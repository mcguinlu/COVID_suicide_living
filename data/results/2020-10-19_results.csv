"Medium-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on multiple vital organs, exercise capacity, cognition, quality of life and mental health, post-hospital discharge","Background The medium-term effects of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on multiple organ health, exercise capacity, cognition, quality of life and mental health are poorly understood. Methods Fifty-eight COVID-19 patients post-hospital discharge and 30 comorbidity-matched controls were prospectively enrolled for multiorgan (brain, lungs, heart, liver and kidneys) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), spirometry, six-minute walk test, cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), quality of life, cognitive and mental health assessments. Findings At 2-3 months from disease-onset, 64% of patients experienced persistent breathlessness and 55% complained of significant fatigue. On MRI, tissue signal abnormalities were seen in the lungs (60%), heart (26%), liver (10%) and kidneys (29%) of patients. COVID-19 patients also exhibited tissue changes in the thalamus, posterior thalamic radiations and sagittal stratum on brain MRI and demonstrated impaired cognitive performance, specifically in the executive and visuospatial domain relative to controls. Exercise tolerance (maximal oxygen consumption and ventilatory efficiency on CPET) and six-minute walk distance (405{+/-}118m vs 517{+/-}106m in controls, p<0.0001) were significantly reduced in patients. The extent of extra-pulmonary MRI abnormalities and exercise tolerance correlated with serum markers of ongoing inflammation and severity of acute illness. Patients were more likely to report symptoms of moderate to severe anxiety (35% versus 10%, p=0.012) and depression (39% versus 17%, p=0.036) and significant impairment in all domains of quality of life compared to controls. Interpretation A significant proportion of COVID-19 patients discharged from hospital experience ongoing symptoms of breathlessness, fatigue, anxiety, depression and exercise limitation at 2-3 months from disease-onset. Persistent lung and extra-pulmonary organ MRI findings are common. In COVID-19 survivors, chronic inflammation may underlie multiorgan abnormalities and contribute to impaired quality of life.","Betty Raman; Mark Philip Cassar; Elizabeth M Tunnicliffe; Nicola Filippini; Ludovica Griffanti; Fidel Alfaro-Almagro; Thomas Okell; Fintan Sheerin; Cheng Xie; Masliza Mahmod; Ferenc E MÃ³zes; Adam J Lewandowski; Eric O Ohuma; David Holdsworth; Hanan Lamlum; Myles J Woodman; Catherine Krasopoulos; Rebecca Mills; Flora A Kennedy McConnel; Chaoyue Wang; Christoph Arthofer; Frederik J Lange; Jesper Andersson; Mark Jenkinson; Charalambos Antoniades; Keith M Channon; Mayooran Shanmuganathan; Vanessa M Ferreira; Stefan K Piechnik; Paul Klenerman; Christopher Brightling; Nick P Talbot; Nayia Petousi; Najib M Rahman; Ling-Pei Ho; Kate Saunders; John R Geddes; Paul Harrison; Kyle Pattinson; Matthew J Rowland; Brian Angus; Fergus Gleeson; Michael Pavlides; Ivan Koychev; Karla L Miller; Clare Mackay; Peter Jezzard; Stephen M Smith; Stefan Neubauer","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.15.20205054","20201018","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-19","",6148,""
"Vulnerability to rumors during the COVID-19 pandemic:Results of a national survey","Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, many rumors have emerged. Given prior research linking rumor exposure to mental well-being, we conducted a nation-wide survey to document the base rate of rumor exposure and factors associated with rumor vulnerability. Between March to July 2020, 1237 participants were surveyed on 5 widely-disseminated COVID-19 rumors (that drinking water frequently could be preventive, that eating garlic could be preventive, that the outbreak arose because of bat soup consumption, that the virus was created in an American lab, and that the virus was created in a Chinese lab). For each rumor, participants reported whether they had heard, shared or believed each rumor. Although most participants had been exposed to COVID-19 rumors, few shared or believed these. Sharing behaviors sometimes occurred in the absence of belief; however, education emerged as a protective factor for both sharing and belief. Together, our results suggest that campaigns targeting skills associated with higher education (e.g. epistemology) may prove more effective than counter-rumor messages.

"Mental Health and Economic Concerns from March to May during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Canada","Background The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the psychological wellbeing of populations worldwide. In this study, we assess changes in mental health during the early months of the pandemic in Canada and examine its relationship with another prominent problem during this time, economic concerns. Methods Analyses were based on two nationally representative cross-sectional surveys from the Canadian Perspectives Survey Series (N=4,627 in March and 4,600 in May). We described the changes in mental health and economic concerns between March and May, and assessed the relationship between the two characteristics. Results Mental health declined significantly during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic: the proportion of Canadian adults who reported only good/fair/poor mental health grew from 46% to 52% from March to May. Economic concerns including food insecurity were an important correlate of â€˜badâ€™ mental health, as was younger age, female gender, and Canada-born status. Contrary to expectations, however, economic concerns lessened during this time frame. Conclusions These findings suggest that policies to mitigate economic stress, such as Canadaâ€™s Emergency Response Benefit, may have eased mental health deterioration in early pandemic months through a reduction in financial hardship. Interventions to increase the economic security of the population will have far-reaching consequences in terms of improved mental health, and should be continued throughout the pandemic.","Anna Zajacova et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46240-EB2-6C5","20201018","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population; covid-19; canada; economic; mental health; adults","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-19","",6153,""
