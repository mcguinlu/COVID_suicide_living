"COVID-19 Epidemic in Argentina: Worsening of Behavioral Symptoms in Elderly Subjects With Dementia Living in the Community","In Argentina, the quality of care that elderly subjects with dementia living in the community received has been deeply affected by COVID-19 epidemic  Our objective was to study to what extend mandatory quarantine imposed due to COVID-19 had affected behavioral symptoms in subjects with dementia after the first 8 weeks of quarantine  We invited family members to participate in a questionnaire survey  The sample consisted of family caregivers (n = 119) of persons with AD or related dementia living at home  We designed a visual analog scale to test the level of the burden of care of family members  Items inquired in the survey included type and setting (home or day care center) of rehabilitation services (physical/occupational/cognitive rehabilitation) and change in psychotropic medication and in behavioral symptoms that subjects with dementia experienced before and during the epidemic  Characteristics of people with dementia and their caregivers were analyzed with descriptive statistics using the chi-square tests, pÂ &lt; 0 01 was considered significant  Results: The sample included older adults with dementia  Mean age: 81 16 (Â±7 03), 35% of the subjects had more than 85 years of age  Diagnosess were 67% AlzheimerÂ´s dementia and 26% mixed AlzheimerÂ´s disease (AD)  Stages were 34 5% mild cases, 32% intermediate stage, and 33% severe cases as per Clinical dementia Rating score  In 67% of the sample, a family member was the main caregiver  Important findings were increased anxiety (43% of the sample), insomnia (28% of the subjects), depression (29%), worsening gait disturbance (41%), and increase use of psychotropics to control behavioral symptoms  When we compared the frequency of behavioral symptoms within each dementia group category, we found that anxiety, depression, and insomnia were more prevalent in subjects with mild dementia compared to subjects with severe dementia  We analyzed the type and pattern of use of rehabilitation services before and during the isolation period, and we observed that, as a rule, rehabilitation services had been discontinued in most subjects due to the quarantine  We concluded from our analysis that during COVID-19 epidemic there was a deterioration of behavioral symptoms in our population of elderly dementia subjects living in the community  Perhaps, our findings are related to a combination of social isolation, lack of outpatient rehabilitation services, and increased stress of family caregivers  It is necessary to develop a plan of action to help dementia subjects deal with the increased stress that this epidemic imposed on them","Cohen, G.; Russo, M.

"Suddenly Becoming a ""Virtual Doctor"": Experiences of Psychiatrists Transitioning to Telemedicine During the COVID-19 Pandemic","OBJECTIVE: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many psychiatrists have rapidly transitioned to telemedicine. This qualitative study sought to understand how this dramatic change in delivery has affected mental health care, including modes of telemedicine psychiatrists used, barriers encountered, and future plans. The aim was to inform the ongoing COVID-19 response and pass on lessons learned to psychiatrists who are starting to offer telemedicine. METHODS: From March 31 to April 9, 2020, semistructured interviews were conducted with 20 outpatient psychiatrists practicing in five U.S. states with significant early COVID-19 activity. Inductive and deductive approaches were used to develop interview summaries, and a matrix analysis was conducted to identify and refine themes. RESULTS: At the time of the interviews, all 20 psychiatrists had been using telemedicine for 2-4 weeks. Telemedicine encompassed video visits, phone visits, or both. Although many continued to prefer in-person care and planned to return to it after the pandemic, psychiatrists largely perceived the transition positively. However, several noted challenges affecting the quality of provider-patient interactions, such as decreased clinical data for assessment, diminished patient privacy, and increased distractions in the patient's home setting. Several psychiatrists noted that their disadvantaged patients lacked reliable access to a smartphone, computer, or the Internet. Participants identified several strategies that helped them improve telemedicine visit quality. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has driven a dramatic shift in how psychiatrists deliver care. Findings highlight that although psychiatrists expressed some concerns about the quality of these encounters, the transition has been largely positive for both patients and physicians.","Uscher-Pines, Lori; Sousa, Jessica; Raja, Pushpa; Mehrotra, Ateev; Barnett, Michael L; Huskamp, Haiden A","https://dx.doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.202000250","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Psychiatr Serv;: appips202000250, 2020 Sep 16.; Publication details: Psychiatr Serv;: appips202000250, 2020 Sep 16.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-22","",4982,""
"In the long shadow of our best intentions: model-based assessment of the consequences of school reopening during the COVID-19 pandemic","As the United States grapples with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, a particularly thorny set of questions surrounds the reopening of K-12 schools and universities. The benefits of in-person learning are numerous, in terms of education quality, mental health, emotional well-being, equity and access to food and shelter. Early reports suggested that children might have reduced susceptibility to COVID-19, and children have been shown to experience fewer complications than older adults. Over the past few months, our understanding of COVID-19 has been further shaped by emerging data, and it is now understood that children are as susceptible to infection as adults and have a similar viral load during infection. While the higher prevalence of asymptomatic disease among children makes symptom-based isolation strategies ineffective, asymptomatic patients do not in fact carry a reduced viral load. Based on this updated understanding of the disease, we have used epidemiological modeling to explore the feasibility and consequences of school reopening in the face of differing rates of COVID-19 prevalence and transmission. Our findings indicate that, regardless of the initial prevalence of the disease, and in the absence of systematic surveillance testing, most schools in the United States can expect to remain open for 20-60 days. At this point, one or more large disease clusters can be expected to be detected, forcing schools to close again. These disease clusters, in turn, can be expected to propagate through the community, with potentially hundreds to thousands of additional cases resulting from each individual school cluster. Thus, our findings suggest that the debate between the risks to student safety and benefits of in-person learning frames a false dual choice. Given the current circumstances in the United States, the most likely outcome in the late fall is that students will be deprived of the benefits of in-person learning while having incurred a significant risk to themselves and their communities.","Kaitlyn E Johnson; Madison Stoddard; Ryan P Nolan; Douglas E White; Natasha S Hochberg; Arijit Chakravarty","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.18.20197400","","Database: PREPRINT-MEDRXIV; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-22","",4983,""
"CLINICALLY DISTINCT COVID-19 CASES SHARE STRIKINGLY SIMILAR IMMUNE RESPONSE PROGRESSION: A FOLLOW-UP ANALYSIS","Inflammatory responses to the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, range from asymptomatic to severe. Here we present a follow-up analysis of a longitudinal study characterizing COVID-19 immune responses from a father and son with distinctly different clinical courses. The father required a lengthy hospital stay for severe symptoms, whereas his son had mild symptoms and no fever yet tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 for 29 days. Father and son, as well as another unrelated COVID-19 patient, displayed a robust increase of SERPING1, the transcript encoding C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH). We further bolstered this finding by incorporating a serum proteomics dataset and found that serum C1-INH was consistently increased in COVID-19 patients. C1-INH is a central regulator of the contact and complement systems, potentially linking COVID-19 to complement hyperactivation, fibrin clot formation, and immune depression. Furthermore, despite distinct clinical cases, significant parallels were observed in transcripts involved interferon and B cell signaling. As symptoms were resolving, widespread decreases were seen in immune-related transcripts to levels below those of healthy controls. Our study provides insight into the immune responses of likely millions of people with extremely mild symptoms who may not be aware of their infection with SARS-CoV-2 and implies a potential for long-lasting consequences that could contribute to reinfection risk.","Melissa Hausburg; Kaysie L.

"Investigating Mental Health of US College Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-Sectional Survey Study","BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has generally increased levels of stress and depression among the public. However, the impact on college students in the United States has not been well-documented. OBJECTIVE: This paper surveys the mental health status and severity of depression and anxiety of college students in a large university system in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An online survey was conducted among undergraduate and graduate students recruited from Texas A&M University via email. The survey consisted of two standardized scales-the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the General Anxiety Disorder-7-for depression and anxiety, and additional multiple-choice and open-ended questions regarding stressors and coping mechanisms specific to COVID-19. RESULTS: Among the 2031 participants, 48.14% (n=960) showed a moderate-to-severe level of depression, 38.48% (n=775) showed a moderate-to-severe level of anxiety, and 18.04% (n=366) had suicidal thoughts. A majority of participants (n=1443, 71.26%) indicated that their stress/anxiety levels had increased during the pandemic. Less than half of the participants (n=882, 43.25%) indicated that they were able to cope adequately with the stress related to the current situation. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of respondents showing depression, anxiety, and/or suicidal thoughts is alarming. Respondents reported academic-, health-, and lifestyle-related concerns caused by the pandemic. Given the unexpected length and severity of the outbreak, these concerns need to be further understood and addressed.","Wang, Xiaomei; Hegde, Sudeep; Son, Changwon; Keller, Bruce; Smith, Alec; Sasangohar, Farzan","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/22817","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;22(9): e22817, 2020 Sep 17.; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;22(9): e22817, 2020 Sep 17.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-22","",4985,""
"Higher psychogeriatric admissions in COVID-19 than in severe acute respiratory syndrome","OBJECTIVES: To examine whether psychogeriatric admissions increased after COVID-19, independent of seasonal variation; whether the increase was comparable with that seen in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); and which factors were associated with such increase. METHODS: All psychiatric admissions aged 65 or older in the 3 months before and after COVID-19 (from November 2019 to April 2020), in the previous 2 years (from November 2017 to April 2018 and from November 2018 to April 2019), and in the year of SARS (from November 2002 to April 2003) in a major gazette inpatient psychiatric unit in Hong Kong, which serves a catchment population of 1.4 million, were anonymously reviewed. The number of psychogeriatric admissions between different timeframes was compared, and factors that might explain the increase in admissions following COVID-19 were examined. RESULTS: Psychogeriatric admissions increased by 21.4% following the COVID-19 outbreak. This increase was not explained by seasonal variation and was greater and lasted longer than that in SARS. A rising trend in admissions for older adults living in residential care homes was observed. The increase in admissions was associated with fewer outpatient attendance, fewer home visits by nurses, and more older adults with dementia requiring inpatient care. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the impact of COVID-19 on older adults' mental health, greater demand for inpatient psychogeriatric services in COVID-19 than in SARS, and the importance of maintaining support for community-living older adults, in particular those with dementia, and their caregivers in reducing the needs for inpatient psychiatric treatment during the pandemic.

"[Comment] The COVIDÂ­19 pandemic as a scientific and social challenge in the 21st century","The coronavirus diseaseÂ­2019 (COVIDÂ­19) pandemic, caused by the new coronavirus SARSÂ­CoVÂ­2, has spread around the globe with unprecedented consequences for the health of millions of people. While the pandemic is still in progress, with new incidents being reported every day, the resilience of the global society is constantly being challenged. Under these circumstances, the future seems uncertain. SARSÂ­CoVÂ­2 coronavirus has spread panic among civilians and insecurity at all socioÂ­political and economic levels, dramatically disrupting everyday life, global economy, international travel and trade. The disease has also been linked to the onset of depression in many individuals due to the extreme restriction measures that have been taken for the prevention of the rapid spreading of COVIDÂ­19. First, the socioÂ­economic, political and psychological implications of the COVIDÂ­19 pandemic were explored. Substantial evidence is provided for the consequences of the pandemic on all aspects of everyday life, while at the same time we unravel the role and the pursuits of national regimes during this unforeseen situation. The second goal of this review is related to the scientific aspect of the pandemic. Hence, we explain why SARSÂ­CoVÂ­2 is not a soÂ­called 'invisible enemy', and also attempt to give insight regarding the origin of the virus, in an effort to reject the conspiracy theories that have arisen during the pandemic. Finally, rational strategies were investigated for successful vaccine development. We are optimistic that this review will complement the knowledge of specialized scientists and inform nonÂ­specialized readers on basic scientific questions, and also on the social and economic implications of the COVIDÂ­19 pandemic.","Zoumpourlis, Vassilios; Goulielmaki, Maria; Rizos, Emmanouil; Baliou, Stella; Spandidos, Demetrios A","https://dx.doi.org/10.3892/mmr.2020.11393","","Country: GR; GRÃ‰CIA; GREECE; GRECIA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Mol Med Rep;2020 Jul 30.; Publication details: Mol Med Rep;2020 Jul 30.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-22","",4987,""
"Psychological impact of COVID-19 in the Swedish population: Depression, anxiety, and insomnia and their associations to risk and vulnerability factors","BACKGROUND: The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, with its associated restrictions on daily life, is like a perfect storm for poor mental health and wellbeing. The purpose of this study was therefore to examine the impacts of COVID-19 on mental health and wellbeing during the ongoing pandemic in Sweden. METHOD: Standardized measures of depression, anxiety, and insomnia as well as measures of risk and vulnerability factors known to be associated with poor mental health outcomes were administered through a national, online, cross-sectional survey (nÂ =Â 1,212; mean age 36.1Â years; 73% women). RESULT: Our findings show significant levels of depression, anxiety, and insomnia in Sweden, at rates of 30%, 24.2%, and 38%, respectively. The strongest predictors of these outcomes included poor self-rated overall health and a history of mental health problems. The presence of COVID-19 symptoms and specific health and financial worries related to the pandemic also appeared important. CONCLUSIONS: The impacts of COVID-19 on mental health in Sweden are comparable to impacts shown in previous studies in Italy and China. Importantly, the pandemic seems to impose most on the mental health of those already burdened with the impacts of mental health problems. These results provide a basis for providing more support for vulnerable groups, and for developing psychological interventions suited to the ongoing pandemic and for similar events in the future.","McCracken, Lance M; Badinlou, Farzaneh; Buhrman, Monica; Brocki, Karin C","https://dx.doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2020.81","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Eur Psychiatry;63(1): e81, 2020 Aug 26.; Publication details: Eur Psychiatry;63(1): e81, 2020 Aug 26.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-22","",4988,""
"A Mental Health Paradox: Mental health was both a motivator and barrier to physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the mental health, physical activity, and sedentary behavior of citizens worldwide. Using an online survey with 1669 respondents, we sought to understand why and how by querying about perceived barriers and motivators to physical activity that changed because of the pandemic, and how those changes impacted mental health. Consistent with prior reports, our respondents were less physically active (aerobic activity, -11%, p <0.05; strength-based activity, -30%, p<0.01) and more sedentary (+11%, p<0.01) during the pandemic as compared to 6-months before. The pandemic also increased psychological stress (+22%, p <0.01) and brought on moderate symptoms of anxiety and depression. Respondents whose mental health deteriorated the most were also the ones who were least active (depression r = -.21, p<0.01; anxiety r = -.12, p<0.01). The majority of respondents were unmotivated to exercise because they were too anxious (+8%, p <0.01), lacked social support (+6%, p =<0.01), or had limited access to equipment (+23%, p <0.01) or space (+41%, p <0.01). The respondents who were able to stay active reported feeling less motivated by physical health outcomes such as weight loss (-7%, p<0.01) or strength (-14%, p<0.01) and instead more motivated by mental health outcomes such as anxiety relief (+14%, p <0.01). Coupled with previous work demonstrating a direct relationship between mental health and physical activity, these results highlight the potential protective effect of physical activity on mental health and point to the need for psychological support to overcome perceived barriers so that people can continue to be physically active during stressful times like the pandemic.","Maryam Yvonne Marashi; Emma Nicholson; Michelle Ogrodnik; Barbara Fenesi; Jennifer J Heisz","https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.03.280719","","Database: PREPRINT-BIORXIV; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-22","",4989,""

"Environmental Nanoparticles, SARS-CoV-2 Brain Involvement, and Potential Acceleration of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases in Young Urbanites Exposed to Air Pollution","Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases (AD, PD) have a pediatric and young adult onset in Metropolitan Mexico City (MMC). The SARS-CoV-2 neurotropic RNA virus is triggering neurological complications and deep concern regarding acceleration of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative processes already in progress. This review, based on our MMC experience, will discuss two major issues: 1) why residents chronically exposed to air pollution are likely to be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 systemic and brain effects and 2) why young people with AD and PD already in progress will accelerate neurodegenerative processes. Secondary mental consequences of social distancing and isolation, fear, financial insecurity, violence, poor health support, and lack of understanding of the complex crisis are expected in MMC residents infected or free of SARS-CoV-2. MMC residents with pre-SARS-CoV-2 accumulation of misfolded proteins diagnostic of AD and PD and metal-rich, magnetic nanoparticles damaging key neural organelles are an ideal host for neurotrophic SARS-CoV-2 RNA virus invading the body through the same portals damaged by nanoparticles: nasal olfactory epithelium, the gastrointestinal tract, and the alveolar-capillary portal. We urgently need MMC multicenter retrospective-prospective neurological and psychiatric population follow-up and intervention strategies in place in case of acceleration of neurodegenerative processes, increased risk of suicide, and mental disease worsening.

"Virtual Trauma-Focused Therapy for Military Members, Veterans, and Public Safety Personnel With Posttraumatic Stress Injury: Systematic Scoping Review","A necessary shift from in-person to remote delivery of psychotherapy (eg, teletherapy, eHealth, videoconferencing) has occurred because of the COVID-19 pandemic. A corollary benefit is a potential fit in terms of the need for equitable and timely access to mental health services in remote and rural locations. Owing to COVID-19, there may be an increase in the demand for timely, virtual delivery of services among trauma-affected populations, including public safety personnel (PSP; eg, paramedics, police, fire, correctional officers), military members, and veterans. There is a lack of evidence on the question of whether digital delivery of trauma-therapies for military members, veterans, and PSP leads to similar outcomes to in-person delivery. Information on barriers and facilitators and recommendations regarding digital-delivery is also scarce. This study aims to evaluate the scope and quality of peer-reviewed literature on psychotherapeutic digital health interventions delivered remotely to military members, veterans, and PSP and synthesize the knowledge of needs, gaps, barriers to, and facilitators for virtual assessment of and virtual interventions for posttraumatic stress injury. Relevant studies were identified using MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online), EMBASE (Excerpta Medica dataBASE), APA (American Psychological Association) PsycINFO, CINAHL (Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature) Plus with Full Text, and Military &amp; Government Collection. For collation, analysis, summarizing, and reporting of results, we used the CASP (Critical Skills Appraisal Program) qualitative checklist, PEDro (Physiotherapy Evidence Database) scale, level of evidence hierarchy, PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews), and narrative synthesis. A total of 38 studies were included in this review. Evidence for the effectiveness of digital delivery of prolonged exposure therapy, cognitive processing therapy, behavioral activation treatment with therapeutic exposure to military members, veterans, and PSP was rated level 1a, whereas evidence for cognitive behavioral therapy was conflicting. The narrative synthesis indicated that virtual delivery of these therapies can be as effective as in-person delivery but may reduce stigma and cost while increasing access to therapy. Issues of risk, safety, potential harm (ie, suicidality, enabling avoidance), privacy, security, and the match among the therapist, modality, and patient warrant further consideration. There is a lack of studies on the influences of gender, racial, and cultural factors that may result in differential outcomes, preferences, and/or needs. An investigation into other therapies that may be suitable for digital delivery is needed. Digital delivery of trauma therapies for military members, veterans, and PSP is a critical area for further research. Although promising evidence exists regarding the effectiveness of digital health within these populations, many questions remain, and a cautious approach to more widespread implementation is warranted.","Jones, Miguel-Cruz, Smith-MacDonald, Cruikshank, Baghoori, Kaur Chohan, Laidlaw, White, Cao, Agyapong, Burback, Winkler, Sevigny, Dennett, Ferguson-Pell, Greenshaw, BrÃƒÂ©mault-Phillips","https://doi.org/10.2196/22079","20200921","digital health; first responder; mental health; military; mobile phone; psychotherapy; public safety personnel; rehabilitation; telemedicine; telepsychiatry; teletherapy; therapy; trauma; veteran","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-22","",4992,""
"Population Risk Factors for COVID-19 Mortality in 93 Countries","Death rates due to COVID-19 pandemic vary considerably across regions and countries. Case Mortality Rates (CMR) per 100,000 population are more reliable than case-fatality rates per 100 test-positive cases, which are heavily dependent on the extent of viral case testing carried out in a country. We aimed to study the variations in CMR against population risk factors such as aging, underlying chronic diseases and social determinants such as poverty and overcrowding. Data on COVID-19 CMR in 93 countries was analyzed for associations with preexisting prevalence rates of eight diseases [asthma, lung cancer, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Alzheimer's Disease (AD), hypertension, ischemic heart disease, depression and diabetes], and six socio-demographic factors [Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, unemployment, age over 65 years, urbanization, population density, and socio-demographic index]. These data were analyzed in three steps: correlation analysis, bivariate comparison of countries, and multivariate modelling. Bivariate analysis revealed that COVID-19 CMR were higher in countries that had high prevalence of population risk factors such as AD, lung cancer, asthma and COPD. On multivariate modeling however, AD, COPD, depression and higher GDP predicted increased death rates. Comorbid illnesses such as AD and lung diseases may be more influential than aging alone.","Hashim, Alsuwaidi, Khan","https://doi.org/10.2991/jegh.k.200721.001","20200921","COVID-19; Novel coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2; epidemiology; risk factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-22","",4993,""
"COVID Isolation Eating Scale (CIES): Analysis of the impact of confinement in eating disorders and obesity-A collaborative international study","Confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to have a serious and complex impact on the mental health of patients with an eating disorder (ED) and of patients with obesity. The present manuscript has the following aims: (1) to analyse the psychometric properties of the COVID Isolation Eating Scale (CIES), (2) to explore changes that occurred due to confinement in eating symptomatology; and (3) to explore the general acceptation of the use of telemedicine during confinement. The sample comprised 121 participants (87 ED patients and 34 patients with obesity) recruited from six different centres. Confirmatory Factor Analyses (CFA) tested the rational-theoretical structure of the CIES. Adequate goodness-of-fit was obtained for the confirmatory factor analysis, and Cronbach alpha values ranged from good to excellent. Regarding the effects of confinement, positive and negative impacts of the confinement depends of the eating disorder subtype. Patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) and with obesity endorsed a positive response to treatment during confinement, no significant changes were found in bulimia nervosa (BN) patients, whereas Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder (OSFED) patients endorsed an increase in eating symptomatology and in psychopathology. Furthermore, AN patients expressed the greatest dissatisfaction and accommodation difficulty with remote therapy when compared with the previously provided face-to-face therapy. The present study provides empirical evidence on the psychometric robustness of the CIES tool and shows that a negative confinement impact was associated with ED subtype, whereas OSFED patients showed the highest impairment in eating symptomatology and in psychopathology.","FernÃƒÂ¡ndez-Aranda, MunguÃƒÂ­a, Mestre-Bach, Steward, Etxandi, Baenas, Granero, SÃƒÂ¡nchez, Ortega, Andreu, Moize, FernÃƒÂ¡ndez-Real, Tinahones, DiegÃƒÂ¼ez, FrÃƒÂ¼hbeck, Le Grange, Tchanturia, Karwautz, Zeiler, Favaro, Claes, Luyckx, Shekriladze, Serrano-Troncoso, Rangil, Meler, Soriano-Pacheco, Carceller-Sindreu, Bujalance-Arguijo, Lozano, Linares, Gudiol, Carratala, Sanchez-Gonzalez, Machado, HÃƒÂ¥kansson, TÃƒÂºry, PÃƒÂ¡szthy, Stein, PapezovÃƒÂ¡, Bax, Borisenkov, Popov, Kim, Nakazato, Godart, van Voren, Ilnytska, Chen, Rowlands, Treasure, JimÃƒÂ©nez-Murcia","https://doi.org/10.1002/erv.2784","20200921","COVID Isolation Eating Scale; COVID-19; eating disorders; obesity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-22","",4994,""
"COVID-19 and mental health: How one pandemic can reveal another","The COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately affected individuals with mental disorders, and revealed fundamental flaws in how vulnerable persons are treated in the context of such crises. Much of this difficulty may be attributed to ignorance of the prevalence, severity and economic burden associated with these conditions, as well as to enduring inequalities in how physical illness is treated in comparison to mental illness. As mental disorders are now the single greatest cause of disability, we have reached the point where the tremendous personal and societal costs associated with these conditions can no longer be ignored. Dramatic changes are needed to replace the slow, incremental efforts that most often characterize public health policy. Such changes can no longer wait for the national or international-level solutions that were once hoped, but they may be just as effective through the use of new technologies, grass-roots organization, and initiatives on a local scale.","Swendsen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbct.2020.08.001","20200921","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-22","",4995,""
"A psychological investigation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients in mobile cabin hospitals in Wuhan","This study investigated the depression, anxiety, and insomnia levels of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients admitted to two mobile cabin hospitals in Jianghan District (Wuhan, China). Thirty COVID-19 (eight mild type and twenty-two common type) patients were evaluated using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 Questionnaire, the Insomnia Severity Index, and a semi-structured interview. All 30 patients reported varying degrees of anxiety, depression, and insomnia. The levels of depression and anxiety in mild type COVID-19 patients were significantly lower than those in common type COVID-19 patients. Significant improvements in depression (P&lt;0.001) and anxiety (P&lt;0.001) levels were found in the COVID-19 patients at the second evaluation compared with the baseline (admittance to hospital). More than 80% patients agreed that medical security, support from other patients, and a better living environment were the main reasons for improvements to their adverse psychological states. Varying degrees of anxiety, depression, and insomnia frequently occur in patients with COVID-19. Standard treatment protocols and patient-centered care in the mobile cabin hospitals in this study provided the chance for COVID-19 patients to successfully improve their mental health during the outbreak of the pandemic.","Zhang, Qin, Zhang, Feng, Fan","https://doi.org/10.21037/atm-20-4907","20200921","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); anxiety; depression; insomnia; mobile cabin hospital; patient psychology; patient-centered care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-22","",4996,""
"Socioeconomic Impact of COVID-19 on Spinal Instrumentation Companies in the Era of Decreased Elective Surgery","Since the onset of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) global health crisis, there has been an unprecedented change to the field of spinal surgery. Comprehensive protocols and algorithms have been implemented globally to maximize available bed space, conserve personal protective equipment, and to minimize exposure. This has resulted in a sharp decline in elective spinal surgery and placed an undue burden on the spinal industry. As the landscape of elective surgery changes, this paper looks to analyze the effects the COVID-19 pandemic has and will have on spinal instrumentation companies, surgeons, and the spinal industry. Changes in government policies, patient care, financial markets, and distribution have all presented an unprecedented strain on spinal instrumentation companies. A narrative literature review was performed using published literature from PubMed. Due to the socioeconomic and financial nature of this review, data collection from financial references was also obtained and cited.Ã‚Â With significant financial losses reported throughout the spinal industry and medical field, this paper discusses managing the COVID-19 pandemic and the future prospectus moving forward. As the pandemic continues to unfold, it remains difficult to predict the exact timing for broad resumption of elective medical procedures, and the extent to which the pandemic will affect the industry. Preparation aimed at facilitating efficient resource allocation and communication among surgeons, surgical instrumentation representatives and hospital leadership is essential as we transition forward and reestablish normalcy under the new constraints of COVID-19.","Fiani, Jenkins, Siddiqi, Khan, Taylor","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.9776","20200921","covid-19; financial; instrumentation companies; socioeconomics; spine surgery","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-22","",4997,""
"Health-related factors of psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic among non-health workers in Spain","Non-health workers engaged in essential activities during the pandemic are less researched on the effects of COVID-19 than health workers. to study the differences between those who work away from home and those who do so from home, when the effects of fear of contagion cross with those of confinement, about the psychological distress during the COVID-19 in Spain. Observational descriptive cross-sectional study<b>.</b> The study was carried out receiving 1089 questionnaires from non-health workers that were working away from home and doing so from their homes. The questionnaire included sociodemographic and occupational data, physical symptoms, self-perceived health, use of preventive measures and possible contacts, and the Goldberg GHQ-12. 71.6% of non-health female workers and 52.4% of non-health male workers had psychological distress, with differences among those working away from home and those working from home. The level of psychological distress among non-health workers is predicted by 66.5% through the variables: being a woman, 43Ã¢â‚¬Â¯years old or younger, having a home with no outdoor spaces, poor perception of health, number of symptoms, and having been in contact with contaminated people or material. Among workers who work away from home, being self-employed is another predictive variable of distress<b>.</b> More than the half of the sample showed inadequate management of the psychological distress. There are modifiable factors which provide necessary elements to support a positive attitude of the workers, such as: knowledge of hygiene, transmission of the virus, protective measures, and social distancing measures.","Ruiz-Frutos, Ortega-Moreno, Allande-CussÃƒÂ³, DomÃƒÂ­nguez-Salas, Dias, GÃƒÂ³mez-Salgado","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssci.2020.104996","20200921","COVID-19; Mental health; Non-health workers; Pandemic; Psychological distress; Public health; Quarantine; Workers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-22","",4998,""
"Psychoanalytic Perspectives on Moral Injury in Nurses on the Frontlines of the COVID-19 Pandemic","To raise awareness of the potential for moral injury in nurses working on the frontlines of COVID-19 patient care and to present aspects of mental functioning that may increase the likelihood of psychological distress. Approaches that draw on psychoanalytic thinking to support frontline nurses' mental health are explained. This article draws on recent work that is available from multiple sources, including published journal articles on moral injury, recent reports from news services highlighting the crisis state of the pandemic and effects on nurses, established literature on the structural model of the mind, and recent webinars and online lectures addressing mental health crisis interventions. The author draws on expertise from years of training in the Adult Psychoanalytic Training Program at the Michigan Psychoanalytic Institute and graduation as an academic analyst. How nurses navigate moral hazards inherent in the current state of frontline health care may depend on their existing ego strengths and levels of self-blame and guilt from a harsh superego. Mental health professionals need to be aware of the mental minefields that frontline nurses must navigate when providing care that, due to circumstances beyond their control, may be morally ambiguous. Educating nurses about the meaning of their own emotional and psychic responses amid the realities in the field may help to decrease the damaging effects of moral injury.","Lesley","https://doi.org/10.1177/1078390320960535","20200921","ethics; models/theories of psychiatric nursing; trauma-informed care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-22","",4999,""
"Delay discounting and under-valuing of recent information predict lower adherence to social distancing measures during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented changes in the day-to-day behaviours of populations globally, especially in areas where social distancing rules have been mandated. Understanding the cognitive mechanisms underlying (un)successful behaviour change around social distancing is crucial to inform public health policy for both the current and future crises. In this study, we utilise tasks probing delay discounting (the preference for immediate versus delayed rewards) and patch foraging (evaluating the trade-off between exploiting a known resource and exploring an unknown one) to investigate cognitive predictors of social distancing and mental health symptoms. Participants (N=442) were recruited from a large UK cohort (N=2025) nationally representative in age, gender and income. Greater sensitivity to reward magnitude during delay discounting predicted lower adherence to social distancing measures and higher levels of mood and anxiety symptoms. In addition, under-valuing recently sampled information during foraging separately predicted greater violation of social distancing. Analyses examining cognitive factors underpinning social distancing behaviour across two time points (early and late phases of the pandemic) additionally revealed that greater sensitivity to magnitude of rewards on offer during delay discounting predicted a greater decline in psychological inclination to maintain social distancing. Moreover, under-valuing recent information during foraging separately predicted less motivation to engage in social distancing during the established phase of the pandemic. The findings suggest that those who typically regulate their mood through behaviours that bring about immediate reward are also those who struggle to maintain social distancing. Further, those who adapt more quickly to new information showed better ability to change their behaviour in response to public health measures. These findings highlight the need for public health initiatives that bolster sustained confidence in planning around social distancing by emphasising the immediate rewards to self as well as longer term benefits.","Alex Lloyd et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46225-88E-782","20200922","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Judgment and Decision Making; decision-making; coronavirus; patch; social distancing; covid-19; delay discounting; foraging","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-22","",5000,""
