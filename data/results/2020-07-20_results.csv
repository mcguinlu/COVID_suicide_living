"Research priorities for the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond: A call to action for psychological science","The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that has caused the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic represents the greatest international biopsychosocial emergency the world has faced for a century, and psychological science has an integral role to offer in helping societies recover. The aim of this paper is to set out the shorter- and longer-term priorities for research in psychological science that will (a) frame the breadth and scope of potential contributions from across the discipline; (b) enable researchers to focus their resources on gaps in knowledge; and (c) help funders and policymakers make informed decisions about future research priorities in order to best meet the needs of societies as they emerge from the acute phase of the pandemic. The research priorities were informed by an expert panel convened by the British Psychological Society that reflects the breadth of the discipline; a wider advisory panel with international input; and a survey of 539 psychological scientists conducted early in May 2020. The most pressing need is to research the negative biopsychosocial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic to facilitate immediate and longer-term recovery, not only in relation to mental health, but also in relation to behaviour change and adherence, work, education, children and families, physical health and the brain, and social cohesion and connectedness. We call on psychological scientists to work collaboratively with other scientists and stakeholders, establish consortia, and develop innovative research methods while maintaining high-quality, open, and rigorous research standards.","O'Connor, Aggleton, Chakrabarti, Cooper, Creswell, Dunsmuir, Fiske, Gathercole, Gough, Ireland, Jones, Jowett, Kagan, Karanika-Murray, Kaye, Kumari, Lewandowsky, Lightman, Malpass, Meins, Morgan, Morrison Coulthard, Reicher, Schacter, Sherman, Simms, Williams, Wykes, Armitage","https://doi.org/10.1111/bjop.12468","20200719","COVID-19; behaviour change; children; education; families; health; human development; mental health; neuroscience; pandemic; psychological science; psychology; school; stress; trauma; work","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-20","",3222,""
"How mental health care should change as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic","The unpredictability and uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic; the associated lockdowns, physical distancing, and other containment strategies; and the resulting economic breakdown could increase the risk of mental health problems and exacerbate health inequalities. Preliminary findings suggest adverse mental health effects in previously healthy people and especially in people with pre-existing mental health disorders. Despite the heterogeneity of worldwide health systems, efforts have been made to adapt the delivery of mental health care to the demands of COVID-19. Mental health concerns have been addressed via the public mental health response and by adapting mental health services, mostly focusing on infection control, modifying access to diagnosis and treatment, ensuring continuity of care for mental health service users, and paying attention to new cases of mental ill health and populations at high risk of mental health problems. Sustainable adaptations of delivery systems for mental health care should be developed by experts, clinicians, and service users, and should be specifically designed to mitigate disparities in health-care provision. Thorough and continuous assessment of health and service-use outcomes in mental health clinical practice will be crucial for defining which practices should be further developed and which discontinued. For this Position Paper, an international group of clinicians, mental health experts, and users of mental health services has come together to reflect on the challenges for mental health that COVID-19 poses. The interconnectedness of the world made society vulnerable to this infection, but it also provides the infrastructure to address previous system failings by disseminating good practices that can result in sustained, efficient, and equitable delivery of mental health-care delivery. Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic could be an opportunity to improve mental health services.","Moreno, Wykes, Galderisi, Nordentoft, Crossley, Jones, Cannon, Correll, Byrne, Carr, Chen, Gorwood, Johnson, KÃƒÂ¤rkkÃƒÂ¤inen, Krystal, Lee, Lieberman, LÃƒÂ³pez-Jaramillo, MÃƒÂ¤nnikkÃƒÂ¶, Phillips, Uchida, Vieta, Vita, Arango","https://doi.org/10.1016/S2215-0366(20)30307-2","20200719","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-20","",3223,""
