"The yESTRO mentoring program and a report from a mentee","The ESTRO vision statement for 2030 is â€œRadiation Oncology. Optimal Health for All, Togetherâ€. It is becoming increasingly clear that optimal health for all should include the health of caregivers, too. This is exemplified by the high level of burnout amongst radiation oncology professionals across the disciplines, as published recently by Franco et al. (1) Sadly, the COVID pandemic has had a negative impact on mental health of these professionals. (2) The young ESTRO committee (yESTRO) has aligned its activities to the ESTRO vision by setting up an ESTRO mentoring program in order to increase professional well-being for its young members. Mentorship benefits both mentor and the mentee. A review on mentorship in the medical field reported it to have an â€˜important influence on personal development, career guidance, career choice, and research productivity, including publication and grant successâ€™. (3) For mentors the benefits lie in enhancement of knowledge, leadership skills, educational skills and increased job satisfaction. With the yESTRO mentoring pilot program, yESTRO specifically aims to satisfy unmet needs for mentorship among young ESTRO members. Fifteen young members were selected as mentees based on their curriculum and personal motivation. The program had its official kickoff at ESTRO 2021 in Madrid with an onsite and an online speed dating session between mentors and mentees. Matches were made and mentor-mentee couples committed to meet at least every three months for the duration of one year. We will present the mid-term evaluation of the pilot at ESTRO 2022. The final evaluation takes place one year after the program started, after which it will be decided whether the program will continue. Yet the ambition of yESTRO is larger. This session will also provide practical advice for those considering to set up a mentoring program at their own institute. Or those seeking a mentor. In this ambition, we will be helped by the experiences shared by Daniel Portik, one of the mentees in the yESTRO mentoring program pilot.","Heukelom, J.; Portik, D.; Bertholet, J.; Dubois, L.; Redalen, K.; Chargari, C.; Bittner, M.; Perryck, S.; Webster, A.; Nevens, D.; Tomasik, B.; Franco, P.; Petit, S.","https://doi.org/10.1016/S0167-8140(22)04029-4","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Radiotherapy and Oncology; 170:S620, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",35964,""
"Assessing implementation of interventions to recruit & retain the Therapeutic Radiographer workforce","Purpose or Objective Recruitment and retention of key NHS staff has been an ongoing challenge. The Reducing Pre-registration Attrition and Improving Retention (RePAIR) initiative was set up by Health Education England (HEE) in 2015 to explore effective interventions to improve retention across the student journey, from pre-enrolment to two years post qualification. Key objectives: Â· Map and identify areas of good practice, opportunities, and challenges of the RePAIR recommendations in England Â· Further embed partnership working across a range of stakeholders Â· Develop a shared online repository of good practice and understand the impact of COVID-19 on student education and training. Project delivered by Society of Radiographers (SoR), funded by HEE. Materials and Methods Sample: Radiotherapy approved Higher Education Institutions (HEIâ€™s) n=10 and Radiotherapy Healthcare Providers (HCPâ€™s) n=51 in England. A two stage project: Â· Multi-method survey of HEIâ€™s, HCPâ€™s and therapeutic radiography students on a placement expansion programme in England Â· Follow-up semi-structured interviews and Dual Moderator focus groups with key stakeholders Results A 100% HEI and 88% HCP survey response Key findings: â€¢ 80% of HEIs and 98% of HCPs were in favour of standardising clinical assessment documentation. â€¢ HEIs, HCPs and students felt simulation could replace up to 20% of clinical practice. â€¢ 70% of HEIâ€™s and 51% of HCPâ€™s surveyed had informal student support mechanisms however only 15% of HCPâ€™s and 20% of HEIâ€™s had extra support for year 2 â€¢ Physical and mental health and wrong career choice, were the most common reasons for attrition. â€¢ Recruitment initiatives were evident in all HEIâ€™s and in 82% of HCPâ€™s, however, only 27% of HCPâ€™s were involved in retention initiatives. â€¢ Formal use of â€˜culture of careâ€™ tools was not standard practice. â€¢ All HEIâ€™s had a transition to professional practice. 80% of HCPâ€™s had a preceptorship programme with 20% collaborating with local HEI â€¢ Only 20% awareness of RePAIR from survey findings Conclusion Priority areas were identified and developed into workstreams: 1. Effective recruitment initiatives (e.g. outreach) 2. Effective retention initiatives, student support toolkit, return to practice 3. Strategies to increase student placement capacity (e.g. simulation and non-traditional placements) 4. Placement allocation and funding support 5. Standardised clinical assessment documentation 6. Preparation for practice (e.g preceptorship) This led to the development of an online toolkit â€“ AHP Support Programme for Implementing Recruitment, Retention and Engagement (ASPIRRE), Standalone projects were identified, requiring separate research and development. â€¢ National project exploring requirements of implementing standardised clinical assessment. â€¢ Production of a professional body guidance document on simulation within pre-registration Therapeutic Radiography education and training programmes These projects address student and professional workforce growth, placement expansion and transformation requirements.","Hutton, N.; Tuckey, M.; Goodman, S.","https://doi.org/10.1016/S0167-8140(22)03817-8","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Radiotherapy and Oncology; 170:S1645-S1646, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",35965,""
"PREVALENCE AND MORTALITY OF ALCOHOL-RELATED LIVER DISEASES DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC","Background COVID-19 pandemic and its resulting life stress could affect lifestyle including increased alcohol use. Mounting evidence has indicated rising prevalence in alcohol related liver disease (ALD) during pandemic. However, the studies were limited by single center data with cross-sectional design. We aimed to determine the nationwide effect of COVID- 19 pandemic on the prevalence as well as mortality of ALD among patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD). Methods Patient data were obtained from the Optum de-identified ClinformaticsÂ® database. Enrollees with a diagnosis of AUD who received care in hospital emergency department and/or inpatient service from January 2019 to December 2020 were included and followed up until March 2021. AUD were defined as having alcohol intoxication, withdrawal, and alcohol-related mental health disorders. We estimated the quarterly prevalence and 30-, 60-, 90-, and 180-day mortality during study period. Results There were no significant trends in mortality before the pandemic. The 30-day mortality decreased from 11.96% to 10.34% from Q1 to Q3 in 2019, then increased to 12.10% in Q1 2020. The increase between 2019 Q1 and 2020 Q1 was not significant. In contrast, the mortality rates increased from 2020 Q1 to 2020 Q2 and continued to increase during pandemic. Mortality rate elevated from 12.10% to 13.44% from 2020 Q1 to 2020 Q2, followed by 13.50% in Q3 and 14.94% in Q4. Similar pattern was seen in 60-day and 90-day mortalities. About a quarter of patient died at 90 days after diagnosis of ALD. The prevalence of ALD among patients with AUD fluctuated throughout 2019, with 53.77% in 2019 Q1 decreasing to 51.29% in 2019 Q3. It increased to 53.15% in 2019 Q4. The prevalence was higher in 2020 Q1 compare to 2019 Q1. However, during pandemic, the prevalence decreased to 53.98% in 2020 Q2 then bounced to 55.40% and 56.57% in 2020 Q3 and Q4. While the prevalence of ALD in AUD patients who visited ED increased from 2020 Q2 to 2020 Q4, the prevalence of ALD in hospitalized patient surged in 2020 Q2, followed by decreasing trend in latter half of 2020. The increasing trend was more prominent in patients aged &lt;65 years than those $65 years. Males had a steeper increasing trend than females. While there was no significant change in prevalence of ALD among non-Hispanic Asians, the upward trend among non-Hispanic Whites and Blacks was significant. ConclusionsWedemonstrated an alarming rise in ALD mortality and increased prevalence among patients with AUD. The data were derived from patients with private insurance. Trends in those without insurance or less coverage are expected to be more alarming given the limitation in access to care. There were significant disparities by sex and race and ethnicity that may inform stakeholders for targeted interventions and resource allocation to curb the surging burden of ALD during pandemic.

"UTILIZATION OF DRUG OVERDOSE DONORS FOR LIVER TRANSPLANTATION DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC","Background: The increasing number of deceased drug overdose donors (DOD) has paralleled the recent rise in the opioid epidemic, which has been further exacerbated by the COVID- 19 pandemic. While the transplant community has seen a rise in allografts donated by victims of drug overdose, we aim to characterize the recent shifts in DOD utilization during the pre-COVID and COVID eras. Methods: Using the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) registry, we analyzed all adult recipients that underwent solid organ transplantation (SOT) including liver transplant (LT) in the United States from January 1, 2017 through June 30, 2021. The pre-COVID era was defined from January 1, 2019 to February 29, 2020 and the COVID era was defined from May 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021 (14 months each). We excluded March and April 2020 because transplant volume was adversely affected due to diversion of resources. DOD were identified using the UNOS variable that characterizes the mechanism of death of the donor. Tests of proportions and unpaired T-tests were performed to compare demographic information and clinical characteristics of DOD from the pre-COVID and COVID eras. Results: The number of donors for all SOT remained stable in the pre-COVID and COVID eras (14,029 vs 15,547). Likewise, the number of LTs remained stable (9,687 vs 10,096), reflected by a rise in DOD utilization. From the pre- COVID to the COVID eras, the utilization of DOD for SOT increased by 33% from 13.7% (n=1924) to 16.4% (n=2553) as shown in Table 1. This increase in DOD utilization during the pandemic was seen across all organ types with a significant rise for LT (pre-COVID n= 1465, 15.1% vs COVID n=1846, 18.3%;P&lt;0.001). Among DOD, the percentage of young adult donors &lt; 30 declined (31.2% vs 28.0%;P=0.022) in the COVID era. Similarly, the percentage of DOD with HCV seropositivity and HCV viremia decreased by 5.2% (34.3% vs 29.1%;P&lt;0.001) and 4.3% (22.1% vs 17.8%;P&lt;0.001) respectively. Regionally, there was a significant increase in DOD utilization in the South and Midwest (Table 1). Conclusion: The continued rise in the opioid epidemic has led to increased utilization of otherwise healthy DOD. This increase in DOD utilization has contributed to the steady transplant volume during the pandemic for all organ types, including LT. Fewer DOD with HCV during the pandemic reflects recent national trends. Unlike the early phases of the opioid epidemic, there is less of a regional distribution of utilization of allografts from DOD.

"THE EFFECTS OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON PRESENTATIONS AND DIAGNOSIS OF UPPER GI AND HEPATOPANCREATICOBILIARY MALIGNANCIES","Introduction: In March 2020, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic. Elective healthcare services were reorganised worldwide. This study addresses the impact of measures taken in the early stages of the pandemic on diagnosing Upper Gastrointestinal (UGI) and Hepatopancreaticobiliary (HPB) malignancies in a university teaching hospital. Aims: To ascertain whether fewer cases of UGI/HPB cancers were detected, the differences in inpatient and outpatient diagnosis and whether there was an increased detection of later stage disease during the pandemic than in the preceding year. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study conducted in Tallaght University Hospital in Ireland. All new diagnoses of UGI/HPB cancers, excluding hepatocellular carcinomas, are managed at a weekly Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) meeting. Data was retrieved from the MDT database and medical records and analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics V20. Results: 111 cases were detected. There was no significant difference in the proportion of cases detected in the overall post-COVID period (n=53, 47.7%) compared to the Pre-COVID period (n=58, 52.3%) (p=0.7884). When COVID-19 cases were at their highest levels in Ireland, we observed a significant drop in new UGI/HPB cases detected compared to the pre-COVID period. This was mitigated in the third quarter of 2020, when transmission was depressed and a sharp increase in detection of UGI/HPB cases was observed. The variance of distribution of cases per quarter in the two periods was statistically significant with a P-value of 0.0001. There was a non-significant trend towards fewer diagnoses of early cancer (stage =2) in the Post- COVID period (21% v 26%) (p=0.6416). The proportion of patients diagnosed as an inpatient did not differ between the two periods, p=.739. Discussion: As fears about aerosolization abated, endoscopy services quickly increased the number of scopes performed after the initial reduction at the start of the pandemic. There are several limitations to this study, however it does lead us to conclude that our fears regarding cancer diagnosis in the postpandemic period did not materialise. It also offers solace that when transmission of COVID- 19 is depressed, as it was in Ireland in Q3 2020 before the peak of the second wave in Q4 2020, that outpatient services can quickly escalate their level of activity and detect cancers that were missed with no significant change in stage. A further observation is that when lockdown measures in Ireland were reintroduced in winter 2020/2021 but outpatient services were kept open, a similar reduction in detections was observed compared to when they were closed. Therefore, the question may be posed if the primary driver of reduced detection of UGI/HPB cancers is primary care services being overwhelmed with pandemic work rather than a reduction in outpatient services .

"MENTAL HEALTH IN IBD DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC: ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH CARE AND EXPOSURE TO PANDEMIC NEWS","Introduction It is well established that persons with IBD have significantly higher rates of depression and anxiety than the general population, and that mental health symptoms exacerbate disease symptoms and impair quality of life. During the COVID pandemic, the general public has experienced escalating rates of anxiety and depression. Our aim was to determine the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adults with IBD, focusing in this study on access to mental health resources. Methods All adults with current contact information in the population-based University of Manitoba IBD Research Registry (n=2833) were invited to participate in a survey via mail regarding their experiences with COVID-19 during autumn 2020, just prior to and during the second pandemic wave in Manitoba. The survey included background sociodemographic and disease information (e.g., symptom severity, medication use), COVID-related personal and health circumstances and coping. Results Response rate was 48.9% (n=1384). The mean age of respondents was 57.8 years, 59.3% were female and 46.9% had Crohn's disease. One in 5 (21.0%) of respondents had a prior diagnosis of a mental health condition. Overall, 11.6% felt they needed help from a mental health professional during the pandemic, with close to half (44.7%) of these individuals feeling they had inadequate access to a mental health professional. 10.0% accessed some type of resource;(of these, 52.5% used the internet, 24.5% used an app to help manage pandemic-related distress or anxiety). The most distressing aspects of the pandemic were concerns about family health (35.8%), concerns for getting infected with COVID-19 (27.2%), and having an IBD flare (9.0%). Trusted sources of information on the pandemic included television programs (64.2%), internet (46.1%), newspaper (27.8%), friends or family (21.7%), and social media (16.9%). Just over half (53.3%) spent 1-5 hours daily consuming information on COVID-19 from various sources, whereas 41.5% spent much less time (1-60 minutes/day). 51.4% tried to limit time spent watching the news or on the internet on the topic of COVID-19;of these, 9.6% found this quite or extremely difficult, and 22.1% had moderate difficulty limiting information consumption. Conclusion Mental health needs were prevalent for individuals with IBD during the first waves of the pandemic, with many of those who identified a need for professional help not feeling they had sufficient access to care. The most common mental health resource accessed was technology-based. A large proportion spent significant time focused on pandemic-related information. Further research is needed to examine changes over time during the pandemic and inter-relationships among mental health, care needs and IBD disease course.","Shaffer, S. R.; Jackson, G.

"THE IMPACT OF IBS ON SELF-REPORTED PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH DURING THE COVID PANDEMIC â€“ A NORWEGIAN TWIN STUDY","Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a stress-sensitive gut-brain disorder. The outbreak of Covid-19 has influenced the level of stress and anxiety at least for some people. Individuals with IBS often report poor self-rated health (SRH), which also reflects psychological and social aspects of life and an overall sense of well-being. This populationbased twin study evaluates whether the Covid pandemic has affected self-reports of abdominal symptoms of IBS and ratings of physical (p_SRH) and mental health (m_SRH) among individuals with IBS. Further, we calculate measures of twin similarity and correlations across traits to gain insights into the importance of genetic influences. Methods: In July 2021, we invited 17138 twins from the Norwegian Twin Register to complete a questionnaire asking how the pandemic affected their health and well-being, including depression, perceived stress, loneliness, anxiety, chronic somatic and pain-related diseases. Responses were received from 9032 twins, aged 19 â€“ 86 of whom 831 reported a positive history of IBS (Table 1). Hierarchical regression models were used to estimate the impact of IBS on p_ SRH and m_SRH during the Covid pandemic, covariates in the stepwise modeling included age, sex, education, and other chronic physical and mental health conditions. Phenotypic, intraclass and cross-twin cross-trait correlations were computed for IBS and the health measures. Results: The majority of individuals with IBS reported no changes in abdominal pain or bowel disturbance during the pandemic. Nonetheless, they did report worse perceptions of health compared to those without IBS. Further findings revealed weak but significant associations between IBS and changes in perceived stress. Age was inversely related to ratings for p_SRH and m_SRH, with younger participants reporting that their mental and physical health worsened more than older participants. IBS retained significance as a predictor of worsening m_SRH after accounting for depression and perceived stress (model 5, Table 2) [OR = 1.22 (1.00;1.50), Table 2]. The intraclass correlations for worse p_SRH and m_SRH were greater among monozygotic (MZ) than dizygotic (DZ) twins, which is consistent with genetic variance explaining some of the differences in how the pandemic has affected perceptions of health. Cross-twin cross-trait correlations between IBS and worse p_SRH were 0.15 (0.11;0.18) for MZ twins and 0.08 (0.03;0.12) for DZ twins, suggesting that common genetic factors may underlie this relationship Conclusion: Abdominal symptoms of IBS did not change during the pandemic. However, IBS was predictive of worsening of mental SRH, not confounded by depression or perceived stress. These results underscore the role of psychosocial and emotional factors for mental health in IBS during the pandemic.

"IMPACT OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON PATIENTS WITH INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE: A LOCAL REPORT","The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the life of people worldwide. We used a cross-sectional survey to evaluate the effects of pandemic on inflammatory bowel disease patients registered with Johns Hopkins. We assessed the methods used to minimize the risk of infection, coping mechanisms, changes in disease activity and management in the first 6 months of pandemic. Of the 405 patients who completed the questionnaire, 240 (58.8%) had Crohn's disease, 132 (32.6%) ulcerative colitis and 35 (8.6%) unclassified IBD.The median (IQR) age was 49 (28, 71). Two hundred seventy-three (67.4%) received biologics including patients on hospital-based (4.2%) infusions, outpatient-based infusions (26.7%) and home infusion (22.2%). Majority had other comorbidities, either heart (142/35.1%) or lung disease (19/ 4.7%), diabetes (22/5.4%), hypertension (77/19%), or obesity (13/3.2%). Most patients were at low risk for infection as they lived in a non-metropolitan area (291 patients, 71.8%), did not report close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 individual (373, 92.1%), did not travel to an area with high rates of COVID-19 (381, 94.1%) and did not use public transportation (379, 93.6%). All but 2 were taking protective measures such as use of N-95 mask (90, 22.2%), commercially (271, 66.9%) or homemade mask (208, 51.4%), sanitizer (363, 89.6%) or gloves (96, 23.7%). Additionally, patients used dietary/herbal supplements (55, 13.6%), dietary modifications (98, 24.2%) to support immunity (35, 8.6%), prevent an IBD flare (28, 6.9%), or minimize medications (48, 11.9%). The most common supplement used was Vitamin C (28, 50.9%), and D (42, 76.4%). Most (344, 84.7%) had no adjustments to their medications during pandemic, 31 (7.7%) discontinued their medication and 31 (7.7%) had to add a medication. Pandemic had, reportedly, no effect to the lives of 44 (20.9%) patients but 28 (13.3%) felt depressed, 70 (33.2%) anxious, 9 (4.3%) lost their income and 60 (28.4%) had other non-specified effects. The most common stress reduction techniques used were exercise (261, 64.4%), yoga (76, 18.8%), art therapy (23, 5.7%), music therapy (40, 9.9%), journaling (28, 6.9%), and guided Imagery (18, 4.4%). Fifty-eight (14.3%) used stress reduction medications. Eight (2%) reported SARS-CoV-2 infection. Median (IQR) age was 39 years (22,50)(Table 1). The majority had CD (6, 75%) and the infection was treated at home (6, 75%). One required admission to ICU. Infection led to worsening of the disease in 2 (25%). One (12.5%) discontinued IBD treatment. Our data suggest that most IBD patients followed low risk activities and were adherent to personal protective equipment and used stress reduction techniques and dietary supplements to cope with pandemic and avoid flares. Infection rates were low and the majority did not require admission to the hospital. In the majority infection did not cause an IBD exacerbation.

"POST-COVID-19 DISORDERS OF GUT-BRAIN INTERACTION (DGBI): AN INTERNET-BASED EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDY","Background: Post-COVID-19 conditions are defined as new, recurring, or ongoing health issues which present weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The gastrointestinal (GI) involvement of COVID-19 suggests that a group of patients with lingering GI symptoms may develop Post-COVID-19 DGBI including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (Schmulson M et al. Am J Gastroenterol. 2021;116:4-7). In this study, we aimed to determine the epidemiological features of Post-COVID-19 DGBI. Methods: Subjects with confirmed COVID-19 at least 6 months before the study who had sustained GI symptoms were invited to complete an internet-based survey on Qualtrics, between March and August 2021. The survey included demographics, acute symptoms, comorbidities, as well as Rome IV questionnaire, Generalized Anxiety Disorder questionnaire (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 for depression. Data was analyzed using ANOVA and multivariate analysis. Findings were reported as percentage or [p-value;(95% odds ratio CI)]. Results: Overall, 164 subjects (70% female, 14% male, and others unknown) with a positive COVID-19 test completed the survey. Among them, 4% were &gt;65 years old and 24% reported hospitalization. Body mass index Â³30 was present in 38%, diabetes in 6.7%, and vitamin D deficiency in 11% of the participants. In total, 108 (66%) subjects fulfilled Rome IV criteria for at least one DGBI. Of 108 with DGBI, only 27 (25%) had DGBI before COVID-19;DGBI developed in 81 subjects after COVID-19. The most common Post-COVID-19 DGBI were functional dyspepsia observed in 38 (postprandial distress syndrome n=31, epigastric pain syndrome n=22) followed by IBS in 26 subjects (IBS with Diarrhea n=7, IBS with Constipation n=4, Mixed-IBS n=14, Unsubtyped IBS n=1) (Table-1). The risk factors of severe COVID-19 including age &gt;65, diabetes, and obesity were not associated with developing Post-COVID- 19 DGBI. Seventy (86%) of subjects with Post-COVID-19 DGBI had at least one GI symptom (abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, and/or diarrhea) in the acute phase of COVID-19. Nausea/ vomiting during the acute illness increased [p-value of 0.02 with 95% OR CI (0.7-10.4)], and BMI less than 25 also increased the odds [p-value of 0.03 (95% OR CI: 0.26-8.4)] for Post-COVID-19 IBS. Anxiety was present in 48% and depression in 65% of subjects with Post-COVID-19 DGBI. Conclusions: Post-COVID-19 DGBI are new entities associated with a high rate of anxiety and depression. Although the majority of those with Post-COVID-19 DGBI reported having GI symptoms in the acute illness, some appeared in subjects without acute GI symptoms.

"PERCEPTIONS OF ACCESSING CARE AMONG IBD PATIENTS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has globally impacted public health and the world economy. This has related, in part, to challenges in accessing medical care including procedures, hospitalizations and/or surgeries that would have been otherwise warranted in their disease management. Access to care was affected during the pandemic as most providers were not seeing patients in person, but providing virtual care. Patients' perceptions of their access to care may cause significant stress and anxiety, in a population in which many already have existing mental health conditions. Methods Participants in the populationbased University of Manitoba IBD Research Registry (n=2833) were invited to participate in a survey regarding their experiences with COVID-19, during autumn 2020, just prior to and during the second pandemic wave in Manitoba. The survey included background sociodemographic and disease information (e.g., symptom severity, medication use), COVIDrelated personal and health circumstances and coping. Results There were 1384 respondents (48.9%), of which 46.9% had Crohn's disease, 40.8% had ulcerative colitis, 3.2% had ulcerative proctitis, 2.8% had IBD-U and 2.2% had an ileoanal pouch. The mean age of respondents was 57.8 years, 40.6% were male. Mean duration of disease was 24.8 years. 38.3% said the pandemic was affecting them extremely, or a lot, while 15.6% said not at all or a little. 65.5% and 62.1% of respondents felt they had good access to their non-IBD provider to discuss non-IBD health care issues, and IBD issues, respectively. Only 53% felt they had good access to their gastroenterologist to discuss their IBD. 45.3% of respondents had increased stress about accessing their physician or nurse, while 19.9% had increased stress about accessing their prescription IBD medications. 901 (65.1%) patients were on some form of IBD therapy;12.5% of IBD-medication users adjusted their IBD medications on their own, while 13.8% had a provider adjust their IBD therapy. Conclusion Our survey revealed that over half of respondents did not feel they had good access to their gastroenterologist, or had increased stress associated with accessing care or their IBD medications 9-10 months into the pandemic. Some adjusted their IBD therapies on their own. Perception regarding access to care is integral for patients with IBD, and further research is needed to understand if perceptions regarding limited access to care changed and whether or not care was in fact limited as the pandemic evolved.","Shaffer, S.

"COVID-19 EXACERBATES EXISTING DIGESTIVE DISORDERS AND TRIGGERS NEW DIGESTIVE SYMPTOMS AND DIAGNOSES: RESULTS FROM AN INTERNATIONAL PATIENT SURVEY","Background/Aims: COVID-19 infection can affect nearly every organ system including the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. GI symptoms such as nausea, pain and diarrhea are common and may be due to infection and/or increased stress and isolation from the pandemic. It is well known that stress affects GI function and sensation, particularly in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The aim of the study was to elucidate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on GI symptoms. Methods: An international online survey (Alchemer) was available via the International Foundation of GI Disorders (IFFGD) website from August 11, 2021- November 17, 2021. There were 57 questions exploring demographics, GI symptom/disorder classification, care delivery, administration and perceptions of COVID-19 vaccination, and health experiences during the pandemic. No compensation was provided for survey completion and patients were able to selectively answer questions, with some questions not analyzed for this report. Results: Survey data was included from 210 patients with GI symptoms (mean age 47.7 yrs, 83% female, 80% Caucasian). Participants' primary GI conditions included 36% IBS, 26% gastroparesis, 6% constipation, and 9% acid reflux (figure 1). Seventy percent reported the pandemic impacted their GI health and nearly 3 out of 4 (73%) reported increased pandemic-related anxiety or depression. COVID-19 was diagnosed in 40 (19%) participants. Nearly 3 out of 4 (74%) experienced new or worsening GI symptoms after a COVID-19 diagnosis. Almost a third (30%) with COVID-19 were diagnosed with post-infection (PI) IBS and 38% were diagnosed with a new GI disorder other than PI-IBS. New GI diagnoses after COVID-19 included gastroparesis (53%), GERD (13%), and diarrhea (7%) (figure 2). Prior to diagnosis of PI-IBS, 58% did not have a GI diagnosis. Almost half (46%) of patients reported new acid reflux symptoms after COVID-19. Almost 3 out of 4 patients (72%) with COVID-19 noticed changes in digestion and/or bowel movements. More than two thirds (67%) noted COVID-related GI symptoms lasted &gt;3 months. Nearly 3 out of 4 (72%) patients felt their GI symptoms were harder to manage after COVID-19. Conclusions: Our results highlight the significant burden of GI illness imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 exacerbated existing GI conditions, increased anxiety and depression, and led to a wide range of new GI issues, led by but not limited to PI-IBS. New diagnoses of upper GI disorders including gastroparesis and GERD were surprisingly common. Further prospective studies to validate these observations and understand their pathogenesis are warranted.

"IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON ABDOMINAL PAIN, EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, QUALITY OF LIFE, SLEEP, AND DISABILITY IN CHILDREN WITH FUNCTIONAL ABDOMINAL PAIN DISORDERS","Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to influence the well-being of families and children with Functional Abdominal Pain Disorders (FAPDs). Given the known relationship between stress and abdominal pain in children with FAPDs, we hypothesized pandemicrelated changes (e.g., reductions in family finances, social interactions) could affect health outcomes. Our aim was to examine the potential impact of the pandemic on abdominal pain, quality of life, psychological and physiological symptoms, and functional disability in children with FAPDs. Methods: Ninety-one parents of children ages 7-12 who met the Rome IV criteria for a FAPD completed baseline questionnaires as part of an ongoing randomized controlled intervention trial on their child's Quality of life (PedsQL), Pain Behavior and Response (PBQ, PBCL, PRI), Pain Catastrophizing (PCS), Psychological Symptoms (SCL-90), Functional Disability (FDI), and sleep habits (CSHQ). Heart rate was also measured. Participants were categorized into two groups, based on the date of entry into the original study, as before or during the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing us to take advantage of a naturally occurring opportunity to assess potential impacts of the pandemic. Results: Sixty-one participants were consented before, and 30 participants were consented during the COVID-19 pandemic. Parents in the latter group reported their children to have more days of abdominal pain, higher pain frequency, pain behavior, disability, helplessness, and depression, and significantly lower quality of life, compared to the before COVID group (Table 1). Finally, child sleep anxiety and overall sleep difficulty were significantly higher during COVID. Children also had a significantly higher mean heart rate during the COVID- 19 pandemic. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted children with FAPDs in multiple domains. Of concern, parents of children with FAPDs reported greater child pain frequency, disability, and pain behaviors during the pandemic than before the pandemic. Parents also reported significant increased child emotional distress during the COVID-19 pandemic and impacts on quality of life during COVID-19;in fact, most scores on the PedsQL were lower than those previously reported for children receiving cancer treatment. Child sleep anxiety and overall disordered sleep also worsened during the pandemic. Additionally, physiological changes (mean heart rate) were observed during the pandemic (Figure 1). Possible explanations for these findings could include increases in child and family stress, and greater parental awareness of child symptoms due to increased time at home together, or parents' own increased stress levels. Clinicians and researchers should be aware of the potential impact of COVID-19 pandemic on these areas to inform research as well as treatment of children with FAPDs.(Table Presented) (Figure Presented)","Kamp, K.; Murphy, T.; Shulman, R.

"Sleep Disturbances and Mental Health: A Transdiagnostic View of Sleep Disorders Symptoms in a Representative Canadian Sample","Introduction: Sleep problems can actively contribute to the onset, maintenance and worsening of mental disorders. Beyond insomnia, several other sleep pathologies may be associated with adverse mental health outcomes, and having multiple sleep disorders may be an aggravating factor. This study aimed to delineate the current landscape of sleep difficulties and symptoms of sleep disorders linked to poor mental health, investigate associations between the age at onset of sleep problems and subsequent mental health, and assess the perceived impacts of sleep problems. Materials and Methods: A representative sample of 1,200 Canadians (16 to 88 years old, 53% females) completed an online survey on sleep and mental health between 21 and 24 September 2021 (i.e. after the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada). The survey included questions inspired form the Sleep Disorders Questionnaire, Sleep Disorders Symptom Checklist-25, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, STOP-Bang, and Insomnia Severity Index. The sample was stratified in two groups based on self-reported current mental disorder diagnosis: mental disorder diagnoses [219 (18.2%)] vs no diagnosis [960 (80.0%)]. Total scores on the General Anxiety Disorder-7 and Patient Health Questionnaire were used to determine anxiety and depression symptoms severity. Results: Of those with mental disorder diagnoses, 80.4% (176/219) endorsed symptoms of at least one sleep disorder, a proportion significantly higher compared to the 42.7% observed in the rest of the sample (p&lt;.001, V=.29). The mental disorder diagnoses group included higher proportions of respondents endorsing symptoms of insomnia disorder, sleep apnea, bruxism, restless legs syndrome, nightmare disorder, hypersomnia and somnambulism. After adjusting for age, sex, income level and total sleep time, having a mental disorder diagnosis was associated with: insomnia (OR=3.52, p&lt;.001), obstructive sleep apnea (OR=1.95, p=.006) and bruxism (OR=2.77, p&lt;.001). Half of those with mental disorders diagnoses endorsed symptoms of multiple sleep disorders, a proportion significantly higher than what was observed in the rest of the sample (p&lt;.001, V=.35). Endorsing symptoms of insomnia, sleep apnea, bruxism, restless legs syndrome, and hypersomnia were associated with more severe anxiety and depression symptoms after adjusting for age, sex, income level, total sleep time, and mental disorders diagnoses (B&gt;.98, p&lt;.012). Younger age at onset of sleep problems was a significant independent predictor for current self-reported diagnosis of mental disorders (OR=.96, p&lt;.001). Compared to the rest of the sample, the mental disorder group reported significantly worse impacts of sleep problems on mental health, family relationships, physical health, cognitive functioning, productivity level, and global daily functioning. Conclusions: These results reinforce the transdiagnostic nature and cumulative impacts of the various profiles of sleep problems associated with mental health issues. These findings also suggest that the relationship between sleep and mental health is not solely driven by short sleep duration or insomnia. There is a need to enhance awareness about the diverse profiles of sleep issues linked to poor mental health and the relevance of early intervention, notably during youth. Should future longitudinal studies based on objective measures confirm these observations, this may inform further development of transdiagnostic sleep interventions for people with mental disorders.","Robillard, R.; Nixon, A.; Porteous, M.; Spitale, N.; Kendzerska, T.; Douglass, A.; Gallson, D.; Pennestri, M.

"The Association Between Sleep Quality and Anxiety in Postsecondary Students: A Systematic Review of the Literature","Introduction:Mental health conditions such as anxiety represent a growing health concern for students in institutions of higher education. Postsecondary students are a vulnerable population that is increasingly recognized to be at risk for both mental health problems and significant sleep problems. While it has been hypothesized that poor sleep quality may be a risk factor for developing anxiety, little is known about the frequency and severity of sleep problems and their association with anxiety within the postsecondary student population. The aim of this systematic review was to synthesize the best evidence on the association between sleep quality and anxiety in postsecondary students. Materials and Methods: An experienced librarian developed systematic search strategies in four databases: MEDLINE, Embase, APA PsycInfo (through Ovid Technologies Inc.) and CINAHL, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (through EBSCOhost). Databases were searched from inception to September 2020. Random pairs of independent reviewers screened titles and s for eligibility and critically appraised all eligible studies. We assessed the quality of studies using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) criteria for cohort studies, and the Hoy tool for cross-sectional studies. One author extracted and synthesized the results from all of the low and moderate risk of bias studies. We synthesized our results by study design and population. Results: Once duplicates were removed, a total of 3203 unique citations were screened. Fifty-one articles were eligible and critically appraised. Studies with low and moderate risk of bias were included in our final synthesis of which 24 were cross-sectional studies and four were cohort studies. With the exception of one study, all cross-sectional studies reported a statistically significant association between poor sleep quality and anxiety. All four of the cohort studies found that students who reported poor sleep quality were more likely to develop future anxiety and students with anxiety were more likely to develop future poor sleep quality. Conclusions: Poor sleep quality is associated with anxiety in postsecondary students. Due to the cross-sectional nature of most studies, we cannot determine the direction of this association. Future studies should focus on developing high-quality prospective cohort or longitudinal studies to help understand the impact and direction that this association has in postsecondary populations. This research has the potential to inform the development and design of mental health policies and programs that are created by postsecondary institutions to address the increasing rates of student mental health issues.

"Effectiveness of digitally delivered sleep interventions on sleep and mental health outcomes in postsecondary students: A systematic review","Introduction: Students pursuing postsecondary education are a population at significant risk for both sleep problems and poor mental health outcomes such as depression and anxiety. Interventions such as sleep hygiene education and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) are commonly used treatments for sleep problems and have been effective in improving sleep and mental health in the university student population. Digitally-delivered CBT has also been shown to be effective in improving sleep in youth, however it has not been evaluated in the postsecondary student population. Materials and Methods: We conducted a systematic review of the quantitative and qualitative evidence on the effectiveness and user experiences of digital sleep interventions to improve sleep and mental health outcomes in postsecondary students. We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, and APA PsycInfo for studies published from 2000 to 2021. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, case-control studies, qualitative studies, and mixed methods studies. Pairs of reviewers independently screened and critically appraised studies, and extracted data. We aimed to use a sequential approach at the review level to synthesize and integrate data across qualitative and quantitative research studies. Results: We screened 5361 citations and 58 full text articles. Eight relevant RCTs and one cohort study were critically appraised. Three interventions were assessed including CBT, digital sleep hygiene education, and relaxation music. Most studies were assessed as high risk of bias. Given the methodological limitations of the included studies, we are unable to conclude on the effectiveness of digital sleep interventions for postsecondary students. We did not identify any qualitative studies. Conclusions: Methodological limitations preclude firm conclusions. Further research is needed to assess the effectiveness of digital alternatives for delivering sleep interventions to improve sleep and mental health outcomes in postsecondary students. Qualitative studies exploring the views and preferences of students and providers are required to inform the development of novel interventions that are acceptable in this population.

"Respiratory Safety of Lemborexant in Adult and Elderly Subjects with Moderate to Severe Obstructive Sleep Apnea: A Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Crossover study","Introduction: A safety risk of some commonly prescribed sleep-promoting drugs, including benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepine receptor agonists, is central respiratory depression. Subjects with coexisting respiratory disease such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and/or the elderly, are particularly at risk. Lemborexant (LEM) is a dual orexin receptor antagonist (DORA) approved in multiple countries for the treatment of adults with insomnia. In study 102 (E2006-A001-102;NCT03471871), no differences between LEM 10 mg (LEM10) and placebo (PBO) were found on peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) and the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) in adult and elderly subjects with mild OSA following a single dose and multiple doses. Study 113 (E2006-A001-113;NCT04647383) is the first to investigate the effect of LEM on respiratory safety in adults and elderly subjects with moderate to severe OSA. Materials and Methods: This was a multicenter, multiple-dose, randomized, double-blind, PBO-controlled, 2-period crossover study in adult (age =45 to &lt;65y) and elderly (age =65 to =90y) subjects with moderate (15=AHI&lt;30) to severe (AHI=30) OSA. Subjects were randomized to two 8-night treatment periods (separated by a washout =14d) with either LEM10 or PBO. In-lab polysomnography and transmissive pulse oximetry were performed at screening, on Day 1 (after a single dose) and Day 8 of study drug during both treatment periods. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were recorded throughout the study. Results: Forty-eight subjects were screened;33 (68.8%) were randomized;of these n=13 had moderate OSA and n=20 had severe OSA. Mean age was 60.6y;22/33 subjects (66.7%) were age =45 to &lt;65y and 11/33 (33.3%) were =65 to =90y. During total sleep time, mean baseline SpO2 was 93.5% and mean AHI for moderate OSA and severe OSA groups together (n=33) was 44.2. No significant difference was found in AHI (least squares mean [LSM]) after a single dose or multiple doses of LEM10 versus PBO in subjects with moderate (single: LEM10, 31.49;PBO, 32.41, P=0.818;multiple: LEM10, 34.66;PBO, 37.16, P=0.442) or severe (single: LEM10, 48.22;PBO, 52.69, P=0.172;multiple: LEM10, 51.48;PBO, 51.15, P=0.902) OSA. LEM10 versus PBO was also not significantly different for SpO2 (LSM with moderate [single: LEM10, 93.68;PBO, 93.86, P=0.696;multiple: LEM10, 93.74;PBO, 93.86%, P=0.784] or severe [single: LEM10, 92.57;PBO, 92.65, P=0.841;multiple: LEM10, 92.63;PBO, 93.02, P=0.283] OSA). Furthermore, no significant difference was found in percentage of total sleep time during which SpO2 was below the thresholds of &lt;90%, &lt;85%, &lt;80% for LEM10 vs PBO following a single dose (P=0.694, P=0.134, P=0.195, respectively) or multiple doses (P=0.481, P=0.711, P=0.699, respectively) in subjects with moderate or severe OSA. TEAEs were higher with LEM10 (18.2%) versus PBO (9.1%). One subject did not complete treatment due to an adverse event unrelated to LEM10 (COVID-19). Overall, LEM was well tolerated, and most TEAEs were mild. Conclusion: As objectively measured by AHI and SpO2 during TST, LEM, a DORA, demonstrated respiratory safety with single and multiple dosing in subjects with moderate and severe OSA, and was well tolerated.

"Digital Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia (dCBT-I) and emotion regulation as early intervention for employees in the workplace","Insomnia is a serious public health concern and has been linked to impaired work productivity. Studies show a link between poor sleep and aspects of occupational functioning such as absenteeism, reduced productivity and low work satisfaction. One in every three workers in the UK are affected by sleep problems costing the economy around Â£36 billion/year due to loss of productivity in the workplace. This results in around 200,000 working days lost every year, and it is estimated that the cost to industry will rise steadily to Â£44 billion by 2030 if nothing is done about it. Few studies have evaluated the effectiveness of CBT-I in workplaces, and have found improvements in severity of insomnia and quality of sleep, and slight improvements in productivity and presenteeism, but not in absenteeism. While most interventions for insomnia are focused on the treatment of those above clinical thresholds, there is crucial need for early intervention/prevention of insomnia. This has been further exacerbated during the Covid-19 pandemic due to isolation, financial insecurities, loss of loved ones and fear of infection, causing extensive sleep problems as well as stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms. This study will examine the efficacy of a new hybrid dCBT-I for mild to severe insomnia and symptoms of depression and anxiety delivered to employees in the workplace. This trial tests the efficacy of implementing a hybrid dCBT-I + emotion regulation (ER) in the workplace in a mixed methods evaluation with a two-arm randomised waitlist control (WLC) design. The dCBT-I+ER intervention is 8-weeks long and delivered via self-guided online platform and four videoconferencing therapy sessions. Primary outcomes are the Insomnia Severity Index, the Patient Health Questionnaire and the Generalised Anxiety Disorder. Secondary outcomes are job productivity, job satisfaction, well-being, quality of life, self-reported (sleep diary data) and objective (actigraphy) sleep parameters. We recruited 163 workers with sleep and emotion regulation problems ranging from subclinical to clinical levels not engaged in treatment at the time of the trial. Due to the study design, analyses for the primary hypotheses will be done when the last enrolled participant provides post-intervention follow-up (1-month) outcome measures. We hypothesise that participants randomly allocated to dCBT-I+ER will demonstrate significantly greater improvements on the primary outcomes compared to WLCs post-intervention. They will also demonstrate significantly greater improvements on objective (actigraphy) and self-reported (sleep diary) sleep parameters. Exploratory analyses will also indicate the impact of the dCBT-I+ER on work productivity, job satisfaction, wellbeing, and quality of life. Evaluation of an early intervention for workers with mild to severe symptoms of insomnia and emotion regulation difficulties will contribute to the understanding of benefits of early interventions in the workplace, and its impact on mental health and productivity. The mixed methods evaluation will provide insight into the application of intervention and help us understand peopleâ€™s experiences of the intervention and what helped or hindered its use. This pilot study forms the basis of what could become a larger nationwide service delivery programme of mental health interventions for insomnia in the workplace.","Moukhtarian, T.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2022.05.316","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sleep Medicine; 100:S114-S115, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",35980,""
"Quantitative and qualitative features of dreaming activity during the pandemic","Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has crucially influenced daily habits, mental health, and sleep. Several findings reveal that dreams are affected by waking experiences and sleep patterns. The lockdown could have provoked strong modifications in dreaming activity. This study aimed to assess dream features during the Italian lockdown. Furthermore, we also investigated the impact of the end of COVID-19 confinement on dream activity through a longitudinal investigation. Materials and Methods: We used a web survey to collect demographic, clinical, sleep, and dream data during the lockdown. The sample included 1091 participants. After filling out the survey, 90 subjects participated in the longitudinal protocol lasting two weeks: (a) the first week (April 28â€“May 4) of full lockdown;and (b) the second week (May 5â€“May 11) of easing of restrictions. Participants were asked to record at home their dream experiences and complete a sleep-dream diary each morning. Results: Results obtained from the first protocol showed an increase in quantitative and qualitative dream features during the lockdown, compared to a pre-lockdown period. Higher dream frequency and specific qualitative features were found in females and individuals with poor sleep quality, nocturnal disruptive behaviors, and depressive symptoms. Most of the dream features collected during the lockdown were predicted by age, gender, depressive symptoms, presence of other people at home, and territorial area. Sleep duration and several sleep quality indexes were the best predictors of dream variables. During the lockdown, dreams were also characterized by increased negative emotions, particularly frequent in females, younger adults, and people with poor sleep quality, nocturnal disruptive behaviors, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Regarding the longitudinal protocol, the analyses showed that participants had higher numbers of awakenings, lower ease of falling asleep, higher dream recall, and lucid dream frequency during lockdown than post-lockdown. Subjects reported more dreams, including â€œbeing in crowded placesâ€ during post-lockdown than lockdown. Conclusions: Our results confirm the strong influence of the pandemic on dreaming, supporting both the continuity-hypothesis between waking experience and sleep mentation and the view of a key influence of sleep patterns on dreaming. The poorer sleep quality during lockdown is consistent with previous studies. The relationship between traumatic events and dream recall frequency supports the idea of the pandemic as â€œcollective traumaâ€. Moreover, we hypothesized that the greater lucid dreams frequency during confinement could reflect the attempt to cope with the waking pandemic experiences. The crowded places into dream scenarios during the second week of our protocol are also consistent with the continuity-hypothesis: the possibility to access places frequented by other people could represent a relevant experience after a long period of confinement. Finally, we believe that investigations on COVID-19 infected subjects experiencing the long-COVID-19 syndrome should be carried out since preliminary findings on COVID-19 patients showed strong associations between increased nightmares and the infection severity. This evidence suggests that the more that people were affected by COVID-19, the greater the impact on dream activity and quality of life.","Scarpelli, S.; Gorgoni, M.; Alfonsi, V.; Annarumma, L.; De Gennaro, L.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2022.05.110","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sleep Medicine; 100:S36, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",35981,""
"Moderator effect of physical activity on stress and sleep relationship in daily life: an observational study using wearable devices","Introduction: Daily sleep may be affected by several conditions, including stress. Stress has been shown to impact our physical and mental health. Perceived stress can affect sleep quantity, quality, and architecture, with a detrimental effect on emotional responses to daily stressors. Moreover, poor quantity/quality sleep can increase the risk of severe medical and mental disorders that in turn can have a negative effect on sleep. However, some beneficial sleep/stress management interventions seem to have a mediator impact on a stress-sleep relationship. Physical activity (PA) is reported to prevent the negative effects of perceived stress on sleep, in stress conditions, as COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. The study aimed to conduct a preliminary analysis on the relationship between PA, perceived daily stress (pdStress), and sleep parameters from data collected through Garmin and Apple wearable devices by LUCA app, a psychophysiological well-being application, helping to recognize and manage stress. Materials and methods: Data from Australian users have been collected for 14 consecutive days. No inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. PA and sleep parameters were selected if present on both Garmin and Apple devices. We assessed: PA by daily calories consumption during active daily periods, and total steps;sleep as time spent asleep;pdStress as the total score obtained from four specific daily, day-framed questions investigating the ability to relax, the presence of somatic, and emotional/cognitive symptoms [total score range: 0-12;the higher is the score the higher is the pdStress.] Statistical analysis included linear mixed models, with pdStress total score as independent variable and sleep duration as dependent variable. PA parameters were added separately as moderators of pdStress and sleep relationship, with age, sex, and the brand of the wearable devices as covariates. Results: Sample: 46 Australian users (19 from Garmin and 27 Apple wearable devices), including 27 females (58.7%);age between 20 and 60 years (years;m=40.8, sd=Â±9.1). On average, the sample was characterized by: low to moderate levels of PA;mild levels of pdStress;and sleep duration as WHOâ€™s recommendations. The analyses showed a statistically significant inverse association between level of pdStress and sleep duration (p &lt; 0.001). This relationship was moderated by PA measured by active calories consumptions (p = 0.015) and total steps (p = 0.038), with higher activity levels resulting in a reduction of the strength of the inverse association between pdStress and sleep. Discussion: Our results confirm the detrimental relationship between pdStress and nighttime sleep duration, as reported by the literature. Moreover, our data show that high levels of PA can reduce the negative effect of pdStress on sleep duration. Despite the limitations concerning the limited number of subjects, device-related recording errors, indirect sleep parameters, and non-sophisticated PA measures, our results underline the importance of PA programs when daily stress conditions and sleep alterations occur.

"Association between decreased frequency of seeing friends and the onset of depressive symptoms among community-dwelling older adults: A longitudinal study","Objevtives : Mental health among the older adults has been shown to be affected by reduced social interaction with friends. However, this relationship has not been confirmed in short periods of limited social interaction, such as that experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we investigated the relationship between the development of depressive symptoms and a 6-month decrease in the frequency of visits with friends among community-dwelling elderly in Japan. Methods : Participants were 491 community-dwelling older adults aged 65 years or older (47.5% female, mean age [standard deviation]Â =Â 80.5 [4.7] years) who responded to the March 2020 baseline survey by mail questionnaire and the October 2020 follow-up survey. Results : The onset of depressive symptoms was observed in 22.8% in about 6 months. The change in frequency of seeing friends, 56.2% remained unchanged, 23.2% increased, and 20.6% decreased. A logistic regression analysis with maintenance of frequency of seeing friends as a reference showed that a decreased frequency of seeing friends was significantly associated with the incidence of depressive symptoms. (odds ratioÂ =Â 2.26, 95% confidence intervalÂ =Â 1.32-3.86, pÂ =Â 0.003). Discussion : A decrease in the frequency of seeing friends over even a short period of time can have a negative impact on older adultsâ€™ mental health. The findings suggest that in situations where the frequency of seeing friends decreases during a short period of time, maintaining interaction with friends and avoiding face-to-face restrictions is important for maintaining the mental health of older adults.","Tomiyama, Naoki, Noguchi, Taiji, Kubo, Yuta, Hayashi, Takahiro, Ochi, Akira, Hayashi, Hiroyuki","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mhp.2022.200243","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Mental Health & Prevention;: 200243, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",35983,""
"Impact of Telehealth on Mental Health Providers- Lifestyle, Training and Patient Care","Background: There is a relative paucity of data on the telehealth experience of health care providers. The present study helps to address this gap by examining the telehealth experiences of mental health providers. Methods: An IRB-approved anonymous survey (31 questions) was circulated in the state of Maryland at the Kennedy Krieger Institute, the Division of Child Psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University and at the University of Maryland, several community mental health practices, and professional organizations. Mental health professionals (physicians, psychologists, licensed social workers, nursing providers), and trainees (medical residents, post-doctoral fellows, and social work trainees) were eligible to participate in the survey. The survey focused on three key domains: patient care, work-life balance, and personal life. 175 providers participated in this survey Results: 75% of the respondents were female. 30% of respondents had been in practice for more than 20 years. 10% were trainees. The majority of respondents reported an overall positive impact of telehealth on their clinical practice. The comfort level with telehealth was high across the board. The impact on work-life balance and personal lives of practitioners was mixed with the highest negative impact (90%)reported by early-career practitioners. The majority of respondents reported a negative impact on education of trainees. Discussion: Several mental health disciplines were represented in the survey. Providers were comfortable with using technology and found benefits for patient care. Managing individual work schedules and maintaining the therapeutic relationship with patients seemed to be the areas of concern, especially for early-career providers. This may be due to relatively less control over their schedules and the presence of other competing responsibilities. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the establishment of telehealth services. The overall impact seems to be positive especially in the mental health field. In our attempt to understand the impact of this transition on the mental health providers, we found that there are specific trends for the degree of impact based on the duration of practice and field of practice of the providers. This information may help inform future clinical practices and policies, as telehealth will likely continue to be an integral part of medical care beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Too Sick to Transfer: Toward Creating an On-call ECT Consult Service in the General Hospital","Background/Significance: Severe depression, psychosis, and catatonia are prevalent conditions on inpatient medical-surgical services and frequently drive psychiatric consultation. These syndromes are more common in patients with SMI, who are often socioeconomically disadvantaged. ECT can be a rate limiting and urgently indicated therapy in the treatment of these conditions. Transfer to inpatient psychiatry for the purposes of providing ECT can be difficult due to medical-surgical instability. ECT is at baseline a scarce resource in many institutions. Access to ECT for patients outside the inpatient psychiatric service is limited and requires the cooperation of multiple services. Barriers to the provision of ECT on the medical-surgical floors include navigation of a typically full ECT schedule, anesthesia availability, the portability of ECT equipment, and, more recently, restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, which necessitates further precautions for procedures requiring anesthesia. We describe a quality improvement intervention designed to assess the needs for and delivery of urgent / emergent ECT referrals in the general hospital. Methods: We convened a group of stakeholders including representatives from medicine, surgery, anesthesia, nursing, and psychiatry to identify the current practices related to care of patients with neuropsychiatric illness who are medically and/or surgically unstable for transfer to inpatient psychiatry and who require urgent/emergent ECT. Goals of this project included education about prevalence, diagnosis, and associated morbidity of catatonia, the role of ECT in catatonia and related psychiatric conditions, and identification of barriers and solutions to providing timely access to ECT. Results: Stakeholders identified the emergent need for ECT and proposed either the creation of an on-call emergency ECT service akin to other on call services such as interventional radiology, dialysis, and surgical subspecialties, and/or the designation of a daily ECT emergency add-on slot. The barriers to intervention and proposed solutions were addressed by stakeholder group participants. Discussion: Neuropsychiatric conditions, including catatonia, can complicate and/or be driven by underlying medical-surgical illness. These patients can become too sick to transfer to inpatient psychiatry. More time on the medical and/or surgical units results in a positive feedback loop of worsening illness, further delaying transfer to inpatient psychiatry. By creating an on-call / designated add-on system for the provision of emergent ECT, we aim to reduce the overall morbidity associated with these conditions. Conclusion/Implications: Improving access to ECT services for medically-surgically ill patients with severe psychiatric comorbidities via an emergency ECT service allows for earlier treatment of these conditions and can improve patient outcomes.

"The relationship Between Glycemic Control and Food Insecurity in People with Diabetes Mellitus and Comorbid Psychosis","Background/Significance: In the US, adults with psychosis have increased mortality mostly due to cardiovascular disease (CVD) (Olfson 2015). Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a potent CVD risk factor, which occurs in 28% of individuals with serious mental illnesses (Mangurian 2018). Little is understood of the contribution of social and environmental factors to diabetes health disparities experienced by people with psychosis. Food insecurity has been shown to be an independent risk factor for poor glycemic control (Seligman 2012). Methods: This IRB-approved cross-sectional survey aims to describe the prevalence and correlates of food insecurity among adults with DM and co-morbid psychosis who receive primary care through 12 clinics affiliated with a large academic healthcare system in Washington state. Administrative data was utilized to identify eligible patients: age 18-65;one inpatient or two outpatient diagnoses of schizophrenia (F20-29), bipolar disorder (F31), or major depressive disorder with psychotic features (F32.3;F33.3) and one inpatient or two outpatient diagnoses of DM (E08-E13.9). Patients with diagnoses of dementia or intellectual disability were excluded. All eligible patients were sent a letter with a unique link to a survey in Research Electronic Data Capture. The survey included questions related to diabetes clinical characteristics, self-care behaviors, and psychosis symptom severity in addition to demographics. Food insecurity was measured with the validated USDAâ€™s Food Security Survey Module. Consistent with previous studies, participants will be considered food-insecure if two or more responses are affirmative. We compared food insecure and food secure particpants with level of social support and frequency of psychiatry symptoms. â€¢Regression analysis was applied to examine the associations between food security status, social support, and mental health symptoms. Results: 624 patients with diabetes and psychosis were identified. 156 patients responded, giving a response rate of 26%. 25% of respondents were found to be food insecure. 16% of respondents demonstrated low social support while 43% showed moderate social support and 41% showed high social support. Mean CSI was 19.36, which suggests participants experienced symptoms several times per month (versus daily or weekly). Significantly lower social support was found in participants with food insecurity compared to those without (p=0.008). This relationship was driven by lower social support from family (p&lt;0.001) compared to friends (p=0.61) or significant others (p=0.192). Additionally, greater psychiatric symptom severity was found in people with food insecurity (p &lt;0.001). Regression analysis showed that social support did not significantly moderate the relationship between food security and frequency of psychiatric symptoms. Discussion: This study showed that food insecurity was significantly associated with both low perceived social support and more frequent psychiatric symptoms. However, no evidence of a moderating effect of social support on the relationship between food insecurity and psychiatric symptom severity was found. Rate of food insecurity was found to be lower than previous studies, which showed approximately 50% of individuals who used public mental health services faced food insecurity (Adams et al., 2021). The study sample was not limited to public mental health service users, which is the likely cause of this lower rate. Conclusion/Implications: Food insecurity is associated with poorer mental health outcomes, which have been associated with poorer health outcomes. The presence of perceived social support does not mitigate the need for addressing food insecurity. There is a need for both medical and mental health providers who care for people with co-morbid diabetes and psychosis to specifically address food insecurity. References: 1.

"Remote Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy for Post-Intensive Care Syndrome","Background: Post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) affects up to half of ICU patients and comprises neuromuscular, cognitive, and psychiatric impairments that persist up to years after discharge (Inoue, 2019). PICS is often overlooked and under-diagnosed (Rawal, 2017), without clear evidence-based strategies for management. Data supporting interventions for symptoms of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress after discharge is limited (Needham, 2012). Developing high-quality, evidence-based interventions for PICS would address this critical need. Methods: Shortly before discharge, patients are recruited from our neurological ICU who have been intubated for at least 24 hours and score 24â€“32 on the Impact of Event Scale - Revised (which indicates likely PTSD symptoms without a true diagnosis). Baseline Beck Depression Index and Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status questionnaires are also administered to each patient. Participants are then randomly assigned either to a virtual reality exposure therapy intervention or to a control group that receives no therapeutic intervention. VRET patients are given an online 360Â° video of an ICU room from the perspective of an intubated patient, complete with sounds and simulated clinical scenarios (rounds, intubation, suctioning, etc.). Intervention patients have unlimited access to the videos for six months, beginning one month after discharge. Follow-up IES-R, BDI, and TICS are administered at 1, 3, and 6 months to both groups. Results/Discussion: Our IRB approved this study in March 2021. Enrollment has begun with 3â€“5 feasibility patients, to be followed by 30 randomized patients starting in November. Our poster features a case discussion on our first patient's experiences with VRET. Given the novelty of remote VRET for post-ICU PTSD symptoms, our results will be an important contribution with the potential to change practice. Conclusion: This will be the first remote intervention for neuropsychiatric symptoms of PICS, and has far-reaching implications for inpatient and outpatient CL psychiatrists â€” particularly at a time when patients have grown increasingly accustomed to virtual interventions, and when ICU survivors have multiplied due to COVID-19. Should our VRET prove successful, it will open the eyes of intensivists and CL psychiatrists to a whole realm of remote, efficient, and accessible virtual reality therapies for patients who have undergone acute care. This will improve long-term outcomes, particularly for patients who may have difficulty seeing an outpatient psychiatrist or taking medications consistently. Finally, our study will help to raise awareness of the psychiatric sequelae of acute illness, and so enhance inpatient collaboration between psychiatry and many other specialties. References: 1.

"Optimizing Mental Health Referrals in a University Based Primary Care Clinic","Background/Significance: Primary care settings are often the first point of contact for psychiatric diagnosis, treatment, and referral â€“ and primary care clinicians manage many psychiatric illnesses in the community. Integrated and collaborative care models have grown in response to the recognized need for psychiatric services in the primary care setting. Despite increased psychiatric presence, access to mental health services remains a challenge for patients and primary care providers. This challenge is particularly notable in racially diverse and socioeconomically disadvantaged patient populations and is further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which disproportionately affects these groups. We describe an initiative to improve equity and access to mental health services among racially diverse and socioeconomically disadvantaged patients in a primary care clinic affiliated with an academic teaching hospital. Methods: We convened a meeting of internal medicine, psychiatry, social work, and administrative stakeholders affiliated with our university-based primary care clinic. This clinic primarily serves low income, racially diverse, and/or immigrant populations. We reviewed provider needs related to mental health referrals and compiled a comprehensive list of local outpatient, partial hospital, inpatient, addiction, and emergency resources. We then created an algorithm to direct providers to the appropriate resources based on the presenting mental health concern. This algorithm has been integrated into the electronic medical record (EMR) for easier access and use. Clinicians were surveyed pre-training and deployment of the algorithm and will be surveyed in follow up to measure its benefits. Results: The majority of primary care providers did not feel confident with psychiatric referral options. The most frequently described reason for psychiatric intervention was for depression and anxiety. Among mental health questions, a majority could be addressed with the assistance of a referral. Discussion: Despite increasing psychiatry presence in primary care, challenges remain in accessing mental health services. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing challenges with increased demand for services. Our project builds on an existing integrated care model and introduces a resource that further streamlines mental health referrals. By having this resource available both physically in the clinic and embedded within the EMR, we hope to enhance the ease and efficiency of referral. Conclusion/Implications: A streamlined referral process can further aid in improving access to mental health services within a clinic already using an integrated care model. This is particularly important given the increased need for mental health services in low income, diverse, and immigrant populations hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. References: 1.

"Is it Time to Revisit Neuroinflammatory Depression? A Case of COVID-19 Associated Depression and the Role of ECT","Background: The neurobiology of depression can be heterogeneous with multiple hypotheses proposed, including serotonin and neuroinflammatory pathways, each falling short of explaining the complete picture. Several reports describe the increased frequency of depression in the community following the COVID-19 pandemic and reports about neuropsychiatric sequela of the virus are emerging and the possible role of neuroinflammation. We present a patient who developed severe depression with psychotic features subsequent to his COVID-19 infection and was treated successfully with ECT following several failed medication trials. Case: A 49-year-old male with a past medical history of type II diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and gastroesophageal reflux disease was diagnosed with COVID-19 in January 2021. Upon initial diagnosis, neither admission nor treatment with steroids was required. He presented to the emergency department four days later with sepsis, pneumonia, and AKI secondary to COVID-19 along with the new onset of suicidal ideations with plans to cut himself and significant psychomotor features despite no previous history of mental illness or treatment. His EEG showed diffuse slow waves, consistent with encephalopathy, but no delirium was noted. He exhibited irritability, anger, anhedonia, negativism, and isolated himself in his room. He demonstrated delusional fear about his apartment exploding due to electricity disconnected for not paying his bills. He misinterpreted the blood draws as someone suspecting he has HIV. Treatment started on the medical floor and he was later transferred to the psychiatric floor. Several psychotropic medications were tried separately including citalopram 20mg, escitalopram 20mg, and bupropion (titrated to 300mg) with the addition of aripiprazole 5 mg without improvement. ECT was considered and his depression and psychosis improved following 6 treatments of bilateral ECT. He was discharged following completion of 10 ECT treatments on 300 mg of bupropion daily and 5mg olanzapine at night. Discussion: Viral infections such as HIV, Hepatitis C, and Influenza are associated with neuropsychiatric sequelae, including depression. COVID-19 infection is occasionally associated with â€˜cytokine stormâ€™ which may exacerbate neuroinflammation via increases in cytokines and possible activation of mast cells and microglia.[1] The role of elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines and glucocorticoid receptor resistance is widely studied. Interleukin-6 and CRP are the most strongly linked to depression with a high correlation for anhedonia and psychomotor retardation, prominent features of depression in our case, hinting at a possible role of neuroinflammation. [2] Psychotic features and psychomotor retardation are predictors of ECT response which matched the response to ECT in this case. References: 1. Kempuraj, Duraisamy, et al.

Dysgeusia may lead to appetite loss which is nonspecific and can have multiple causes, including major depressive disorder (MDD) (Coulter, 1988). Although post-marketing data revealed no association between nifedipine and dysgeusia (Ackerman, 1997), case reports of dysgeusia from nifedipine exist (Ackerman, 1997). We present a case of nifedipine-induced dysgeusia mistaken for depression. Case Report: A 42-year-old man with hypertension and diabetes was admitted to the hospital following right thalamocapsular and intraventricular hemorrhages. Hypertension was managed with metoprolol, lisinopril, nifedipine, and chlorthalidone. Levetiracetam was started for seizure prophylaxis. Medications included pantoprazole, simethicone, transdermal lidocaine, insulin, metformin, docusate, senna, and subcutaneous heparin. Psychiatric consultation was requested out of concern that appetite loss indicated depression. The day before psychiatric evaluation, mirtazapine 15 mg at bedtime for mood and appetite was started. Nifedipine 90 mg daily had been started 9 days prior to his first complaint of decreased appetite. The patient reported feeling disconnected from his family and â€œsad"" for ~10 years, complaining that family members â€œtalk behind his back.â€ He was otherwise without paranoia. He denied insomnia, anhedonia, hopelessness, poor concentration, suicidal ideation, homicidal ideation, guilt, mania, or hallucinations. He reported poor appetite due to epigastric discomfort and bad taste to foods. Covid-19 testing was not yet widely available. No other signs or symptoms suggestive of Covid-19 were present. Although alert and fully oriented, concentration was impaired with sometimes tangential thought processes. Affect was full without depression. A diagnosis of adjustment disorder was made. The psychiatry team suspected nifedipine-induced dysgeusia and advised discontinuing nifedipine. Appetite improved two days later. Discussion: This case highlights the importance of considering alternative causes of nonspecific symptoms of depression, including decreased appetite, that may have non-psychiatric causes. Dysgeusia is widely recognized as a symptom of Covid-19. Other causes, including medications may be underrecognized and amenable to intervention. Conclusion: It would be helpful to consider medication side-effects as potential causes for taste distortion alongside psychiatric diagnoses, and COVID-19. References: 1.

"Collaborative Care in Acute Settings: An Integrated Approach to Psychiatric Care within an Academic Emergency Department","Background/Significance: Nationwide, the number of hospital emergency department (ED) visits has steadily increased over the past decade;since 2009, ED volumes have increased over 11%.1 The proportion of ED visits primarily involving psychiatric concerns (including substance use) has also been on the rise, from 6.6% of all visits in 2007 to 10.9% of all visits in 2016.2 A recent retrospective analysis of ED visit data from the National Emergency Department Sample examining the years 2010 through 2014 identified mental health concerns (including substance use) as the second-most frequent ED presentation, with abdominal pain ranking as the most frequent.3 Challenges to caring for patients with prominent psychiatric concerns in EDs include: prolonged lengths of stay (LOS),4 boarding and overcrowding,5 increased restraint use,6 financial sequelae,7 and safety implications for patients and staff.5 Many EDs have limited access to psychiatric expertise. Unique features of our innovative ED-based Psychiatry service line include: 1) joint administration by academic departments of Emergency Medicine and Psychiatry, and 2) concurrent, rather than consecutive, evaluations conducted by Emergency Medicine physicians and Psychiatrists for optimal efficiency and collaboration. Methods: The ED Psychiatry Program at Froedtert Hospital was implemented in 2019 to improve patient care, systems-based processes, and cross-specialty education. IRB approval was granted on 4/7/2020 to review data collected on all patients seen in the ED by the new ED Psychiatry service and compare metrics with primary psychiatric patients seen in the ED prior to program implementation. Patient care metrics from the first 12 months has been analyzed;cases in which the ED psychiatrist was involved total 382 (data from 5 patients seen during this period could not be reviewed due to erroneous recording of identifying information). 754 charts were reviewed in totalâ€”377 post-implementation (9/1/2019-8/31/2020) and 377 pre-implementation (9/1/2018-8/31/2019). The following metrics were recorded and analyzed using basic summary statistics: ED LOS, disposition, psychiatric diagnosis at discharge, medication class recommended, medication class administered, medication route recommended, and medication route administered. Statistical analysis was performed both on the 12-month groups in aggregate, as well as separately in 6-month groupings to assess for any COVID-19 related confounding effect. Results: Analysis of the first 12 months of data (n = 377 control and intervention patients) demonstrates statistically significant results across a number of domains, including disposition (decrease in hospital admissions and increases in transfers and ED discharges post-implementation), psychiatric diagnoses (increases in personality, intellectual developmental, and anxiety spectrum disorders post-implementation), and medication classes and administration routes utilized (decrease in benzodiazepine use and increases in both atypical antipsychotic use, as well as oral route of administration post-implementation). There were also notable decreases in ED LOS for patients being admitted and transferred from the ED;however, these differences were not statistically significant. Discussion: Analysis of the first year of service data suggests program efficacy and overall value to the health system, with relevant metrics including shorter ED LOS, improved diagnostic accuracy, increased provision of pharmacological treatment interventions in the ED setting and upon discharge, and more resource-appropriate dispositions for patients presenting to the ED with psychiatric concerns. Future directions for further study include: 1) review of the total data set, numbering over 1300 patients in 2 years;2) de-duplication of the data set to eliminate repeat patient encounters as a potential source of confounding;3) collaboration with a faculty biostatistician team for further statistical analysis;and 4) collection and analysis of additional relevant metrics, including restraint use (both f equency and duration), utility of 1:1 observers, patient insurance status (to aid in quantifying possible financial impact), additional patient demographic data (including age, race, gender, ethnicity), and time of patient presentation to the ED. Conclusion/Implications: Integration of psychiatric care into medical settings has been widespread in outpatient environments, but acute models are lacking. Complex psychiatric presentations impede ED workflows and often lead to inadequate care for this vulnerable population. Our jointly administered program that embeds CL Psychiatrists into our academic ED care team has improved and enhanced the care of ED patients presenting with psychiatric concerns as well as operational efficiencies within the department.

"Case Series of Consultation-Liaison Patients with Anorexia Nervosa during the Pandemic","Introduction: Anorexia Nervosa (AN) is an eating disorder defined by an abnormally low body weight due to purging behaviors/food intake restrictions and distorted self-image. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has changed our environment due to social distancing, lockdown, and reduced access to regular mental health services. Reports indicate a negative impact of COVID-19 on mental health1, including patients with AN2. Our Consultation-Liaison service noticed an increase in new-onset AN cases and a worsening of established AN cases attributed to the environment created by COVID-19. Methods: PubMed literature review with keywords â€œCOVID-19â€ and â€œAN.â€ Review of seven AN cases seen during the pandemic. Case series: Seven cases (COVID-19 negative) of worsening AN were seen by our Consultation-Liaison service between August 2020 and January 2021. Six cases were newly diagnosed, five cases presented severe dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, or bradycardia requiring inpatient stabilization, and five cases needed transfer to inpatient eating disorder units. The lack of structured activities and increased social media use leading to distorted self-image were found to be a trigger. Discussion: The impact of the Pandemic in AN can vary. The lack of structure, increased social media use, and reduced access to mental health services may increase AN incidence and worsening of symptoms3. However, a study reported a positive response to AN treatment during confinement4, possibly due to family dynamics5. It is important to note that patients with AN are a vulnerable population that requires greater support and monitoring to prevent worsening symptoms and long-term consequences. These observations suggest the need for further research to understand the impact of the pandemic on AN symptoms onset and severity. References: 1. Phillipou, A., et al. (2020).

"ECT Resolving Catatonia in a Huntington's Disease Patient: A Case Report and Review of Literature","Background: Psychiatric symptoms, particularly depression, are common in Huntingtonâ€™s Disease (HD) patients. Catatonia is relatively rare in this population, and there is no current standardized treatment for catatonic HD patients (Merida-Puga et al., 2011). ECT is not generally used for treatment of psychiatric disorders in HD patients;however, there is evidence that it should be considered for some catatonic HD patients (Mowafi and Millard, 2021). Here, we present the case of a HD patient with catatonia rapidly responsive to ECT and conduct a literature review, adding further evidence of its efficacy in this population. Case: Mr. S is a 60-year-old male with a history of HD, MDD, and anxiety who presented to the ED with suicidal ideation and a plan to overdose due to his disease progression, significant anxiety, and paranoia surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. He was previously admitted to another psychiatric hospital without clinical benefit. His psychotropic regimen at admission included buspirone, citalopram, deutetrabenazine, paliperidone, propranolol, and tiagabine. Four days into his admission, he was nonresponsive on interview. Given concern for catatonia (Bush-Francis Rating Scale, BFRS, 24), a successful lorazepam challenge was administered. Paliperidone was held and lorazepam was scheduled. In the subsequent days, multiple medication changes were made, including discontinuation of deutetrabenazine given concern for depression exacerbation. ECT was started due to continuation of catatonia symptoms despite scheduled lorazepam (BFRS fluctuating from 1 to 23). Following his first two treatments, he resumed oral intake, and his BFRS reduced to 0. By ECT #3, he was speaking fluently with improvement in his mood and suicidal ideation. Following an initial series of eight ECT, treatments were tapered with maintained improvement. Discussion: Our patient had complete resolution of his catatonia and remission of depression with a short course of ECT, experiencing profound improvement even two treatments into the course. Prior case reports indicated the need for longer ECT courses before resolution with the minimum being five treatments and the maximum being 42 (Mowafi and Millard, 2021). However, our patient has had sustained improvement in mood and catatonia symptoms allowing for minimization of polypharmacy. Implications: Given the neuropsychiatric burden in HD patients, it is important for C-L psychiatrists to be aware of ECT's efficacy for both depression and catatonia in this population.

"Creating an Effective Clinic Model for Post-COVID Mental Health Treatment","Background: The University of Colorado (UCH) Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry (CLP) service and Psychiatric Consultation for the Medically Complex clinic (PCMC) are developing a brain health outreach program for those hospitalized with COVID. Patients with COVID have increased risk of cognitive and psychiatric sequelae due to intrinsic viral properties, hyperinflammatory state, and increased disposition to ICU level care (Inoue, 2019;Cothran, 2020). Development of a post COVID brain health program has become paramount and UCH is not alone in creation of new clinic protocols to meet the needs of this population (Rovere Querini, 2020;O'Brien, 2020). Hospitals around the globe are developing new screeners to identify patients at higher risk of neuropsychiatric sequelae and refer them to appropriate resources. Methods: The program makes use of two arms: The first assesses those discharged from the hospital using a screener developed by the UCH post-COVID hospitalization program. The second screens patients currently admitted to the hospital with COVID using psychiatric and neurocognitive screeners. Both allow patients to be referred to PCMC for evaluation and treatment. Evaluation includes psychiatric interview and additional screeners including: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). Additional neuropsychiatric evaluation via Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS), and cognitive rehabilitation referral, are available. Clinic treatment includes pharmaceuticals, individual therapy referral, or referral to the PCMC COVID Survivorship Support Group. Results: To date, 100 patients have been screened in arm 1 (outpatient outreach) and arm 2 (inpatient outreach). In arm 2, about 54% of the population identifies as female, 46% as male, 61% identified as white, and 86% spoke English. Of those in arm 2 that agreed to full participation, 26% agreed to future check-ins and 6% were seen in the clinic. There was a difference in those who did and didn't fully participate based on ethnicity, language, and insurance status;though not of statistical significance. HADs scores demonstrated different trends based on these same demographic factors, though also not statistically significant. Discussion: By using this two-armed approach, the service has been able to more effectively outreach patients and refer them to appropriate care. Though data is not complete, referral needs seem to differ based on demographic data. Conclusions: As data continues to be collected, the clinic model is expanding to outreach high risk patients for neuropsychiatric sequelae. This will strengthen our existing system, with risk of reoccurrence of similar events, and inform a new standard of care for COVID survivors. 1. Cothran, T. P., Tam, J. W.;et.al. (2020).

"EDALoCo: Enhancing the accessibility of blockchains through a low-code approach to the development of event-driven applications for smart contract management","Blockchain is a cutting-edge technology based on a distributed, secure and immutable ledger that facilitates the registration of transactions and the traceability of tangible and intangible assets without requiring central governance. The agreements between the nodes participating in a blockchain network are defined through smart contracts. However, the compilation, deployment, interaction and monitoring of these smart contracts is a barrier compromising the accessibility of blockchains by non-expert developers. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a low-code approach, called EDALoCo, that facilitates the development of event-driven applications for smart contract management. These applications make blockchain more accessible for software developers who are non-experts in this technology as these can be modeled through graphical flows, which specify the communications between data producers, data processors and data consumers. Specifically, we have enhanced the open-source Node-RED low-code platform with blockchain technology, giving support for the creation of user-friendly and lightweight event-driven applications that can compile and deploy smart contracts in a particular blockchain. Additionally, this platform extension allows users to interact with and monitor the smart contracts already deployed in a blockchain network, hiding the implementation details from non-experts in blockchain. This approach was successfully applied to a case study of COVID-19 vaccines to monitor and obtain the temperatures to which these vaccines are continuously exposed, to process them and then to store them in a blockchain network with the aim of making them immutable and traceable to any user. As a conclusion, our approach enables the integration of blockchain with the low-code paradigm, simplifying the development of lightweight event-driven applications for smart contract management. The approach comprises a novel open-source solution that makes data security, immutability and traceability more accessible to software developers who are non-blockchain experts.","Rosa-Bilbao, JesÃºs, Boubeta-Puig, Juan, Rutle, Adrian","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csi.2022.103676","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Computer Standards & Interfaces;: 103676, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",35995,""

"Frontline nurses' burnout and its associated factors during the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea","Background The Coronavirus disease pandemic is a global health crisis with psychological consequences for healthcare workers. Purpose To identify the prevalence and potential factors influencing burnout among frontline nurses in South Korea. Methods This cross-sectional study comprised 161 nurses who voluntarily participated in the survey through advertisements at a general hospital. Data on sociodemographic and professional characteristics, insomnia, depression, anxiety, stress, and burnout were collected via an online questionnaire in 2021. Results Among the participants, 90 had a high level of burnout. Overall, 59.6Â %, 23.0Â %, 36.0Â %, and 17.4Â % of nurses experienced insomnia, depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively. The results showed that the assigned number of patients, insomnia, and depression were the major factors affecting burnout levels of nursing staff. Conclusions Frontline nurses were the main force in the fight against public health emergencies. The government and medical institutions must consider professional and psychological factors in ameliorating burnout and safety for nurses.","Noh, Eun-Young, Park, Yeon-Hwan, Chai, Young Jun, Kim, Hyun Jeong, Kim, Eunjin","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apnr.2022.151622","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Applied Nursing Research;: 151622, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",35997,""
"SY02-3 Expectations of home-based exercise research for enhancing cancer survivorship care","Exercise guidelines for cancer survivors issued by multiple international organizations (Campbell KL et al, 2019) updated the recommendations that aerobic, combined aerobic plus resistance training, and/or resistance training could improve common cancer-related health outcomes (eg, anxiety, depression, fatigue, physical function, and health-related quality of life). Despite these guidelines, the majority of cancer survivors are not regularly physically active. A lack of awareness regarding available effective program to help facilitate exercise in cancer survivors was suggested to be a one of barriers to clinicians referring them to exercise. Furthermore, given that the COVID-19 pandemic has made getting sufficient exercise difficult, there is an urgent need for developing a home-based exercise program and its effectiveness among cancer survivors. Systematic review revealed that high-intensity interval training (HIIT) is a time-efficient method for increasing cardiovascular function in breast cancer survivors (Tsuji K et al, 2021), while all previous HIIT studies were lab-based supervised intervention. Recently, we originally developed 12-week home-based smartphone-supported HIIT program (habit-B program) and examined its effect on cardiorespiratory fitness among breast cancer survivors in Japan. Our single-blind single-center randomized controlled trial involved 50 sedentary women with stage I-IIa breast cancer. The results showed that home-based HIIT intervention can lead to improve cardiorespiratory fitness and muscle strength (Ochi E et al, 2021). Based on the pilot study, we are proceeding a multi-center RCT in stage I-III breast cancer survivors. Mobile health such as habit-B might become a solution, but we need more collaboration and care coordination with appropriate professionals as well as change in the behaviors of clinicians, cancer survivors, and those who deliver the rehabilitation and exercise program.","Matsuoka, Y.; Tsuji, K.; Ochi, E.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2022.05.433","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Annals of Oncology; 33:S425, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",35998,""
"Changes in obesity and BMI among children and adolescents with selected chronic conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic","Objective To examine COVID-19 pandemic-related changes in obesity and BMI among patients aged 5-&lt;20?years with selected chronic conditions. Methods We conducted a longitudinal study in 293,341 patients aged 5-&lt;20y prescribed one of five medication classes (for depression, psychosis, hypertension, diabetes, epilepsy) and had BMI measures from January 2019 to March 2021. We used generalized estimating equations and linear mixed effects models, accounting for within-child repeated measures, and stratified by age, race, ethnicity, gender, and class of medication prescribed, to compare obesity and BMI-z during the pandemic (June-December 2020) vs. pre-pandemic (June-December 2019). Results Obesity prevalence increased from 23.8% pre-pandemic to 25.5% during the pandemic;mean (SD) BMI-z increased from 0.62(1.26) to 0.65(1.29). Obesity prevalence during the pandemic increased at a faster rate compared with pre-pandemic among children aged 5-&lt;13y (0.27%/month;95%CI 0.11%, 0.44%) and 13-&lt;18y (0.24%/month;95%CI 0.09%, 0.40%), with the largest increases among children aged 5-&lt;13y who were male (0.42%/month), Black (0.35%/month), Hispanic (0.59%/month), or who were prescribed anti-hypertensives (0.28%/month). Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the obesity epidemic and widened disparities among children with selected chronic conditions. Our findings highlight the importance of continuing efforts to specifically help high-risk populations who are experiencing weight gain from the pandemic. This article is protected by copyright.

The effect of stress caused by lockdown and pandemic may exacerbate existing symptoms of temporomandibular disorders (TMD), painful masticatory system disorders. This study's aim was to investigate the somatic and psychological effects a two-year pandemic might have on individuals diagnosed with TMD. Materials and methods: A total of 186 TMD patients were contacted through email to take part in an online survey. The survey, created using Google forms, comprised of 20 questions on the long-term impact of the pandemic on present and/or new TMD-related symptoms, oral behavioral habits, other bodily pains, anxiety, depression and temporomandibular pain severity. Statistics included chi-square test and Spearman's correlation. Results: The response rate was 63.98%;57.98% of individuals were infected with COVID-19, and 73.94% said they had been vaccinated at least once. In a two-year period, 40.33% participants developed new TMD-related symptoms or their symptoms deteriorated. New symptoms (headache, difficulty while opening, other bodily pains, depressive symptoms) correlated with temporomandibular joint discomfort, while new symptoms (headaches, grinding, insomnia) correlated with masticatory muscle discomfort (p&lt;0.05). There was no difference in the number of patients who developed new symptoms or developed deterioration of existing symptoms between those who had been infected with COVD-19 or had been vaccinated and those who hadn't been infected with COVID-19 or hadn't been vaccinated. (p&gt;0.05). Patients experiencing anxiety more often reported other bodily pains (p=0.005) and headaches (p=0.002). Other bodily pains were more common in those experiencing depressive symptoms (p&lt;0.001). Conclusion: Majority of somatic difficulties that emerged throughout pandemic, such as orofacial pain, might be attributed to a psychological response to stress rather than to COVID-19 infection or vaccination.","Vrbanovic, E.; Alajbeg, I.

"Moral injury in healthcare workers","Moral injury, known from military medicine, is getting more attention also in the context of healthcare provision related to COVID-19 pandemic. Moral injury represents an intense cognitive and emotional response to events that jeopardize one's moral or ethical beliefs. Healthcare professionals had to quickly learn how to provide care to an enormous amount of patients, making compromising decision, often giving up their professionals standards and preferring what had to be done instead of what should be done. The aim of this review is to map out the psychological impact of potentially morally injurious events in the context of current pandemic, describe specific risks related to ethical distress and to suggest effective strategies to mitigate the impact of moral injury on healthcare professionals' mental health.","Motlova, L.

"ANALYSIS OF CONTRIBUTION TO ECONOMIC REACTIVATION POT-COVID-19 OF THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR IN THE PROVINCE OF CHIMBORAZO, ECUADOR","With the rapid global expansion of COVID-19, the consequences on the economy have been catastrophic: a sharp drop in production, company bankruptcies, job losses and reduced household income, placing households in a situation of risk and uncertainty, both in terms of health and food. The adoption of policies to mitigate these problems is urgent. In this scenario, within the context of Ecuador. The main objective of this article was to propose the promotion of agrifood activities, with special emphasis on social economy organizations and in the province of Chimborazo, as a basis for the reactivation of the post-COVID-19 economy in Ecuador. An observational, retrospective, cross-sectional and descriptive study was carried out. Theoretical methods used were Analytical-Synthetic;Inductive-Deductive;Historical-Logical;and systemic approach. Documentary analysis was used as methods of the empirical level of knowledge. It is evident that the Ecuadorian economy has been slowly reactivated after the pandemic, and has done so at different rates if we compare what happened in the public sector with the private sector. It also shows that the agricultural sector played an important role in the case of the province of Chimborazo. The performance of the cooperatives and particularly the CACs during the COVID-19 pandemic, while remaining active, turned them into dynamizing agents of the Ecuadorian economy, which was depressed during the past months, as evidenced in the agricultural sector in the province of Chimborazo.","Guanolema, B.

"Prevalence and factors associated with not receiving the booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine in adults in Latin America and the Caribbean","Booster doses have been described as effective in reducing hospitalizations and deaths from the new variants. However, its coverage is heterogeneous in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), one of the regions most affected by the pandemic. We aimed to assess the factors associated with not receiving a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine booster dose in adults from LAC. We analyzed a secondary database compiled by the University of Maryland and Facebook assessing the global impact of COVID-19. We included Facebook users over 18 years of age who resided in LAC and responded to the survey between February 13, 2022, and March 14, 2022. We evaluated sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidities, food, and economic insecurity, mental health, and vaccination-related practices. We calculated crude (cPR) and adjusted (aPR) prevalence ratios with their respective 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). The sample included 154,841 adults from 20 LAC countries. 33.7% (nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯46,459) reported not receiving the COVID-19 booster vaccine. Being under 75 years old, having a college, high school, pre-university, primary, or lower education, having no or 1 to 2 comorbidities, living in a town, having food insecurity, depressive symptoms, and having had COVID-19, were associated with a higher prevalence of not receiving the booster dose. In contrast, being female or non-binary and having anxiety symptoms were associated with a lower prevalence of not receiving the booster dose. Approximately three out of 10 adults surveyed in LAC reported not having received the booster vaccine. Authorities must design campaigns that promote receiving a booster dose considering the factors found.","Urrunaga-Pastor, Fernandez-Guzman, Caira-Chuquineyra, Herrera-AÃƒÂ±azco, Benites-Zapata, Bendezu-Quispe","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2022.102409","20220812","COVID-19; COVID-19 vaccine booster shot; COVID-19 vaccines; Latin America (source: MeSH); SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination refusal","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",36006,""
"A novel procedure to investigate social anxiety using videoconferencing software: A proof-of-concept study","Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is very common and can be significantly disabling. New treatments are needed as the remission rate for SAD is the lowest of all the anxiety disorders. Experimental medicine models, in which features resembling a clinical disorder are experimentally induced, are a cost-effective and timely approach to explore potential novel treatments for psychiatric disorders. Following the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, there is a need to develop experimental medicine models that can be carried out remotely. We developed a novel procedure to investigate SAD (the InterneT-based Stress test for Social Anxiety Disorder; ITSSAD) that can be carried out entirely online by a single investigator, potentially reducing costs and maximising internal reliability. The procedure involves an anticipatory period followed by a naturalistic social interaction task. In a sample of 20 non-treatment-seeking volunteers with symptoms of SAD, the ITSSAD induced significant subjective anxiety and reduced positive affect. Further, increased social anxiety symptoms at baseline predicted increased anxiety during the social interaction task. This protocol needs further validation with physiological measures. The ITSSAD is a new tool for researchers to investigate mechanisms underlying social anxiety disorder.","Huneke, Rowlatt, Hyde, McEwan, Maryan, Baldwin, Garner","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2022.114770","20220812","Anxiety disorders; Experimental methods; Mental health; Social anxiety; Social anxiety disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",36007,""
"Prioritizing Mental Health in Residency","Residency is both physically and mentally taxing. Although some tout these struggles as a rite of passage to practice medicine, rates of physician burnout and suicide unfortunately remain higher than the general population. Limitations on work hours, mandatory reporting of work hour violations, and resident wellness programs have aimed to improve these statistics, but the time constraints and physical demands of residency offer little room for trainees to focus on their mental health. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic tested an already strained health care system, bringing to light the prevalence of depression and anxiety among residents. This article explores this prevalence and highlights several modalities available to residents who are seeking to prioritize their mental health.","Lim","https://doi.org/10.12788/cutis.0551","20220812","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",36008,""
"Subjective COVID-19-related work factors predict stress, burnout, and depression among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic but not objective factors","Work-related stress is significantly higher among healthcare workers (HCWs) than in the general population. Elevated occupational stress has been linked to burnout syndrome and depression. Moreover, medical professionals working during infectious disease outbreaks are at especially high risk for these problems. The aim of the present study was to examine the mental health status of HCWs and possible predictors of mental health status related to the COVID-19 outbreak utilizing a complex comprehensive model. In a countrywide cross-sectional survey among HCWs (N = 2087), work-related stress, COVID-19 -related objective work factors (displacement, frontline working) and subjective work factors (insecurity, unpredictability, workload), perceived stress, work-related stress, burnout and depression were assessed between the second and third wave of COVID-19 pandemic in Hungary. COVID-19-related objective factors did not predict directly stress, burnout, and depression, whereas feelings of insecurity and unpredictability in relation to the COVID-19 situation at work had a significant medium-sized total effect (also considering the indirect effect via stress) on burnout and depression. In order to prevent subsequent mental health problems during crisis situations, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare management should create a more predictable work environment and a safer work experience for healthcare workers and provide mental health support.","SpÃƒÂ¡nyik, Simon, RigÃƒÂ³, Griffiths, Demetrovics","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0270156","20220812","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",36009,""
"The prevalence of self-reported anxiety, depression, and associated factors among Hanoi Medical University's students during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic","Medical students are known to have higher levels of these issues than the general population but in Vietnam the effects of the pandemic on medical student mental health was not documented. To estimate the prevalence and identify factors associated with self-reported anxiety disorder, depression, and perception of worsening mental health among Vietnamese medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional study was conducted from April 7th to 29th, 2020. All students in Doctor of General Medicine, Doctor of Preventive Medicine, and Bachelor of Nursing tracks at Hanoi Medical University (3672 students) were invited to participate. Data were collected using an online questionnaire including demographic characteristics, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 items, Patient Health Questionnaire 9 items, Fear of COVID-19 scale, and question about worsening mental health status. Robust Poisson regression was used to assess the association between mental health status and associated factors. Among 1583 students (43.1% response rate), the prevalence of students screened positive for anxiety disorder was 7.3%(95%C.I.:6.0-8.7), depression was 14.5%(95%C.I.:12.8-16.3), and perceiving worsening mental health was 6.9%(95%C.I.:5.7-8.3). In multivariable regression models, significant factors associated with self-reported anxiety disorder included being male (PR = 1.99,95%C.I.:1.35-2.92), difficulty in paying for healthcare services (PR = 2.05,95%C.I.:1.39-3.01), and high level of fear of COVID-19 (Q3:PR = 2.36,95%C.I.:1.38-4.02 and Q4:PR = 4.75,95%C.I.:2.65-8.49). Significant factors associated with self-reported depression were difficulty in paying for healthcare services (PR = 1.78,95%C.I.:1.37-2.30), and high level of fear of COVID-19 (Q3:PR = 1.41,95%C.I.:1.02-1.95 and Q4:PR = 2.23,95%C.I.:1.51-3.29). Significant factors associated with perceived worsening mental health status included having clinical experience (PR = 1.83,95%C.I.:1.17-2.88) and having atypical symptoms of COVID-19 (PR = 1.96,95%C.I.:1.31-2.94). The prevalence of self-reported depression, anxiety disorder, and worsening mental health among Vietnamese students during the first wave of COVID-19 was lower than in medical students in other countries.

"Evaluation of reach, usability and user perceptions of a Canadian COVID-19 website: An e-mental health strategy aimed at reducing pandemic associated stress among the general population","COVID 19 and its public health response are having a profound effect on people's mental health. To provide supports during these times Canada's largest mental health and addiction teaching hospital (CAMH) launched the Mental Health and the COVID-19 Pandemic website on March 18, 2020. This website was designed to be a non-stigmatizing psycho-educational resource for people experiencing mild to moderate distress due to COVID-19 and the public health response to the pandemic. The aim of this study was to examine the reach, usability and user perceptions of the CAMH Mental Health and COVID-19 Pandemic website. This study utilized a mix-method sequential explanatory design approach, which consisted of two distinct phases: 1) quantitative data collection and analysis followed by, 2) qualitative semi structured interviews. In phase 1, we analyzed google analytics data to understand how many people visited the website, and which were the most visited pages. We conducted a survey to identify users' socio-demographic background, and assess the usability of the website using the System Usability Scale (SUS) tool, and users subjective stress levels using the perceived stress scale (PSS-10). For phase 2, we conducted semi-structured interviews to explore user experiences, their motivation, engagement, satisfaction and perception of the stress reduction strategies, and reflections of the website's functionality, ease of use, navigation, design, and recommendations for improvement. Google analytic results showed 146,978 unique users from June 2020 to March 2021. Most users were from Canada (88.5 %). Between February 20, 2021 and June 4, 2021, 152 users completed the survey. Most users identified as white, female, and having at least a college degree. Based on the PSS-10 scores, most participants were experiencing moderate to high stress when they visited the website. Users rated the usability of the website as acceptable. Ten users completed in-depth interviews between May 2021 and June 2021. Positive feedback related to the content was that the website was a trustworthy source of mental health information with helpful evidence-based stress reduction strategies. Areas for improvement included the text heavy design of the website, wider dissemination/marketing, and greater accessibility of the website to meet the needs of diverse populations. Adding stress reduction resources in a website from a well-respected institution may be a practical method to increase awareness and access to evidence-based stress reduction resources during times of crisis where there is severe disruption to usual health care contacts. Efforts to ensure that these resources are more widely accessed especially by diverse populations are needed.","Minian, Gayapersad, Saiva, Dragonetti, Kidd, Strudwick, Selby","https://doi.org/10.2196/39885","20220812","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",36011,""
"A mixed-methods evaluation of Inuka, a Friendship Bench digital mental health intervention in the treatment of common mental health disorders in Zimbabwean adults in response to the COVID-19 pandemic: a feasibility and acceptability pilot study","Common mental health disorders (CMDs) are a leading cause of disability globally. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated the burden of CMDs. COVID-19 containment measures, including lockdowns, have disrupted access to in-person mental healthcare. It is therefore imperative to explore digital mental health interventions' utility to bridge the treatment gap. Mobile health (mHealth) technologies are effective tools for increasing access to treatment at a lower cost. This study explores the utility of Inuka, a chat-based application (app) hinged on the Friendship Bench problem-solving therapy intervention. The Inuka app offers double anonymity, and clients can book and/or cancel a session at their convenience. Inuka services can be accessed either through a mobile app or the web. To explore the feasibility of conducting a future clinical trial. Additionally, we evaluated the feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness, scalability, and preliminary effectiveness of Inuka. Data were collected using concurrent mixed methods. We used a pragmatic quasi-experimental design to compare the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary clinical effectiveness of Inuka (experimental group) compared to WhatsApp chat-based counselling (control intervention). Participants received six problem-solving therapy sessions delivered by lay counsellors. A reduction in CMDs was the primary clinical outcome. The secondary outcomes were health-related quality of life (HRQoL), disability and functioning, and social support. Quantitative outcomes were analyzed using descriptive and bivariate statistics. Last, we used administrative data and semi-structured interviews to gather data on acceptability and feasibility; this was analyzed using thematic analysis. Altogether, 258 participants were screened over six months, with 202 assessed for eligibility. 176 participants were assigned to the study giving a recruitment ratio of 29 participants/month. The participants' mean age was 24.4 (SD 5.3) years, and most participants were female (65.8%), had tertiary education (55.3%), with a mean daily smartphone usage of 8 hours (SD 3.5). Eighty-three (83) users signed up and completed at least one session. The average completion rate was three out of four sessions. Inuka was deemed feasible and acceptable in the local context, with connectivity challenges, app instability, expensive mobile data and power outages cited as potential barriers to scale-up. Generally, there was a decline in CMDs (F (2,73) =2.63; P=0.079), depression (F (2,73) =7.67; p&lt; .001), anxiety (F (2,73) =2.95; P=0.059) and a corresponding increase in HRQoL (F (2, 73) =7.287; P&lt;. 001) in both groups. Study outcomes show it is feasible to run a future large-scale RCT and lend support to the feasibility and acceptability of Inuka, including evidence of preliminary effectiveness. The app's double anonymity and structured support were the most salient features. There is a great need for iterative app updates before scaling up. Last, a large-scale hybrid RCT with a longer follow-up to evaluate the clinical, implementation and cost-effectiveness is needed.

"The 'welcomed lockdown' hypothesis? Mental wellbeing and mobility restrictions","The COVID-19 pandemic and its mobility restrictions have been an external shock, influencing mentalÃ‚Â wellbeing. However, does risk exposure to COVID-19Ã‚Â affect the mental wellbeing effect of lockdowns? This paper examines the 'welcomed lockdown' hypothesis, namely the extent to which there is a level of risk where mobility restrictions are not a hindrance to mentalÃ‚Â wellbeing. We exploit the differential timing of exposureÃ‚Â the pandemic, and the different stringency of lockdown policies across European countriesÃ‚Â and we focus onÃ‚Â the effects on two mental health conditions, namely anxiety and depression. We studyÃ‚Â whether differences in the individualÃ‚Â symptoms of anxiety and depression are explained by the combination ofÃ‚Â pandemicÃ‚Â mortality and stringency of lockdown. We draw on an event study approach, complemented withÃ‚Â a Difference-in-Difference (DiD), and Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD). Our estimates suggest an average increase in depression (3.95%) and anxiety (10%) symptoms relative to the mean level on the day that lockdown took effect. However, such effects are wiped out when a country's exhibits high mortality ('pandemic category 5'). Hence, we conclude that in an environment of high mortality, lockdowns no longer give rise to a reduction in mentalÃ‚Â wellbeing consistent with the 'welcome lockdown' hypothesis.","Costa-Font, Knapp, Vilaplana-Prieto","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10198-022-01490-6","20220812","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Lockdown; Pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",36013,""

Social support is an important determinant of physical and psychological well-being, especially during pregnancy when individuals take on new responsibilities and roles.<b>What do the results of this study add?</b> The study showed that pregnant women were deprived of social support and their anxiety levels increased during this pandemic. The results highlight that there is a high need to mitigate mental health risks and adjust interventions under pandemic conditions.<b>What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research?</b> It is necessary to provide social support from family, friends, and close circles. States and health professionals need to put forward serious programs and studies to reduce the stress and anxiety experienced by the society and especially pregnant women and to provide accurate information about COVID-19.","Erin, Baki Erin, KulaksÃ„Â±z, BayoÃ„Å¸lu Tekin","https://doi.org/10.1080/01443615.2022.2109410","20220812","COVID-19; Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support; State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; pregnancy; psychosocial outcomes","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",36015,""
"Recent research advances in identification and prevention of youth suicide risk","The rate of youth suicidal behaviors has gradually increased over the last 15 years and continues to grow during the COVID-19 pandemic. This trend burdens mental health services and demands significant developments in risk detection and delivery of interventions to reduce the risk. In this article we outline significant advances and recent findings in youth suicide research that may facilitate strategies for identifying and preventing suicide risk among youth at risk in general and in specific risk groups. The rise in suicide and suicidal behaviors is most likely to affect young people of racial, ethnic, sexual, and gender identity minorities and those living in poverty or experiencing maltreatment. The suicide rate in children is rising and demands special attention. Proximal risk factors for suicidal behavior compared with suicidal ideation have been suggested to identify near-term suicidal risk. Effective and scalable prevention strategies were identified, and the role of new technologies in suicide prevention among youth is to be determined. To reach broader suicide prevention in youth and reduce the pressure on mental healthcare, public health approaches and improved service access for minority youth and those living in underserved areas of the world are needed.","Barzilay, Apter","https://doi.org/10.1097/YCO.0000000000000816","20220812","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",36016,""
"Associations between early-life stress exposure and internalizing symptomatology during the COVID-19 pandemic: Assessing the role of neurobehavioral mediators","The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is a major stressor that has been associated with increased risk for psychiatric illness in the general population. Recent work has highlighted that experiences of early-life stress (ELS) may impact individuals' psychological functioning and vulnerability for developing internalizing psychopathology in response to pandemic-related stress. However, little is known about the neurobehavioral factors that may mediate the association between ELS exposure and COVID-related internalizing symptomatology. The current study sought to examine the mediating roles of pre-pandemic resting-state frontoamygdala connectivity and concurrent emotion regulation (ER) in the association between ELS and pandemic-related internalizing symptomatology. Retrospective life-stress histories, concurrent self-reported ER strategies (i.e., reappraisal and suppression), concurrent self-reported internalizing symptomatology (i.e., depression- and anxiety-related symptomatology), and resting-state functional connectivity data from a sample of adults (<i>N</i> = 64, <i>M</i> <sub>age</sub> = 22.12, female = 68.75%) were utilized. There were no significant direct associations between ELS and COVID-related internalizing symptomatology. Neither frontoamygdala functional connectivity nor ER strategy use mediated an association between ELS and COVID-related internalizing symptomatology (<i>p</i>s &gt; 0.05). Exploratory analyses identified a significant moderating effect of reappraisal use on the association between ELS and internalizing symptomatology (ÃŽÂ² = -0.818, <i>p</i> = 0.047), such that increased reappraisal use buffered the impact of ELS on psychopathology. While frontoamygdala connectivity and ER do not appear to mediate the association between ELS and COVID-related internalizing symptomatology, our findings suggest that the use of reappraisal may buffer against the effect of ELS on mental health during the pandemic.","Foster, Cohodes, Brieant, McCauley, Odriozola, Zacharek, Pierre, Hodges, Kribakaran, Haberman, Holt-Gosselin, Gee","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsgos.2022.07.006","20220812","COVID-19 pandemic; early-life stress; emotion regulation; frontoamygdala circuitry; internalizing psychopathology; resting-state functional connectivity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",36017,""
"Network Analysis of Comorbid Anxiety and Insomnia Among Clinicians with Depressive Symptoms During the Late Stage of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study","A high proportion of clinicians experienced common anxiety, insomnia and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study examined the item-level association of comorbid anxiety and insomnia symptoms among clinicians who suffered from depressive symptoms during the late stage of the COVID-19 pandemic using network analysis (NA). Clinicians with depressive symptoms (with a Patients Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) total score of 5 and above) were included in this study. Anxiety and insomnia symptoms were measured using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale - 7-item (GAD-7) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), respectively. Network analysis was conducted to investigate the network structure, central symptoms, bridge symptoms, and network stability of these disturbances. Expected influence (EI) was used to measure the centrality of index. Altogether, 1729 clinicians were included in this study. The mean age was 37.1 [standard deviation (SD)=8.04 years], while the mean PHQ-9 total score was 8.42 (SD=3.33), mean GAD-7 total score was 6.45 (SD=3.13) and mean ISI total score was 8.23 (SD=5.26). Of these clinicians, the prevalence of comorbid anxiety symptoms (GAD-7Ã¢â€°Â¥5) was 76.8% (95% CI 74.82-78.80%), while the prevalence of comorbid insomnia symptoms (ISIÃ¢â€°Â¥8) was 43.8% (95% CI: 41.50-46.18%). NA revealed that nodes ISI7 (""Interference with daytime functioning"") (EI=1.18), ISI4 (""Sleep dissatisfaction"") (EI=1.08) and ISI5 (""Noticeability of sleep problem by others"") (EI=1.07) were the most central (influential) symptoms in the network model of comorbid anxiety and insomnia symptoms in clinicians. Bridge symptoms included nodes PHQ3 (""Sleep"") (bridge EI=0.55) and PHQ4 (""Fatigue"") (bridge EI=0.49). Gender did not significantly influence the network structure, but ""having the experience of caring for COVID-19 patients"" significantly influenced the network structure. Central symptoms and key bridge symptoms identified in this NA should be targeted in the treatment and preventive measures for clinicians suffering from comorbid anxiety, insomnia and depressive symptoms during the late stage of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Cai, Zhao, Xing, Tian, Qian, Liang, Wang, Cheung, Su, Tang, Ng, Sha, Xiang","https://doi.org/10.2147/NSS.S367974","20220812","anxiety; depression; health personnel; network analysis; sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",36018,""
"[Mental health during the Covid pandemic, a narrative review]","The COVID-19 pandemic (caused by the Sars-CoV-2 coronavirus) led to unprecedented challenges to public health, the healthcare system, and our daily lives (including work and education), particularly during the first wave in early 2020. In order to control infection of the virus, many countries have imposed restrictive measures to promote social distancing, ranging from curfews and school closures to widespread lockdown. At the beginning of 2022, there were 135,000 deaths from Sars-CoV-2 in France (nearly 6 million worldwide). Beyond the possible impact of Sars-CoV-2 on the brain, the pandemic has created complex human situations, with a possible impact on the mental health of populations. In this narrative review, we summarize current data on the impact of the pandemic on mental health in the general population and identify the most vulnerable groups. The goal is to provide more targeted prevention for these populations. Our review has identified several subgroups of subjects at higher risk of disorder in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic: those bereaved by COVID-19, adolescents, students, people with COVID (with potentially direct brain damages), and finally, health care workers. Gender disparities were accentuated, leading to more mental disorders in women. Longitudinal follow-up studies are needed to better identify the effects of the pandemic on the mental health of different populations, and also to define personalized prevention strategies. Screening and prevention measures must be taken to limit the impact of this pandemic on mental health. More generally, the ""one health"" approach, which places human health at the interface of environmental and animal health, seems essential to avoid the occurrence of this type of pandemic and its consequences in the future.","Mallet, Massini, Dubreucq, Padovani, Fond, Guessoum","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2022.07.019","20220812","Anxiety; Covid-19; Depression; Epidemiology; Grief; Mental Health; Sleep disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",36019,""
"The Efficacy of Hospice Care for Terminally Ill Emergency Patients During the Coronavirus 2019 Pandemic","This study aimed to explore the efficacy of hospice care for terminally ill emergency patients in the COVID-19 context. A total of 86 terminally ill emergency patients at the authors' hospital from February 2020 to October 2020 were included in this study, they were randomly allocated into a control (n = 42) and an intervention (n = 44) group, respectively. The control group received routine nursing care, and the intervention group received hospice care. Following treatment, the survival time (as the primary outcome) in the intervention group was longer than in the control group (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Distress thermometer and psychological pain-related factor scores for the intervention group were lower than those of the control group (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001 for both). The comfort scores of all dimensions in the intervention group were higher than in the control group (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). The scores for survival puzzle, symptom distress, independence, and mental well-being in all dimensions related to a sense of dignity were lower in the intervention than in the control group (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05 for all). The intervention group's yield, avoidance, and total scores were lower than in the control group, whereas the face score was higher than in the control group (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05 for all). In the current COVID-19 context, the telehealth (psychological, physical, online remote support, critical illness communication, and death education) approach adopted by the Anning care team for terminally ill emergency patients and other aspects of peace care could help improve the physical and mental health of patients. Hospice care can minimise the physical and psychological pain of terminally ill patients in the emergency department and assist them in their final stage of life by providing a calming and comfortable environment.","Wang, Han, Yue","https://doi.org/10.2147/JMDH.S371915","20220812","COVID-19; comfort; deathbed; emergency department; hospice care; mental state","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",36020,""
"A Survey on Depressive Symptoms and Its Correlates Amongst Physicians in Bangladesh During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The aim of this study was to determine the presence of depressive symptoms and understand the potential factors associated with these symptoms among physicians in Bangladesh during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional study using an online survey was conducted in between April 21 and May 10, 2020, among physicians living in Bangladesh. Participants completed a series of demographic questions, COVID-19-related questions, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Descriptive statistics (frequency, percentage, mean and standard deviation), test statistics (chi-squared test and logistic regression) were performed to explore the association between physicians' experience of depression symptoms and other study variables. Stepwise binary logistic regression was followed while conducting the multivariable analysis. A total of 390 physicians completed the survey. Of them, 283 (72.6%) were found to be experiencing depressive symptoms. Predictors which were significantly associated with depressive symptoms were gender (with females more likely to experience depression than males), the presence of sleep disturbance, being highly exposed to media coverage about the pandemic, and fear around (a) COVID-19 infection, (b) being assaulted/humiliated by regulatory forces and (c) by the general public, while traveling to and from the hospital and treating patients during the countrywide lockdown. The findings of this study demonstrate that there is a high prevalence of depressive symptom among physicians especially among female physicians in Bangladesh during the COVID-19 pandemic. Immediate, adequate and effective interventions addressing gender specific needs are required amid this ongoing crisis and beyond.","Hasan, Anjum, Biswas, Hossain, Alin, Koly, Safa, Alam, Rafi, Podder, Hossain, Trisa, Azad, Nodi, Ashraf, Akther, Ahmed, McNaney","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.846889","20220812","Bangladesh; COVID-19; PHQ-9; depression symptoms; physicians","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",36021,""

"The interplay of Criterion A of the Alternative Model for Personality Disorders, mentalization and resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has been accompanied by a worsening of mental health levels in some, while others manage to adapt or recover relatively quickly. Transdiagnostic factors such as personality functioning are thought to be involved in determining mental health outcomes. The present study focused on two constructs of personality functioning, Criterion A of the Alternative Model for Personality Disorders (AMPD, DSM-5) and mentalization, as predictors of depressive symptoms and life satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic. A second focus of the study was to examine whether this relationship was mediated by resilience. Linear regression analyses were used to examine the relationship between personality functioning measured by Criterion A (AMPD, DSM-5) and mentalizing abilities as predictors, and depression and life satisfaction as mental health outcomes. To assess the hypothesis that this relationship is mediated by resilience a structural equation modeling approach was conducted. Data from <i>N</i> = 316 individuals from the general population were collected. Linear regression models revealed highly significant associations between Criterion A/mentalization and both outcome measures. Structural equation models showed a significant partial mediation by resilience of these relationships. Our results support the hypothesis that mentalizing serves as a protective function by promoting resilience to the impact of stress and threats. Criterion A and mentalization performed similarly as predictors of mental health outcomes, providing empirically overlapping operationalizations of personality functioning. This finding emphasizes the importance of personality functioning in positive and negative mental health outcomes. Furthermore, our results are consistent with a mediating role of resilience.","Maerz, Buchheim, Rabl, Riedl, Viviani, Labek","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.928540","20220812","COVID-19; Criterion A; depression; life satisfaction; mental health; mentalization; personality functioning; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",36023,""
"Adverse events following immunization and psychological distress among cancer patients/survivors following vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 infection","This study aims to describe the adverse events following immunization (AEFIs) of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in cancer patients/survivors associated with their psychological distress. A cross-sectional study was conducted to assess AEFIs after the receipt of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in cancer patients/survivors attending a university hospital in Malaysia. Psychological distress was measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) before and after the first and second doses of COVID-19 vaccine. A total of 217 complete responses were received. Compared with before vaccination, both HADS Anxiety (HADS-A) and HADS Depression (HADS-D) scores were significantly reduced after the first and second dose of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Most of the participants had mild-or-moderate systemic and local AEFIs, with the most common being pain at the injection site, tiredness, and headache for both the first and second doses of the vaccine. Positive correlations between the total AEFI score and HADS-A (<i>r</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.309, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and HADS-D (<i>r</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.214, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) scores were observed after the first dose of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.

"Partial Social Integration as a Predictor of COVID-19 Vaccine Rejection and Distress Indicators","Partial social integration refers to the perceived exclusion of individuals or groups, from full participation in their society. The current study claims that perceived partial social integration (PPSI) constitutes a substantial predictor of the rejection of the COVID-19 vaccine, a significant mediator of the impact of demographic variables (such as age and level of income) on this vaccine rejection, and an important predictor of indices of psychological distress during pandemic times. Previous publications show that although vaccines constitute a very efficient means for countering pandemics, vaccine hesitancy is a prevalent public response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study is one of a few studies examining the impact of psychological variables on the actual behavior of vaccine rejection rather than on the cognitive element of vaccine hesitancy. A sample of 600 Israeli Jewish adults responded in February 2022 to an anonymous questionnaire exploring, among other issues, the (PPSI), the individual level of vaccine uptake, and the level of distress of these individuals. Path analyses of the variables predicted by PPSI indicated the following results: (a) PPSI score negatively predicted vaccine uptake level and significantly mediated the effects of age and family income on the level of vaccination. (b) PPSI levels significantly predicted higher levels of anxiety, depression, and a sense of danger and negatively predicted societal resilience. The discussion elaborates the contention that the PPSI is a substantial cause of psychological distress and in compliance with the pandemic vaccination guidelines, despite the potential health risk involved.","Eshel, Kimhi, Marciano, Adini","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.900070","20220812","distress symptoms; partial social integration; sense of danger; societal resilience; vaccine rejection","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",36026,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the prevalence and risk factors of workplace violence among healthcare workers in China","The pandemic of COVID-19 has significantly increased the burden on healthcare workers and potentially affect their risk of workplace violence (WPV). This study aimed to explore the prevalence and risk factors of WPV among healthcare workers during the peaking and the remission of the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Using the snowball method, a repeated online questionnaire survey was conducted among Chinese healthcare workers from March 27th to April 26th in 2020 and 2021, respectively. Data included healthcare workers' socio-demographic and occupational characteristics, psychological status, and workplace violence. A total of 3006 samples in 2020 and 3465 samples in 2021 were analyzed. In 2020, the prevalence of WPV and witnessing colleagues suffering from WPV among healthcare workers were 64.2% and 79.7% respectively. Compared with 2020, the prevalence decreased by 11.0% and 14.4% in 2021, respectively. Logistic regression showed that WPV in 2020 was influenced by males, long working experience, working in the psychiatric department, direct contact with COVID-19 patients, self-discovery of medical errors, moral injury, depression, and anxiety (minimum OR = 1.22, maximum OR = 2.82). While risk factors of WPV in 2021 included males, working in psychiatric departments, self-discovery of medical errors, moral injury, depression, and anxiety (minimum OR = 1.33, maximum OR = 3.32); and protective factors were holding a master's degree (OR = 0.78) and working in other departments (OR = 0.54). This study retains the common effects of WPV among healthcare workers, though after the baptism of the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of WPV among healthcare workers decreased; however, part of the influencing factors changed. In addition, COVID-19 has seriously affected the mental health of healthcare workers, and the effect of mental health problems on WPV should also attract more attention.","Qi, Hu, Liu, Wen, Hu, Wang, Shi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.938423","20220812","COVID-19; China; healthcare workers; prevalence; risk factors; workplace violence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",36027,""
"Mental Health Research During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Focuses and Trends","The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly influenced the world. In wave after wave, many countries suffered from the pandemic, which caused social instability, hindered global growth, and harmed mental health. Although research has been published on various mental health issues during the pandemic, some profound effects on mental health are difficult to observe and study thoroughly in the short term. The impact of the pandemic on mental health is still at a nascent stage of research. Based on the existing literature, we used bibliometric tools to conduct an overall analysis of mental health research during the COVID-19 pandemic. Researchers from universities, hospitals, communities, and medical institutions around the world used questionnaire surveys, telephone-based surveys, online surveys, cross-sectional surveys, systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and systematic umbrella reviews as their research methods. Papers from the three academic databases, Web of Science (WOS), ProQuest Academic Database (ProQuest), and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), were included. Their previous research results were systematically collected, sorted, and translated and CiteSpace 5.1 and VOSviewers 1.6.13 were used to conduct a bibliometric analysis of them. Authors with papers in this field are generally from the USA, the People's Republic of China, the UK, South Korea, Singapore, and Australia. Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, and Shanghai Jiao Tong University are the top three institutions in terms of the production of research papers on the subject. The University of Toronto, Columbia University, and the University of Melbourne played an important role in the research of mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. The numbers of related research papers in the USA and China are significantly larger than those in the other countries, while co-occurrence centrality indexes in Germany, Italy, England, and Canada may be higher. We found that the most mentioned keywords in the study of mental health research during the COVID-19 pandemic can be divided into three categories: keywords that represent specific groups of people, that describe influences and symptoms, and that are related to public health policies. The most-cited issues were about medical staff, isolation, psychological symptoms, telehealth, social media, and loneliness. Protection of the youth and health workers and telemedicine research are expected to gain importance in the future.","Liang, Sun, Tan","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.895121","20220812","COVID-19; bibliometric analysis; focuses; keyword clustering; mental health; trends","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",36028,""
"Factors associated with the perception of inadequate sanitary control in 12 Latin American countries during the COVID-19 pandemic","Sanitary control mechanisms differ greatly from country to country. Therefore, it is important to know citizens' perception of different realities. We aimed to determine the factors associated with the perception of inadequate sanitary control in 12 Latin American countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is an analytical cross-sectional study. We asked about six perceptions in regard to different situations experienced by inhabitants of 12 Latin American countries during the pandemic. Frequencies according to country were described and associations vs. other important variables were obtained. Out of 8,489 participants, 68% stated that there were moments of collective hysteria. Honduras was the country that most perceived inadequate control mechanisms established by the government. Multivariate analysis showed that there were statistically significant differences among many of the countries according to the six evaluated items. The higher the level of education, the greater the perception of poor control in five of the aspects. Additionally, men had a lower perception of inadequate control. The older the age, the lower the perception of inadequate control regarding whether there was collective hysteria and shortages of basic essentials. Those with COVID-19 had a lower perception of medicine shortages. The population of multiple realities in Latin America have perceived a bad management of the pandemic. Citizens' perception is an important indicator of the performance of each government during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study may provide valuable information on the relationship between the effectiveness of government sanitary control and people's mental health, which ultimately helps to create objective prevention programs against post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, fear of contagion, and collective hysteria. In addition, governments could use this information to design effective mitigation plans for future unavoidable pandemic events based on the six criteria discussed here.","Mejia, Liendo-Venegas, GarcÃƒÂ­a-Gamboa, MejÃƒÂ­a-RodrÃƒÂ­guez, Valladares-Garrido","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.934087","20220812","COVID-19; Latin America; coronavirus; government; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",36029,""
"Depression, anxiety and stress, during COVID-19 pandemic among midwives in ethiopia: A nationwide cross-sectional survey","COVID-19 has rapidly crossed borders, infecting people throughout the whole world, and has led to a wide range of psychological sequelae. Midwives who come close in contact with women while providing care are often left stricken with inadequate protection from contamination with COVID-19. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the level of depression, anxiety, and stress (DASS) among midwives in Ethiopia. A cross-sectional study was conducted from 20 June to 20 August 2020, among 1,691 practicing midwives in Ethiopia. A simple random sampling technique was used to select study participants. Data were collected through a structured telephone interview. A 21-item depression, anxiety, and stress scale (DASS-21) was used. Data were entered using the Google forms platform and were analyzed with SPSS version 24. Both bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were employed. Variables with a <i>p-</i>value &lt; 0.05 in the final model were declared statistically significant. Adjusted odds ratio (<i>AOR</i>) with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% <i>CI</i>) was used to determine independent predictors. The prevalence of DASS among midwives in Ethiopia was 41.1, 29.6, and 19.0%, respectively. Being female [<i>AOR</i> = 1.35; 95% <i>CI</i>: 1.08, 1.69], working in rural areas [<i>AOR</i> = 1.39; 95% <i>CI</i>: 1.06, 1.82], having poor knowledge of COVID-19 [<i>AOR</i> = 1.40; 95% <i>CI</i>: 1.12, 1.75], having poor preventive practice [<i>AOR</i> = 1.83; 95% <i>CI</i>: 1.47, 2.28], and substance use [<i>AOR</i> = 0.31; 95% <i>CI</i>: 0.17, 0.56] were significantly associated with depression; while, working in the governmental health facility [<i>AOR</i> = 2.44; 95% <i>CI</i>: 1.24, 4.78], having poor preventive practice [<i>AOR</i> = 1,47; 95% <i>CI</i>: 1.16, 1.85], and having poor attitude [<i>AOR</i> = 2.22; 95% <i>CI</i>: 1.04, 1.66] were significantly associated with anxiety.

"The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the well-being of children with autism spectrum disorder: Parents' perspectives","The COVID-19-related lockdown interrupted children's learning progress and discontinued social learning and regular activities that children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) rely on socially and physically. Negative consequences for children with ASD were reported far and wide. To investigate this problem in Kazakhstan, we conducted a mixed-methods study that drew on data from an online survey with 97 parents and semi-structured interviews with 14 parents. While parent-report quantitative results suggest that children were likely to experience negative impacts of the pandemic due to disrupted educational and therapeutic services, qualitative findings confirm that they have experienced an elevated mental health and behavioral challenges during the lockdown. Remote educational and therapeutic services were not helpful as families coped with pandemic-caused problems on their own. We highlight that continued support and care during and after a crisis is vital not only for children with ASD but also for the families under-resourced mentally and socially.","Amirova, CohenMiller, Sandygulova","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.913902","20220812","autism (ASD); children; inclusion; online; pandemic (COVID-19); parents","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",36031,""
"Trends in online searching toward suicide pre-, during, and post the first wave of COVID-19 outbreak in China","COVID-19 may increase the risk of suicide, but the conclusion is still unclear. This study was designed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on suicide pre-, during, and post the first wave of COVID-19 in China. It was reported that online public searching was associated with their offline thoughts and behaviors. Therefore, this study was designed to explore the online search for suicide pre-, during, and post-COVID-19 in China. The keywords on suicide, COVID-19, unemployment, and depression were collected in 2019 and 2020 using the Baidu Search Index (BSI). A time-series analysis examined the dynamic correlations between BSI-COVID-19 and BSI-suicide. A generalized estimating equation model was used to calculate the coefficients of variables associated with the BSI-suicide. The BSI-suicide showed a significant increase (15.6%, <i>p</i> = 0.006) from the 5th to 9th week, which was also the point of the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. A time-series analysis between BSI-suicide and BSI-COVID-19 showed that the strongest correlation occurred at lag 1+ and lag 2+ week. In the pre-COVID-19 model, only BSI-depression was highly associated with BSI-suicide (ÃŽÂ² = 1.38, <i>p</i> = 0.008). During the COVID-19 model, BSI-depression (ÃŽÂ² = 1.77, <i>p</i> = 0.040) and BSI-COVID-19 (ÃŽÂ² = 0.03, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) were significantly associated with BSI-suicide. In the post-COVID-19 model, BSI depression (ÃŽÂ² = 1.55, <i>p</i> = 0.010) was still highly associated with BSI-suicide. Meanwhile, BSI-unemployment (ÃŽÂ² = 1.67, <i>p</i> = 0.007) appeared to be linked to BSI-suicide for the first time. There was a surge in suicide-related online searching during the early stage of the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. Online suicide search volume peaked 1-2 weeks after the COVID-19 peak. The BSI of factors associated with suicide varied at different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings in this study are preliminary and further research is needed to arrive at evidence of causality.","Chen, Zhang, Li, Li, Li","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.947765","20220812","COVID-19; depression; online searching behavior; social psychiatry; suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",36032,""
"Mental Health Status of Teachers During the Second Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Web-Based Study in Bangladesh","Following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the government of Bangladesh implemented strict non-therapeutic measures, i.e., ""social distancing,"" ""lockdown,"" ""work from home,"" in the first quarter of 2020. Like other professionals, teachers at schools, colleges and universities were confined within households. However, the introduction of online education imposed an additional burden on teachers along with growing household responsibilities, thus, affecting their psychological state. This study was aimed to explore the prevalence of mental health problems among teachers in Bangladesh and to identify the associated risk factors. This web-based cross-sectional study was conducted during the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. Data were collected from 381 teachers working at schools, colleges, and universities between 01 August and 29 August 2021 by administering a self-reported e-questionnaire using Google Form, where the mental health of teachers was assessed by depression, anxiety, and stress scale. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics (Version 26) and STATA Version 16, and multiple linear regression was executed to predict mental health problems among teachers. The findings indicate that the overall prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress among teachers was 35.4%, 43.7%, and 6.6%, respectively. The prevalence was higher among male and older teachers than among their female and younger colleagues. The findings further showed that place of residence, institution, self-reported health, usage of social and electronic media, and fear of COVID-19 significantly influenced the mental health status of teachers. It is strongly recommended that the government and policymakers provide proper mental health services to teachers in order to reduce mental health problems and thus sustain the quality of education during and after the pandemic.","Hossain, Islam, Jahan, Nahar, Sarker, Rahman, Deeba, Hoque, Aktar, Islam, Hossain, Siddiqua, Mahbub, Islam","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.938230","20220812","Bangladesh; COVID-19; anxiety; depression; mental health; prevalence; stress; teacher","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",36033,""

"Characteristics associated with optimistic or pessimistic perception about the probability of contracting COVID-19: A cross-sectional study of Japanese older adults","Excessive optimistic perception about the probability of acquiring coronavirus disease (COVID-19) may hinder people from exercising preventive measures, whereas excessive pessimistic perception can induce psychological problems. Not much focus has been paid to this topic, and prior studies are only online surveys. We determined the characteristics of older adults with optimistic and pessimistic perceptions of the probability of contracting COVID-19. We used data from the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study (JAGES), including 18,045 participants aged Ã¢â€°Â¥ 65 years (mean age: 75.7 years) who were physically and cognitively independent. Self-reported questionnaires were sent to 11 municipalities between November 2020 and February 2021. Multinomial logistic regression was used for data analysis. The characteristics of 1,596 (8.8%) participants with optimistic perception and 1,276 (7.1%) with pessimistic perception were compared with that of others (80.4%) with moderate perception. Optimism about infection probability was positively associated with older age; better perceived financial conditions but negatively associated with higher education level; trust in TV news programs, TV information programs, and government-issued newsletters; depressive symptoms; and higher levels of reciprocity. Pessimism was negatively associated with higher levels of social cohesion. In contrast, it was positively associated with engagement in paid work; trust in TV news programs, the Internet, and information from medical staff; and depressive symptoms. Optimistic and pessimistic perceptions about the probability of acquiring infection correlated differently with various characteristics. Thus, risk communication during a pandemic should be tailored based on specific individual characteristics.","Takemura, Sato, Kondo, Kondo","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2022.101186","20220812","COVID-19; Japanese older adults; Optimism; Pessimism; Risk communication","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",36035,""
"Prediction of adolescent suicidal ideation after the COVID-19 pandemic: A nationwide survey of a representative sample of Korea","This study developed a model to predict groups vulnerable to suicidal ideation after the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic based on nomogram techniques targeting 54,948 adolescents who participated in a national survey in South Korea. This study developed a model to predict suicidal ideation by using logistic regression analysis. The model aimed to understand the relationship between predictors associated with the suicidal ideation of South Korean adolescents by using the top seven variables with the highest feature importance confirmed in XGBoost (extreme gradient boosting). The regression model was developed using a nomogram so that medical workers could easily interpret the probability of suicidal ideation and identify groups vulnerable to suicidal ideation. This epidemiological study predicted that eighth graders who experienced depression in the past 12 months, had a lot of subjective stress, frequently felt lonely in the last 12 months, experienced much-worsened household economic status during the COVID-19 pandemic, and had poor academic performance were vulnerable to suicidal ideation. The results of 10-fold cross-validation revealed that the area under the curve (AUC) of the adolescent suicidal ideation prediction nomogram was 0.86, general accuracy was 0.89, precision was 0.87, recall was 0.89, and the F1-score was 0.88.

"Psychological consequences and the related factors among COVID-19 survivors in southeastern Iran","Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a new viral disease that has spread rapidly worldwide since December 2019 and there is no effective treatment for it. The current study aimed to investigate the psychological consequences and related factors among COVID-19 survivors. This descriptive analytical study was conducted on 152 patients with COVID-19 referred to referral hospitals in southeastern Iran in 2020. Data collection tools were three questionnaires of demographic and background information, Depression Anxiety stress Scale (DASS-21) and Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IESR). Descriptive and inferential statistics and SPSS25 were used to analyze the data. The mean age of patients was 39.52Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°13.16 years. The patients were mostly female (63.8%). Seventy-three percent of the patients had severe posttraumatic stress disorder, 26.3% had moderate depression and 26.3% had severe anxiety.

"Cardio-Metabolic and Mental Health Outcomes Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic in a Cohort of Women With Gestational Diabetes Mellitus in Switzerland","The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with worsened metabolic and mental health in the general and perinatal population. The postpartum is a critical moment regarding these outcomes particularly in women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). We investigated the cardio-metabolic and mental health outcomes before and during the pandemic in this population. This cohort study included 418 women with GDM, recruited during two distinct periods. This included 180 women exposed to the pandemic (E+) and recruited between May 2020-April 2021 and 238 women who were not exposed to the pandemic during their postpartum period (attended a year before=non-exposed (E-)) and recruited between January-December 2019. Among the E+, a nested-subcohort of 120 women were exposed both during pregnancy and postpartum. During the pandemic, we adopted a hybrid follow-up of women that consisted of in-person consultations, regular contact <i>via</i> phone calls (35%), sent recorded exercise guide to patients to follow at home and linked to our website. We specifically focused on maintaining motivation and keeping a strong focus on healthy lifestyle behaviors. Obstetric, neonatal, cardio-metabolic and mental health outcomes were assessed during pregnancy and postpartum. The pandemic was not associated with worsened weight, weight retention, glucose tolerance, metabolic syndrome, well-being or depression in the postpartum with the exception of a minimally increased HbA1c, diastolic blood pressure and lower emotional eating scores in E+ women (all p Ã¢â€°Â¤ 0.046). In the nested subcohort, E+ women had a slightly increased HbA1c at the first GDM visit and a higher need for glucose-lowering medication (both p Ã¢â€°Â¤ 0.014), but HbA1c at the end of pregnancy and other cardio-metabolic, mental health, obstetric and neonatal outcomes during pregnancy were similar. The pandemic was not associated with any clinically relevant worsening of cardio-metabolic, mental health, obstetrical and neonatal outcomes in our GDM cohort.

Single-centre cohort study. Large public hospital in the United Kingdom. All HCWs who had been tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin (Ig) G nucleocapsid antibody in summer 2020 were asked to complete an electronic survey focusing on their physical and mental health in Winter 2020-21. This survey was comprised of the Short Form 12v2, Physical Component Summary (PCS), Mental Component Summary (MCS), and Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) questionnaires. 7604/9781 (77.7%) HCWs were antibody tested, of which 1082 completed the full survey. Antibody testing was conducted between 17/06/20-30/07/20, during which time our seroprevalence rate was 28% (299/1082). Of those self-reporting COVID-19 symptoms, 51% (201/395) were antibody positive. Antibody-positive participants had lower PCS scores (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.016), indicating poorer physical health. Lower PCS scores were also found in those deemed high risk for COVID-19 by their GP (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.001), and those aged &gt;44 years (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.009). Antibody-negative participants had lower MCS scores (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.044), indicating poorer mental health. Those who self-reported COVID-19 symptoms had lower PCS scores (p=&lt;0.001) than those with no symptoms. Lower MCS scores were found in women (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.001), Caucasians (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.018), non-clinicians (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.001), and those aged &lt;44 years (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.009).

"Gender differences in the experience of burnout and its correlates among Chinese psychiatric nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic: A large-sample nationwide survey","Psychiatric nurses often experience burnout and other mental health symptoms. However, few studies have examined these phenomena and gender-specific associated factors during the COVID-19 pandemic. We surveyed a national sample of psychiatric nurses (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°8971) from 41 tertiary psychiatric hospitals in China as part of a large national survey conducted during the pandemic. The Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Service Survey was used to assess burnout and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 was used to assess mental health symptoms. Binary logistic regression analyses were used to explore factors associated with burnout in the entire sample and separately by gender. The overall prevalence of burnout was 27.27%, with the rate in male psychiatric nurses (32.24%) being significantly higher than that in female psychiatric nurses (25.97%). Many key demographic factors (such as the male gender and marital status), work-related variables (such as a mid-level professional title, having an administrative position, longer working hours, more monthly night shifts, and the perceived negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical work) were significantly associated with burnout in the whole sample. Moreover, burnout was associated with depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms in the whole sample. Gender-specific factors associated with burnout were also identified: burnout was associated with night shifts in male psychiatric nurses, whereas it was associated with single or married marital status, a mid-level professional title, and having an administrative position among female psychiatric nurses. The high rates of burnout and mental health symptoms in psychiatric nurses need attention from hospital administrators. While mental health symptoms, longer working hours, and the perceived impact of COVID-19 are associated with burnout in both genders, gender-specific factors also warrant special attention when developing gender-specific interventions.","Zhang, Li, Yang, Xia, Min, Liu, Liu, Kalow, Liu, Tang, Jiang, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1111/inm.13052","20220812","COVID-19 pandemic; burnout; gender differences; mental health symptoms; psychiatric nurses","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",36040,""
"Depression, anxiety and worry in young Pacific adults in New Zealand during the COVID-19 pandemic","To measure symptoms of anxiety, depression and hopelessness in a sample of young Pacific adults living in Auckland, New Zealand during the 2020/2021 COVID-19 pandemic and identify protective factors. Participants were 267 Pacific adults (58% female) who completed a survey online. Analyses included descriptive statistics, correlations, linear regression and symptom network analysis. Around 25% of the sample scored in the range for moderate to severe anxiety and 10% for moderate to severe depression on standard measures. Almost 40% indicated that they found the first lockdown very stressful and 55% noted that some members of their family found it stressful. Only 16% worried about COVID-19 and their future <i>quite a bit or constantly</i>, while another 25% worried <i>sometimes</i>. Self-compassion and Pacific Identity had moderate, negative correlations, and Worry about COVID-19 had weak positive correlations, with anxiety, depression, hopelessness and perceived stress. These results suggest that, while the prevalence of depression and anxiety are quite high among this population, fostering ethnic identity and self-compassion in Pacific children and adolescents might protect against developing depression and anxiety.","Siegert, Narayanan, Dipnall, Gossage, Wrapson, Sumich, Merien, Berk, Paterson, Tautolo","https://doi.org/10.1177/00048674221115641","20220812","COVID-19; Pacific; anxiety; depression; ethnic identity; hopelessness; network analysis; self-compassion; young adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",36041,""
"Pain Extent Is Not Associated with Sensory-Associated Symptoms, Cognitive or Psychological Variables in COVID-19 Survivors Suffering from Post-COVID Pain","We aimed to investigate the relationship between pain extent, as a sign of sensitization, and sensory-related, cognitive and psychological variables in hospitalized COVID-19 survivors with post-COVID pain. One hundred and forty-six (67 males, 79 females) previously hospitalized COVID-19 survivors with post-COVID pain completed demographic (age, sex, height, weight), sensory-related (Central Sensitization Inventory, Self-Report Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms), cognitive (Pain Catastrophizing Scale, Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia) and psychological (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) variables. Pain extent and frequency maps were calculated from pain drawings using customized software. After conducting a correlation analysis to determine the relationships between variables, a stepwise linear regression model was performed to identify pain extent predictors, if available. Pain extent was significantly and weakly associated with pain intensity (r = -0.201, <i>p</i> = 0.014): the larger the pain extent, the lower the pain intensity. No other significant association was observed between pain extent and sensory-related, cognitive, or psychological variables in individuals with post-COVID pain. Females had higher pain intensity, more sensitization-associated symptoms, higher anxiety, lower sleep quality, and higher kinesiophobia levels than males. Sex differences correlation analyses revealed that pain extent was associated with pain intensity in males, but not in females. Pain extent was not associated with any of the measured variables and was also not related to the presence of sensitization-associated symptoms in our sample of COVID-19 survivors with long-term post-COVID pain.","FernÃƒÂ¡ndez-de-Las-PeÃƒÂ±as, Fuensalida-Novo, Ortega-Santiago, Valera-Calero, Cescon, Derboni, Giuffrida, Barbero","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm11154633","20220812","COVID-19; pain; pain extent; post-COVID; sensitization","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",36042,""
"Mental Health Condition among University Students of Bangladesh during the Critical COVID-19 Period","Bangladesh's education sector has been in a state of flux since COVID-19. During the pandemic, all university campuses were closed. There was a mental health issue among the students. This study aims to examine the mental health condition and the determinants that contribute to adverse mental health conditions among university students of Bangladesh. A survey was performed online among university students in Bangladesh, in mid-June 2020 when averaging 3345 affected cases of the population daily. The convenience sampling technique was used and the survey gathered data from 365 university students. The relationship between general information and Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale 21 (DASS-21) subscales of university students was determined. The questionnaire was administered to respondents during the pandemic, which ensured fast replies. Linear regression models were used for statistical analysis. University students indicated normal levels of depression (30.41%), anxiety (43.29%), and stress (47.40%). However, a disproportionate number of extremely depressed, anxious, and stressed university students suggested a mental health status of concern. There were significant connections between the individual's opinion of social satisfaction, mental health concerns, and the present location's safety with an undesirable mental health condition. Female students were shown to be much more anxious and stressed than male students. Capital Dhaka city students were more depressed and anxious than students outside of Dhaka. Financial and psychological support for students may help mitigate the psychological impact. Authorities should make effective efforts to reduce mental health problems among these students. This research may aid organizations, health care providers, and social workers in their attempts to prepare for and respond to pandemics.","Rahman, Asikunnaby, Khan, Arony, Mamun, Procheta, Sakib, Aryal, Rahman, Islam","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm11154617","20220812","COVID-19; lockdown; mental health; stress; tertiary education; university students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",36043,""
"Assessment of Anxiety, Depression, Work-Related Stress, and Burnout in Health Care Workers (HCWs) Affected by COVID-19: Results of a Case-Control Study in Italy","This study aims to investigate whether HCWs infected with COVID-19 may experience potential psychological consequences and a higher incidence of depression, anxiety, work-related stress, and burnout compared to non-infected HCWs. A case-control study with 774 participants was conducted comparing COVID-19-infected HCWs (cases) and non-infected HCWs (controls) from the Occupational Medicine Unit at the Teaching Hospital Policlinico Umberto I, who were administered the same questionnaire including Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Copenhagen Burnout Inventory and Karasek's Job Content Questionnaire. No differences in the levels of burnout and decision latitude were found between the two groups. Cases showed higher level of anxiety and job demand compared to controls. In contrast, levels of depression in the case group were significantly lower compared to the control group. The results are indicating the need for workplace health promotion activities based on stress and burnout management and prevention. Multiple organizational and work-related interventions can lower the impact of mental health-related issues in the COVID-19 pandemics, including the improvement of workplace infrastructures, as well as the adoption of correct and shared anti-contagion measures, which must include regular personal protective equipment supply, and the adoption of training programs that deal with mental health-related issues.","La Torre, Barletta, Marte, Paludetti, Faticoni, Barone, Rocchi, Picchioni, Previte, Serruto, Deriu, Ajassa, Campagna, Antonelli, Matroianni","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm11154434","20220812","COVID-19; anxiety; burnout; caseÃ¢â‚¬â€œcontrol; depression; health care workers; work-related stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",36044,""
"Psychological Burdens among Teachers in Germany during the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic-Subgroup Analysis from a Nationwide Cross-Sectional Online Survey","Schools underwent massive changes during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic worldwide. Besides existing occupational health challenges, teachers had to deal with biological and psychological burdens that had the potential to impact their psychological well-being. The aim of the present study was to (i) assess the current state of psychological burdens in German teachers and (ii) identify highly burdened subgroups to derive and address interventions. A nationwide cross-sectional online survey was conducted among teachers at all school types in Germany in March 2021. Data on psychological strains were assessed using established (e.g., PHQ-4) and new-pandemic-specific-(e.g., COVID-19-associated anxieties) instruments. ANOVAs and Tukey's post hoc tests were used to identify highly burdened subgroups (e.g., gender, age, and number of risk factors for severe courses of COVID-19) of teachers. Psychological burdens in German teachers (N = 31.089) exceeded the level of the general population, for example, regarding symptoms of depression (PHQ-2, M = 1.93 vs. 1.24) or generalized anxiety (GAD-2, M = 1.72 vs. 1.03). Subgroup analysis revealed that psychological burdens were unevenly distributed among different groups of teachers; for example, younger teachers (18-30 years) showed more depression symptoms compared with their older colleagues (56-67 years) (PHQ-2, M = 2.01 vs. 1.78). The online survey was conducted during the ""third wave"" of SARS-CoV-2 in Germany, which might have influenced risk perception and psychological strains. Future studies at different times, ideally longitudinal monitoring of the mental health of teachers, are recommended. Based on our results, evidence-based subgroup-specific interventions should be implemented to sustain teachers' mental health; for example, younger teachers or teachers with risk factors for a severe course of COVID-19 should receive special attention and support. Teachers from special needs schools whose mental health is, on average, good could also be a starting point for identifying the health promotion structural elements of this school type (e.g., fewer students per teacher). However, beyond the specific pandemic-related psychological burdens, the classic occupational health challenges of physical, biological, and chemical stress and their resulting strains should not be disregarded.","Koestner, Eggert, Dicks, Kalo, ZÃƒÂ¤hme, Dietz, Letzel, Beutel","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19159773","20220812","COVID-19; anxiety; burnout; depression; mental health; school; teachers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",36045,""
"A Qualitative Exploration of the Functional, Social, and Emotional Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on People Who Use Drugs","Since 2020, people who use drugs (PWUD) experienced heightened risks related to drug supply disruptions, contamination, overdose, social isolation, and increased stress. This study explored how the lives of PWUD changed in Philadelphia over a one-year period. Using semi-structured interviews with 20 participants in a Housing First, low-barrier medication for opioid use (MOUD) program in Philadelphia, the effects of the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic on the daily lives, resources, functioning, substance use, and treatment of PWUD were explored. Interviews were analyzed using a combination of directed and conventional content analysis. Six overarching themes emerged during data analysis: (1) response to the pandemic; (2) access to MOUD and support services; (3) substance use; (4) impacts on mental health, physical health, and daily functioning; (5) social network impacts; and (6) fulfillment of basic needs. Participants reported disruptions in every domain of life, challenges meeting their basic needs, and elevated risk for adverse events. MOUD service providers offset some risks and provided material supports, treatment, social interaction, and emotional support. These results highlight how there were significant disruptions to the lives of PWUD during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic and identified critical areas for future intervention and policies.","Kelly, Reed, Schoenauer, Smith, Scalia-Jackson, Kay Hill, Li, Weinstein","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19159751","20220812","COVID-19; medication for opioid use disorder; social isolation; social networks; substance use; vaccine hesitancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",36046,""
"Mental Health and Physical Activity of Female Higher Education Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Comparative Cross-Sectional Study from Lithuania","During emerging adulthood (EA), higher education medical students undergo a higher risk of anxiety and depression compared to the general population. The aim of this comparative cross-sectional study was to compare the proportions of three mental disorders, namely anxiety, depression and somatisation in terms of their symptoms and self-reported physical activity (PA) levels across the cohorts of biomedical and non-biomedical female students as well as to assess the association between the mental health outcomes and PA use. Between September 2021 and January 2022, a total of 1231 female higher education students aged between 18 and 29 years old were recruited for the study. Severe symptoms of anxiety and depression, as well as unexplained somatic complaints, were suffered by 51.9%, 11% and 23% of female students, respectively. Non-biomedical female students, compared to medicine and health sciences students, were more vulnerable due to the increased prevalence of negative mental health outcomes. The relationship between increased sports activity as a potential trigger for mental well-being and decreased severity of depressive symptoms was identified in the cohorts of both biomedical (adjusted odd ratio (OR<sub>adj</sub>) 0.4; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.1-1.0) and non-biomedical (OR<sub>adj</sub> 0.4; 95% CI: 0.2-0.9) female students.

"Binge-Watching and Mental Health Problems: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","Binge-watching, the viewing of online videos or streamed content, may be associated with different types of mental health problems. The present study aimed to investigate the associations between binge-watching and five mental health concerns including depression, loneliness, sleep problems, anxiety, and stress. Academic databases of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, ProQuest, PsycINFO, and Psych Articles were systematically searched through February of 2022. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess the methodological quality. A meta-analysis was performed on Fisher's z values as effect sizes, using a random effect model. Publication bias, small study effect, and moderators in this association were assessed. Binge-watching was significantly associated with the five types of mental health concerns with the most robust correlations found with stress (0.32) and anxiety (0.25). Stronger associations between binge-watching and two types of mental health problems (depression and sleep problems) were found during the COVID-19 pandemic than before the pandemic. Moreover, stronger associations between binge-watching and two types of mental health problems (stress and sleep problems) were found in developing countries than in developed countries. The associations between binge-watching and mental health concerns were significant and positive. Programs and interventions to reduce binge-watching should be considered and tested.","Alimoradi, Jafari, Potenza, Lin, Wu, Pakpour","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19159707","20220812","Internet use addiction; addictive behaviors; anxiety; binge-watching; depression; loneliness; sleep problems; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",36048,""

This study aimed to understand HCWs' MD experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic and to identify HCWs' preferred coping strategies. Based on a qualitative research methodology, three surveys were distributed at different stages of the pandemic response in British Columbia (BC), Canada. The thematic analysis of the data revealed common MD themes: concerns about ability to serve patients and about the risks intrinsic to the pandemic. Additionally, it revealed that COVID-19 fatigue and collateral impact of COVID-19 were important ethical challenges faced by the HCWs who completed the surveys. These experiences caused stress, anxiety, increased/decreased empathy, sleep disturbances, and feelings of helplessness. Respondents identified self-care and support provided by colleagues, family members, or friends as their main MD coping mechanisms. To a lesser extent, they also used formal sources of support provided by their employer and identified additional strategies they would like their employers to implement (e.g., improved access to mental health and wellness resources). These results may help inform pandemic policies for the future.","Alonso-Prieto, Longstaff, Black, Virani","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19159701","20220812","COVID-19; ethical dilemmas; moral distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",36049,""

"The Level of Fear in the Polish Police Population during the COVID-19 Pandemic with the Impact of Sociodemographic Variables","This study has a twofold objective. First, we aim to measure the levels of fear among Polish police officers using the COVID-19 Fear Scale (FCV-19S) that has a stable unidimensional structure allowing for the provision of additional data by combining variables. This structure allows the second objective to be met to measure the correlation with sociodemographic variables. The utilitarian objective of the study is to provide information for updating support policies for stress management in the service. The questionnaire was completed by 1862 people with a mean age of 38.75 years with a good Cronbach's alpha (0.89). The perceived level of fear associated with COVID-19 should be considered relatively low. Caring for the elderly does not affect the level of fear. The factors of gender, age and having children statistically significantly differentiate the perceptions of fear. Therefore, there is a necessity to focus on building support for police officers who are over 50 years old, as well as for women, where higher levels of fear in both men and women can translate into the development of psychosomatic illnesses.","SzykuÃ…â€ša-Piec, Piec, ZaczyÃ…â€žski, WÃƒÂ³jtowicz, Butkiewicz, Rusyan, Adamczyk, Walecka, Dmochowska, Rogula-KozÃ…â€šowska","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19159679","20220812","COVID-19; mental health; safety of policemen; sociodemographic variables","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",36051,""
"Prevalence, Predictors, and Experience of Moral Suffering in Nursing and Care Home Staff during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Mixed-Methods Systematic Review","(1) Background: Nursing and care home staff experienced high death rates of older residents and increased occupational and psychosocial pressures during the COVID-19 pandemic. The literature has previously found this group to be at risk of developing mental health conditions, moral injury (MI), and moral distress (MD). The latter two terms refer to the perceived ethical wrongdoing which contravenes an individual's moral beliefs and elicits adverse emotional responses. (2) Method: A systematic review was conducted to explore the prevalence, predictors, and psychological experience of MI and MD in the aforementioned population during the COVID-19 pandemic. The databases CINAHL, APA PsychINFO, APA PsychArticles, Web of Science, Medline, and Scopus were systematically searched for original research studies of all designs, published in English, with no geographical restrictions, and dating from when COVID-19 was declared a public health emergency on the 30 January 2020 to the 3 January 2022. Out of 531 studies screened for eligibility, 8 studies were selected for review. A thematic analysis was undertaken to examine the major underpinning themes. (3) Results: MI, MD, and related constructs (notably secondary traumatic stress) were evidenced to be present in staff, although most studies did not explore the prevalence or predictors. The elicited major themes were resource deficits, role challenges, communication and leadership, and emotional and psychosocial consequences. (4) Conclusions: Our findings suggest that moral injury and moral distress were likely to be present prior to COVID-19 but have been exacerbated by the pandemic. Whilst studies were generally of high quality, the dearth of quantitative studies assessing prevalence and predictors suggests a research need, enabling the exploration of causal relationships between variables. However, the implied presence of MI and MD warrants intervention developments and workplace support for nursing and care home staff.","Laher, Robertson, Harrad-Hyde, Jones","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19159593","20220812","COVID-19; care home staff; healthcare workers; mental health; moral distress; moral injury; nursing home staff; workplace well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",36052,""
"Adapted Physical Activity Protocol for Lower Limb Functional and Strength Recovery in a Young Athlete with Cutaneous Melanoma: Feasibility and Efficacy during COVID-19 Pandemic","Adapted physical activity (APA) can improve psychophysical wellbeing and quality of life (QoL) in cancer survivors, a vulnerable population requiring a global management, especially during the recent pandemic. On this basis, we investigated for the first time the impact of a tailored APA intervention on a melanoma-affected 18-year-old female athlete to counteract treatment sequelae and promote lower limb functional and strength recovery. Patient was evaluated at baseline and post-protocol by a test battery focusing on mobility, muscle strength measured by dynamometry, and lower limb girths assessed at specific anatomical points. Moreover, health-related QoL, depression/anxiety, psychological distress and pain intensity were evaluated by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Melanoma (FACT-M), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), distress thermometer, and numerical rating scale (NRS) questionnaires, respectively. An almost doubled up increase in lower limb strength, along with hip mobility improvement, and post-surgical edema and pain reduction were observed following the protocol. Concerning the QoL assessment, a moderate post-intervention improvement in physical and emotional wellbeing was detected, while depression state worsened though remaining within the normality range. Our findings show that a specialist-supervised structured APA protocol based on a patient-centered multidisciplinary approach may represent an effective strategy to recover functional and psychophysical efficiency, thus promoting a quick return to daily life activities and offering a concrete chance of resuming competitive sport practice.","Carretti, Mirandola, Germano, Manetti, Marini","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19159590","20220812","COVID-19; adapted physical activity; cancer survivor; health-related outcomes; melanoma; quality of life; skin cancer","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",36053,""

"The North Italian Longitudinal Study Assessing the Mental Health Effects of SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic Health Care Workers-Part II: Structural Validity of Scales Assessing Mental Health","It is unclear if the factor structure of the questionnaires that were employed by studies addressing the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of Healthcare Workers (HCW) did not change due to the pandemic. The aim of this study is to assess the factor structure and longitudinal measurement invariance of the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and the factor structure of the General Health Questionnare-12 (GHQ-12), PTSD Checklist for DSM-5-Short Form (PCL-5-SF), Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-10 (CD-RISC-10) and Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory-Short Form (PTGI-SF). Out of n = 805 HCWs from a University hospital who responded to a pre-COVID-19 survey, n = 431 were re-assessed after the COVID-19 outbreak. A Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) on the MBI showed adequate fit and good internal consistency only after removal of items 2, 6, 12 and 16. The assumptions of configural and metric longitudinal invariance were met, whereas scalar longitudinal invariance did not hold.

"The North Italian Longitudinal Study Assessing the Mental Health Effects of SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic on Health Care Workers-Part I: Study Design and Psychometric Structural Validity of the HSE Indicator Tool and Work Satisfaction Scale","Literature on the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on the mental health of Health Care Workers (HCWs) is mostly based on cross-sectional surveys. We designed a longitudinal study to assess work-related stress and mental health before and after the pandemic onset in a university-hospital in Lombardia region, Italy. We report on sample representativeness and structural validity of questionnaires assessing work stress (HSE Indicator Tool, HSE-IT) and work satisfaction (WS), which were not validated in the HCWs population. n = 1287 HCWs from 67 hospital wards/offices were invited to an online survey in summer 2019 (pre-COVID-19 wave) and again during winter 2020 (COVID-19 wave). Selected hospital wards/offices did not differ from the remaining wards for turn-over and down-sizing rates, overload, sick leaves, and night shifts (Wilcoxon rank tests <i>p</i>-values &amp;gt; 0.05). Participation rates were 70% (n = 805) and 60% (n = 431) in the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 waves, respectively. Socio-demographic and work-related characteristics did not impact data completeness nor participation to the COVID-19 wave. While confirming a 7-component structure for HSE-IT, we identified a new factor related to participation in work organization. A one-factor model for WS had satisfactory fit. Our longitudinal study based on a representative sample and adopting validated questionnaires is well-suited to elucidate the role of work conditions on the development of mental health disorders in HCWs.","Veronesi, Giusti, D'Amato, Gianfagna, Borchini, Castelnuovo, Iacoviello, Ferrario","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19159514","20220812","COVID-19; HSE indicator tool; health care workers; longitudinal study; mental health; principal component analysis; work satisfaction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",36057,""
"Emotional Experiences of COVID-19 Patients in China: A Qualitative Study","This study explored the emotional experiences of COVID-19 patients in China. Thirty-four patients diagnosed with COVID-19 participated in semi-structured telephone interviews. We used qualitative methods to investigate the distribution patterns and characteristics of patients' emotional experiences. The results indicated that emotional experiences showed different characteristics at different stages during isolation and treatment. COVID-19 patients' emotional discourse encompassed eight main themes, namely, feelings of shock at the diagnosis, yearning for future life, attachment to one's family, depression during the treatment, self-restriction due to probable contagiousness, powerlessness about the disease, open-mindedness about death, and faith in the joint efforts to fight COVID-19. These themes related to experiences concerning infection, isolation, outlook on life and death, stigma, and macro-identity. The findings suggest that the unexpected experience of COVID-19 infection exacerbated patients' negative emotions. COVID-19 patients' emotional stress stemmed from isolated environments, physiological effects of the disease, panic about the unknown, and realistic economic pressure. The government, medical staff, family members of patients, and the media should therefore work together to ensure proper emotional care for COVID-19 patients.","Deng, Li, Park","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19159491","20220812","COVID-19 patients; China; emotional experiences; mental health; qualitative analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",36058,""
"Brief Screening for Distress among Healthcare Professionals: Psychometric Properties of the Physician Well-Being Index-Spanish Version","The Physician Well-Being Index (PWBI) is a brief, valid, reliable self-assessment instrument to identify health professionals' distress and those in need of an intervention. to evaluate the construct, predictive validity (of depression, suicidal ideation, insomnia, and generalized anxiety), and internal consistency of the 7-item Spanish version of the PWBI (PWBI-S). out of a national population of approximately 1 million Mexican healthcare professionals, a sample of 3506 subjects (42.0% physicians, 28.7% nurses and 29.3% psychologists) completed an online survey between 17 April and 7 May 2020, at the time of the COVID-19 case cluster transmission scenario in Mexico. In the three sub-samples, PWBI-S's Confirmatory factor analyses (adding residual covariances) exhibited adequate goodness of fit indices for the PWBS original unidimensional model. Overall Cronbach's alphas were 0.89 for physicians, 0.90 for nurses, and 0.86 for psychologists. Univariate logistic regression models showed that a cutoff point of 3 on the total score of the PWBI-S was generally related to the presence of depression, suicidal ideation, and insomnia, but not with generalized anxiety among nurses and psychologists. When trying with a cutoff point of 3, a relationship with GA was shown in psychologists, but not in nurses. our findings suggest that PWBI-S is a valid, reliable measure for clinical and research purposes in the field.","Robles, FresÃƒÂ¡n, Alcocer-Castillejos, Real-RamÃƒÂ­rez, Morales-ChainÃƒÂ©","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19159451","20220812","Well-being Index; distress; evaluation; healthcare workers; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",36059,""
"Exploring the Associated Factors of Depression, Anxiety, and Stress among Healthcare Shift Workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The recent pandemic of COVID-19 has had a tremendous impact on healthcare frontliners. This study sought to assess healthcare shift workers' depression, anxiety, and stress and its associated factors. The sampling frame includes healthcare shift workers directly managing COVID-19 cases around Klang Valley, Malaysia. The participants' mental health status was assessed using the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). The associated factors specified in this study include sleep quality, physical activities, and eating habits. Pearson's Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> and simple and multivariable binary logistic regression models were constructed following the Hosmer-Lemeshow approach to determine the potential associated factors. A total of 413 participants were recruited. Overall, 40.7% of participants had one or more symptoms of depression, anxiety, or stress. Poor sleep quality was significantly associated with all mental health outcomes of depression, anxiety, and stress. Inactivity was found to be strongly associated with symptoms of depression and anxiety. At the same time, eating habits were strongly associated with anxiety and stress. Sleep quality, inactivity, and eating habits that were found to be associated with the mental health status of healthcare shift workers are modifiable factors that must be addressed to curb mental health issues among this group of workers.","Juliana, Mohd Azmi, Effendy, Mohd Fahmi Teng, Azmani, Baharom, Mohamad Yusuff, Abu","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19159420","20220812","COVID-19; eating habits; physical activity; psychosocial; shift workers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",36060,""
"Association of Social Capital and Locus of Control with Perceived Health during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Japan","Previous studies have indicated that social capital and locus of control influence mental health. Accordingly, we investigated the effect of social capital and locus of control on perceived physical and mental health in the general Japanese population during the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to conduct a cross-sectional study, in 2021, three thousand citizens were randomly selected from the Chitose City Resident Register according to ten strata of sex and age classes between 30 years and 79 years. Because thirteen persons moved away from the city, the survey was conducted for the remaining 2987 citizens. A total of 1430 citizens (712 males, 718 females) responded to the survey with their written informed consent (response rate, 47.9%). As a result, social capital measured three dimensions, namely social support, social participation, and trust and reciprocity, and internal locus of control was significantly inversely associated with it, but external locus of control was significantly positively associated with impaired physical and mental health in male and female subjects after adjustment of lifestyle habits and lifestyle change affected by the pandemic. Strengthening social capital and internal locus of control, and weakening external locus of control, may improve physical and mental health, even if the pandemic would bring about distress. Further longitudinal study is needed to examine the causal relationship among them.","Mori, Seko, Ogawa","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19159415","20220812","COVID-19; locus of control; perceived health; social capital","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",36061,""
"Planning and Implementation of COVID-19 Isolation and Quarantine Facilities in Hawaii: A Public Health Case Report","In response to the second surge of COVID-19 cases in Hawaii in the fall of 2020, the Hawaii State Department of Health Behavioral Health Administration led and contracted a coalition of agencies to plan and implement an isolation and quarantine facility placement service that included food, testing, and transportation assistance for a state capitol and major urban center. The goal of the program was to provide safe isolation and quarantine options for individual residents at risk of not being able to comply with isolation and quarantine mandates. Drawing upon historical lived experiences in planning and implementing the system for isolation and quarantine facilities, this qualitative public health case study report applies the plan-do-study-act (PDSA) improvement model and framework to review and summarize the implementation of this system. This case study also offers lessons for a unique opportunity for collaboration led by a public behavioral health leadership that expands upon traditionally narrow infectious disease control, by developing a continuum of care that not only addresses immediate COVID-19 concerns but also longer-term supports and services including housing, access to mental health services, and other social services. This case study highlights the role of a state agency in building a coalition of agencies, including a public university, to respond to the pandemic. The case study also discusses how continuous learning was executed to improve delivery of care.","Fan, Yamaguchi, Pal, Geib, Conlon, Holmes, Sutton, Aiona, Curtis, Mersereau","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19159368","20220812","COVID-19; containment and mitigation strategies; homelessness; isolation and quarantine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",36062,""
"Associations between Health Education and Mental Health, Burnout, and Work Engagement by Application of Audiovisual Stimulation","Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, health education programs and workplace health promotion (WHP) could only be offered under difficult conditions, if at all. In Germany for example, mandatory lockdowns, working from home, and physical distancing have led to a sharp decline in expenditure on prevention and health promotion from 2019 to 2020. At the same time, the pandemic has negatively affected many people's mental health. Therefore, our goal was to examine audiovisual stimulation as a possible measure in the context of WHP, because its usage is contact-free, time flexible, and offers, additionally, voice-guided health education programs. In an online survey following a cross-sectional single case study design with 393 study participants, we examined the associations between audiovisual stimulation and mental health, work engagement, and burnout. Using multiple regression analyses, we could identify positive associations between audiovisual stimulation and mental health, burnout, and work engagement. However, longitudinal data are needed to further investigate causal mechanisms between mental health and the use of audiovisual stimulation. Nevertheless, especially with regard to the pandemic, audiovisual stimulation may represent a promising measure for improving mental health at the workplace.","Ghadiri, Sturz, Mohajerzad","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19159370","20220812","audiovisual stimulation; burnout; health education; mental health; relaxation; well-being; work engagement; workplace health promotion","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",36063,""
"Should We Be Worried about Smartphone Addiction? An Examination of Canadian Adolescents' Feelings of Social Disconnection in the Time of COVID-19","As the COVID-19 global pandemic limited face-to-face social contact, mental health concerns increased for adolescents. Additionally, many adolescents turned to technology to communicate with their peers, which also raised concerns about adolescent smartphone addiction. However, research has yet to examine how mental health and technology engagement are related to adolescents' feelings of social connection-an important developmental predictor of wellbeing across the lifespan. Specifically, little is known regarding the relative risk of adolescents' mental health concerns, a known risk factor for social disconnection and isolation and smartphone addiction in contributing to feelings of social disconnection in the time of COVID-19. The present study investigated how mental health outcomes and smartphone addiction contributed to Canadian adolescents' (<i>n</i> = 1753) feelings of social disconnection during COVID-19. Between October 2020 and May 2021, data were collected from five secondary schools in and around the lower mainland of British Columbia using an online-administered self-report questionnaire. Adolescents responded to questions about their smartphone addiction, internalizing problems, and an open-ended question about their feelings of connection to others. Findings from logistic regression analyses indicated that depression was a predictor of feeling socially disconnected: however, smartphone addiction was not associated with feelings of social disconnection during COVID-19. Implications of these findings can help inform the development of prevention programs targeting adolescents at risk for social disconnection in times of increased social isolation (e.g., a global pandemic). Specifically, these findings suggest that adolescents higher in depressive symptoms, and not those higher in smartphone addiction, are the ones most at risk.","Parent, Xiao, Hein-Salvi, Shapka","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19159365","20220812","COVID-19; adolescents; mental health; smartphone addiction; social disconnection","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",36064,""
"Mental Health Consequences of COVID-19 Pandemic Period in the European Population: An Institutional Challenge","The worldwide spread of SARS-CoV-2 has been responsible for an infectious pandemic, with repercussions on socio-economic aspects and on the physical and mental health of the general population. The present systematic review aimed to evaluate the data belonging to the European framework, analyzing the population by age group. Original articles and reviews on the state of mental health of the general European population have been researched starting from 2021. Initially, a total of 1764 studies were found, among which a total of 75 were selected. Youth were the age group most affected by pandemic consequences on mental health, with emotional and behavioral alterations observed from a third to more than a half of children and adolescents examined. Among both adolescents and adults, the female gender had a higher prevalence of psychopathological symptoms. The main risk factors were poor social support, economic difficulties, and, in particular, unemployment or job changes. Additional individual risk factors were the perception of loneliness, the presence of pre-pandemic mental illness/distress, and some personality traits, such as neuroticism, impulsiveness, and the use of maladaptive coping strategies. Unexpectedly, the elderly maintained good resilience towards change, even if a stress factor was represented by the feeling of loneliness and poor social contact. As regards suicidal behaviors, among adolescents, there was an increase in attempts of 25%, with a greater risk for the female gender. This risk increased also among adults, in association with symptoms of anxiety and depression, and poor socio-environmental conditions. In conclusion, some population groups were found to be at greater risk of psychological burden during pandemic waves, thus representing priority targets for socio-health interventions.","Di Fazio, Morena, Delogu, Volonnino, Manetti, Padovano, Scopetti, Frati, Fineschi","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19159347","20220812","COVID-19; Europe; general population; health policies; lockdown; mental health; pandemic; psychiatric diseases; psychological burden","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",36065,""
"Association between Family Dysfunction and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder in School Students during the Second COVID-19 Epidemic Wave in Peru","Although the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on children and adolescents' mental health has been studied, there is still scarce evidence of the influence of nuclear family on the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This study aimed to determine the association between family dysfunction and PTSD in Peruvian high-school students during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional study was conducted using a virtual survey administered to 562 high-school students in three schools in Chiclayo, Peru. The dependent variable was PTSD, which was measured with the Child PTSD Symptom Scale. Family dysfunction was the main independent variable, measured with the Family APGAR Questionnaire. Prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated with generalized linear models. Most of the students were female (88.3%) and the average age was 14.4 years. We found that 21.4% showed severe family dysfunction and 60.3% had PTSD. Students with mild and moderate family dysfunction had 37% (PR: 1.37; 95% CI: 1.14-1.65) and 26% (PR: 1.26; 95% CI: 1.04-1.54) higher PTSD prevalence, respectively.

"Women-Reported Barriers and Facilitators of Continued Engagement with Medications for Opioid Use Disorder","Opioid-related fatalities increased exponentially during the COVID-19 pandemic and show little sign of abating. Despite decades of scientific evidence that sustained engagement with medications for opioid use disorders (MOUD) yields positive psychosocial outcomes, less than 30% of people with OUD engage in MOUD. Treatment rates are lowest for women. The aim of this project was to identify women-specific barriers and facilitators to treatment engagement, drawing from the lived experience of women in treatment. Data are provided from a parent study that used a community-partnered participatory research approach to adapt an evidence-based digital storytelling intervention for supporting continued MOUD treatment engagement. The parent study collected qualitative data between August and December 2018 from 20 women in Western Massachusetts who had received MOUD for at least 90 days. Using constructivist grounded theory, we identified major themes and selected illustrative quotations. Key barriers identified in this project include: (1) MOUD-specific discrimination encountered via social media, and in workplace and treatment/recovery settings; and (2) fear, perceptions, and experiences with MOUD, including mental health medication synergies, internalization of MOUD-related stigma, expectations of treatment duration, and opioid-specific mistrust of providers. Women identified two key facilitators to MOUD engagement: (1) feeling ""safe"" within treatment settings and (2) online communities as a source of positive reinforcement. We conclude with women-specific recommendations for research and interventions to improve MOUD engagement and provide human-centered care for this historically marginalized population.","Fiddian-Green, Gubrium, Harrington, Evans","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19159346","20220812","medications for opioid use disorder; qualitative methods; stigma and substance use; substance use treatment; women and opioid use disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",36067,""

Unfortunately, there are very few evidence-based studies in the literature that focus on anesthesiologists' burnout during that time. The purpose of our study was to examine the psychological distress, after the COVID-19 pandemic, among anesthesiologists in Poland. We conducted an anonymous internet survey among a group of anesthesiologists in Poland. It contained a questionnaire, entitled ""Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI)"", with demographic questions about sex, age, and family, as well as questions related to working conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. We received data from 158 people, including 109 women and 49 men. Results from the analysis showed that 73% (115/158) of the participants suffered from burnout. Moreover, 95.6% of the participants thought that the COVID-19 pandemic had had an influence on their level of burnout, and 97.3% found that it had had a negative impact. There is no doubt that healthcare workers, despite the difficulties associated with their daily work, have not faced challenges on such a scale in a very long time.

"University Students' Mental Health and Well-Being during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Findings from the UniCoVac Qualitative Study","The worldwide spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in early 2020 affected all major sectors, including higher education. The measures to contain the spread of this deadly disease led to the closure of colleges and universities across the globe, disrupting the lives of millions of students and subjecting them to a new world of online learning. These sudden disturbances coupled with the demands of a new learning system and the experiences of living through a pandemic have placed additional strains on the mental health of university students. Research on university students' mental health, conducted during the pandemic, have found high levels of stress, anxiety and depression among students. In this qualitative study, we aimed to understand how pandemic experiences have affected student well-being by conducting in-depth interviews with 34 undergraduate students enrolled in a UK university. All interviews were conducted through Microsoft Teams and recorded with prior permission. Transcripts of recorded interviews were thematically analysed which identified two broad themes: (i) University students' mental health and well-being experiences during the pandemic; (ii) factors that influenced students' mental health and well-being. These factors were further distributed across six sub-themes: (a) isolation; (b) health and well-being; (c) bereavement; (d) academic concerns; (e) financial worries and; (f) support, coping, and resilience. Our study identifies the importance of mental health support to university students during pandemics and calls for measures to improve access to support services through these crisis points by universities.

"Challenges and Opportunities for Mental Health and Psychosocial Support in the COVID-19 Response in Africa: A Mixed-Methods Study","This research aimed to (1) assess the extent to which mental health and psycho-social support (MHPSS) was included in the national response to the COVID-19 pandemic in African countries, and (2) explore barriers and enablers to MHPSS integration into the COVID-19 response. A mixed-methods study, using an online survey and in-depth interviews, was conducted. Participants included Mental Health Focal Points at the Ministries of Health, the World Health Organization (WHO) country and regional offices, and civil society representatives. Responses were received from 28 countries out of 55 contacted. The implementation level, based on standard guidelines, of MHPSS activities was below 50% in most countries. The most implemented MHPSS activities were establishing coordination groups (57%) and developing MHPSS strategy (45%), while the least implemented activities included implementing the developed MHPSS strategy (32%) and establishing monitoring and evaluation mechanisms (21%). Key factors that hindered implementing MHPSS activities included lack of political commitment and low prioritisation of mental health during emergencies, as it was seen as a ""less important"" issue during the COVID-19 pandemic, when more importance was given to infection prevention and control (IPC). However, there are signs of optimism, as mental health gained some attention during COVID-19.

"Psychometric Properties of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) in Previously Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus is associated with psychological/emotional disturbances. This study aimed to assess internal consistency, reliability, and construct validity of the Hospital Anxiety and Depressive Scale (HADS), as a patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) for evaluating emotional consequences of SARS-CoV-2 in hospitalized COVID-19 survivors with long COVID. The LONG-COVID-EXP-CM is a multicenter cohort study including patients hospitalized by COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic in five hospitals in Madrid. A total of 1969 (age: 61 Ã‚Â± 16 years, 46.5% women) COVID-19 survivors experiencing post-COVID symptoms a mean of 8.4 Ã‚Â± 1.5 months after hospital discharge completed HADS. Internal consistency (Cronbach ÃŽÂ±), reliability (item-internal consistency, item-discriminant validity), construct validity (confirmatory factor analysis), and floor effect and ceiling effect were calculated. The mean time for fulfilling HADS was 65 Ã‚Â± 12 s. A ceiling effect ranging from 1.99% to 13.74% and a floor effect ranging from 43.05% to 77.77% was observed. Based on the item-scale correlation coefficients, the Cronbach's alpha values reflecting the internal consistency reliability were 0.890 for the anxiety scale (HADS-A) and 0.856 for the depressive scale (HADS-D) The correlation coefficient between HADS-A and HADS-D scores was excellent (r: 0.878). The confirmatory factor analysis revealed that five out of the seven fitness indexes were excellent: CFI = 0.969, NNFI = 0.963; TLI = 0.963; AGFI = 0.951; GFI = 0.972), supporting good construct validity.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of eHealth tools in a programme called ePSICONUT. This programme was created to promote healthy lifestyle habits in university students. The sample consisted of 16 university students from the Dominican Republic aged 18-24 years (xÃ‚Â¯&amp;amp;nbsp; = 20.69; s = 1.74). ePSICONUT was developed in 12 weeks and its impact was analyzed by comparing the initial and the final psychological and lifestyle tests results, which were completed online by the participants. Results reported that the professionally supervised use of eHealth tools was associated with better psychological well-being, lees anxiety and depression, and better lifestyle habits (such as diet quality), even in stressful and changing situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic circumstances. However, more studies are needed to validate and promote the use of eHealth-based intervention programmes.","Cantisano, Gonzalez-Soltero, Blanco-FernÃƒÂ¡ndez, Belando-PedreÃƒÂ±o","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19159253","20220812","eHealth; healthy lifestyle habits; lifestyle; mHealth; subjective well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",36072,""
"How the COVID-19 Pandemic Has Changed Adolescent Health: Physical Activity, Sleep, Obesity, and Mental Health","The purpose of this study is to provide essential data for the establishment of education and policy for the formation of healthy lifestyles of adolescents in the future by analyzing the patterns of changes in society due to the prolonged COVID-19 in the physical activities, sleeping habits, obesity, and mental health of Korean adolescents. To this end, a total of 147,346 adolescents were selected and analyzed according to the purpose of the study in the 2018 (14th), 2019 (15th), and 2020 (16th) raw data of the ""Youth Health Behavior Online Survey,"" an annual national approval statistical survey conducted by a Korean government agency. The study examined changes in the physical activity, obesity, sleep, and mental health of Korean adolescents due to COVID-19. The physical activity rate of Korean adolescents in 2019 decreased by 5.3% from 2018. In addition, the physical activity rate in 2020 decreased by 2.1% compared to 2019. It was found that physical activity steadily decreased (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001). The obesity rate increased by 0.9% in 2019 compared to 2018 and by 1.8% in 2020 compared to 2019. Although the obesity rate steadily increased, it was found that it was accelerated due to COVID-19 (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001). Looking at the subjective sleep satisfaction rate of Korean adolescents, in 2019, it was 0.1% lower than in 2018, while in 2020, when COVID-19 began, it increased by 3.5% compared to 2019. It was found that satisfaction with sleep increased after COVID-19. Finally, the mental health characteristics of Korean adolescents by year were divided into stress and depression. Stress decreased by 1% compared to 2019 and 2018 and by 6.2% compared to 2020 and 2019. Depression increased by 1% in 2019 compared to 2018 and decreased by 3.4% in 2020 compared to 2019. In other words, stress and depression decreased after COVID-19. In 2020, when COVID-19 occurred, it was confirmed that there was a change in the health behavior of adolescents compared to 2018 and 2019. Therefore, active responses from schools, families, and communities are required to foster healthy lifestyle habits in social changes such as COVID-19.","Kim, Lee, Yoo","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19159224","20220812","COVID-19; adolescent health; mental health; obesity; physical activity; sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",36073,""
"""We Were Afraid"": Mental Health Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Two South African Districts","The impacts of pandemics are recognized to go beyond infection, physical suffering, and socio-economic disruptions. Other consequences include psychological responses. Using a mental wellbeing lens, we analyzed COVID-19-related stressors in healthcare workers (HCWs) and community members who provided and regularly accessed health services in South Africa, respectively. From February to September 2021, during the second COVID-19 wave we conducted a qualitative study in one urban and one rural district. In-depth interviews and focus group discussions were used to collect data among 43 HCWs and 51 community members purposely and conveniently selected. Most participants experienced mental health challenges regarding multiple aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic and its resulting lockdown, with a few reporting positive adjustments to change. COVID-19 impacts on mental health were consistent among both HCWs and community members in urban and rural alike. Participants' COVID-19-induced psychological responses included anxiety and fear of the unknown, perceived risk of infection, fear of hospitalization, and fear of dying. Physical effects of the pandemic on participants included COVID-19 infection and associated symptoms, possibilities of severe illness and discomfort of using personal protective equipment. These distresses were exacerbated by social repercussions related to concerns for family wellbeing and infection stigma. Lockdown regulations also intensified anxieties about financial insecurities and social isolation. At times when common coping mechanisms such as family support were inaccessible, cultural consequences related to lack of spiritual gatherings and limited funeral rites posed additional stress on participants. In preparation for future public health emergencies, recognition needs to be given to mental health support and treatment.","Rwafa-Ponela, Price, Nyatela, Nqakala, Mosam, Erzse, Lalla-Edward, Hove, Kahn, Tollman, Hofman, Goldstein","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19159217","20220812","COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown; biopsychosocial; community members; healthcare workers; mental health and wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",36074,""
"Meta-Analysis of Psychological Interventions for Reducing Stress, Anxiety, and Depression among University Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic","(1) Background: The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of internet-based intervention programs for reducing stress, anxiety, and depression among university students during the COVID-19 pandemic by conducting a meta-analysis. (2) Methods: Searches were conducted in the following databases: MEDLINE, EbscoHost Academic Search Ultimate, and PsycArticles, using a combination of ""Covid-19 AND 'Randomized Controlled Trial' AND students"", as well as a combination of the following search terms: ""internet"", ""online"", ""treat_"", ""psycholog_"", ""intervention"", ""program_"", ""stress_"", ""depress_"", ""anxiety"", ""university"", ""college"", ""freshm_"", ""sophomore_"", and ""undergraduat_"".

"The Impact of Mortality Salience, Negative Emotions and Cultural Values on Suicidal Ideation in COVID-19: A Conditional Process Model","As suicides incurred by the COVID-19 outbreak keep happening in many countries, researchers have raised concerns that the ongoing pandemic may lead to ""a wave of suicides"" in society. Suicidal ideation (SI) is a critical factor in conducting suicide intervention and also an important indicator for measuring people's mental health. Therefore, it is vital to identify the influencing factors of suicidal ideation and its psychological mechanism during the outbreak. Based on the terror management theory, in the present study we conducted a social media big data analysis to explore the joint effects of mortality salience (MS), negative emotions (NE), and cultural values on suicidal ideation in 337 regions on the Chinese mainland. The findings showed that (1) mortality salience was a positive predictor of suicidal ideation, with negative emotions acting as a mediator; (2) individualism was a positive moderator in the first half-path of the mediation model; (3) collectivism was a negative moderator in the first half-path of the mediation model. Our findings not only expand the application of the terror management theory in suicide intervention but provide some insights into post-pandemic mental healthcare. Timely efforts are needed to provide psychological interventions and counseling on outbreak-caused negative emotions in society. Compared with people living in collectivism-prevailing regions, those living in individualism-prevailing regions may be more vulnerable to mortality salience and negative emotions and need more social attention.","Huang, Li, Li, Yang, Ding, Di, Zhu","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19159200","20220812","big data analysis; collectivism; individualism; negative emotion; suicidal ideation; terror management theory","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",36076,""
"Exploring Barriers and Facilitators to Physical Activity during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Study","Quantitative data show that physical activity (PA) reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic, with differential impacts across demographic groups. Qualitative research is limited; thus, this study aimed to understand barriers and facilitators to PA during the pandemic, focusing on groups more likely to have been affected by restrictions, and to map these onto the capability, opportunity, motivation model of behaviour (COM-B). One-to-one interviews were conducted with younger (aged 18-24) and older adults (aged 70+), those with long-term physical or mental health conditions, and parents of young children. Themes were identified using reflexive thematic analysis and were mapped onto COM-B domains. A total of 116 participants contributed (aged 18-93, 61% female, 71% White British). Key themes were the importance of the outdoor environment, impact of COVID-19 restrictions, fear of contracting COVID-19, and level of engagement with home exercise. Caring responsibilities and conflicting priorities were a barrier. PA as a method of socialising, establishing new routines, and the importance of PA for protecting mental health were motivators. Most themes mapped onto the physical opportunity (environmental factors) and reflective motivation (evaluations/plans) COM-B domains. Future interventions should target these domains during pandemics (e.g., adapting PA guidance depending on location and giving education on the health benefits of PA).","Roche, Fisher, Fancourt, Burton","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19159169","20220812","COM-B model; COVID-19; United Kingdom; physical activity; qualitative","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",36077,""
"What Levers to Promote Teachers' Wellbeing during the COVID-19 Pandemic and Beyond: Lessons Learned from a 2021 Online Study in Six Countries","To highlight effective levers to promote teachers' wellbeing worldwide, particularly during difficult times such as the COVID-19 pandemic, we investigated work-related factors associated with teacher wellbeing, across borders and cultures. In six countries/territories, we examined the factors that were most consistently and strongly associated with two indicators of wellbeing at work: (i) job satisfaction; and (ii) work/life balance, and three indicators of general wellbeing: (i) subjective health; (ii) mental health; and (iii) life satisfaction. Between May and July 2021, after 18 months of the pandemic, 8000 teachers answered the first edition of the International Barometer of Education Personnel's Health and Wellbeing (I-BEST): 3646 teachers from France, 2349 from QuÃƒÂ©bec, 1268 from Belgium, 302 from Morocco, 222 from The Gambia, and 215 from Mexico. For each country/territory and each wellbeing indicator, we used a forward stepwise regression procedure to identify important determinants among a carefully selected set of 31 sociodemographic, private, and professional life factors. Aside from healthcare access, the factors most consistently and strongly associated with teacher wellbeing in France, QuÃƒÂ©bec and Belgium (samples whose size were Ã¢â€°Â¥1000) were related to the psychosocial and the organizational dimensions of work, namely: feeling of safety at school, autonomy at work, and the quality of relationships with superiors and quality of relationships with students. In the smaller samples of teachers from the three remaining countries (Morocco, The Gambia and Mexico), exploratory analyses showed that the feeling of safety and autonomy at work were, there too, consistently associated with wellbeing indicators. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the factors most consistently associated with teachers' wellbeing across countries were related to security and autonomy at work, supporting the importance to consider these aspects in a continuous, structural way at school. Factors associated with teachers' wellbeing in very different contexts require further cross-cultural study.","Billaudeau, Alexander, Magnard, Temam, Vercambre","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19159151","20220812","COVID-19; job satisfaction; life satisfaction; mental health; psychosocial factors; school; social support; teachers; wellbeing; work/life balance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",36078,""
"Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander alcohol, tobacco and other drug use, mental health and treatment need in the United States during COVID-19","Before COVID-19, Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders (NH/PI) endured a heavy burden of alcohol, tobacco and other drug (ATOD) use in prior US data. Responding to reports that many NH/PI communities experienced severe COVID-19 disparities that could exacerbate their ATOD burden, we partnered with NH/PI communities to assess the substance use patterns and treatment needs of diverse NH/PIs during COVID-19. Collaborating with NH/PI community organisations across five states with large NH/PI populations, we conducted a large-scale investigation of NH/PI ATOD use, mental health and treatment need during COVID-19. Between April and November 2021, NH/PI-heritage research staff from our community partners collected data involving 306 NH/PI adults using several community-based recruitment methods (e-mail, telephone, in-person) and two survey approaches: online and paper-and-pencil. Multivariate regressions were conducted to examine potential predictors of NH/PI alcohol use disorder and need for behavioural health treatment. During COVID-19, 47% and 22% of NH/PI adults reported current alcohol and cigarette use, while 35% reported lifetime illicit substance use (e.g., cannabis, opioid). Depression and anxiety were high, and alcohol use disorder, major depression and generalised anxiety disorder prevalence were 27%, 27% and 19%, respectively. One-third of participants reported past-year treatment need with lifetime illicit substance use, COVID-19 distress and major depression respectively associating with 3.0, 1.2, and 5.3 times greater adjusted odds for needing treatment. NH/PI adults reported heavy ATOD use, depression, anxiety and treatment need during COVID-19. Targeted research and treatment services may be warranted to mitigate COVID-19's negative behavioural health impact on NH/PI communities.","Subica, Guerrero, Martin, Okamoto, Aitaoto, Moss, Morey, Wu","https://doi.org/10.1111/dar.13522","20220812","COVID-19; Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders; alcohol; alcohol use disorder; drug use; mental health; tobacco","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",36079,""
"Child, adolescent, and caregiver mental health difficulties and associated risk factors early in the COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa","At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 in South Africa, many safety measures were implemented to protect the lives of the population. Ironically, these same safety measures have negatively impacted on the lives of children and their caregivers resulting in increased mental health problems. This study forms part of the multicountry Co-SPACE (COVID-19: Supporting Parents, Adolescents and Children during Epidemics) study that explores how families are coping during the COVID-19 pandemic, and what caregivers can do to help support their children's mental health. This paper aims to gain a better understanding of the mental health status of families specifically in South Africa in the early onset of the pandemic during restrictive lockdown measures, and identify certain risk factors that might contribute towards deteriorating mental health. Two hundred and fifty-four South African parents and carers of children and adolescents completed an online survey about their child's mental health as well as their own mental health during and post- hard lockdown in South Africa. Data collection took place over the period of the first and second waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa. Results showed that children experienced significantly higher mental health problems than adolescents (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.016). Younger children were particularly negatively affected by lockdown and had more mental health problems than adolescents (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.023); including emotional problems (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.017), misconduct (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.030), and hyperactivity (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Additionally, the presence of special educational needs/neurodevelopmental disorders (SEN/ND) was associated with more mental health problems (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Surprisingly, single parent households, which is another well-known risk factor showed no differences in mental health problems compared to nuclear families. There was also a reciprocal relationship between parental/carer mental health and child/adolescent mental health, with higher level of endorsement of mental health problems in children by parents/caregivers who themselvesÃ‚Â associated with higher levels of depression, anxiety and stress (all p'sÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). These results highlight the dramatic impact that COVID-19 had on children, adolescents and parents in South Africa early in the pandemic, and emphasises the need for specific support structures to be implemented within the SEN/ND community, as well as for younger children and single parent households.","Bloom, Lachman, Gaxo, Pillay, Seedat","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13034-022-00499-2","20220811","Adolescent; COVID-19; Child; Depression Anxiety Stress Scale; Mental health; Pandemic; Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire; Youth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",36080,""
"Pandemic-Related Stress May Be Associated with Symptoms of Poor Mental Health Among African Americans","The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected African Americans and has been a significant source of stress for this population due to increased economic hardship and social isolation. This study characterized the associations between COVID-19 vulnerability (e.g., contracting the illness or losing a loved one), pandemic-related stress, and symptoms of poor mental health among African Americans. The study sample included African Americans (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°304) who responded to an online survey. Symptoms of poor mental health were assessed using the PHQ-4, which assessed symptoms of depression and anxiety. Vulnerability to COVID-19 was measured via self-report in three ways: (1) personal vulnerability, (2) family vulnerability, and (3) community vulnerability (i.e., friends, neighbors, and co-workers). Pandemic-related stress was measured by asking participants to rate how difficult it has been to access essential resources and services, manage finances, and plan or attend social events since March 13, 2020. Data were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression. Results showed that COVID-19 vulnerability was not associated with symptoms of depression or anxiety, but pandemic-related stress was consistently associated with symptoms of poor mental health. Study findings highlight the need to monitor and intervene on pandemic-related stress to prevent further psychological distress within this vulnerable and underserved population.","Brewer, Waring, Noble, Bradley, Olurotimi, Fronheiser, Sifat, Ehlke, K Boozary, McQuoid, Kendzor, Alexander","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40615-022-01383-7","20220811","African Americans; COVID-19; Financial insecurity; Poor mental health; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-13","",36081,""
