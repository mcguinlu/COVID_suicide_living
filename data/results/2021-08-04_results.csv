"[Vaccination Against COVID-19 in Patients Treated with Psychotropic Drugs]","Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been available in the European Union since December 2020. Persons suffering from mental illness have an increased risk of a severe or fatal course following an infection with SARS-CoV-2. Thus, the question arises to what extent interactions between the newly approved vaccines and psychotropic drugs may be expected. Data on the tolerability and efficacy of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 under treatment with psychotropic drugs are not available to date - however, potential interactions can be derived from previous investigations on vaccines against other pathogens, such as a reduced immune response with lower clinical efficacy and an increase in drug plasma levels due to the indirect vaccine-mediated inhibition of metabolizing enzymes. On the other hand, depressed patients treated with antidepressant medication show a better immune response. Seit Dezember 2020 stehen in der EuropÃƒÂ¤ischen Union Impfstoffe gegen SARS-CoV-2 zur VerfÃƒÂ¼gung. Psychisch erkrankte Personen haben ein erhÃƒÂ¶htes Risiko fÃƒÂ¼r einen schweren oder tÃƒÂ¶dlichen Verlauf einer SARS-CoV-2-Infektion. So stellt sich die Frage, inwiefern Interaktionen zwischen den neuen SARS-CoV-2-Impfstoffen und Psychopharmaka zu erwarten sind. GrundsÃƒÂ¤tzlich fehlen bislang noch konkrete Daten ÃƒÂ¼ber die VertrÃƒÂ¤glichkeit und Wirksamkeit einer Impfung gegen SARS-CoV-2 unter Psychopharmakotherapie Ã¢â‚¬â€œ aus Untersuchungen zu Impfstoffen gegen andere Krankheitserreger lassen sich jedoch potenzielle Interaktionen ableiten, wie zum Beispiel eine reduzierte Immunantwort mit geringerer klinischer Wirksamkeit oder eine ErhÃƒÂ¶hung von Medikamentenspiegeln aufgrund einer indirekten Hemmung von metabolisierenden Enzymen durch Impfstoffe. Andererseits zeigen depressive Patienten, die mit Antidepressiva medikamentÃƒÂ¶s behandelt werden, eine bessere Immunantwort.","Seifert, Heck, Eckermann, Singer, Bleich, Grohmann, Toto","https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1531-4460","20210803","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-04","",16773,""
"Patterns of mental health problems before and after easing COVID-19 restrictions: Evidence from a 105248-subject survey in general population in China","The COVID-19 pandemic has alarming implications for individual and population level mental health. Although the future of COVID-19 is unknown at present, more countries or regions start to ease restrictions. The findings from this study have provided the empirical evidence of prevalence and patterns of mental disorders in Chinese general population before and after easing most COVID-19 restrictions, and information of the factors associated with these patterns. A cross-sectional population-based online survey was carried out from February to March 2020 in the general population across all provinces in China. The 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) was incorporated in the survey. Latent class analyses were performed to investigate the patterns of mental disorders and multinomial logistic regressions were used to examine how individual and regional risk factors can predict mental disorder patterns. Four distinctive patterns of mental health were revealed in the general population. After the ease of most COVID-19 restrictions, the prevalence of high risk of mental disorders decreased from 25.8% to 20.9% and prevalence of being high risk of unhappiness and loss of confidence decreased from 10.1% to 8.1%. However, the prevalence of stressed, social dysfunction and unhappy were consistently high before and after easing restrictions. Several regional factors, such as case mortality rate and healthcare resources, were associated with mental health status. Of note, healthcare workers were less likely to have mental disorders, compared to other professionals and students. The dynamic management of mental health and psychosocial well-being is as important as that of physical health both before and after the ease of COVID-19 restrictions. Our findings may help in mental health interventions in other countries and regions while easing COVID-19 restrictions.","Jiang, Chen, Liu, Lin, Liu, Chen, Jiang, Zhang, Chen, Cui, Jiang, Jiang, Zhang, Hu, Li, Li, Li, Pan","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255251","20210803","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-04","",16774,""
"Living Under Coronavirus and Injecting Drugs in Bristol (LUCID-B): A qualitative study of experiences of COVID-19 among people who inject drugs","People who inject drugs (PWID) are a high-risk group for COVID-19 transmission and serious health consequences. Restrictions imposed in the UK in response to the pandemic led to rapid health and housing service alterations. We aimed to examine PWID experiences of: 1) challenges relating to the COVID-19 public health measures; 2) changes to opioid substitution therapy (OST) and harm reduction services; and 3) perceived effects of COVID-19 on drug use patterns and risk behaviour. Telephone semi-structured interviews were conducted with 28 PWID in Bristol, Southwest of England. Analysis followed a reflexive thematic analysis. Concern about COVID-19 and adherence to public health guidance varied. Efforts made by services to continue providing support during the pandemic were appreciated and some changes were preferred, such as less frequent OST collection, relaxation of supervised consumption and needle and syringe programmes (NSP) home delivery. However, remote forms of contact were highlighted as less beneficial and more difficult to engage with than in-person contact. Public health guidance advising people to 'stay home' led to increased isolation, boredom, and time to ruminate which impacted negatively on mental health. Lockdown restrictions directly impacted on sources of income and routine. Changes in drug use were explained as a consequence of isolation and fewer interactions with peers, problems accessing drugs, reduced drug purity and reduced financial resources. This study captures the significant impacts and challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic on the lives of PWID. While rapid adaptations to service delivery to help mitigate the risks of COVID-19 were appreciated and some changes such as relaxation of supervised daily OST consumption were viewed positively, barriers to access need further attention. Going forwards there may be opportunities to harness the positive aspects of some changes to services.","Kesten, Holland, Linton, Family, Scott, Horwood, Hickman, Telfer, Ayres, Hussey, Wilkinson, Hines","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2021.103391","20210803","COVID-19; Drug users; Harm reduction; Injecting; Opioid Substitution Therapy; PWID","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-04","",16775,""
"Effects of tree canopy on psychological distress: A repeated cross-sectional study before and during the COVID-19 epidemic","During the COVID-19 epidemic period, people showed a stronger connection to the environment within their communities. Although tree canopy in residential areas has been shown to positively affect psychological distress, it is not clear whether the COVID-19 epidemic played a role in this process. Elucidation of the relationship between tree canopy and the impact on psychological distress during the COVID-19 epidemic could provide valuable information as to the best methods to help individuals cope with urban mental stress events. A total of 15 randomly selected residential areas of Beijing were enrolled in this repeated cross-sectional study. A total of 900 residents were included in the two-waves of the investigation (450 residents per wave) before and during the COVID-19 epidemic (i.e., May 2019 and May 2020). Psychological distress was estimated using the 12-question General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Tree canopy coverage (TCC) was measured through visual interpretation based on the 2013 data sources (World View 2 satellite imagery of Beijing urban areas with a resolution of 0.5Ã¢â‚¬Â¯m). The demographic characteristics, distance to the nearest surrounding green or blue space, residential area house price, household density, and construction year were also collected in this study. A multivariate logistic regression, relative risk due to interaction (RERI), and synergy index (SI) were used to explore the relationships among tree canopy, COVID-19, and psychological distress. The negative impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on mental health was significant, with the prevalence of psychological distress increased 7.84 times (aORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯7.84, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯4.67-13.95) during the COVID-19 epidemic period. Tree canopy coverage in the group without psychological distress was significantly higher than that of the psychologically distressed group (31.07Ã¢â‚¬Â¯Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬Â¯11.38% vs. 27.87Ã¢â‚¬Â¯Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬Â¯12.97%, PÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.005). An increase in 1% of TCC, was related to a 5% decrease in the prevalence of psychological distress (aORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.95, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.93-0.98). An antagonism joint action between tree canopy and the COVID-19 epidemic existed (RERIÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1.09, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.72-1.47; SIÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.16, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.05-0.52), and persisted enhancing only in medium (26.45%-33.21%) and above TCC level. Correlation of GHQ items and TCC significantly differed between the COVID-19 non-epidemic and epidemic periods, with the effects of tree canopy on GHQ-12 items covering topics, such as social function and depression, presumably absent because of epidemic limitations. This study indicates that the COVID-19 epidemic harmed mental health and verified the positive effects of residential tree canopy on psychological distress in Beijing. We suggest paying more attention to residents in areas of low TCC and dealing with psychological distress caused by public health stress events based on tree canopy strategies.","Zhang, Wang, Chen, Tao, Jin, Wang, Jia","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.111795","20210803","COVID-19 epidemic; Mental health; Psychological distress; Residential tree canopy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-04","",16776,""
"COVID-19, Telehealth, and Pediatric Integrated Primary Care: Disparities in Service Use","The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic (COVID-19) may increase pediatric mental health needs due to its social, economic, and public health threats, especially among Black, Indigenous, and People of Color and those served within disadvantaged communities. COVID-19 protocols have resulted in increased provision of telehealth in integrated primary care (IPC) but little is known about pediatric telehealth IPC utilization during the pandemic for diverse and traditionally underserved groups. A comparative study was conducted to explore variability between in-person (pre-COVID-19; nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°106) and telehealth (mid-COVID-19; nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°120) IPC consultation utilization among children 1-19Ã¢â‚¬â€°years old served through a large, inner-city primary care clinic. Logistic regression modeling was used to examine the association between service delivery modality (i.e., in-person vs. telehealth) and attendance, referral concerns, and several sociodemographic variables. Service delivery modality and attendance, referral concerns, and race/ethnicity were significantly associated. The odds of non-attendance were greater for children scheduled for telehealth, the odds of children with internalizing problems being scheduled for telehealth were greater than those with externalizing problems, and the odds of Black children being scheduled for telehealth were less compared to White children. Though telehealth has helped provide IPC continuity during COVID-19, findings from this study show troubling preliminary data regarding reduced attendance, increased internalizing concerns, and disparities in scheduling for Black patients. Specific actions to monitor and address these early but alarming indications of telehealth and Covid-19 related behavioral health disparities are discussed.","Chakawa, Belzer, Perez-Crawford, Yeh","https://doi.org/10.1093/jpepsy/jsab077","20210803","COVID-19; adolescents; anxiety; behavior problems; depression; evidence-based practice; health disparities and inequities; healthcare services and utilization; patient/provider communication; preschool children; primary care; public health; race/ethnicity; school-age children; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-04","",16777,""
"Challenges and opportunities for osteoporosis care during the COVID-19 pandemic","The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has both directly and indirectly affected osteoporosis diagnosis and treatment throughout the world. This mini-review summarizes the available evidence regarding the effects of COVID-19, its treatment, and the consequences of the pandemic itself on bone health. Additionally, we review evidence and expert recommendations regarding putative effects of osteoporosis medications on COVID-19 outcomes and vaccine efficacy and summarize recommendations for continuation of osteoporosis treatment during the pandemic. The use of standard screening procedures to assess for osteoporosis and fracture risk declined dramatically early in the pandemic, while rates of fragility fractures were largely unchanged. COVID-19, its treatments, and public health measures to prevent viral spread are each likely to negatively affect bone health. Osteoporosis treatments are not known to increase risk of adverse events from COVID-19, and pre-clinical data suggests possible beneficial effects of some therapies. Vitamin D deficiency is clearly associated with adverse outcomes from COVID-19, but it remains unclear whether vitamin D supplementation may improve outcomes. Osteoporosis treatment should be continued whenever possible, and recommendations for substituting therapies, if required, are available. The COVID-19 pandemic has decreased screening and disrupted treatment for osteoporosis. Osteoporosis medications are safe and effective during the pandemic and should be continued whenever possible. Further studies are needed to fully understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on long-term bone health.","Cromer, Yu","https://doi.org/10.1210/clinem/dgab570","20210803","COVID-19; SARS-CoV2; anti-resorptive; osteoporosis; vaccination; vitamin D","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-04","",16778,""
"Mood responses to COVID-19: Implications for family practice in South Africa","The effect of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the mood responses of individuals is an important indicator of how society is coping with the pandemic. Characterising mood responses in a South African sample could prepare clinicians for possible presentations of mental health concerns in general practice. This study described mood responses during COVID-19 Alert Level 1. The sample of 641 participants who completed the Brunel Mood State Scale during November 2020 was drawn from primary healthcare and family medicine clinics and practices in Cape Town. Their mood response profile was described and compared with pre-COVID-19 norms. The mood profile represented an inverse iceberg profile, with mean scores deviating significantly from pre-COVID-19 norms across all six mood dimensions measured. The inverse iceberg profile had been associated with a range of psychopathologies, suggesting an increased risk of psychological disorders. The current profile of mood responses could alert clinicians to the possibility of increased mental health needs of patients. Patient reports of prolonged anxiety and fatigue, particularly when combined with low mood and low vigour, could signal the need for intervention or referral for further mental health support.","Van Wijk, Majola","https://doi.org/10.4102/safp.v63i1.5285","20210803","COVID-19; fatigue; lockdown; mental health; mood","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-04","",16779,""

"Coping strategies, optimism, and resilience factors associated with mental health outcomes among medical residents exposed to coronavirus disease 2019 in Qatar","The aim of this study is to examine the association between coping strategies, resilience, optimism and different mental health outcomes like stress, anxiety, and depression among the medical residents' during the COVID-19 pandemic, with consideration of different factors like seniority, frontliner, gender, and coping style. An electronic survey was sent to all medical residents in Qatar. Depression, anxiety, and stress were assessed by the DASS-21. Professional quality of life was measured by the ProQOL scale. The coping mechanisms were assessed with the Brief-COPE, and resilience was measured by the Brief Resilience Scale. The most commonly used coping strategies were acceptance, religion, and active coping. The avoidant coping style scores were higher among junior residents (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .032) and non-COVID-19 frontliners (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .039). Optimism LOT-R score was higher in senior than in junior residents (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001). Lower avoidant coping scores, higher optimism, and higher resilience were associated with lower stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. It seems that avoidant coping styles can exacerbate depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms in medical residents amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Strategies promoting optimism, resilience, and approach coping styles can decrease the mental health burden of the pandemic on medical residents.","Smida, Khoodoruth, Al-Nuaimi, Al-Salihy, Ghaffar, Khoodoruth, Mohammed, Ouanes","https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.2320","20210803","COVID-19; coping; medical residents; optimism; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-04","",16781,""

"Differential impact of stay-at-home orders on mental health in adults who are homeschooling or ""childless at home"" in time of COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic has forced the confinement of most populations worldwide, through stay-at-home orders. Children have continued their education process at home, supervised by parents, who, in most cases, have adopted the role of prime drivers of their learning processes. In this study, the psychological impact of confinement was explored, as well as the relationship of the forced homeschooling situation with psychological well-being. During their confinement, 400 individuals residing in Spain-165 without children at home (Group 1), 104 parents who dedicated little time to homeschooling (Group 2), and 131 who dedicated more time to homeschooling (Group 3)-responded to an online questionnaire. The results show that confinement threatened the mental health of all the participants but especially Group 3 individuals, who had the highest loneliness, anxiety, and stress levels. Moreover, loneliness, perception of discomfort due to homeschooling, and anxiety exacerbated the stress experienced during confinement. Discomfort due to the homeschooling situation was especially relevant in explaining anxiety and stress for Group 3 individuals. These results suggest that forced homeschooling could be associated with the negative consequences that confinement has on individuals' mental health. Moreover, the results suggest that parents who dedicate more time to homeschooling feel more unprotected and more stressed due to the homeschooling in comparison to Group 2 individuals. Health professionals must pay special attention to parents who dedicate more time to homeschooling, and governments and schools must emphasize social support provision to families during homeschooling situations. La pandemia de la COVID-19 ha impuesto el confinamiento de la mayorÃƒÂ­a de las poblaciones de todo el mundo mediante ÃƒÂ³rdenes de quedarse en casa. Los niÃƒÂ±os han continuado su proceso de escolarizaciÃƒÂ³n en sus hogares, supervisados por los padres, quienes, en la mayorÃƒÂ­a de los casos, han adoptado el papel de impulsores principales de sus procesos de aprendizaje. En este estudio se analizÃƒÂ³ el efecto psicolÃƒÂ³gico del confinamiento, asÃƒÂ­ como la relaciÃƒÂ³n de la situaciÃƒÂ³n forzada de enseÃƒÂ±anza en el hogar con el bienestar psicolÃƒÂ³gico. Durante su confinamiento, 400 personas residentes en EspaÃƒÂ±a -165 sin niÃƒÂ±os en casa (grupo 1), 104 padres que dedicaron poco tiempo a la enseÃƒÂ±anza en el hogar (grupo 2), y 131 que dedicaron mÃƒÂ¡s tiempo a la enseÃƒÂ±anza en el hogar (grupo 3)- respondieron un cuestionario en lÃƒÂ­nea. Los resultados demuestran que el confinamiento amenazÃƒÂ³ la salud mental de todos los participantes, pero especialmente la de las personas del grupo 3, quienes demostraron mayores niveles de soledad, ansiedad y estrÃƒÂ©s. AdemÃƒÂ¡s, la soledad, la percepciÃƒÂ³n de incomodidad a consecuencia de la enseÃƒÂ±anza en el hogar, y la ansiedad agravaron el estrÃƒÂ©s sufrido durante el confinamiento. La incomodidad provocada por la situaciÃƒÂ³n de enseÃƒÂ±anza en el hogar fue especialmente importante para explicar la ansiedad y el estrÃƒÂ©s de las personas del grupo 3. Estos resultados sugieren que la enseÃƒÂ±anza forzada en el hogar podrÃƒÂ­a estar asociada con las consecuencias negativas que tiene el confinamiento en la salud mental. AdemÃƒÂ¡s, los resultados indican que los padres que dedican mÃƒÂ¡s tiempo a la enseÃƒÂ±anza en el hogar se sienten mÃƒÂ¡s desprotegidos y mÃƒÂ¡s estresados debido a este tipo de enseÃƒÂ±anza en comparaciÃƒÂ³n con las personas del grupo 2. Los profesionales de la salud deben prestar especial atenciÃƒÂ³n a los padres que dedican mÃƒÂ¡s tiempo a la enseÃƒÂ±anza en el hogar, y los gobiernos y centros educativos deben brindar mÃƒÂ¡s apoyo social a las familias durante las situaciones de enseÃƒÂ±anza en el hogar. 2019Ã¦â€“Â°Ã¥â€ Â Ã§â€”â€¦Ã¦Â¯â€™(COVID-19)Ã¥Â¤Â§Ã¦ÂµÂÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã§â€”â€¦Ã¨Â¿Â«Ã¤Â½Â¿Ã¤Â¸â€“Ã§â€¢Å’Ã¥Ââ€žÃ¥Å“Â°Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â¤Â§Ã¥Â¤Å¡Ã¦â€¢Â°Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€ºÂ Ã¤Â¸ÂºÃ§â€¢â„¢Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¥Â®Â¶Ã©â€¡Å’Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥â€˜Â½Ã¤Â»Â¤Ã¨Â¢Â«Ã§Â¦ÂÃ©â€”Â­Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¥Â­Â©Ã¥Â­ÂÃ¤Â»Â¬Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¥Â®Â¶Ã©â€¡Å’Ã§Â»Â§Ã§Â»Â­Ã¤Â»â€“Ã¤Â»Â¬Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦â€¢â„¢Ã¨â€šÂ²Ã¨Â¿â€¡Ã§Â¨â€¹Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã§â€Â±Ã§Ë†Â¶Ã¦Â¯ÂÃ§â€ºâ€˜Ã§ÂÂ£Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¥Â¤Â§Ã¥Â¤Å¡Ã¦â€¢Â°Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¥â€ ÂµÃ¤Â¸â€¹Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã§Ë†Â¶Ã¦Â¯ÂÃ¦ËœÂ¯Ã¤Â»â€“Ã¤Â»Â¬Ã¥Â­Â¦Ã¤Â¹Â Ã¨Â¿â€¡Ã§Â¨â€¹Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¤Â¸Â»Ã¨Â¦ÂÃ¦Å½Â¨Ã¥Å Â¨Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¥Å“Â¨Ã¨Â¿â„¢Ã©Â¡Â¹Ã§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¦Ë†â€˜Ã¤Â»Â¬Ã¦Å½Â¢Ã¨Â®Â¨Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã§Â¦ÂÃ©â€”Â­Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã¤Â»Â¥Ã¥ÂÅ Ã¥Â¼ÂºÃ¨Â¿Â«Ã¥Â¼ÂÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â®Â¶Ã¥ÂºÂ­Ã¦â€¢â„¢Ã¨â€šÂ²Ã¥Â¢Æ’Ã¥â€ ÂµÃ¤Â¸Å½Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥â€¦Â³Ã§Â³Â»Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¥Å“Â¨Ã§Â¦ÂÃ©â€”Â­Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Â±â€¦Ã¤Â½ÂÃ¥Å“Â¨Ã¨Â¥Â¿Ã§ÂÂ­Ã§â€°â„¢Ã§Å¡â€ž400Ã¥ÂÂÃ¥Ââ€”Ã¨Â¯â€¢Ã¨â‚¬â€¦--Ã¥â€¦Â¶Ã¤Â¸Â­165Ã¥ÂÂÃ¥Â®Â¶Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¦Â²Â¡Ã¦Å“â€°Ã¥Â­Â©Ã¥Â­ÂÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¤ÂºÂºÃ¯Â¼Ë†Ã§Â¬Â¬1Ã§Â»â€žÃ¯Â¼â€°Ã¯Â¼Å’104Ã¥ÂÂÃ¥Â®Â¶Ã©â€¢Â¿Ã¥Â¾Ë†Ã¥Â°â€˜Ã¦Å“â€°Ã¦â€”Â¶Ã©â€”Â´Ã¨â€¡Â´Ã¥Å â€ºÃ¤ÂºÅ½Ã¥Â®Â¶Ã¥ÂºÂ­Ã¦â€¢â„¢Ã¨â€šÂ²Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§Ë†Â¶Ã¦Â¯ÂÃ¯Â¼Ë†Ã§Â¬Â¬2Ã§Â»â€žÃ¯Â¼â€°Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¤Â»Â¥Ã¥ÂÅ 131Ã¥ÂÂÃ¨Å Â±Ã¨Â¾Æ’Ã¥Â¤Å¡Ã¦â€”Â¶Ã©â€”Â´Ã¨â€¡Â´Ã¥Å â€ºÃ¤ÂºÅ½Ã¥Â®Â¶Ã¥ÂºÂ­Ã¦â€¢â„¢Ã¨â€šÂ²Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§Ë†Â¶Ã¦Â¯ÂÃ¯Â¼Ë†Ã§Â¬Â¬3Ã§Â»â€žÃ¯Â¼â€°--Ã¥â€ºÅ¾Ã§Â­â€Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã¤Â»Â½Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã§ÂºÂ¿Ã¨Â°Æ’Ã¦Å¸Â¥Ã©â€”Â®Ã¥ÂÂ·Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“Ã¦ËœÂ¾Ã§Â¤ÂºÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã§Â¦ÂÃ©â€”Â­Ã¥Â¨ÂÃ¨Æ’ÂÃ§Ââ‚¬Ã¦â€°â‚¬Ã¦Å“â€°Ã¥Ââ€šÃ¤Â¸Å½Ã¨â‚¬â€¦Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¤Â½â€ Ã§â€°Â¹Ã¥Ë†Â«Ã¦ËœÂ¯Ã§Â¬Â¬3Ã§Â»â€žÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¤ÂºÂºÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã¤Â»â€“Ã¤Â»Â¬Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â­Â¤Ã§â€¹Â¬Ã¦â€žÅ¸Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¥Å½â€¹Ã¥Å â€ºÃ¦Â°Â´Ã¥Â¹Â³Ã¦Å“â‚¬Ã©Â«ËœÃ£â‚¬â€šÃ¦Â­Â¤Ã¥Â¤â€“Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Â­Â¤Ã§â€¹Â¬Ã¦â€žÅ¸Ã£â‚¬ÂÃ¥Â¯Â¹Ã¥Â®Â¶Ã¥ÂºÂ­Ã¦â€¢â„¢Ã¨â€šÂ²Ã¥Â¸Â¦Ã¦ÂÂ¥Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¤Â¸ÂÃ©â‚¬â€šÃ¦â€žÅ¸Ã¥â€™Å’Ã§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã¦â€žÅ¸Ã¥Å Â Ã¥â€°Â§Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã§Â¦ÂÃ©â€”Â­Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Å½â€¹Ã¥Å â€ºÃ£â‚¬â€šÃ¥Å“Â¨Ã¨Â§Â£Ã©â€¡Å Ã§Â¬Â¬3Ã§Â»â€žÃ¤ÂºÂºÃ§Å¡â€žÃ§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¥Å½â€¹Ã¥Å â€ºÃ¦â€”Â¶Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã§â€Â±Ã¤ÂºÅ½Ã¥Â®Â¶Ã¥ÂºÂ­Ã¦â€¢â„¢Ã¨â€šÂ²Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¥â€ ÂµÃ©â‚¬Â Ã¦Ë†ÂÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¤Â¸ÂÃ©â‚¬â€šÃ¦â€žÅ¸Ã¥Â°Â¤Ã¤Â¸ÂºÃ©â€¡ÂÃ¨Â¦ÂÃ£â‚¬â€šÃ¨Â¿â„¢Ã¤Âºâ€ºÃ§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“Ã¨Â¡Â¨Ã¦ËœÅ½Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¥Â¼ÂºÃ¨Â¿Â«Ã¥Â®Â¶Ã¥ÂºÂ­Ã¦â€¢â„¢Ã¨â€šÂ²Ã¥ÂÂ¯Ã¨Æ’Â½Ã¤Â¸Å½Ã§Â¦ÂÃ©â€”Â­Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¤Â¸ÂªÃ¤ÂºÂºÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã¤ÂºÂ§Ã§â€Å¸Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦Â¶Ë†Ã¦Å¾ÂÃ¥ÂÅ½Ã¦Å¾Å“Ã¦Å“â€°Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¦Â­Â¤Ã¥Â¤â€“Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“Ã¨Â¡Â¨Ã¦ËœÅ½Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¤Â¸Å½Ã§Â¬Â¬2Ã§Â»â€žÃ¤Â¸ÂªÃ¤Â½â€œÃ§â€ºÂ¸Ã¦Â¯â€Ã¯Â¼Å’Ã¤Â¸ÂºÃ¥Â®Â¶Ã¥ÂºÂ­Ã¦â€¢â„¢Ã¨â€šÂ²Ã¦Å â€¢Ã¥â€¦Â¥Ã¦â€ºÂ´Ã¥Â¤Å¡Ã¦â€”Â¶Ã©â€”Â´Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§Ë†Â¶Ã¦Â¯ÂÃ¦â€žÅ¸Ã¥Ë†Â°Ã¦â€ºÂ´Ã¥Â¤Å¡Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¤Â¸ÂÃ¥Ââ€”Ã¤Â¿ÂÃ¦Å Â¤Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¦â€ºÂ´Ã¥Â¤Å¡Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Å½â€¹Ã¥Å â€ºÃ£â‚¬â€šÃ¥ÂÂ«Ã§â€Å¸Ã¤Â¸â€œÃ¤Â¸Å¡Ã¤ÂºÂºÃ¥â€˜ËœÃ¥Â¿â€¦Ã©Â¡Â»Ã§â€°Â¹Ã¥Ë†Â«Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã¦Â³Â¨Ã©â€šÂ£Ã¤Âºâ€ºÃ¨Å Â±Ã¦â€ºÂ´Ã¥Â¤Å¡Ã¦â€”Â¶Ã©â€”Â´Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¥Â®Â¶Ã¥ÂºÂ­Ã¦â€¢â„¢Ã¨â€šÂ²Ã¤Â¸Å Ã§Å¡â€žÃ§Ë†Â¶Ã¦Â¯ÂÃ¯Â¼Å’Ã¨â‚¬Å’Ã¦â€Â¿Ã¥ÂºÅ“Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¥Â­Â¦Ã¦Â Â¡Ã¥Â¿â€¦Ã©Â¡Â»Ã¥Â¼ÂºÃ¨Â°Æ’Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¥Â®Â¶Ã¤Â¸Å Ã¥Â­Â¦Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â®Â¶Ã¥ÂºÂ­Ã¦â€¢â„¢Ã¨â€šÂ²Ã¦Æ’â€¦Ã¥â€ ÂµÃ¤Â¸â€¹Ã¥Ââ€˜Ã¥Â®Â¶Ã¥ÂºÂ­Ã¦ÂÂÃ¤Â¾â€ºÃ§Â¤Â¾Ã¤Â¼Å¡Ã¦â€Â¯Ã¦Å’ÂÃ£â‚¬â€š.","Cuadrado, Arenas, Moyano, Tabernero","https://doi.org/10.1111/famp.12698","20210803","Anxiety; COVID-19; Homeschooling stress; Loneliness; Perceived social support provided by school staff; Stress; ansiedad; enseÃƒÂ±anza en el hogar; estrÃƒÂ©s; soledad; Ã¥Å½â€¹Ã¥Å â€º; Ã¥Â­Â¤Ã§â€¹Â¬; Ã¥Â®Â¶Ã¥ÂºÂ­Ã¦â€¢â„¢Ã¨â€šÂ²; Ã§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-04","",16783,""
"[Neuropsychiatric Aspects of COVID-19 - A Narrative Overview]","The SARS-CoV-2 virus (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Type 2) and COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) can affect numerous organ systems. In the present paper we offer an overview of the current state of knowledge about the psychiatric aspects of SARS-CoV-2 infection.Medline, Embase und LIVIVO were searched for relevant literature, the last query dating from March 2nd, 2021. Different stress factors in the context of the pandemic can lead to manifest mental illnesses. In addition, there is a risk of neuropsychological changes due to the biological effects of the virus itself.Our work describes the psychological symptoms of COVID-19 sufferers themselves and the psychological effects of the epidemic and the associated socio-economic and psychosocial stress factors on those who are not sick.The most common psychiatric complication among people with COVID-19 is delirium, while hospitalized patients seem to have an increased incidence of symptoms of anxiety, depression and PTSD. There are many case reports on psychotic disorders. In general, an existing psychiatric illness (especially dementia and psychotic disorders) also increases the risk of infection and of a more severe course of the disease. After recovery from COVID-19 infection, there is also a higher incidence of mental illnesses, in particular ""Chronic Post-SARS Syndrome"" with its manifestations such as fatigue, anxiety, depression and PTSD. In addition, the course of dementia seems to be negatively influenced by an infection with SARS-CoV-2.The second part deals with the effects of the epidemic as a stressor and the established socio-political measures on the mental health of people with and without previous mental illnesses. The literature currently available shows high symptom values for anxiety and depressive disorders as well as post-traumatic stress disorders, stress, suicidality, sleep disorders etc. Risk factors seem to include female gender, younger age and fewer resources, as well as previous psychiatric or physical illnesses. Extrinsic factors such as high infection rates, large numbers of deaths, long curfews/lockdowns, low trust in the government and ineffective measures against economic and social consequences increase the burden. Das Virus SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Type 2) und die von ihm ausgelÃƒÂ¶ste Erkrankung COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) kÃƒÂ¶nnen zahlreiche Organsysteme betreffen. In vorliegender Arbeit bieten wir einen ÃƒÅ“berblick bezÃƒÂ¼glich des aktuellen Wissensstands ÃƒÂ¼ber die psychiatrischen Aspekte der SARS-CoV-2 Infektion.Die Datenbanken Medline, Embase und LIVIVO wurden nach relevanter Literatur untersucht, die letzte Abfrage erfolgte am 02.03.2021. Unterschiedliche Stressfaktoren im Rahmen der Epidemie kÃƒÂ¶nnen zu manifesten psychischen Erkrankungen fÃƒÂ¼hren. ZusÃƒÂ¤tzlich besteht das Risiko psychischer VerÃƒÂ¤nderungen durch die biologischen Effekte des Virus selbst.Beschrieben werden in unserer Arbeit psychische Symptome von an COVID-19 Erkrankten selbst sowie die psychischen Auswirkungen der Epidemie und der damit einhergehenden sozioÃƒÂ¶konomischen und psychosozialen Stressfaktoren auch auf nicht Erkrankte.Bei an COVID-19 Erkrankten zeigen sich als hÃƒÂ¤ufigste psychiatrische Komplikation das Auftreten von Delirien, bei hospitalisierten Patienten scheint es zu gehÃƒÂ¤uftem Auftreten von Symptomen von Angst, Depression und posttraumatischen BelastungsstÃƒÂ¶rungen zu kommen. Es liegen auch zahlreiche Kasuistiken ÃƒÂ¼ber psychotische StÃƒÂ¶rungen vor. Allgemein steigert eine vorliegende psychiatrische Erkrankung (besonders eine psychotische oder dementielle StÃƒÂ¶rung) auch das Risiko einer Infektion und eines schweren Verlaufes. Nach Ablauf einer COVID-19-Infektion ist ebenfalls eine hÃƒÂ¶here Inzidenz von psychischen Erkrankungen zu finden, hier ist das Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Chronic Post-SARS SyndromeÃ¢â‚¬Å“ mit seinen AusprÃƒÂ¤gungen wie Fatigue, Angst, Depression und PTSD zu nennen. AuÃƒÅ¸erdem scheint der Verlauf einer dementiellen Erkrankung durch eine Infektion mit SARS-CoV-2 negativ beeinflusst zu werden.Ferner wird auf die Auswirkungen eingegangen, die das Bedrohungsszenario der Epidemie und die etablierten gesellschaftlichen SchutzmaÃƒÅ¸nahmen auf die psychische Gesundheit von Menschen mit und ohne psychische Vorerkrankungen haben. Es zeigen sich hier in der derzeit vorliegenden Literatur hohe Symptomwerte betreffend Angst- und depressiven StÃƒÂ¶rungen sowie posttraumatischen BelastungsstÃƒÂ¶rungen, Stress, SuizidalitÃƒÂ¤t, SchlafstÃƒÂ¶rungen, etc. Risikofaktoren scheinen unter anderem weibliches Geschlecht, jÃƒÂ¼ngeres Alter und geringere Ressourcen sowie psychische oder kÃƒÂ¶rperliche Vorerkrankungen darzustellen. Extrinsische Faktoren wie z-B. hohes Infektionsgeschehen, groÃƒÅ¸e Anzahl von TodesfÃƒÂ¤llen, lange Ausgangssperren/Lockdowns, geringes Vertrauen in die Regierung und ineffektive MaÃƒÅ¸nahmen gegen wirtschaftliche und soziale Folgen steigern die Belastung.","Rittmannsberger, Barth, Malik, Yazdi","https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1523-3850","20210803","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-04","",16784,""
"Chronic fatigue syndrome: an emerging sequela in COVID-19 survivors?","SARS-CoV-2 survivors may report persistent symptoms that resemble myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). We explored (a) ME/CFS-like symptom prevalence and (b) whether axonal, inflammatory, and/or lung changes may contribute to ME/CFS-like symptoms in SARS-CoV-2 survivors through clinical, neuropsychiatric, neuropsychological, lung function assessment, and serum neurofilament light chain, an axonal damage biomarker. ME/CFS-like features were found in 27% of our sample. ME/CFS-like group showed worse sleep quality, fatigue, pain, depressive symptoms, subjective cognitive complaints, Borg baseline dyspnea of the 6-min walking test vs. those without ME/CFS-like symptoms.

"Exploring the factors associated with coronaphobia among physicians during the COVID-19 outbreak in Egypt","Coronaphobia refers to intensified and persistent fears of contracting COVID-19 virus infection. This study aimed to evaluate the newly termed phenomenon, coronaphobia, and address its associated correlates among Egyptian physicians during the outbreak. A cross-sectional study, including a total of 426 Egyptian physicians working during COVID-19 outbreak, was conducted between March 1st and May 1st, 2020. The Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were utilized for assessment of coronaphobia, and comorbid anxiety and depressive symptoms among physicians, respectively during the outbreak. Moderate-to-severe symptoms of anxiety and depression were reported by 28% and 30% of physicians, respectively. Physicians experiencing higher levels of coronaphobia were more likely to be females, nonsmokers, having death wishes and/or self-harming thoughts, receiving insufficient training, dissatisfied with their personal protective equipment (PPE), and had colleagues infected with COVID-19 virus infection. Coronaphobia was positively correlated with anxiety (<i>r</i> = 0.59, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) and depressive symptoms (<i>r</i> = 0.47, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). Egyptian physicians experienced higher levels of coronaphobia, anxiety, and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak. Yet, frontline physicians did not differ from their second-line counterparts regarding the aforementioned symptoms. Routine mental and physical assessment measures of medical staff should be implemented.","Abdelghani, Hassan, Elgohary, Fouad","https://doi.org/10.1186/s41983-021-00357-6","20210803","COVID-19 outbreak; Coronaphobia; Egypt; Physicians","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-04","",16786,""
"Psychological distress and moral injury to oncologists and their patients during COVID-19 pandemic","The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare systems has been unprecedented, and the psychological effects on cancer patients and health care professionals are likely to be significant and long-lasting. The traditional methods of face-to-face health care interactions have been replaced by virtual consultations to reduce exposure to COVID-19 infection. This has put the healthcare professional under tremendous psychological pressure and led to considerable anxiety and distress among cancer patients. Treatment decisions have had to be adjusted to account for a healthcare system that has been temporarily consumed by the care of people with COVID-19, and this has put cancer patients at risk of inferior outcomes. This has had the potential to cause moral injury and psychological distress to health care professionals as well as patients, who have had to deal with a range of stressors due to the uncertainty, sense of loss of control, reduced accessibility to medications and social support, changes to personal circumstances (e.g. financial pressures) and fear of death due to COVID-19 infection. Long term consequences also include post-traumatic responses and complex grief reactions. Cancer services in particular should gear themselves to recognize and monitor these effects and allocate adequate resources to combat them in the months and years to come.","Rashid, Reeder, Sahu, Rashid","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-02128-1","20210803","COVID-19; Cancer clinicians; Cancer patients; Elderly; Healthcare professionals; Mental health; Moral injury and psychological distress; Oncologists","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-04","",16787,""
"[""Now You're Talking!""]","The survey ""Jetzt Sprichst Du!"" (""Now you're talking!"") impressively demonstrates the psychosocial burden and impairments of children and adolescents in Austria during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As part of an online questionnaire, 5483 children and adolescents betweenÃ‚Â 6 and 18Ã‚Â years of age were asked about their feelings, fears, worries, and assessments regarding the coronavirus pandemic. As can be seen, children and adolescents are worried about the situation, and girls are more burdened by this across all age groups. The study also clearly shows that the risk of aÃ‚Â COVID-19-associated hospitalization is massively overestimated by children and adolescents, similar to adults. In addition, a great lack of perspective caused by the constantly challenging situation is evident across all age groups. Feelings of fury, anger, loneliness, and sadness are reported much more frequently than previously. Last but not least, our study shows an alarming reduction of sleep quality and a drastic increase in self-reported sleep problem already in this young population. The data from the ""Jetzt Sprichst Du!"" survey emphasize the need for inevitable and rapid action in order to limit the psychosocial and health-related collateral damage and to reduce the negative impact on young people's psychological development, as far as this is still possible today.","Schabus, Eigl","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00608-021-00909-2","20210803","Children; Collateral damage; Corona; Mental health; Psychosocial burden","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-04","",16788,""

"The Impact of Knowledge, Anxiety and Fear on Psychological Distress during COVID-19 among Residents of the United Arab Emirates","<b>Objectives:</b> COVID-19 has become a global concern, affecting both physical and mental health. In this study, we measured knowledge, fear, anxiety, and psychological distress related to COVID-19 among residents of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). <b>Methods:</b> A total of 1053 adult participants completed a Web-based cross-sectional survey. <b>Results:</b> Our data revealed 75.7% of the sample to be knowledgeable about COVID-19, 15.3% had experienced anxiety and 50.4%, psychological distress about COVID-19. Being knowledgeable about COVID-19 was significantly associated with having spent one to 2 hours reading about COVID-19. There was also an association between being knowledgeable about COVID-19 and low levels of anxiety and psychological distress. Psychological distress was associated with a history of mental illness (76.2%), anxiety (85.1%), and fear of COVID-19 (21Ã‚Â±6.6). Age, history of mental illness (OR = 3.70, 95% CI = 2.35-5.82, p &lt; .001), and COVID-19 anxiety (OR = 2.48, 95% CI = 1.48-4.13, p &lt; .001) and fear (OR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.14-1.20, p &lt; .001) were risk factors for psychological distress. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our results showed significant psychological distress in the UAE population. Providing pre-recorded workshops and continuous telemedicine on biopsychosocial perspectives of COVID-19 may enhance the COVID-19 insight and reduce the COVID-19 anxiety and psychological distress.","Saravanan, Mahmoud","https://doi.org/10.5993/AJHB.45.4.15","20210803","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-04","",16790,""
"Effect of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health hospital admissions: comparative population-based study","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic caused mental health services to be downscaled to abide by the public health restrictions issued. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the pandemic and resultant restrictions had an impact on Malta's admissions to hospital for mental health issues by assessing the number and nature of psychiatric admissions to our only national mental health hospital. Data collection was carried out retrospectively for the 13-week period between 7 March 2020 and 4 June 2020, compared with the equivalent in 2019. Demographic data was obtained and descriptive statistical analysis through the use of the Ãâ€¡Ã‚Â²-test, z-test and logistic regression model were used to compare both data-sets, using a P-value of 0.05. An overall reduction in admissions to hospital was noted in 2020 when compared with 2019, recorded to be lowest in March 2020 with a steady acceleration of admissions up until May 2020 (Ãâ€¡2(3) = 22.573, P &lt; 0.001). This coincided with a decelerated rate of positive COVID-19 cases locally. In 2020, there were significantly higher female admissions (Ãâ€¡2(1) = 10.197, P &lt; 0.001), increased presentations of self-harm/suicidal ideation (P &lt; 0.001) and higher involuntary admissions using the Mental Health Act (Ãâ€¡2(1) = 4.904, P = 0.027). The logistic regression model identified total length of stay in hospital, primary mental health diagnosis, gender and month of admission as variables significantly associated with an admission. Our first population-wide study confirms that the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent public health restrictions had an impact on the population's hospital admissions for mental health issues.","Bonello, Zammit, Grech, Camilleri, Cremona","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2021.975","20210803","COVID-19; hospital admission; pandemic; population-study; suicidality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-04","",16791,""

In line with the initial aim, we investigated students' change of mental health, perceived learning environment and burdens in the 'new normal'. Students in a newly founded German medical study programme (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°63) answered a questionnaire each semester (October 2019Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°entering medical school; December 2019Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°'old normal'; June 2020Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°'new normal'; December 2020Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°'new normal') on their well-being (FAHW-12), burnout (Maslach Inventory), depression (PHQ-9), perception of the learning environment (DREEM), burdens and protective attitudes in the 'new normal' (items designed for the study). Friedman tests reveal overall significant differences (all pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã‚Â .001) in depression and burnout (emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation, personal accomplishment); changes in well-being were identified as just non-significant (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã‚Â .05). The effects were explained by a significant increase in burnout and depression identified post-hoc from October 2019 to December 2019. No increase in severity was identified in the 'new normal' semesters. The learning environment was perceived positively even with a significant improvement for June 2020 (repeated measures ANOVA pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). Study-related burdens (e.g. procrastination of online-learning material) took on greater relevance than burdens related to physicians' occupation (e.g. potential for students' recruitment to the healthcare system during their studies). The 'new' when entering medical school had a greater impact on our students' mental health than the 'new normal'. The readiness for change in the context of a newly designed study programme may have been beneficial with regard to students' positively perceived learning environment during the virtual semesters. Monitoring medical students' mental health longitudinally should be a concern regardless of a pandemic.","Schindler, Polujanski, Rotthoff","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-021-02798-2","20210803","Burnout; COVID-19; Depression; First-year medical students; Learning environment; Mental health; New normal; Undergraduate medical students; Virtual learning; Well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-04","",16792,""
"Stress reactions in a tertiary oto-rhino-laryngological department during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Danish Capital region","Health care workers (HCW) at otorhinolaryngological departments have an increased risk of contracting COVID-19, due to aerosol-inducing diagnostic and surgical procedures in the airways. The ongoing exposure to physical and psychological stressors could impact the mental health of HCW. To investigate the impact on mental health in an otorhinolaryngological department during the COVID-19 pandemic. Cross-sectional questionnaire study, assessing symptoms of depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-10). Physicians, nurses, and secretaries were included at a tertiary department of otorhinolaryngology in the Capital Region of Denmark during the COVID-19 lockdown in spring 2020. Positive screenings for stress reactions were found in 22% for depressive symptoms and 15.5% anxiety. 27% feared becoming infected, 47% feared infecting their families in relation to work. 27% felt others were distancing from them, and 38% isolated themselves from others because of their work. Women had an odds ratio of 9.18 (CI 1.49-179) for depressive stress reactions. HCW were primarily concerned with transmitting COVID-19 to their relatives. Secondarily, there was a concern about becoming infected despite feeling adequately protected by personal protective equipment. Women were at higher risk of more severe depressive symptoms when corrected for professions.","BrejnebÃƒÂ¸l, Walvik, Christensen, Jensen, von Buchwald","https://doi.org/10.1080/00016489.2021.1947525","20210803","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; health care worker; mental health; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-04","",16793,""
