"How the COVID-19 contingency affects children","Due to the pandemic, children are undergoing many changes in their daily lives. We analyzed how parents perceive the effects of the contingency on their children through an online survey shared by digital media for 7 days. We obtained 4000 responses. The most frequent difficulty of the children was online homeschooling (30.4%), followed by sleeping disorders (20.3%). The use of screens increased 30-80% in over 65% of children. Tantrum was detected in 34% and mood swings in 30% of children. The majority of parents (77.8%) considered that distance education does not guarantee children's education and that the level of learning acquired through online classes is not the same as that of face-to-face education (83.5%). In contrast, 70.6% of parents considered that it is not yet time to reopen schools, 78.8% believed that there is sufficient evidence to keep them closed, and 45% indicated that it is better not to return to campus this year. Regarding activities to improve mental health during the contingency, 51.3% have created home games, and 23.6% perform physical activity. However, 74.4% do not have the peace of mind to restart daily life. Among the positive aspects of the contingency, adaptability (35%) and family union (33.5%) were reported. Health professionals in contact with children must be prepared for the problems that this contingency is generating and sensitize parents to observe their children and seek professional help on any alarm data on the emotional or behavioral state of the child. Debido a la pandemia, la poblaciÃƒÂ³n infantil ha experimentado cambios en varios aspectos de su vida cotidiana. Se analizÃƒÂ³ la percepciÃƒÂ³n de los padres con respecto a los efectos de la contingencia en sus hijos a travÃƒÂ©s de una encuesta en lÃƒÂ­nea compartida por medios digitales durante 7 dÃƒÂ­as. Se obtuvieron 4000 respuestas. La dificultad mÃƒÂ¡s frecuente a la que se enfrentan los niÃƒÂ±os en la pandemia son las clases en lÃƒÂ­nea en casa (30.4%), seguida de problemas para dormir (20.3%). Se identificÃƒÂ³ un incremento en el uso de pantallas del 30-80% en mÃƒÂ¡s del 65% de los niÃƒÂ±os. Se detectaron berrinches en el 34% y cambios de humor en el 30% de los niÃƒÂ±os. La mayorÃƒÂ­a de los padres (77.8%) consideraron que la educaciÃƒÂ³n a distancia no garantiza la educaciÃƒÂ³n de los niÃƒÂ±os, y que el nivel de aprendizaje de las clases en lÃƒÂ­nea no es igual que el de las clases presenciales (83.5%). Por otro lado, el 70.6% de los padres opinaron que no es momento para abrir los colegios, el 78.8% indicaron que existe evidencia para mantenerlos cerrados y el 45% consideraron que es mejor no regresar este aÃƒÂ±o al plantel. En cuanto a actividades para mejorar la salud mental en la contingencia, el 51.3% han creado juegos en casa y el 23.6% realizan actividad fÃƒÂ­sica. Sin embargo, el 74.4% no tienen tranquilidad para reiniciar su vida cotidiana. Dentro de las cosas positivas de la contingencia, se reportÃƒÂ³ adaptabilidad (35%) y uniÃƒÂ³n familiar (33.5%). Los profesionales de la salud en contacto con niÃƒÂ±os deben estar preparados para los problemas generados por esta contingencia y sensibilizar a los padres para observar a sus hijos y solicitar ayuda si detectan datos de alarma del estado emocional o conductual del niÃƒÂ±o.","ResÃƒÂ©ndiz-Aparicio","https://doi.org/10.24875/BMHIM.20000140","20210624","COVID-19; Children; Contingencia; Contingency; Coronavirus disease 2019; Encuesta; NiÃƒÂ±os; Survey","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-25","",15326,""
"The effect of mental health on sleep quality of front-line medical staff during the COVID-19 outbreak in China: A cross-sectional study","The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is a public health emergency of international concern and poses a challenge to the mental health and sleep quality of front-line medical staff (FMS). The aim of this study was to investigate the sleep quality of FMS during the COVID-19 outbreak in China and analyze the relationship between mental health and sleep quality of FMS. From February 24, 2020 to March 22, 2020, a cross-sectional study was performed with 543 FMS from a medical center in Western China. A self-reported questionnaire was used to collect data anonymously. The following tests were used: The Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) for symptoms of anxiety, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) for depressive symptoms, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) for sleep quality assessment. Of the 543 FMS, 216 (39.8%) were classified as subjects with poor sleep quality. Anxiety (P&lt;0.001), depression (P&lt;0.001), and the prevalence of those divorced or widowed (P&lt;0.05) were more common in FMS with poor sleep quality than in participants with good sleep quality. The FMS exhibiting co-occurrence of anxiety and depression were associated with worse scores on sleep quality than those medical staff in the other three groups/categories. The difference in sleep quality between the FMS with only depression and the FMS experiencing co-occurrence of anxiety and depression was statistically significant (P&lt;0.05). However, there was no significant difference in sleep quality between the FMS experiencing only anxiety and the FMS with co-occurrence of anxiety and depression (P &gt; 0.05). During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a noteworthy increase in the prevalence of negative emotions and sentiments among the medical staff, along with poor overall sleep quality. We anticipate that this study can stimulate more research into the mental state of FMS during outbreaks and other public health emergencies. In addition, particular attention must be paid to enhance the sleep quality of FMS, along with better planning and support for FMS who are continuously exposed to the existing viral epidemic by virtue of the nature of their profession.","Yue, Zhao, Xiao, Zhuo, Yu, Meng","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253753","20210624","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-25","",15327,""
"Mechanisms of parental distress during and after the first COVID-19 lockdown phase: A two-wave longitudinal study","In these unpredictable times of the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, parents worldwide are affected by the stress and strain caused by the physical distancing protocols that have been put in place. In a two-wave longitudinal survey, we investigated the levels of parental stress and symptoms of anxiety and depression in a sample of parents at two time points; during the implementation of the strictest physical distancing protocols following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (T1, N = 2,868) and three months after the discontinuation of the protocols (T2, N = 1,489). Further, we investigated the relationships between parental stress and anxiety and depression relative to relationship quality and anger toward their children at the two aforementioned time points, including subgroups based on age, parental role, cultural background, relationship status, education level, number of children, employment status and pre-existing psychiatric diagnosis. Parents were asked to fill out a set of validated questionnaires on the two measurement points. Parental stress significantly decreased from T1 to T2, indicating that the cumulative stress that parents experienced during the implementation of the distancing protocols declined when the protocols were phased out. The decrease of perceived parental stress was accompanied by a significant decrease in the symptoms of both depression and anxiety among the participating parents. Symptoms meeting the clinical cut-offs for depression (23.0%) and generalized anxiety disorder (23.3%) were reported among participating parents at T1, compared to 16.8% and 13.8% at T2, respectively. The reduction in depression and anger toward their child(ren) from T1 to T2 was associated with a reduction of parental stress. Relationship quality and anger toward their child(ren) at T1 further predicted a change in the level of parental stress from T1 to T2. The study underlines the negative psychological impacts of the implementation of the distancing protocols on parents' health and well-being. Uncovering the nature of how these constructs are associated with parents and families facing a social crisis such as the ongoing pandemic may contribute to the design of relevant interventions to reduce parental distress and strengthen parental coping and resilience.","Johnson, Skjerdingstad, Ebrahimi, Hoffart, Urnes Johnson","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253087","20210624","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-25","",15328,""

"Mental Stress, Anxiety and Depressive Symptoms and Interleuken-6 Level among Healthcare Workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic","This study aimed to evaluate the interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels and its relationship to stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms among healthcare workers (HCWs) compared to controls during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 80 HCWs in Suez Canal University Hospital in Ismailia, Egypt, and 80 controls were analyzed during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS 21) questionnaire was used, and serum IL-6 level was determined in both groups. IL-6 levels were high in 81.2% (65) of HCWs compared to 36% (45) of controls (<i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05). The DASS score was higher in participants with high IL-6 levels (&gt;3Ã¢â‚¬â€°ng/mL) than in those with mild to moderate levels (<i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05). The regression model revealed that the type of work as a healthcare staff, irregular or night shift, and stress were predictors of increased IL-6 levels among the studied sample (<i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05) (odds ratioÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°20.30, 2.44, and 2.04, respectively).

"Effect of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health among Bangladeshi healthcare professionals: A cross-sectional study","The COVID-19 has been spreading across the world since December 2019. The pandemic has created tremendous fear of death from infection and awful psychological pressure on healthcare professionals (HCPs). The measures of psychological effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on the Bangladeshi HCPs are unknown. The present study aimed to assess the mental health outcomes of Bangladeshi HCPs and associated risk factors. We conducted this cross-sectional study from July 15 to September 20, 2020. A total of 355 HCPs aged between 20 and 60Ã¢â‚¬â€°years residing in Bangladesh participated in this study. All the participants completed a self-administered questionnaire through Google Forms consisting of socio-demographic characteristics and mental health outcomes. We measure loneliness, depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance using the UCLA loneliness scale-8, patient health questionnaire-9, 7-item generalized anxiety disorder scale, Pittsburgh sleep quality index. The present study observed the prevalence of loneliness, depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance among HCPs were 89%, 44%, 78%, and 87%, respectively. The factors significantly associated with the development of mental health problems among HCPs were working environment, economic condition, education level, area of residence, marital status, gender differences, professional category, body mass index, and smoking habit. Moreover, we have seen significant correlations among the different mental health outcomes. In Bangladesh, a large portion of HCPs reported mental health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 pandemic incredibly impacted the psychological health of Bangladeshi healthcare professionals. Appropriate supportive programs and interventional initiatives might help the HCPs with mental health problems during and after this pandemic.","Repon, Pakhe, Quaiyum, Das, Daria, Islam","https://doi.org/10.1177/00368504211026409","20210624","Bangladesh; COVID-19; anxiety; depression; healthcare professionals; loneliness; mental health; sleep disturbance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-25","",15331,""
"Work Patterns of Women Physicians During Vacation: A Cross-Sectional Study","<b> <i>Background:</i> </b> Burnout and poor work-life integration (WLI) are prevalent among women physicians. Vacation may help alleviate burnout and improve WLI but working while on vacation may negate these potential benefits. Little is known about the work patterns of women physicians on vacation, and we attempted to further characterize it in this study. <b> <i>Methods:</i> </b> In this online cross-sectional study of 498 members of the Physician Women in Leadership Facebook Group, we collected demographic information, information regarding burnout/WLI, self-reported work patterns while on vacation, and perceived impact of working during vacation on burnout/WLI. We also asked about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on these behaviors. <b> <i>Results:</i> </b> At baseline, 37.5% of respondents reported burnout and 58.4% reported lack of satisfaction with WLI. About 94.4% of respondents reported engaging in some level of work-related behavior while on vacation (primarily answering work-related emails and participating in work-related meetings), but 73.3% reported that such engagement was detrimental to their mental health and WLI. About 66.3% reported an increase in at least one work-related behavior on vacation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Respondents identified and/or endorsed multiple strategies to reduce work-related engagement on vacation, many involving good modeling by leadership and/or national associations. <b> <i>Conclusions:</i> </b> Engagement in work-related behavior while on vacation is almost universal among women physicians, but most feel that it has negative effects on mental health and WLI.

"Functional, cognitive, and nutritional decline in 435 elderly nursing home residents after the first wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic","Many institutionalized older people have died during the first wave of COVID-19. Other related consequences have not yet been described objectively. The aim of this study was to compare functional, cognitive, and nutritional status before and after the first wave among nursing home residents, in both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. Older adults institutionalized in four nursing homes were assessed from May to June 2020, by a geriatric multidisciplinary team in collaboration with the nursing homes staff. Comprehensive geriatric assessment was performed including functional, cognitive, and nutritional variables before and after the first wave of the pandemic. Data from residents with positive results for microbiological testing for SARS-CoV-2 were compared with those who did not. 435 nursing home residents were included. The median age was 86.77Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°8.5Ã‚Â years, 78.4% were women. 190 (43.9%) tested positive for coronavirus. Functional decline after the first wave was detected in 20.2% according to the Barthel Index and in 18.5% according to functional ambulation categories, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001. Cognitive status worsened by 22 and 25.9% according to the global deterioration scale (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and Lobo's Mini-Examen Cognoscitivo (p 0.01), respectively. Onset of depressive symptoms was found in 48% (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). The prevalence of malnutrition increased by 36.8 and 38.4% lost weight. When comparing the functional, cognitive, and nutritional decline between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients no clinical or statistically significant differences were found except for the presence of prior malnutrition, higher in the COVID-19 group. We observed a significative functional, cognitive, and nutritional decline in institutionalized elderly after the first wave of COVID-19. These results may be caused by the lockdown itself, since no differences have been found between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. According to these results, interventions are necessary during social isolation or confinement to prevent systemic decline in the elderly.","PÃƒÂ©rez-RodrÃƒÂ­guez, DÃƒÂ­az de Bustamante, Aparicio MollÃƒÂ¡, Arenas, JimÃƒÂ©nez-Armero, Lacosta Esclapez, GonzÃƒÂ¡lez-Espinoza, Bermejo Boixareu","https://doi.org/10.1007/s41999-021-00524-1","20210624","COVID; Decline; Elderly; Malnutrition; Nursing homes","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-25","",15333,""
"Use of Telehealth in Mental Health (MH) Services During and After COVID-19","COVID-19 social distancing guidelines caused a rapid transition to telephone and video technologies for the delivery of mental health (MH) services. The study examined: (a) adoption of these technologies across the MH service continuum; (b) acceptance of these technologies; and (c) intention of providers to use these technologies following the pandemic based on a sample of 327 MH organizations from 22 states during May-August 2020. There was widespread use of technology, with greater than 69% of organizations reporting using telephone or video for most services. For all video services and just three telephone services, organizations reported significantly greater odds of intending to use technology to deliver services post-COVID-19. Use of video was seen as more desirable as compared to telephone. The overall perceived ease of use and usefulness for video-based services and certain telephone services provide a promising outlook for use of these services post the COVID-19 pandemic.","Molfenter, Heitkamp, Murphy, Tapscott, Behlman, Cody","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10597-021-00861-2","20210624","Behavioral health; Mental health; Technology adoption; Telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-25","",15334,""
"Daily mindfulness training reduces negative impact of COVID-19 news exposure on affective well-being","COVID-19 has led to mental health adversities worldwide. The current study examined whether daily practice of brief mindfulness training has a beneficial impact on affective well-being, and mitigates the negative impact of exposure to COVID-19 news during the pandemic. Participants were randomly assigned into a mindfulness training (MT) group or a waitlist control (WC) group. Participants in the MT group practiced guided mindfulness meditation for a minimum of 10Ã‚Â min each day for 10Ã‚Â days. Both groups completed questionnaires assessing well-being at baseline and after the 10-day period. We also included four ecological momentary assessments (EMA) interspersed throughout the day to measure fine-grained affective states and recent exposure to COVID-19-related news, which has been linked to negative affect. We observed an increase in positive affect in the MT group compared to the WC group in the post-training assessment. However, no group differences emerged in the other three post-training affective measures of negative affect, anxiety and depression. EMA revealed that the MT group also showed more positive affective valence than the WC group across the 10Ã‚Â days. Notably, the WC group reported more negative affective valence following COVID-19 news exposure, whereas the MT group was not impacted. Taken together, our study indicates brief sessions of guided mindfulness meditation during COVID-19 may boost positive affect and serve as a protective buffer against the negative impact of exposure to COVID-19-related news on affective well-being. These findings highlight the utility of mindfulness meditation as an accessible and cost-effective technique to elevate positive affect amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kam, Javed, Hart, Andrews-Hanna, Tomfohr-Madsen, Mills","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00426-021-01550-1","20210624","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-25","",15335,""
"Anxiety and Depression during COVID-19 Pandemic among Medical Students in Nepal","Background Medical students' psychological response to societal lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic has not been studied much. Objective To assess levels of anxiety and depression among medical students during initial stages of COVID-19 pandemic in Nepal and relate their distress to relevant variables. Method A cross-sectional study with online questionnaire was conducted among medical students at different colleges in Nepal. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) detected 'anxiety' and 'depression'. The covariates were explored by logistic regression analyses. Result A total 416 medical students [mean age: 22.2 (2.1); males 57.7%, females 42.3%] participated. HADS-anxiety scores [mean: 7.1(4.3)] were significantly and positively correlated with HADS-depression [mean: 5.9 (4.1)] (r=0.695; p &lt; 0.001). Point prevalence of total HADS caseness (HADS-T) was 26.7%. Specific HADS-defined caseness were: anxiety (HADS-A) 11.8%, depression (HADS-D) 5.5%, and comorbid anxiety and depression (HADS-cAD) 9.4%. All four types of caseness were significantly more prevalent among students with a history of mental problems (AOR=4.7, 3.2, 2.6, and 3.2 respectively). HADS-T was higher among those with a concurrent physical illness (AOR=2.4). HADS-T, HADS-A and HADS-D scores were higher among the age group &gt; 22 years (AOR= 2.2, 2.5 and 4.4 respectively). HADS-cAD was almost threetimes higher among those with a possible COVID-19 exposure (AOR=2.8). Conclusion A significant number of medical students in Nepal suffered from high levels of anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 shut-down. The students in the higher (&gt; 22 years) age group, those with past mental disorders, possible COVID-19 exposure, and concurrent physical illness showed elevated levels of anxiety and/or depression.","Risal, Shikhrakar, Mishra, Kunwar, Karki, Shrestha, Khadka, Holen","https://www.google.com/search?q=Anxiety+and+Depression+during+COVID-19+Pandemic+among+Medical+Students+in+Nepal.","20210624","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-25","",15336,""

"Prevalence of anxiety and depression among pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic: a meta-analysis","Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a newly emerged respiratory illness, which has spread around the world. Pregnant women are exposed to additional pressure due to the indirect adverse effects of this pandemic on their physical and mental health. Since the psychological wellness framework is weak in developing countries, it is likely that geographical factors affect the prevalence. Therefore, the goal of this meta-analysis is to investigate the prevalence of anxiety and depression among pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. We searched databases including PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library for articles. The quality of studies was determined based on the STROBE checklist. I2 and Cochrane Q-test were used to determine heterogeneity. Fixed effects and/or random effects models were also employed to estimate pooled prevalence. Since heterogeneity was fairly high in all analyses, the random effect model was used. According to the results of random effects in the meta-analysis, the pooled prevalence was 18.7% (95% CI: 0.06-0.36%; <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""> <mml:msup> <mml:mrow> <mml:mi>I</mml:mi> </mml:mrow> <mml:mrow> <mml:mn>2</mml:mn> </mml:mrow> </mml:msup> <mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:mn>99</mml:mn> <mml:mi>%</mml:mi> <mml:mo>,</mml:mo> <mml:mi>P</mml:mi> <mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo> <mml:mn>0.001</mml:mn> </mml:math>) for anxiety and 25.1% (95% CI: 0.18-0.33%; <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""> <mml:msup> <mml:mrow> <mml:mi>I</mml:mi> </mml:mrow> <mml:mrow> <mml:mn>2</mml:mn> </mml:mrow> </mml:msup> <mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:mn>97</mml:mn> <mml:mi>%</mml:mi> <mml:mo>,</mml:mo> <mml:mi>Ã‚Â </mml:mi> <mml:mi>P</mml:mi> <mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo> <mml:mn>0.001</mml:mn> </mml:math>) for depression.

"Treatment Needs and Service Delivery for Patients with Dual Disorders During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Findings From the WADD Survey","The COVID-19 pandemic has posed a great challenge for the existing health systems. The restrictions imposed across countries on the movement of people and the realignment of health care services in response to the pandemic are likely to negatively affect the health status and delivery of mental health services to persons with dual disorders (PWDD). <b>Methods:</b> An online survey was conducted among mental health professionals involved in providing care to PWDD to better understand the problems encountered and identify potential solutions in providing continued treatment for PWDD during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Results:</b> The findings confirmed significant disruption in the delivery of treatment services for PWDD during the COVID-19 pandemic. Dissatisfaction with personal protective equipment, inadequate COVID-19 testing services at treatment facility, and lack of guidelines on providing continued treatment services to PWDD by national authorities or professional bodies were identified as the likely reasons for this disruption. <b>Conclusions:</b> These concerns in turn need to be addressed by the policy-makers, hospital management staff, and other stakeholders. Specifically, there should be a focus on developing and disseminating guidelines to assist mental health professionals in setting-up and providing continued treatment services to PWDD via tele-psychiatry and other novel digital strategies.","Singh Balhara, Szerman, Singh, Martinez Raga, Salom, Peris, Ganesh","https://doi.org/10.1080/15504263.2021.1940413","20210624","COVID-19; service delivery; Dual disorders; barriers; health care delivery","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-25","",15340,""

"Changes in alcohol consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic: exploring gender differences and the role of emotional distress","Restrictions to do with the COVID-19 pandemic have had substantial unintended consequences on Canadians' alcohol consumption patterns, including increased emotional distress and its potential impact on alcohol use. This study examines 1) changes in adults' alcohol consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia; 2) whether drinking more frequently during the pandemic is associated with increased feelings of stress, loneliness and hopelessness; and 3) whether gender moderates this relationship. Participants were drawn from a cross-sectional survey of 2000 adults. Adjusted multinomial regression models were used to assess the association between drinking frequency and increased feelings of stress, loneliness and hopelessness. Additional analyses were stratified by gender. About 12% of respondents reported drinking more frequently after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and 25%-40% reported increased emotional distress. Increased feelings of stress (odds ratio [OR] = 1.99; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.35-2.93), loneliness (OR = 1.79; 95% CI: 1.22-2.61) and hopelessness (OR = 1.98; 95% CI: 1.21-3.23) were all associated with drinking more frequently during the pandemic. While women respondents reported higher rates of emotional distress, significant associations with increased drinking frequency were only observed among men in gender-stratified analyses. Individuals who report increased feelings of stress, loneliness and hopelessness during the COVID-19 pandemic were more likely to report increased drinking frequency; however, these associations were only significant for men in stratified analyses. Understanding how the pandemic is associated with mental health and drinking may inform alcohol control policies and public health interventions to minimize alcohol-related harm.

Data were analysed from a large-scale mental health study: the COvid-19 and you: mentaL heaLth in AusTralia now survEy (COLLATE). The impact of pet ownership on levels of resilience, loneliness and quality of life were examined in a sample of 138 pet owners and 125 non-pet owners. Hierarchical linear regression analyses indicated that pet ownership was significantly associated with poorer quality of life, but not significantly associated with resilience or loneliness, after accounting for situational factors (e.g. job loss) and mood states. Contrary to expectations, the findings suggest that during a specific situation such as a pandemic, pets may contribute to increased burden among owners and contribute to poorer quality of life.","Phillipou, Tan, Toh, Van Rheenen, Meyer, Neill, Sumner, Rossell","https://doi.org/10.1111/avj.13102","20210624","cat; dog; loneliness; pandemic; quality of life; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-25","",15343,""
"Profiles of Depressive Symptoms Among Men Who Have Sex With Men and Transgender Women During the COVID-19 Outbreak in Mexico: A Latent Class Analysis","The impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on mental health among HIV high-risk populations is not known. We assess the prevalence of depressive symptoms (DS) and explore the association with characteristics related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted an online survey among 881 men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW) assessing the presence of DS using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CESD-10); results were compared with previously self-reported DS and national data. We applied latent class analysis (LCA) to identify classes of participants with similar COVID-19 related characteristics. The overall prevalence of significant DS was 53.3%. By LCA posterior probabilities we identified three classes: (1) minimal impact of COVID-19 (54.1%), (2) objective risk for COVID-19 (41.5%), and (3) anxiety and economic stress caused by COVID-19 (4.4%). Multivariate logistic regression showed that compared with those in class one, the odds to have significant DS were almost five times higher for those in class three. Our findings suggest high levels of depression among MSM and TGW in Mexico during the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight the need for the provision of targeted psychological interventions to minimize the impacts of COVID-19 on the mental health.","Cerecero-Garcia, Vermandere, Bojorquez, GÃƒÂ³mez-Castro, Arturo SÃƒÂ¡nchez-Ochoa, MartÃƒÂ­nez-DÃƒÂ¡valos, Huerta-Icelo, Bautista-Arredondo","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.598921","20210624","COVID-19; Mexico; depressive symptoms; men who have sex with men; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-25","",15344,""
"Effects of Wise Intervention on Perceived Discrimination Among College Students Returning Home From Wuhan During the COVID-19 Outbreak","At the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, college students returning home from Wuhan, Hubei Province, experienced various degrees of discrimination. This study first investigates perceived discrimination among college students returning home from Wuhan. Then, an experimental method is used to investigate the effectiveness of an intervention designed to reduce the perceived discrimination among those who returned to towns outside of Hubei Province. A total of 63 college students participated in the experiment. In the experimental group (<i>N</i> = 31), a wise intervention based on reading and writing was adopted to intervene in perceived discrimination among the participants. The results showed that the perceived discrimination among students returning from Wuhan to towns outside of Hubei Province was significantly higher than that among students returning to towns within Hubei Province. The wise intervention reduced the perceived discrimination in the experimental group but not in the control group. Further analysis found that perceived social support fully mediated the relationship between the intervention and perceived discrimination. These results provide insights on how the content of intervention (perceived social support) and the form of intervention (wise intervention) can prevent the occurrence of psychological problems in epidemic situations.","Lu, Guo, Li, Zhang, Ren, Yang, Wei, Huang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.689251","20210624","COVID-19; mental health; perceived discrimination; perceived social support; wise intervention","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-25","",15345,""
"Associations Between Depressive Symptoms and Physical Activity Intensity in an Older Adult Population During COVID-19 Lockdown","The COVID-19 pandemic led to the implementation of physical-social distancing measures-including self-isolation, home confinement, and quarantine around the world, with psychological consequences such as depression. Older adults are especially likely to develop depressive symptomatology. This study aims to investigate the association between physical activity intensities and sedentary behavior with depression levels among previously active older adults during the COVID-19 lockdown. A total of 1,123 physically active older Brazilian adults (67.68 Ã‚Â± 5.91 years, 91.00% female) were interviewed by telephone in regard to sociodemographic, general health status, depression (GDS-15), and physical activity (IPAQ-SV) after being home-confined for 11.59 Ã‚Â± 2.42 weeks. Participants were also asked to self-report changes in their physical activity levels and time spent sitting. Descriptive statistics (mean, frequencies), between-groups comparisons (<i>t</i>-tests and chi-square), and hierarchical regression analysis were used. About 83.80% of older adults self-reported a decrease in daily physical activity levels and 73.90% increased sitting time. Overall, depressive symptoms were observed in 30.40, and 20.80% met physical activity recommendations. Daily moderate (ÃŽÂ² = -0.174; 95% CI = -0.026; -0.012) and moderate-to-vigorous (ÃŽÂ² = -0.183; 95% CI = -0.023; 0.011) physical activity intensities were negatively associated with depression score explaining 2.6 and 2.9% of depression variability, respectively, after adjusting for age, gender, education level, body mass index, and polypharmacy. Daily walking and sitting time were not associated with the depression score (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). The results provide empiric suggestion supporting moderate to vigorous physical activity as a way to reduce depressive levels among older adults during COVID-19 confinement. Supervised home-based exercise programs, specifically designed for older adults, might be an important strategy to maintain and improve older adults' mental health.","Lage, Carrapatoso, Sampaio de Queiroz Neto, Gomes, Soares-Miranda, Bohn","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.644106","20210624","association; depression; intensity; lockdown; pandemic; physical activity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-25","",15346,""
"Gender Differences in Anxiety, Depression, and Nursing Needs Among Isolated Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients","This study explored gender differences in anxiety, depression, and nursing needs among isolated Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, with a particular focus on the influencing factors. The main goal was to elucidate breakthrough points and intervention targets for psychological counseling aimed at the promotion of overall health during isolation treatment. A survey was conducted to obtain information about the nursing needs of COVID-19 patients, with mental health assessed via the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Participants included 219 isolated COVID-19 patients at a Wuhan module hospital in Hubei province, China. A total of 216 valid questionnaires were collected (98.63% retrieval rate). Of these participants, 21.76% had anxiety symptoms, while 17.59% had depression symptoms. Colleagues infected with COVID-19 (OR = 3.896, 95%CI: 1.555-9.764, <i>P</i> = 0.004) were the main influencing factors for anxiety symptoms, while marital status (OR = 2.700, 95% CI: 1.033-7.055, <i>P</i> = 0.043) and family members infected with COVID-19 (OR = 2.969, 95% CI: 1.243-7.095, <i>P</i> = 0.014) were the main influencing factors for depression symptoms. As for gender, male patients were generally more prone to depression and anxiety than female patients, especially those who were infected with colleagues. On the other hand, female patients reported greater concerns about safe treatment environments and communication with medical staff. This study found gender-based differences regarding the factors influencing anxiety and depression in isolated COVID-19 patients, with males reporting a greater general tendency for symptoms. On the other hand, female patients reported greater overall psychological nursing needs than males. Targeted nursing should thus be implemented to address specific psychological characteristics and nursing needs.","Li, Li, Yang, Zhang, Dong, Wang, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.615909","20210624","COVID-19; coronavirus disease 2019; gender; hospital anxiety and depression scale; isolated patients; nursing needs","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-25","",15347,""
"Factors Associated With Mental Health Symptoms During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Hong Kong","<b>Background:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increasing mental health burden. We examined the factors associated with mental health symptoms in Chinese general adults in Hong Kong. <b>Methods:</b> We conducted a dual-frame (landline and mobile) survey on Chinese adults aged 18 years or older in April 2020. Shortage of preventive materials, perceptions of the outbreak (each item range 1-5), and reduction in income were assessed. Mental health symptoms measured included stress (Perceived Stress Scale-4, range 0-16), anxiety (General Anxiety Disorders-2, range 0-6, cutoff &gt;2), and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-2, range 0-6, cutoff &gt;2). Results were weighted by the general population distribution. Associations were analyzed by multivariable linear (for stress) and logistic (for anxiety and depressive symptoms) regression adjusting for sociodemographic and health-related covariates, including confirmed or in close contacts of confirmed cases, chronic disease, self-rated health, and smoking and alcohol drinking behavior. <b>Results:</b> Of the 1,501 participants (52.5% female, 55.0 aged 30-59 years), the average stress score was 7.20 (SD 2.12). 218 (15.8%) and 206 (14.8%) participants had anxiety and depressive symptoms, respectively. Shortage in facemasks (20.8%), alcohol-based hand sanitizers (13.9%), and cleaning products (7.3%) was reported. Participants generally disagree with the perception of at risk of getting infected in the coming 6 months (mean 2.2, SD 1.1), but tended to agree with the perception of worry that the people around pose a threat to them (mean 3.6, SD 0.9) and the outbreak has greatly affected their daily life (mean 3.7, SD 0.9). 59.3% employed participants had income reduction and 6.2% had become unemployed since the outbreak. Stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms were more prevalent in those with shortages of preventive materials and negative perceptions of the outbreak (all <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Reduction in income and unemployment were associated with more mental health symptoms (all <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). <b>Conclusions:</b> Shortage of preventive materials, negative perceptions, financial loss, and unemployment were prevalent during the outbreak and found in association with higher stress and more anxiety and depressive symptoms. Further research and urgent actions are warranted to relieve stress and promote mental health, targeting the many risk factors identified by our study.","Zhao, Luk, Wu, Weng, Wong, Wang, Lam","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.617397","20210624","COVID-19; mental health; public health; risk factors; unemployment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-25","",15348,""
"Risk of Developing Post-traumatic Stress Disorder in Severe COVID-19 Survivors, Their Families and Frontline Healthcare Workers: What Should Mental Health Specialists Prepare For?","Given the high mortality of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), having severe COVID-19 may be a life-threatening event, especially for individuals at high risk of complications. Therefore, in the article we try to answer two questions that are relevant to public mental health: Can we define groups who are at higher risk of developing pandemic-related PTSD? How can health specialists prepare for it? Given the results of previous research on PTSD in epidemic (e.g., SARS) survivors, we suggest that mental health professionals in countries touched by the pandemic should prepare for an increase in the PTSD prevalence, specifically in: individuals who have had severe COVID-19; family members of these patients and of patients who have died; and frontline healthcare workers witnessing COVID-19 patients' sudden deaths, or numerous life-threatening situations. We postulate that these groups at risk should be routinely screened for PTSD in primary medical and pediatric care. Mental health services should prepare for providing therapeutic interventions for individuals with PTSD in the vulnerable groups, and support to their families, especially children.","Sekowski, Gambin, Hansen, Holas, Hyniewska, Wyszomirska, Pluta, SobaÃ…â€žska, Ã…Âojek","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.562899","20210624","coronavirus disease; family; healthcare worker; post-traumatic stress disorder; prolonged grief disorder; severe acute respiratory syndrome","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-25","",15349,""
"Prevalence and risk factors of depression symptoms among Chinese seafarers during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study","To curb the spread of COVID-19, most countries have adopted measures such as banning shore leave at ports and placed restrictions on crew change. Seafarers may bear an excess pressure during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and risk factors associated with depression symptoms among Chinese seafarers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Cross-sectional study. This field survey-based study was conducted at Rongcheng Port, Shandong Province, China, from 10 June 2020 to 25 July 2020. Sociodemographic and occupational characteristics and health-related behaviours were collected through a face-to-face questionnaire. The Self-Rating Depression Scale was used to evaluate depression status during the preceding week. Logistic regression models were used to explore factors related to depression. 441 male Chinese seafarers were enrolled. Overall, the proportions of seafarers with low, moderate and severe depression symptoms were 23.35%, 9.30% and 9.07%, respectively. Compared with those with good self-rated health (SRH), seafarers with poor SRH had higher odds of depression (OR, 2.24, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.22 to 4.11). Less leisure time or physical exercise was associated with more severe self-reported depression symptoms (1-3 per week vs Ã¢â€°Â¥4 per week: OR, 1.72, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 0.71 to 4.14; none vs Ã¢â€°Â¥4 per week: OR, 3.93, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.67 to 9.26). Poor sleep quality was associated with higher likelihood of reporting severe depression (fair vs good: OR, 2.78, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.54 to 5.01; poor vs good: OR, 4.30, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.65 to 11.24). The more frequent seafarers worked overtime a week, the higher the likelihood of reporting severe depression symptoms (1-2 per week vs none: OR, 1.82, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.04 to 3.18; Ã¢â€°Â¥3 per week vs none: OR, 2.49, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.05 to 5.92). Also, high perceived work stress was linked to higher odds of being depressed (intermediate vs low: OR, 2.06, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 0.78 to 5.46; high vs low: OR, 3.83, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.35 to 10.90). There is a high burden of depression associated with COVID-19 among seafarers. Special interventions that protect the mental health of seafarers are more critical than ever in the context of the pandemic.","Qin, Li, Zhu, Ju, Bi, Li","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-048660","20210624","COVID-19; depression &amp; mood disorders; epidemiology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-25","",15350,""
"Pregnant women's experiences of social distancing behavioural guidelines during the Covid-19 pandemic 'lockdown' in the UK, a qualitative interview study","Covid-19 triggered the rapid roll-out of mass social distancing behavioural measures for infection control. Pregnant women were categorised as 'at risk' requiring extra vigilance with behavioural guidelines. Their understanding and ability to adhere to recommendations was unknown. To complete a behavioural analysis of the determinants of recommended social distancing behaviour in pregnant women, according to the 'capability, opportunity, motivation and behaviour' ('COM-B') model to inform the development of recommendations/materials to support pregnant women in understanding and adhering to behavioural guidelines. Qualitative interview study with pregnant women in the Bristol area (UK). Semi-structured telephone/videoconference interviews were conducted following a topic guide informed by the COM-B model, transcribed verbatim and subjected to framework analysis. Infographic materials were iteratively produced with stakeholder consultation, to support pregnant women. Thirty-one women participated (selected for demographic range). Women reported adhering to social distancing recommendations and intended to continue. COM-B analysis identified gaps in understanding around risk, vulnerability, and the extent of required social distancing, as well as facilitators of social distancing behaviour (e.g. social support, motivation to stay safe, home environment/resources). Additional themes around detrimental mental health effects and changes to maternity healthcare from the social distancing measures were identified. Infographic resources (plus midwife report) addressing women's key concerns were produced and disseminated. The COM-B model provided useful details of determinants of pregnant women's adherence to social distancing behaviours. The confusion of what being 'at risk' meant and varying interpretation of what was expected indicates a need for greater clarity around categories and guidance. The loss of maternity care and negative mental health effects of social distancing suggest a growing area of unmet health needs to be addressed in future.","Anderson, Brigden, Davies, Shepherd, Ingram","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11202-z","20210624","Behavioral research; Coronavirus; Covid-19; Health-related behavior; Infection control; Maternal health services; Pandemics; Pregnant women; Qualitative research; Social distance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-25","",15351,""
"The Danish Health and Wellbeing Survey: Study design, response proportion and respondent characteristics","This study aimed to describe the study design and respondent characteristics (including non-response analyses) of the Danish Health and Wellbeing Surveys in 2015 and 2019 and a follow-up survey that was carried out during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The Danish Health and Wellbeing Survey is the Danish part of the European Health Interview Survey (EHIS). The samples in 2015 (<i>N</i>=12,000) and 2019 (<i>N</i>=14,000) were both based on a simple random selection of individuals aged Ã¢Â©Â¾15 years from the Danish Civil Registration System. All individuals from the sample in 2019 who were still alive and living in Denmark were reinvited for a follow-up survey in 2020 (<i>N</i>=13,474). Data in all surveys were collected via self-administered questionnaires (web or paper based). The questionnaires in 2015 and 2019 included the EHIS model questionnaire as well as national questions, whereas the questionnaire in 2020 mainly focused on physical and mental health, employment and working lives, and health behaviour. The overall response proportion declined slightly between 2015 (48.4%) and 2019 (47.4%) but went up to 49.8% in the follow-up survey in 2020. Unit non-response was associated with, for example, male sex, younger age, being unmarried and lower educational level but not with degree of urbanisation. In all, 5000 individuals completed the questionnaire in both 2019 and 2020. The results are in line with most previous research on non-response in health surveys. However, an association between degree of urbanisation and non-response has been suggested in previous studies. This association was not found in our study.","Rosendahl Jensen, Thygesen, MÃƒÂ¸ller, Dahl Nielsen, ErsbÃƒÂ¸ll, Ekholm","https://doi.org/10.1177/14034948211022429","20210624","COVID-19; Cross-sectional studies; data collection; follow-up-studies; health surveys; participation rate; public health surveillance; survey and questionnaires","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-25","",15352,""
"College Student Experiences of Grief and Loss Amid the COVID-19 Global Pandemic","This study examined types of and reactions to loss experienced by a sample of 162 undergraduate and graduate students in the United States amid the COVID-19 global pandemic. Results indicated students reported an average of 6.33 losses with loss of normalcy being the most prominent. The number of losses experienced was a significant predictor of loss of control and avoidance. A significant positive relationship was revealed between spirituality and positive reappraisal whereas a significant negative correlation was identified between spirituality and loss of control and avoidance. Age was also negatively associated with expressions of avoidance and loss of control. Finally, students who attended faith-based institutions reported higher levels of positive reappraisal and lower levels of loss of control. Results suggest the need for educators and mental health practitioners to assess non-death losses among college students and provide supportive interventions aimed at promoting psychosocial-spiritual coping and resilience during and following a pandemic.","Sirrine, Kliner, Gollery","https://doi.org/10.1177/00302228211027461","20210624","COVID-19; college students; grief; loss; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-25","",15353,""
"Emotional responses and perceived stressors of frontline medical staffs in case of COVID-19 treatment centers and obstetrics emergency in Ethiopia","the rapid spread of COVID-19, its lethality in severe cases and the absence of specific medicine poses a huge threat to human life and health, as well as huge impact on the mental health. Facing this critical situation, health care workers on the front line who are directly involved in the diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients with COVID-19 are at risk of developing psychological distress and other mental health symptoms including emotional disturbance. the aim of this study will be to assess the current state of emotional responses and perceived stressors of frontline medical staffs in case of Addis Ababa COVID-19 Treatment Centers and obstetrics emergency and abortion care, Ethiopia 2020. Hospital based comparative cross-section study design was conducted by using self-administered questionnaire survey from June 1st to 30th of 2020 among 133 and 266 frontline medical staffs from obstetric emergency and abortion care clinic and COVID-19 treatment centers respectively. The data were collected after getting written consent from each participant and it entered into the computer using Epi-data version 7, then exported to SPSS version 20 for further analysis. Descriptive analysis was done using frequencies &amp; percent. All independent determinants with P-value &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05 were used to identify important predictors of emotional responses and perceived stressors. A total of 399 frontline medical staffs were included in the study. The mean age of the respondents of those who were working in obstetrics emergency and abortion care clinic was 27.47 (SD, 3.46) years and it was 28.12 (SD, 4.09) years for the other groups. This study revealed that, 72.9 and 5.6% of the study participant from obstetrics emergency and abortion clinic and COVID-19 treatment centers had a positive emotional response, respectively. Factors such as having a low level of motivational factors (AOR 2.78, 95% CI (1.13, 6.84)), being a nurse (AOR 10.53, 95% CI (1.31, 85.26)) and working at triage (AOR 8.61, 95% CI (1.15, 64.81))) had statistically significant association with negative emotional response. The current study revealed that a high proportion of front line a negative emotional responses had negative emotional response. Further, almost all of the medical staffs working in COVID-19 treatment centers and at obstetrics emergency and abortion care unit had perceived the outbreak related stressors. So, providing comprehensive psychological support is warranted for health care providers working in such kinds of department or units.","Kebede, Demissie, Guddu, Haile, Bitew, Muleta","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03311-1","20210624","Addis Ababa COVID-19 treatment centers; Emotional responses; Front line medical staffs; Perceived stressors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-25","",15354,""
