"The impact of the COVID19 pandemic and initial period of lockdown on the mental health and wellbeing of UK adults","Mental health and wellbeing impacts of COVID19 were assessed in a convenience sample of 600 UK adults using a cross-sectional design. Recruited over a two-week period during the initial phase of the government lockdown, participants completed an online survey that included COVID19-related questions, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the WHO-5 and the OXCAP-MH. Self-isolating prior to lockdown, increased feelings of isolation since the lockdown, and having COVID19-related livelihood concerns, were associated with poorer mental health, wellbeing and quality of life. Perceiving increased kindness, community connectedness, and being an essential worker were associated with better mental health and wellbeing outcomes.","White, R.

"Concentration-dependent mortality of chloroquine in overdose","Background: Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have been used extensively in malaria and rheumatological conditions. Although generally safe and well tolerated they are potentially lethal in overdose. These two drugs are now candidates for the prevention and treatment of COVID19. In vitro data suggest that high concentrations and thus high doses will be needed if they are to be of benefit, but as yet there is no convincing evidence they are clinically effective. Nevertheless they are already being used very widely and fatal accidental overdoses have been reported. Methods: Individual data from prospectively studied French patients who had taken intentional chloroquine overdoses and were managed in the national toxicology intensive care unit in Paris were pooled. Bayesian logistic regression was used to estimate a concentration-fatality curve. The probabilities of fatal iatrogenic toxicity with the chloroquine regimens currently being trialled for the treatment of COVID19 were estimated from a combined pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model. Findings: In total, 258 patients were studied of whom 26 died (10%). There was a steep sigmoid relationship between admission whole blood chloroquine concentrations and death. Concentrations above 13umol/L (95% credible interval (C.I.), 10 to 16) were associated with greater than 1% mortality. Based on peak concentrations, absolute fatality ratios in the high dose arm (chloroquine base equivalent adult dose of 600mg given twice daily for ten days) of a recently terminated trial were estimated between 0.06% (90kg adult, 95%C.I. 0 to 0.3%) and 4.8% (40kg adult, 95% C.I. 1.9 to 9.7%). This regimen results in peak concentrations above 10umol/L in more than 60% of adults weighing 70kg. The other high dose regimens trialled currently for COVID19 result in peak concentrations above 10umol/L in only 0.2% of adults weighting 70kg. Interpretation:} High-dose chloroquine treatment regimens which result in whole blood chloroquine concentrations below 10umol/L for the majority of patients should not result in life-threatening cardiovascular toxicity.","Watson, J.

"Illinois rolls out COVID-19 MH crisis hotline as cases climb","After another deadly 24 hours in Illinois, Gov. J.B. Pritzker announced a new program to connect scared and depressed Illinois residents to badly needed mental health services, Block Club Chicago reported April 11. In the 24 hours in question, 81 people died from COVID-19 and 1,293 new confirmed cases were reported. Hoping to help those in need of mental and physical health care during the crisis, the state has created programs that will help people from afar. Call4Calm, a free emotional support text line, was created to serve Illinois residents ?swimming in the stress and uncertainty? caused by COVID-19, Pritzker said. To connect with a counselor, people can text ?TALK? to 552020 or text ?HABLAR? to the same number for counseling in Spanish. Users will remain anonymous, and the state has partnered with mental health organizations to have counselors respond. Once a resident texts the hotline, they'll get a call from a licensed counselor within 24 hours. The program was announced as the state reached 19,180 confirmed COVID-19 cases, said Dr. Ngozi Ezike, director of the Illinois Department of Public Health.","","https://doi.org/10.1002/mhw.32329","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-30","",701,""
"COVID-19 leads to jump in people seeking MH help in NYC","It's a stressful time to be a New Yorker. People are stuck at home, worrying about their health, their family and their paycheck, Spectrum News New York 1 reported April 13. ?We are seeing a lot of calls related to anxiety and stress that people are experiencing today,? said Matt Kudish, executive director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness of New York City. The organization says the number of callers seeking help has jumped 60% over the last few weeks, and that conversations now last about 15 minutes longer than average. The city says it's also seeing an increase in demand. Web sessions to its NYC Well service jumped 185% last month to more than 81,000. ?We're hearing from people who are worried about their own physical health, they're worried about their mental health being forced to stay socially distant from other people,? Kudish said. Health care providers predict that even when the COVID-19 crisis ends, the mental health crisis will continue. They say people will continue to be anxious ? this time about leaving home and being convinced it's safe to be outside.","","https://doi.org/10.1002/mhw.32328","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-30","",702,""

"DEA, SAMHSA relax OTP/OBOT regulations due to COVID-19","Opioid treatment programs (OTPs) that dispense methadone got a fast and clear reprieve from federal authorities last week in the face of COVID-19. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) issued policies that give OTPs flexibility in take-homes, limiting the frequency of face-to-face contact and opportunities for transmission of COVID-19. There is also greater flexibility for office-based opioid treatment (OBOT) with buprenorphine.","Knopf, Alison","https://www.doi.org/10.1002/adaw.32664","20200320",NA,"PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-30","",728,""

"North Carolina frees up $30 million for BH during COVID-19 crisis","North Carolina's seven regional managed care agencies for behavioral health are receiving $30 million so they can keep a variety of programs running during the COVID-19 crisis, Carolina Public Press reported March 31. The money, which an N.C. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) spokesperson said represented unused Medicaid funds, has been shifted to the state's seven local management entities/managed care organizations, commonly called LME/MCOs. The LME/MCOs manage care for beneficiaries receiving mental health, developmental disabilities and substance abuse services who are on Medicaid, uninsured or underinsured. The letter also gave the LME/MCOs authority to use up to 15% of risk reserves to support contracted providers, but with a significant qualifier. The agencies, the DHHS said, would be able to use their reserves to support providers that are “maintaining consumers in their existing residential placements, utilizing telehealth capabilities to the maximum extent possible, providing services that keep consumers from needing access to emergency departments and inpatient services, and otherwise making efforts to deliver high-quality services during this crisis.” The department's caveat that local providers make every effort to keep their clients out of hospitals is part of a concerted campaign to maintain as much bed space and equipment as possible as the number of COVID-19 cases rises.","","https://www.doi.org/10.1002/mhw.32310","20200403",NA,"PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-30","",731,""

METHODS: Using a general questionnaire, a self-designed new coronavirus pneumonia knowledge and cognitive behavior questionnaire, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), we conducted an internet-based questionnaire survey of 3881 college students in Guangdong Province. A multinomial-logistic regression model was used to analyze the collected data. RESULTS: The survey showed that 69.47% of the college students had a high level of awareness of COVID-19; the overall incidence of anxiety was 26.60%, and the incidences of mild, moderate and severe anxiety were 23.19%, 2.71%, and 0.70%, respectively. Depressive emotions were detected in 21.16% of the students, and the incidences of mild, moderate, and moderate-to-severe depression were 16.98%, 3.17%, and 1.01%, respectively. The results of multivariate analysis showed that an older age was associated with a higher level of awareness of COVID-19 and greater changes in future health behaviors were associated with less anxiety and depression among the students. The students currently in rural areas, of non-medical majors, and reporting half of their information concerning the epidemic being negative were more likely to have anxiety; female gender, residence in suburbs, a drinking history, and excessive negative information concerning the epidemic were all associated with the likeliness of depression. CONCLUSION: The college students have different levels of anxiety and depression during the epidemic. Depression and anxiety are closely related, but the factors contributing to different levels of such emotions can be different, and colleges and related departments are urged to provide precision mental health education for college students.","","https://www.doi.org/10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2020.02.06","20200220",NA,"PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-30","",732,""

METHODS: We surveyed a total of 95 nursing interns who were isolated collectively in a general teaching hospital in Guangzhou using a self-designed questionnaire, which consisted of a basic information form, self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), self-rating depression scale (SDS) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Descriptive analysis, single factor analysis and correlation analysis were used to analyze the current status of the interns' psychology and sleep quality, the potential factors affecting their psychology and sleep quality, and the correlation between their psychological status and sleep quality. RESULTS: The surveyed interns had SAS, SDS and PSQI score of 37.79±6.59, 43.98±9.74 and 5.20±3.14, respectively, which were significant higher than the national norms in China (P < 0.05). Correlation analysis indicated that both anxiety and depression were positively correlated with the sleep quality score (r=0.508 and 0.546, respectively). Univariate analysis showed that the major factors affecting the psychological status and sleep quality of the interns during collective isolation included recent contact with persons from the affected area before isolation and the onset of fever during the isolation. CONCLUSION: These interns showed relatively high levels of anxiety and depression during the collective isolation to affect their sleep quality, and interventions should be timely administered to improve their mental health and sleep quality.","","https://www.doi.org/10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2020.03.09","20200320",NA,"PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-30","",733,""
"Community-acquired pneumonia among children: the latest evidence for an updated management","Abstract Objective To provide cutting-edge information for the management of community-acquired pneumonia in children under 5 years, based on the latest evidence published in the literature. Data source A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, by using the expressions: “community-acquired pneumonia” AND “child” AND “etiology” OR “diagnosis” OR “severity” OR “antibiotic”. All articles retrieved had the title and the abstract read, when the papers reporting the latest evidence on each subject were identified and downloaded for complete reading. Data synthesis In the era of largely implemented bacterial conjugate vaccines and widespread use of amplification nucleic acid techniques, respiratory viruses have been identified as the most frequent causative agents of community-acquired pneumonia in patients under 5 years. Hypoxemia (oxygen saturation = 96%) and increased work of breathing are signs most associated with community-acquired pneumonia. Wheezing detected on physical examination independently predicts viral infection and the negative predictive value (95% confidence interval) of normal chest X-ray and serum procalcitonin < 0.25 ng/dL was 92% (77-98%) and 93% (90-99%), respectively. Inability to drink/feed, vomiting everything, convulsions, lower chest indrawing, central cyanosis, lethargy, nasal flaring, grunting, head nodding, and oxygen saturation < 90% are predictors of death and can be used as indicators for hospitalization. Moderate/large pleural effusions and multilobar infiltrates are predictors of severe disease. Orally administered amoxicillin is the first line outpatient treatment, while ampicillin, aqueous penicillin G, or amoxicillin (initiated initially by intravenous route) are the first line options to treat inpatients. Conclusions Distinct aspects of childhood community-acquired pneumonia have changed during the last three decades. Resumo Objetivo Fornecer informações de ponta para o manejo de crianças menores de cinco anos com pneumonia adquirida na comunidade, com base nas evidências mais recentes publicadas na literatura. Fonte de dados Uma pesquisa abrangente foi feita no PubMed, com as expressões: “community-acquired pneumonia” + “child” + “etiology” ou “diagnosis” ou “severity” ou “antibiotic”. Todos os artigos encontrados tiveram o título e o resumo lidos e os artigos que relatavam as evidências mais recentes sobre cada assunto foram identificados e recuperados para leitura completa. Síntese dos dados Na era das vacinas bacterianas conjugadas amplamente usadas e do uso difundido de técnicas de amplificação de ácidos nucléicos, os vírus respiratórios foram identificados como os agentes causadores mais frequentes de pneumonia adquirida na comunidade em pacientes com menos de cinco anos. A hipoxemia (saturação de oxigênio = 96%) e o aumento do esforço respiratório são os sinais mais associados à pneumonia adquirida na comunidade. A sibilância detectada ao exame físico prediz de forma independente a infecção viral e o valor preditivo negativo (intervalo de confiança de 95%) da radiografia de tórax normal e a procalcitonina sérica < 0,25 ng/dL foi de 92% (77-98%) e 93% (90-99%), respectivamente. Incapacidade de beber e se alimentar, vomitar todo o alimento, convulsões, retração torácica subcostal, cianose central, letargia, aleteo nasal, estridor e saturação de oxigênio < 90% são preditores de óbito e podem ser usados como indicadores de hospitalização. Derrames pleurais moderados/grandes e infiltrados multilobulares são preditores de doença grave. A amoxicilina administrada por via oral é a opção de primeira linha para tratar pacientes ambulatoriais e a ampicilina ou penicilina cristalina G ou amoxicilina (administrada inicialmente por via intravenosa) são as opções de primeira linha para tratar pacientes hospitalizados. Conclusões Aspectos distintos da pneumonia adquirida na comunidade durante a infância mudaram durante as últimas três décadas.","Nascimento-Carvalho, Cristiana M.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpedp.2019.08.002","20200430",NA,"Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-30","",734,""
