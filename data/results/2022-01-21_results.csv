"Implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer patients' current needs and distress: generating recommendations for outpatient care","Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic has had detrimental impacts on all our daily lives. Besides the serious threats the coronavirus poses to people's physical health, it leads to higher levels of stress, anxiety and depression in the general population. Oncological patients are particularly vulnerable to these negative implications: due to their underlying condition, most are at-risk patients and need to be especially precautious regarding contagion. Additionally, structural changes and limited resources within medical care might lead to postponed or modified treatments and restricted access to psychological support. All these challenges might cause/increase uncertainty and psychosocial distress. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify the specific stressors and current needs of cancer patients. Methods: Between 11/2020 and 02/2021 122 outpatient cancer patients of the Comprehensive Cancer Center Munich participated in the study. After giving informed consent, participants completed a survey via telephone or in person. They were interviewed about their knowledge and concerns about COVID-19, both in general and regarding their cancer, as well as risk perception and precautionary measures concerning COVID-19. Psychosocial distress, symptoms of anxiety and depression, somatic symptoms and self-efficacy were collected via standardized questionnaires. Additionally, socio-demographic and medical data were raised. Results: The results showed that n=42 (34.7%) were significantly distressed (mean distress score: 3.7;scale: 0-10). About a third of the patients (34.2%, n=41) still had unanswered questions regarding the effect of the coronavirus on their cancer and/or treatment. Patients most often mentioned questions regarding the impact of an infection with Covid-19 on cancer (n=11), followed by vaccination (n=9) and treatment (n=9). The willingness to receive an anti-covid-vaccination is high (71%). At the time of the interview, 22% had not made a decision yet. Frequent reasons for indecisiveness or refusal were a) a need for a conversation with their oncologist before decision (63.3%) and b) a need for information about toleration of the vaccine and cancer (treatment) (36.7%). Conclusions: Findings suggest that oncologists should educate and support patients by responding to the diverse questions cancer patients still have regarding the effect of COVID-19 on their disease and treatment as well as clarifying uncertainties regarding the anti-COVID-vaccination.","Maier, S.; Frank, T.; Pichler, T.; Batenhorst, I.; Daltrozzo, T.; Harbeck, N.; Algul, H.; Heinemann, V.; Hermelink, K.; Dinkel, A.; Mumm, F.

"Effectiveness of an Internet-Based Self-Help Intervention versus Public Mental Health Advice to Reduce Worry during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Pragmatic, Parallel-Group, Randomized Controlled Trial","The mental health burden for the general population due to the COVID-19 pandemic has been highlighted. Evidence on effective, easily accessible public health interventions to reduce worry, a major transdiagnostic risk-factor for, e.g., anxiety and depression, is scarce. In a pragmatic randomized controlled trial, we aimed to assess whether an internet cognitive-behavioral self-help intervention could reduce worry more than public mental health advice in the general population. Eligible internet users above the age of 18 were recruited from the German general population and randomly assigned, to either get.calm-move.on (GCMO), a 10-day unguided, internet-based self-help intervention, or mental health advice waiting group (MHA-W, receiving officially endorsed mental health recommendations). The primary outcome was level of worry, using the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ), 2 weeks after randomization. Baseline assessment and 2-month and 6-month follow-ups were conducted. The trial was registered at the German Clinical Trials Registry (DRKS00021153). Between April 7, 2020 and December 11, 2020, we randomly assigned 351 individuals to receive either GCMO (n = 175) or MHA-W (n = 176). Participants receiving GCMO (PSWQ = 46.6; change -10.3) reported significantly less worrying at post-intervention (F1,219 = 12.9; p &lt; 0.001; d = 0.38) than MHA-W controls (PSWQ = 51.6; change -5.1). Improvements were also seen on most secondary outcomes, including symptoms of anxiety and depression, general well-being, resiliency, and emotion regulation skills. Improvements made from baseline were stable until the 6-month follow-up. This internet-based self-help intervention providing cognitive-behavioral techniques to cope with the threatening pandemic situation is effective in reducing worry in the general population and should complement existing and potentially effective mental health recommendations.","Heckendorf, Lehr, BoÃƒÅ¸","https://doi.org/10.1159/000521302","20220120","COVID-19; Internet-based intervention; Randomized controlled trial; Self-help; Worry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-21","",25746,""
"Influences of the COVID-19 pandemic and response strategies on residents' psychological state: The survey from Hainan Island","Mental health is a major public health issue that affects social development. This study aims to explore the psychological state of residents of Hainan Island and its influencing factors during the COVID-19 pandemic and to provide a scientific basis for the formulation of psychological counseling measures to be used after the pandemic. We used the nonprobability snowball sampling method to conduct an online survey from February 21 to February 28, 2020, and collected a sample of 533 respondents. Using a binary logistic regression model and network analysis, the psychological state of residents and the main factors were analyzed during the concentrated outbreak of COVID-19 (from January 20 to February 16, 2020). The study found that during the pandemic, 92.7% of the respondents were in a poor state of mind, and 54.2% experienced severe psychological stress. The mental state is spatially expressed as a pattern of ""high in the middle and low in the surroundings."" Second, within the four-week sample, the overall psychological tension showed an inverted U-shaped trend. Respondents feeling stressed were most common in the second week, when they accounted for 87.99% of the total. Third, individual characteristics such as gender, age, fixed expenditure, and family size significantly affect the mental state. Women, the elderly, residents with fixed expenditures, and residents with large families are at greater risk of psychological stress. Finally, external factors such as the distance between residents and the location of cases and the node degree of the pandemic transmission network have a significant impact on the psychological state. However, residents in the least developed areas of Hainan Island, which are far away from active cases and have a low node degree, are more prone to psychological pressure. The government needs to pay special attention to these groups when constructing a long-term mechanism of psychological crisis intervention and increase public health resource investment in underdeveloped areas.","Zhang, Zhou, Xue, Su, Li, Li, Chu, Cheng","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0261537","20220120","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-21","",25747,""
"Integrated Tuberculosis and COVID-19 Activities in Karachi and Tuberculosis Case Notifications","As the COVID-19 pandemic surged, lockdowns led to the cancellation of essential health services. As part of our Zero TB activities in Karachi, we adapted our approach to integrate activities for TB and COVID-19 to decrease the impact on diagnosis and linkage to care for TB treatment. We implemented the following: (1) integrated COVID-19 screening and testing within existing TB program activities, along with the use of an artificial intelligence (AI) software reader on digital chest X-rays; (2) home delivery of medication; (3) use of telehealth and mental health counseling; (4) provision of PPE; (5) burnout monitoring of health workers; and (6) patient safety and disinfectant protocol. We used programmatic data for six districts of Karachi from January 2018 to March 2021 to explore the time trends in case notifications, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and service adaptations in the city. The case notifications in all six districts in Karachi were over 80% of the trend-adjusted expected notifications with three districts having over 90% of the expected case notifications. Overall, Karachi reached 90% of the expected case notifications during the COVID-19 pandemic. The collaborative efforts by the provincial TB program and private sector partners facilitated this reduced loss in case notifications.","Malik, Hussain, Maniar, Safdar, Mohiuddin, Riaz, Pasha, Khan, Kazmi, Kazmi, Khowaja","https://doi.org/10.3390/tropicalmed7010012","20220120","COVID-19; active case finding; case notification; screening; tuberculosis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-21","",25748,""
"Association Between Dementia Development and COVID-19 among Individuals Who Tested Negative for COVID-19 in South Korea: A Nationwide Cohort Study","We aim to assess whether the number of newly diagnosed dementia increases and whether comorbid psychiatric symptoms of patients with dementia worsen, in people who were tested for COVID-19. We used electronic medical records from a nationwide cohort consisting of people who tested positive (positive group), tested negative (negative group), and those who did not receive the test (control group) for COVID-19. For people with neither a history of dementia nor mild cognitive disorder (MCI), the negative group was more likely to develop dementia than the control group, and less likely to develop MCI than the positive group. For people who already had dementia, the negative group was more likely to develop comorbid psychiatric disorders than the control group, but less likely than the positive group. These findings suggest the necessity of managing mental health not only for patients with COVID-19 but also for people who tested negative for COVID-19.","Kim, Son, Kim, Lee, Ahn, Yon, Hahm","https://doi.org/10.1177/15333175211072387","20220120","Korean dementia screening questionnaire; claims database; cognitive function; comorbid; health insurance review and assessment service of Korea","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-21","",25749,""
"COVID-19 Pandemic in a Vulnerable Population: Prevalence and Correlates of Anxiety","The COVID-19 pandemic has produced negative mental health outcomes. These effects were more prominent in vulnerable communities that experienced prior similar disasters. The study aimed to examine the likelihood and correlates of anxiety symptoms among Fort McMurray (FMM) residents, during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional online survey questionnaire was applied between 24 April and 2 June 2021, at FMM, to gather sociodemographic, COVID-19, and clinical information, including generalized anxiety disorder (using GAD-7 scale). Overall, 186 individuals completed the survey (response rate 74.7%). Most of the respondents were females (159, 85.5%); above 40 years (98, 52.7%); employed (175, 94.1%); and in relationship (132, 71%). The prevalence of moderate-to-severe anxiety was (42.5%, 71) on GAD-7 self-reported scale. Subscribers who reported that they would like to receive mental health support; have received no family support since COVID-19 declaration; and have lost their job during the pandemic were all more likely to report moderate-to-severe anxiety (OR = 3.39; 95% CI: 1.29-8.88), (OR = 4.85; 95% CI: 1.56-15.03), and (OR = 4.40; 95% CI: 1.01-19.24), respectively. Anxiety levels were high among FMM residents, compared to levels before COVID-19. Clinical and social factors significantly predicted likely anxiety in the Fort McMurray population, during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is imperative that resources are mobilized to support vulnerable communities during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Shalaby, Eboreime, Nkire, Agyapong, Pazderka, Obuobi-Donkor, Adu, Mao, Owusu, Oluwasina, Agyapong","https://doi.org/10.3390/bs12010013","20220120","COVID-19; Fort McMurray; anxiety; cross-sectional; online survey; trauma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-21","",25750,""
"Connectivity-Guided Theta Burst Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Versus Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation for Treatment-Resistant Moderate to Severe Depression: Magnetic Resonance Imaging Protocol and SARS-CoV-2-Induced Changes for a Randomized Double-blind Controlled Trial","Depression is a substantial health and economic burden. In approximately one-third of patients, depression is resistant to first-line treatment; therefore, it is essential to find alternative treatments. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a neuromodulatory treatment involving the application of magnetic pulses to the brain that is approved in the United Kingdom and the United States in treatment-resistant depression. This trial aims to compare the clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and mechanism of action of standard treatment repetitive TMS (rTMS) targeted at the F3 electroencephalogram site with a newer treatment-a type of TMS called theta burst stimulation (TBS) targeted based on measures of functional brain connectivity. This protocol outlines brain imaging acquisition and analysis for the Brain Imaging Guided Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in Depression (BRIGhTMIND) study trial that is used to create personalized TMS targets and answer the proposed mechanistic hypotheses. The aims of the imaging arm of the BRIGhTMIND study are to identify functional and neurochemical brain signatures indexing the treatment mechanisms of rTMS and connectivity-guided intermittent theta burst TMS and to identify imaging-based markers predicting response to treatment. The study is a randomized double-blind controlled trial with 1:1 allocation to either 20 sessions of TBS or standard rTMS. Multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is acquired for each participant at baseline (before TMS treatment) with T1-weighted and task-free functional MRI during rest used to estimate TMS targets. For participants enrolled in the mechanistic substudy, additional diffusion-weighted sequences are acquired at baseline and at posttreatment follow-up 16 weeks after treatment randomization. Core data sets of T1-weighted and task-free functional MRI during rest are acquired for all participants and are used to estimate TMS targets. Additional sequences of arterial spin labeling, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and diffusion-weighted images are acquired depending on the recruitment site for mechanistic evaluation. Standard rTMS treatment is targeted at the F3 electrode site over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, whereas TBS treatment is guided using the coordinate of peak effective connectivity from the right anterior insula to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Both treatment targets benefit from the level of MRI guidance, but only TBS is provided with precision targeting based on functional brain connectivity. Recruitment began in January 2019 and is ongoing. Data collection is expected to continue until January 2023. This trial will determine the impact of precision MRI guidance on rTMS treatment and assess the neural mechanisms underlying this treatment in treatment-resistant depressed patients.

"Telemedicine catches on: changes in the utilization of telemedicine services during the COVID-19 pandemic","To determine the degree of telemedicine expansion overall and across patient subpopulations and diagnoses. We hypothesized that telemedicine visits would increase substantially due to the need for continuity of care despite the disruptive effects of COVID-19. A retrospective study of health insurance claims for telemedicine visits from January 1, 2018, through March 10, 2020 (prepandemic period), and March 11, 2020, through October 31, 2020 (pandemic period). We analyzed claims from 1,589,777 telemedicine visits that were submitted to Independence Blue Cross (Independence) from telemedicine-only providers and providers who traditionally deliver care in person. The primary exposure was the combination of individual behavior changes, state stay-at-home orders, and the Independence expansion of billing policies for telemedicine. The comparison population consisted of telemedicine visits in the prepandemic period. Telemedicine increased rapidly from a mean (SD) of 773 (155) weekly visits in prepandemic 2020 to 45,632Ã‚Â (19,937) weekly visits in the pandemic period. During the pandemic period, a greater proportion of telemedicine users were older, had Medicare Advantage insurance plans, had existing chronic conditions, or resided in predominantly non-Hispanic Black or African American Census tracts compared with during the prepandemic period. A significant increase in telemedicine claims containing a mental health-related diagnosis was observed. Telemedicine expanded rapidly during the COVID-19 pandemic across a broad range of clinical conditions and demographics. Although levels declined later in 2020, telemedicine utilization remained markedly higher than 2019 and 2018 levels. Trends suggest that telemedicine will likely play a key role in postpandemic care delivery.","Friedman, Gervasi, Song, Bond, Chen, Bergman, David, Bailey, Brooks, Smith-McLallen","https://doi.org/10.37765/ajmc.2022.88771","20220120","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-21","",25752,""
"Interaction between science advice and policymaking in time of COVID-19: a French perspective","In the COVID-19 context, many Governments relied on scientific consultative bodies to advise their policy, but their contribution remains poorly documented. This paper aims to fill this gap by reviewing the role played by the French High Council for Public Health (HCSP) in the French Government's response to COVID-19. We studied the time distribution of the COVID-19 guidelines produced by the HCSP until November 2020, computed their delay of production and analyzed the thematic areas they cover. To assess their use by the authorities, we looked for references to these guidelines in the regulatory texts, protocols and press communicates issued by national and local authorities until January 2021. The HCSP was strongly demanded with 102 guidelines produced following 97 official requests and two self-referrals. Most of them (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°43) concerned protective measures to constrain the infection while health inequalities and mental health were poorly addressed. Timing was very constraint as half of the guidelines were requested within 4Ã¢â‚¬â€°days. In total, 73% of the guidelines were used by policy makers to implement new obligations or within communication toward the public at national and local levels. This paper informs on the HCSP's contribution during the crisis and stresses the difficulties it encountered to provide quality recommendations in very short times. It prompts Governments to enlarge the competencies of their advisory boards and to consider the multidimensional aspects of health in policy design.","Bruat, Monnet, Azanowsky, Faliu, Mansour, Chauvin","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckac008","20220120","Advisory Committees; COVID-19; Decision Making; Health Policy; Technical Expertise","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-21","",25753,""

Depressive symptoms (PHQ-2), anxiety (GAD-2), post-traumatic stress (PCL-C-2), social support (EMAS), loneliness (UCLA-3), and discrimination (InDI-d) were evaluated. Significant changes were found in the variables depression and anxiety with a greater presence of this kind of symptomatology after one year (p &amp;lt; .01). There were also significant changes in the variable social support, which showed a substantial reduction after one year (p &amp;lt; .001). Similarly, there were significant variations in the variable intersectional discrimination (p &amp;lt; .001), with greater levels of discrimination. The temporal models show no significant differences in terms of post-traumatic symptomatology (p = .12) or loneliness (p = .19).

"Death anxiety, self-esteem, and health-related quality of life among geriatric caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has influenced all social spaces and older adults are susceptible to COVID-19. Geriatric caregivers in nursing homes might experience death anxiety when faced with infected older adults and a closed working environment. Death anxiety is a negative and formidable affective state. Yet, little is currently known about the relationships among death anxiety, self-esteem, and health-related quality of life among geriatric caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to examine whether self-esteem could moderate the association between death anxiety and health-related quality of life during the pandemic. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Jinan and Heze cities, Shandong Province, from November 2020 to January 2021. Participants comprised a convenience sample of 236 geriatric caregivers in nursing homes. Data on sociodemographic variables, death anxiety, self-esteem, and health-related quality of life were collected. Descriptive analysis, Pearson correlation, and moderated analysis were used for statistical analysis. Self-esteem moderated the association between death anxiety and health-related quality of life (death anxiety Ãƒâ€” self-esteem: BÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â -0.113, 95% CI: -0.143, -0.018). This study revealed that self-esteem played a moderating role between death anxiety and health-related quality of life during the pandemic, which implies that mental health should be given more attention, and that interventions for improving self-esteem need to be carried out.","Zhao, Zhang, Su, Song, Si, Zhu","https://doi.org/10.1111/psyg.12807","20220120","COVID-19; death anxiety; geriatric caregivers; health-related quality of life; self-esteem","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-21","",25755,""
"The perceptions of general practice among Central and Eastern Europeans in the United Kingdom: A systematic scoping review","Around 2 million people have migrated from Central and Eastern Europe to the UK since 2004. The UK Central and Eastern European Community (UK-CEE) are disproportionately exposed to the social determinants of poor physical and mental health. Their health and healthcare beliefs remain under-researched, particularly regarding primary care. This review explores UK-CEE community members' use and perceptions of UK general practice. A systematic search of nine bibliographic databases identified 2094 publications that fulfilled the search criteria. Grey literature searches identified 16 additional relevant publications. Screening by title and abstract identified 201 publications of relevance, decreasing to 65 after full-text screening. Publications were critically appraised, with data extracted and coded. Thematic analysis using constant comparison allowed generation of higher-order thematic constructs. Full UK-CEE national representation was achieved. Comparatively low levels of GP registration were described, with ability, desire and need to engage with GP services shaped by the interconnected nature of individual community members' cultural and sociodemographic factors. Difficulties overcoming access and in-consultation barriers are common, with health expectations frequently unmet. Distrust and dissatisfaction with general practice often persist, promoting alternative health-seeking approaches including transnational healthcare. Marginalized UK-CEE community subgroups including Roma, trafficked and homeless individuals have particularly poor GP engagement and outcomes. Limited data on the impact of Brexit and COVID-19 could be identified. Review findings demonstrate the need for codesigned approaches to remove barriers to engagement, culturally adapt and develop trust in GP care for UK-CEE individuals. Community members and stakeholders shaped the conceptualisation of the review question and validation of emergent themes.","Poppleton, Howells, Adeyemi, Chew-Graham, Dikomitis, Sanders","https://doi.org/10.1111/hex.13433","20220120","European Union; United Kingdom; delivery of healthcare; emigration immigration; general practice","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-21","",25756,""
"COVID-19 infection and the broader impacts of the pandemic on healthcare workers","The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) disease or COVID-19 pandemic is associated with more than 230 million cases and has challenged healthcare systems globally. Many healthcare workers (HCWs) have acquired the infection, often through their workplace, with a significant number dying. The epidemiology of COVID-19 infection in HCWs continues to be explored, with manifold exposure risks identified, leading to COVID-19 being recognised as an occupational disease for HCWs. The physical illness due to COVID-19 in HCWs is similar to the general population, with some HCWs experiencing a long-term illness, which may impact their ability to return to work. HCWs have also been affected by the immense workplace and psychosocial disruption caused by the pandemic. The impacts on the psychological well-being of HCWs globally have been profound, with high prevalence estimates for mental health symptoms, including emotional exhaustion. Globally, governments, healthcare organisations and employers have key responsibilities, including: to be better prepared for crises with comprehensive disaster response management plans, and to protect and preserve the health workforce from the physical and psychological impacts of the pandemic. While prioritising HCWs in vaccine rollouts globally has been critical, managing exposures and outbreaks occurring in healthcare settings remains challenging and continues to lead to substantial disruption to the health workforce. Safeguarding healthcare workforces during crises is critical as we move forward on the new path of 'COVID normal'.","Smallwood, Harrex, Rees, Willis, Bennett","https://doi.org/10.1111/resp.14208","20220120","COVID-19 infection; epidemiology; healthcare workers; mental; occupational medicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-21","",25757,""

This study compared the experiences of autistic and non-autistic current United Kingdom students, in terms of thoughts about dropping out, burnout, mental health and coping, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Burnout was of particular interest as this is a relatively unexamined phenomenon for autistic students. Seventy autistic and 315 non-autistic students, completed a mixed methods questionnaire with standardized measures of burnout (personal and academic), mental health (depression, stress, and anxiety), and coping styles (adaptive and maladaptive). We also included qualitative questions about dropping out and COVID-19 experiences. We found autistic participants experienced higher rates of burnout and mental health symptoms and were more likely to have thought about dropping out. Reasons given for thinking about dropping out, for both groups, focused on poor mental well-being, doubts about university, and academic challenges. For autistic participants, further analyses did not identify specific predictors of thinking about dropping out, but for non-autistic participants, this was predicted by maladaptive coping styles and academic burnout. Academic and personal burnout predicted one another for autistic students, and age, maladaptive coping, autistic characteristics, stress, and anxiety additionally predicted burnout for non-autistic students. Similarities in experiences during the pandemic were noted, with both groups experiencing negative social implications, difficulties adjusting to emergency online learning, and poorer psychological well-being. Moving forward from COVID-19, universities must find ways to enhance both academic and social support, to enable equal opportunity within Higher Education for autistic students.","Cage, McManemy","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.792945","20220120","COVID-19; autism; burnout; higher education; mental well-being; university dropout","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-21","",25759,""
"Assessment of the Risk of Depression in Residents Staying at Long-Term Care Institutions in Poland During the COVID-19 Pandemic Depending on the Quality of Cognitive Functioning","<b>Background:</b> The development of the COVID-19 pandemic has prompted the implementation of many procedures to safeguard against further increases in illness. Unfortunately, this has drastically reduced residents' contact with their families, which has increased feelings of loneliness and isolation. This is particularly difficult in long-term care facilities, where the risk of developing depression is higher than in the general population. <b>Objectives:</b> The aim of the study was to assess the risk of depression among the residents of long-term care institutions in Poland during the COVID-19 pandemic and to determine the relationship between the risk of depression and the occurrence of cognitive impairment in the study group. <b>Methods:</b> The study included 273 residents from long-term care institutions in Poland. The risk of depression was determined based on an originally designed questionnaire. The cognitive state of the subjects was assessed using the screening test Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Both the depression risk assessment and the MMSE test were conducted twice: in March and December 2020. <b>Results:</b> In March, severe dementia was present in 28.2% of the residents and normal MMSE scores were observed in 16.1% of the subjects; in December, the prevalence of severe dementia increased to 31.1% and that of normal scores decreased to 10.3%. In March, no participant was found to be at high risk of depression and moderate risk was observed in 14.3% of the subjects; in December, 2.6% of the residents had a high risk score and 45.4% had a moderate risk score. Statistical analysis revealed that higher MMSE scores correspond with a higher risk of depression. <b>Conclusion:</b> A higher risk of depression was observed with the development of the pandemic. Residents with cognitive impairment were characterised by a lower risk of depression compared to individuals with normal MMSE scores. During the study, progression of cognitive impairment was observed in the residents.","GÃƒÂ³rski, Buczkowska, Grajek, Garbicz, CaÃ…â€šyniuk, Paciorek, GÃ…â€šuszek, Polaniak","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.766675","20220120","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; dementia; depression; elderly individuals; long-term care institutions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-21","",25760,""
"Comparison of Prevalence and Risk Factors of PTSS Between Chinese Patients With Depression and Non-depressed Controls During COVID-19 Outbreak","<b>Background:</b> COVID-19 pandemic is a traumatic event all over the world, and may lead to post-traumatic stress symptom (PTSS) in different population who are under the threat of novel corona virus. Therefore, the aim of our study was to compare the prevalence and risk factors of PTSS between Chinese patients with depression and non-depressed controls during the COVID-19 outbreak. <b>Methods:</b> 437 depressed patients and 2,940 non-depressed controls were enrolled in this cross-sectional study between February 14 and May 9, 2020.The Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R), Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were used to evaluate the psychological status of all the participants. <b>Results:</b> The prevalence of PTSS (IES-R Ã¢â€°Â¥ 33) in depressed patients (45.08%) was higher than that in non-depressed controls (5.31%). Patients with depression were 16 times more likely to suffer from PTSS than those without depression. Correlation analyses showed that the IES-R total score was positively correlated with SDS, SAS, and PSQI scores in both depressed and non-depressed groups (Bonferroni corrected all <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that SAS score, and PSQI score were independently associated with IES-R total score in both depression and non-depression groups. In depressed patients, education level and duration of media exposure to COVID-19 were positively associated with PTSS, while in the non-depressed group, subjects who were married, in the 31-50 year group or with higher SDS score were more likely to develop PTSS. <b>Conclusions:</b> These results indicate that the prevalence rate of PTSS in patients with depression is very higher than that in subjects without depression. PTSS are associated with a number of socio-demographic and clinical variables.","Peng, Song, Liu, Zhao, Lai, Bao, Guo, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.719931","20220120","COVID-19; PTSD; PTSS; correlates; depression; post-traumatic stress disorder; posttraumatic stress symptom; prevalence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-21","",25761,""
"COVID-19 behavioral health and quality of life","In addition to concern about physical health consequences of COVID-19, many researchers also note the concerning impact on behavioral health and quality of life due to disruption. The purpose of this paper is to explore pathways of COVID-19 behavioral health and quality of life. We found increased anxiety, depression, and alcohol misuse and that the pandemic exacerbated prior problems. Further community indicators also lead to poorer behavioral health and overall decreased quality of life. The nature of COVID-19 and vast reach of the virus suggests that behavioral health concerns should take a primary role in pandemic recovery.","Hansel, Saltzman, Melton, Clark, Bordnick","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-05042-z","20220120","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-21","",25762,""
"Health trends, inequalities and opportunities in South Africa's provinces, 1990-2019: findings from the Global Burden of Disease 2019 Study","Over the last 30 years, South Africa has experienced four 'colliding epidemics' of HIV and tuberculosis, chronic illness and mental health, injury and violence, and maternal, neonatal, and child mortality, which have had substantial effects on health and well-being. Using data from the 2019 Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries and Risk Factors Study (GBD 2019), we evaluated national and provincial health trends and progress towards important Sustainable Development Goal targets from 1990 to 2019. We analysed GBD 2019 estimates of mortality, non-fatal health loss, summary health measures and risk factor burden, comparing trends over 1990-2007 and 2007-2019. Additionally, we decomposed changes in life expectancy by cause of death and assessed healthcare system performance. Across the nine provinces, inequalities in mortality and life expectancy increased over 1990-2007, largely due to differences in HIV/AIDS, then decreased over 2007-2019. Demographic change and increases in non-communicable diseases nearly doubled the number of years lived with disability between 1990 and 2019. From 1990 to 2019, risk factor burdens generally shifted from communicable and nutritional disease risks to non-communicable disease and injury risks; unsafe sex remained the top risk factor. Despite widespread improvements in healthcare system performance, the greatest gains were generally in economically advantaged provinces. Reductions in HIV/AIDS and related conditions have led to improved health since 2007, though most provinces still lag in key areas. To achieve health targets, provincial governments should enhance health investments and exchange of knowledge, resources and best practices alongside populations that have been left behind, especially following the COVID-19 pandemic.","Achoki, Sartorius, Watkins, Glenn, Kengne, Oni, Wiysonge, Walker, Adetokunboh, Babalola, Bolarinwa, Claassens, Cowden, Day, Ezekannagha, Ginindza, Iwu, Iwu, Karangwa, Katoto, Kugbey, Kuupiel, Mahasha, Mashamba-Thompson, Mensah, Ndwandwe, Nnaji, Ntsekhe, Nyirenda, Odhiambo, Oppong Asante, Parry, Pillay, Schutte, Seedat, Sliwa, Stein, Tanser, Useh, Zar, ZÃƒÂ¼hlke, Mayosi, Hay, Murray, Naghavi","https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2021-217480","20220120","HIV; health policy; healthcare disparities; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-21","",25763,""

"Video intervention to increase treatment-seeking by healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: randomised controlled trial","Many healthcare workers do not seek help, despite their enormous stress and greater risk for anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This study screened for psychopathology and evaluated the efficacy of a brief, social contact-based video intervention in increasing treatment-seeking intentions among healthcare workers (trial registration: NCT04497415). We anticipated finding high rates of psychopathology and greater treatment-seeking intentions post-intervention. Healthcare workers (n = 350) were randomised to (a) a brief video-based intervention at day 1, coupled with a booster video at day 14; (b) the video at day 1 only; or (c) a non-intervention control. In the 3 min video, a female nurse described difficulty coping with stress, her anxieties and depression, barriers to care and how therapy helped her. Assessments were conducted pre- and post-intervention and at 14- and 30-day follow-ups. Of the 350 healthcare workers, 281 (80%) reported probable anxiety, depression and/or PTSD. Participants were principally nurses (n = 237; 68%), physicians (n = 52; 15%) and emergency medical technicians (n = 30; 9%). The brief video-based intervention yielded greater increases in treatment-seeking intentions than the control condition, particularly among participants in the repeat-video group. Exploratory analysis revealed that in both video groups, we found greater effect among nurses than non-nurses. A brief video-based intervention increased treatment-seeking intention, possibly through identification and emotional engagement with the video protagonist. A booster video magnified that effect. This easily disseminated intervention could increase the likelihood of seeking care and offer employers a proactive approach to encourage employees to search for help if needed.","Amsalem, Lazarov, Markowitz, Smith, Dixon, Neria","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjp.2021.54","20220120","COVID-19; Healthcare; intervention; psychopathology; treatment-seeking","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-21","",25765,""

"Relationship between interoceptive sensibility, age, and COVID-19 anxiety during the first national lockdown in the United Kingdom","<b>Objectives:</b> Interoception refers to the multidimensional representation of the internal states of the body, including sensation, appraisal, integration, and regulation. COVID-19 targets internal respiratory, temperature and gastrointestinal systems, thus posing a threat to humans that causes anxiety. Here, we examined the relationship between interoceptive sensibility and COVID-19 anxiety during the first UK national lockdown, when uncertainties surrounding the virus were at their peak.<b>Methods:</b> Between April and July 2020, <i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°232 individuals across four age-categories completed questionnaires measuring interoceptive sensibility (BPQ-SF and MAIA-2), an adapted State-Trait-Anxiety Inventory (STAI) to assess COVID-19 anxiety, and a Perceived Quality of Life (QoL) questionnaire.<b>Results:</b> Higher scores on the BPQ-SF were related to higher levels of COVID-19 anxiety, while the MAIA-2 subscales Not Worrying, Attention Regulation, and Trusting of bodily signals were related to lower levels of COVID-19 anxiety. Age was related to lower levels of COVID-19 anxiety yet showed no significant (Bonferroni-corrected) relationship with interoceptive dimensions. Trait anxiety, Not Worrying, perceived quality of work, and COVID-19-related media consumption emerged as significant predictors of COVID-19 anxiety.<b>Conclusion:</b> Findings suggest that interoceptive dimensions differentially relate to COVID-19 anxiety irrespective of age, with implications for managing health anxiety and adaptive behaviour during a pandemic across the lifespan.","Elliott, Pfeifer","https://doi.org/10.1080/13607863.2022.2026878","20220120","Aging; COVID-19; Interoception; anxiety; mental health; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-21","",25767,""
"Reinforcement sensitivity predicts affective psychopathology via emotion regulation: Cross-sectional, longitudinal and quasi-experimental evidence","The current article presents a model wherein reinforcement sensitivity predicts depression and anxiety via trait preferences for concomitant emotion regulation strategies. In Study 1 (N = 593), BAS sensitivity positively predicted reappraisal and BIS sensitivity negatively predicted it. Reappraisal then negatively predicted depression. BIS sensitivity also predicted rumination, which predicted both depression and anxiety. Study 2a confirmed the model developed in Study 1 with an independent sample (N = 513) and examined the relationships longitudinally. While the cross-sectional relationships were generally maintained, reinforcement sensitivity did not predict reappraisal. In Study 2b, participants (N = 218) were assessed a third time one year later, at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. During this stressful time, BAS sensitivity did longitudinally predict reappraisal. These studies highlight the role of emotion regulation in mediating the relationship between reinforcement sensitivity and affective pathology, particularly during times of high stress.","Katz, Yovel","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.01.017","20220120","Internalizing Disorders; Longitudinal Study; Reappraisal; Reinforcement Sensitivity; Rumination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-21","",25768,""
