0,Drug synergy of combinatory treatment with remdesivir and the repurposed drugs fluoxetine and itraconazole effectively impairs SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro,"The SARS-COV-2 pandemic and the global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) urgently calls for efficient and safe antiviral treatment strategies. A straightforward approach to speed up drug development at lower costs is drug repurposing. Here we investigated the therapeutic potential of targeting the host- SARS-CoV-2 interface via repurposing of clinically licensed drugs and evaluated their use in combinatory treatments with virus- and host-directed drugs. We tested the antiviral potential of repurposing the antifungal itraconazole and the antidepressant fluoxetine on the production of infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles in the polarized Calu-3 cell culture model and evaluated the added benefit of a combinatory use of these host-directed drugs with remdesivir, an inhibitor of viral RNA polymerase. Drug treatments were well-tolerated and potent impaired viral replication was observed with all drug treatments. Importantly, both itraconazole-remdesivir and fluoxetine-remdesivir combinations inhibited the production of infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles > 90% and displayed synergistic effects in commonly used reference models for drug interaction. Itraconazole-Remdesivir and Fluoxetine-Remdesivir combinations are promising therapeutic options to control SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe progression of COVID-19.",Ursula Rescher; Sebastian Schloer; Linda Brunotte; Angeles Mecate-Zambrano; Shuyu Zheng; Jing Tang; Stephan Ludwig,https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.342410,20201016.0,,bioRxiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17

15,Synergy of pandemics-social isolation is associated with worsened Parkinson severity and quality of life,"Social isolation and its deleterious effects on health increases with age in the general population  People with Parkinson’s Disease (PWP) are no exception  Social isolation is a risk factor for worsened health outcomes and increased mortality  Symptoms such as depression and sleep dysfunction are adversely affected by loneliness  There is a paucity of research on social isolation in Parkinson’s disease (PD), which is all the more critical now in the setting of social distancing due to COVID-19  The goal of this study was to survey individuals with PD to evaluate whether social isolation is associated with PD symptom severity and quality of life  Only individuals reporting a diagnosis of idiopathic PD were included in this analysis  The primary outcome measures were the Patient-Reported Outcomes in PD (PRO-PD) and questions from PROMIS Global related to social health  PRO-PD scores increased as social performance and social satisfaction scores diminished  Individuals who reported being lonely experienced a 55% greater symptom severity than those who were not lonely (P &lt; 0 01)  Individuals who documented having a lot of friends had 21% fewer symptoms than those with few or no friends (P &lt; 0 01)  Social isolation was associated with greater patient-reported PD severity and lower quality of life, although it is unclear whether this is the cause and/or a consequence of the disease  In essence, the Parkinson pandemic and the pandemic of social isolation have been further compounded by the recent COVID-19 pandemic  The results emphasize the need to keep PWP socially connected and prevent loneliness in this time of social distancing  Proactive use of virtual modalities for support groups and social prescribing should be explored","Subramanian, I.; Farahnik, J.; Mischley, L.

44,Poor appetite and overeating reported by adults in Australia during the coronavirus-19 disease pandemic: a population-based study,"OBJECTIVE: As a result of the coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) pandemic, Australia adopted emergency measures on 22 March 2020. This study reports the effect of the COVID-19 lockdown on appetite and overeating in Australian adults during the first month of emergency measures. DESIGN: This study reports analysis of data from the population-based, self-completed survey. The main outcome measure was an item from the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 asking: 'Over the past 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by poor appetite or overeating?'. Data on sociodemographic factors, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and the impact of COVID-19 and lockdown were also collected. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine associations with poor appetite or overeating. SETTING: An anonymous online survey available from 3 April to 2 May 2020. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 13 829 Australian residents aged 18 years or over. RESULTS: The weighted prevalence of being bothered by poor appetite or overeating in the past 2 weeks was 53·6 %, with 11·6 % (95 % CI 10·6, 12·6) of the cohort reporting poor appetite or overeating nearly every day. High levels of anxiety, concern about contracting COVID-19, being in lockdown with children and reporting a severe impact of the lockdown were associated with increased odds of poor appetite or overeating. CONCLUSIONS: Given the widespread prevalence of being bothered by poor appetite or overeating, universal public health interventions to address emotion-focused or situational eating during periods of lockdown may be appropriate.","Owen, A J; Tran, T; Hammarberg, K; Kirkman, M; Fisher, Jrw",https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1368980020003833,,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Public Health Nutr;: 1-7, 2020 Sep 25.; Publication details: Public Health Nutr;: 1-7, 2020 Sep 25.; Publication type: article",WHO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
45,Mental Health Practitioners' Immediate Practical Response During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Observational Questionnaire Study,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with increased psychological distress, signaling the need for increased mental health services in the context of stay-at-home policies. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to characterize how mental health practitioners have changed their practices during the pandemic. The authors hypothesize that mental health practitioners would increase tele-mental health services and that certain provider types would be better able to adapt to tele-mental health than others. METHODS: The study surveyed 903 practitioners, primarily psychologists/doctoral-level (Psych/DL) providers, social workers/master's-level (SW/ML) providers, and neuropsychologists employed in academic medical centers or private practices. Differences among providers were examined using Bonferroni-adjusted chi-square tests and one-way Bonferroni-adjusted analyses of covariance. RESULTS: The majority of the 903 mental health practitioners surveyed rapidly adjusted their practices, predominantly by shifting to tele-mental health appointments (n=729, 80.82%). Whereas 80.44% (n=625) were not using tele-mental health in December 2019, only 22.07% (n=188) were not by late March or early April 2020. Only 2.11% (n=19) reported no COVID-19-related practice adjustments. Two-thirds (596/888, 67.10%) reported providing additional therapeutic services specifically to treat COVID-19-related concerns. Neuropsychologists were less likely and Psych/DL providers and SW/ML providers were more likely than expected to transition to tele-mental health (P<.001). Trainees saw fewer patients (P=.01) and worked remotely more than licensed practitioners (P=.03). Despite lower rates of information technology service access (P<.001), private practice providers reported less difficulty implementing tele-mental health than providers in other settings (P<.001). Overall, the majority (530/889, 59.62%) were interested in continuing to provide tele-mental health services in the future. CONCLUSIONS: The vast majority of mental health providers in this study made practice adjustments in response to COVID-19, predominantly by rapidly transitioning to tele-mental health services. Although the majority reported providing additional therapeutic services specifically to treat COVID-19-related concerns, only a small subset endorsed offering such services to medical providers. This has implications for future practical directions, as frontline workers may begin to seek mental health treatment related to the pandemic. Despite differences in tele-mental health uptake based on provider characteristics, the majority were interested in continuing to provide such services in the future. This may help to expand clinical services to those in need via tele-mental health beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","Reilly, Shannon E; Zane, Katherine L; McCuddy, William T; Soulliard, Zachary A; Scarisbrick, David M; Miller, Liv E; Mahoney Iii, James J",https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/21237,,"Country: CA; CANADÁ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Ment Health;7(9): e21237, 2020 Oct 01.; Publication details: JMIR Ment Health;7(9): e21237, 2020 Oct 01.; Publication type: article",WHO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
46,"Integration of Online Treatment Into the ""New Normal"" in Mental Health Care in Post-COVID-19 Times: Exploratory Qualitative Study","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated an immediate and large-scale uptake of online treatment for mental health care. However, there is uncertainty about what the ""new normal"" in mental health care will be like in post-COVID-19 times. To what extent will the experiences gained during the pandemic influence a sustainable adoption and implementation of online mental health care treatment in the future? OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we aim to formulate expectations with regard to the sustainability of online mental health care after COVID-19. METHODS: In an interview study, 11 mental health care professionals were asked about their experiences and expectations for the future. Participants were recruited from a mental health care organization in the Netherlands. The interviews took place between April 7-30, 2020, at the peak of the COVID-19 crisis in the Netherlands. The data were analyzed using a thematic coding method. RESULTS: From the interviews, we learn that the new normal in mental health care will most likely consist of more blended treatments. Due to skill enhancement and (unexpected) positive experiences with online treatment, an increase in adoption is likely to take place. However, not all experiences promise a successful and sustainable upscaling of online treatment in the future. Mental health care professionals are learning that not all clients are able to benefit from this type of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Sustainable upscaling of online mental health care requires customized solutions, investments in technology, and flexibility of mental health care providers. Online treatment could work for those who are open to it, but many factors influence whether it will work in specific situations. There is work to be done before online treatment is inherently part of mental health care.","Bierbooms, Joyce J P A; van Haaren, Monique; IJsselsteijn, Wijnand A; de Kort, Yvonne A W; Feijt, Milou; Bongers, Inge M B",https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/21344,,"Country: CA; CANADÁ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Form Res;4(10): e21344, 2020 Oct 08.; Publication details: JMIR Form Res;4(10): e21344, 2020 Oct 08.; Publication type: article",WHO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
47,Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Obsessive-Compulsive Symptoms Among University Students: Prospective Cohort Survey Study,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with common mental health problems. However, evidence for the association between fear of COVID-19 and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is limited. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine if fear of negative events affects Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) scores in the context of a COVID-19-fear-invoking environment. METHODS: All participants were medical university students and voluntarily completed three surveys via smartphone or computer. Survey 1 was conducted on February 8, 2020, following a 2-week-long quarantine period without classes; survey 2 was conducted on March 25, 2020, when participants had been taking online courses for 2 weeks; and survey 3 was conducted on April 28, 2020, when no new cases had been reported for 2 weeks. The surveys comprised the Y-BOCS and the Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS); additional items included questions on demographics (age, gender, only child vs siblings, enrollment year, major), knowledge of COVID-19, and level of fear pertaining to COVID-19. RESULTS: In survey 1, 11.3% of participants (1519/13,478) scored &#8805;16 on the Y-BOCS (defined as possible OCD). In surveys 2 and 3, 3.6% (305/8162) and 3.5% (305/8511) of participants had scores indicative of possible OCD, respectively. The Y-BOCS score, anxiety level, quarantine level, and intensity of fear were significantly lower at surveys 2 and 3 than at survey 1 (P<.001 for all). Compared to those with a lower Y-BOCS score (<16), participants with possible OCD expressed greater intensity of fear and had higher SAS standard scores (P<.001). The regression linear analysis indicated that intensity of fear was positively correlated to the rate of possible OCD and the average total scores for the Y-BOCS in each survey (P<.001 for all). Multiple regressions showed that those with a higher intensity of fear, a higher anxiety level, of male gender, with sibling(s), and majoring in a nonmedicine discipline had a greater chance of having a higher Y-BOCS score in all surveys. These results were redemonstrated in the 5827 participants who completed both surveys 1 and 2 and in the 4006 participants who completed all three surveys. Furthermore, in matched participants, the Y-BOCS score was negatively correlated to changes in intensity of fear (r=0.74 for survey 2, P<.001; r=0.63 for survey 3, P=.006). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that fear of COVID-19 was associated with a greater Y-BOCS score, suggesting that an environment (COVID-19 pandemic) × psychology (fear and/or anxiety) interaction might be involved in OCD and that a fear of negative events might play a role in the etiology of OCD.","Ji, Guangjun; Wei, Wenjun; Yue, Kai-Chen; Li, Heng; Shi, Li-Jing; Ma, Jian-Dong; He, Chen-Yang; Zhou, Sheng-Sheng; Zhao, Zongya; Lou, Tao; Cheng, Jie; Yang, Shi-Chang; Hu, Xian-Zhang",https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/21915,,"Country: CA; CANADÁ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;22(9): e21915, 2020 09 30.; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;22(9): e21915, 2020 09 30.; Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology; Coronavirus Infections/psychology; Health Surveys; Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder/epidemiology; Pneumonia, Viral/epidemiology; Pneumonia, Viral/psychology; Students/psychology; Students/statistics & numerical data; Universities; Adolescent; Adult; Anxiety/epidemiology; Anxiety/psychology; Fear; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder/psychology; Pandemics; Prospective Studies; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Young Adult; Publication type: article",WHO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
48,Pandemic-related behaviours and psychological outcomes; A rapid literature review to explain COVID-19 behaviours,"COVID-19 spread rapidly causing widescale loss of life and economic devastation. Efforts to contain it have resulted in measures such as closing of borders and restrictions around travel, social activities and attending places of worship. We conducted this rapid review to systematically examine, synthesize, and critically appraise the available evidence on the relationship between pandemic-related behaviours and psychological outcomes. The methods were compliant with the PRISMA guidelines. The review was preregistered with PROSPERO (Registration #: CRD42020181576). A literature search was conducted from January 2010 to April 2020 using ProQuest, Web of Science, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, Scopus, SAGE Journals, and CINAHL. Of 3844 articles identified, we included 11 quantitative articles in the final synthesis, representing data from 32, 049 individual respondents from eight countries. We identified three pandemics (COVID-19, MERS-CoV, Influenza A(H1N1) pdm09) as well as several psychological outcomes including anxiety, mental distress, post-traumatic stress disorder, and anger. We also identified several behaviours during pandemics and categorized them into protective, preparedness, and perverse behaviours. The review showed that even though there is limited evidence regarding pandemic-related behaviours and psychological outcomes, the current findings showed that the psychological outcomes significantly impacted on the adoption of the pandemic-related behaviours. Given the negative effects of psychological outcomes on behaviours, we recommend that mental health professionals should promote mental health support to people exhibiting psychological distress resulting from similar events in the future. Also, we recommend that future research should test the hypothesized effects of pandemics and psychological outcomes on behaviour change.","Usher, Kim; Jackson, Debra; Durkin, Joanne; Gyamfi, Naomi; Bhullar, Navjot",https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/inm.12790,,Country: AU; AUSTRÁLIA; AUSTRALIA; AUSTRALIA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Ment Health Nurs;2020 Aug 29.; Publication details: Int J Ment Health Nurs;2020 Aug 29.; Publication type: article,WHO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
49,Social Media Exposure and College Students' Mental Health During the Outbreak of COVID-19: The Mediating Role of Rumination and the Moderating Role of Mindfulness,"In response to reports of people experiencing varying levels of anxiety and depression during the outbreak of COVID-19, researchers have argued that exposure to related information on social media is a salient contributing factor. Based on the integrated model of ruminative response style and the diathesis-stress model, it has been suggested that incorporating rumination and mindfulness may elucidate the potential mechanism underlying the aforementioned association. This study aimed to examine the mediating role of rumination and the moderating role of mindfulness in the association between social media exposure (SME) to COVID-19 information and psychological distress. The results from online questionnaire responses of 439 college students from two universities in Wuhan, Hubei Province, showed that rumination mediated the association between SME and psychological distress. Furthermore, mindfulness was revealed as a protective factor that buffered the adverse effect of SME on psychological distress through rumination. These findings advance a better understanding of the formation process of psychological symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic and provide insights regarding effective interventions for adverse mental health consequences in college students.","Hong, Wei; Liu, Ru-De; Ding, Yi; Fu, Xinchen; Zhen, Rui; Sheng, Xiaotian",https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/cyber.2020.0387,,Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Cyberpsychol Behav Soc Netw;2020 Oct 12.; Publication details: Cyberpsychol Behav Soc Netw;2020 Oct 12.; Publication type: article,WHO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
50,The mediation role of sleep quality in the association between the incidence of unhealthy movement behaviors during the COVID-19 quarantine and mental health,"BACKGROUND: Our aim was to investigate the mediating role of worsening sleep quality in the association of the incidence of physical inactivity, high TV-viewing, and high computer/tablet use with loneliness, sadness, and anxiety. METHODS: Data of 45,161 Brazilian adults from a nationwide behavior survey, conducted between April 24th and May 24th (2020), were used. Participants reported physical inactivity (PI; <150 min/week), high TV-viewing (TV; &#8805;4 h/day), and high computer/tablet use (PC; &#8805;4 h/day) before and during COVID-19 quarantine (exposures). For incidence indicators, we only considered participants without the risk behavior before quarantine. Changes in sleep quality during the quarantine period (maintained/got better or worsened) were treated as a mediator. Elevated frequencies of feelings of loneliness, sadness (feel sad, crestfallen, or depressed), and anxiety (feel worried, anxious, or nervous) during the pandemic period were the study outcomes. Analyses were adjusted for sex, age group, highest academic achievement, working status during quarantine, skin color, previous diagnosis of depression, and adherence to quarantine. Mediation models were created using the Karlson Holm Breen method. RESULTS: The incidence of PI, high TV, and high PC use were associated with loneliness, sadness, and anxiety feelings. Worsening sleep quality partly mediated the association of the incidence of PI, high TV, and high PC use with loneliness (PI:30.9%; TV:19.6%; PC: 30.5%), sadness (PI:29.8%; TV:29.3%; PC: 39.1%), and anxiety (PI:21.9%; TV:30.0%; PC:38.5%). CONCLUSION: The association of the incidence of physical inactivity and sedentary behaviors with mental health indicators is partly mediated by worsening sleep quality during the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine.","Werneck, André O; Silva, Danilo R; Malta, Deborah Carvalho; Lima, Margareth G; Souza-Júnior, Paulo R B; Azevedo, Luiz O; Barros, Marilisa B A; Szwarcwald, Célia L",https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2020.09.021,,"Country: NL; HOLANDA; NETHERLANDS; PAISES BAJOS; THE NETHERLANDS; HOLLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Sleep Med;76: 10-15, 2020 Sep 25.; Publication details: Sleep Med;76: 10-15, 2020 Sep 25.; Publication type: article",WHO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17

56,Gibt es ein Post-COVID-Syndrom?; [Is there a post-COVID syndrome?],"For critically ill COVID-19 patients surviving the acute phase of the disease could possibly only mean having overcome the first stage of a long and challenging path. Physical, cognitive and psychological consequences seem to be realistic; however, do residual symptoms in patients who have returned to microbiological normalization constitute a post-COVID syndrome and which symptoms are principally possible in this context and are able to cause such a syndrome? It is no novelty that critically ill patients often still sustain functional limitations over a long period after discharge from hospital, in many cases even over many years. In most cases of COVID-19 it is too early for the diagnosis of a post-COVID syndrome. For this the symptoms would have to have lasted over a period of at least 6 months; therefore, only a post-infection fatigue can currently be spoken of. On top of this, even if patients recover physically they could be at particular risk of suffering from long-term mental health problems or perceive a reduced quality of life. Such findings exist not only after ARDS as many intensive care unit patients sustain long-term disorders, which is also known as post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). To sum up, there is sufficient evidence for the possible existence of a post-COVID syndrome or for the justification to correspondingly designate these possible sequelae with persisting symptoms in this way. In any case, all efforts that enable a complete functional recovery and a return to a life after corona are justified.","Lamprecht, Bernd",https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10405-020-00347-0,,"Country: DE; ALEMANHA; GERMANY; ALEMANIA; DEUSTCHLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Pneumologe (Berl);: 1-4, 2020 Oct 08.; Publication details: Pneumologe (Berl);: 1-4, 2020 Oct 08.; Publication type: article",WHO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
57,Factors associated with mental health outcomes across healthcare settings in Oman during COVID-19: frontline versus non-frontline healthcare workers,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess and compare demographic and psychological factors and sleep status of frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) in relation to non-frontline HCWs. DESIGN, SETTINGS, PARTICIPANTS AND OUTCOMES: This cross-sectional study was conducted from 8 April 2020 to 17 April 2020 using an online survey across varied healthcare settings in Oman accruing 1139 HCWs.The primary and secondary outcomes were mental health status and sociodemographic data, respectively. Mental health status was assessed using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21), and insomnia was evaluated by the Insomnia Severity Index. Samples were categorised into the frontline and non-frontline groups. &#967;2 and t-tests were used to compare groups by demographic data. The Mantel-Haenszel OR was used to compare groups by mental health outcomes adjusted by all sociodemographic factors. RESULTS: This study included 1139 HCWs working in Oman. While working during the pandemic period, a total of 368 (32.3%), 388 (34.1%), 271 (23.8%) and 211 (18.5%) respondents were reported to have depression, anxiety, stress and insomnia, respectively. HCWs in the frontline group were 1.5 times more likely to report anxiety (OR=1.557, p=0.004), stress (OR=1.506, p=0.016) and insomnia (OR=1.586, p=0.013) as compared with those in the non-frontline group. No significant differences in depression status were found between the frontline and non-frontline groups (p=0.201). CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the differential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on different grades of HCWs. This study suggests that frontline HCWs are disproportionally affected compared to non-frontline HCWs, with managing sleep-wake cycles and anxiety symptoms being highly endorsed among frontline HCWs. As psychosocial interventions are likely to be constrained owing to the pandemic, mental healthcare must first be directed to frontline HCWs.","Alshekaili, Muna; Hassan, Walid; Al Said, Nazik; Al Sulaimani, Fatima; Jayapal, Sathish Kumar; Al-Mawali, Adhra; Chan, Moon Fai; Mahadevan, Sangeetha; Al-Adawi, Samir",https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-042030,,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMJ Open;10(10): e042030, 2020 Oct 10.; Publication details: BMJ Open;10(10): e042030, 2020 Oct 10.; Publication type: article",WHO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17

61,Mental health care in French correctional settings during the Covid-19 pandemic,"Objective  The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the 11 million people currently incarcerated worldwide is the subject of many concerns  Prisons and jails are filled with people suffering from many preexisting medical conditions increasing the risk of complications  Detainees’ access to medical services is already limited and overcrowding poses a threat of massive contagion  Beyond the health impact of the crisis, the tightening of prison conditions worries  On March 16, 2020, in France, the lockdown measures have been accompanied by specific provisions for prisons: all facilities have suspended visitations, group activities and external interventions  Over 10 000 prisoners have been released to reduce the prison population and the risk of virus propagation  These adjustments had major consequences on the healthcare system in French prisons  The objectives of this article are to describe the reorganization of the three levels of psychiatric care for inmates in France in the context of Covid-19 pandemic and to have a look at the impact of lockdown measures and early releases on mental health of prisoners  Methods  This work is based on a survey conducted in April 2020 in France among psychiatric healthcare providers working in 42 ambulatory units for inmates and in the 9 full-time inpatient psychiatric wards exclusively for inmates called “UHSAs” (which stands for “unités hospitalières spécialement aménagées”, and can be translated as “specially equipped hospital units”)  A review of the international literature on mental healthcare system for inmates during the Covid-19 epidemic has also been performed  Results  The Covid-19 epidemic has been rather contained during the period of confinement in French prisons but the impact of confinement measures on the prison population is significant  The three levels of psychiatric care for inmates have implemented specific measures to ensure continuity of care, to support detainees during Coronavirus lockdown and to prevent an infection’s spread  Among the most important are: limitation of medical consultations to serious and urgent cases, creation of “Covid units”, cancellation of voluntary psychiatric hospitalizations, reinforcement of preventive hygiene measures and reshuffling of medical staff  Prolonged confinement has consequences on mental health of detainees  Currently, mental health workers are facing multiple clinical situations such as forced drug and substance withdrawal (linked to difficulties in supplying psychoactive substances), symptoms of anxiety (due to concerns for their own and their relatives’ wellbeing) and decompensation among patients with severe psychiatric conditions  Early releases from prison may also raise some issues  People recently released from prison are identified as at high risk of death by suicide and drug overdose  The lack of time to provide the necessary link between health services within prisons and health structures outside, could have serious consequences, emphasizing the well-known “revolving prison doors” effect  Discussion  The current lockdown measures applied in French jails and prisons point out the disparities between psychiatric care for inmates and psychiatric care for general population  Giving the high vulnerability of prison population, public health authorities should pay more attention to health care in prisons","Fovet, Thomas; Lancelevee, Camille; Eck, Marion; Scouflaire, Tatiana; Becache, Eve; Dandelot, Dominique; Giravalli, Pascale; Guillard, Alexandre; Horrach, Pierre; Lacambre, Mathieu; Lefebvre, Tiphaine; Moncany, Anne-Hélène, Touitou; David, David; Michel, Thomas; Pierre",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.05.002,,Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: L'Encephale;2020.; Publication details: L'Encephale;2020.; Publication type: article,WHO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17

COVID-19-related closed- and open-ended questions were included. A mixed-methods approach assessed COVID-19-related changes in well-being and sexual health by outness with an accepting guardian. The majority (57%) of participants reported being worried about COVID-19. Almost all (91%) were physically distancing. Participants noted that COVID-19 changed school, home, work, and family life. Participants highlighted that COVID-19 reduced their ability to socialize and had a deleterious effect on their mental health. In the past 3 months, participants reported seeing sexual partners in person less often, masturbating and viewing pornography more often, and sexting and messaging on men-seeking-men websites/phone applications about the same amount. Many described being physically distanced from sexual partners, and some noted an increase in their use of virtual ways to connect with partners (e.g., video chatting). There were no differences by outness with an accepting guardian in quantitative or qualitative responses. These findings provide a snapshot of the initial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic among a convenience sample of U.S. ASMM and underscore the need to provide access to resources sensitive to their social, developmental, and sexual health needs during this crisis.","Nelson, Gordon, John, Stout, Macapagal",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.08.027,20201011.0,ASMM; Adolescents; COVID-19; Mental health; Sexual health; Sexual minority; YMSM,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17

65,Trauma-informed responses in addressing public mental health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic: position paper of the European Society for Traumatic Stress Studies (ESTSS),"The COVID-19 pandemic has changed life in Europe and globally. The pandemic affects both individuals and the broader society across many domains, including physical and psychological health, the economy and general welfare. The measures taken to counteract the pandemic have significantly altered daily life and, along with the threat of contracting the coronavirus and uncertainties surrounding future developments, created a complex system of stressors with a negative impact on public mental health. This paper aims to outline the ESTSS strategy to address mental health issues related to COVID-19 and focuses on (1) trauma-informed policies, (2) capacity building, (3) collaborative research and (4) knowledge-exchange. To facilitate implementation of a trauma-informed approach and appropriate measures, ESTSS has developed a toolkit of recommendations on mental health and psychosocial assistance to be provided during the different phases of crisis and its aftermath. To promote capacity building, ESTSS offers a certification programme based on a curriculum in psychotraumatology and corresponding on-line training to the European community of mental health professionals. To assure evidence-based approaches and methods tailored to current circumstances, ESTSS has initiated a pan-European research project with international cooperation aimed at studying the mental health consequences of the pandemic, with a focus on psychological trauma and other stress-related reactions. To foster knowledge-exchange, the European Journal of Psychotraumatology (EJPT), the official journal of ESTSS, is publishing a special issue on COVID-19. La pandemia de COVID-19 ha cambiado la vida en Europa y en todo el mundo. La pandemia afecta tanto a los individuos como a la sociedad en general en muchos Ã¡mbitos, incluida la salud fÃ­sica y psicolÃ³gica, la economÃ­a y el bienestar general. Las medidas tomadas para contrarrestar la pandemia han alterado significativamente la vida diaria y, junto con la amenaza de contraer el coronavirus y las incertidumbres que rodean los desarrollos futuros, crearon un complejo sistema de estresores con un impacto negativo en la salud mental pÃºblica. En este artÃ­culo se pretende esbozar la estrategia de la ESTSS para abordar los problemas de salud mental relacionados con COVID-19 y se centra en: 1. PolÃ­ticas informadas en trauma, 2. capacitaciÃ³n, 3. investigaciÃ³n colaborativa, 4. e intercambio de conocimientos. Para facilitar la implementaciÃ³n de un enfoque basado en el trauma y las medidas apropiadas, la ESTSS ha desarrollado un conjunto de herramientas de recomendaciones sobre salud mental y asistencia psicosocial que se proporcionarÃ¡ durante las diferentes fases de la crisis y sus consecuencias. Para fomentar la capacitaciÃ³n, la ESTSS ofrece un programa de certificaciÃ³n basado en un plan de estudios en psicotraumatologÃ­a y la formaciÃ³n on-line correspondiente a la comunidad europea de profesionales de la salud mental. Para asegurar enfoques y mÃ©todos basados en la evidencia adaptados a las circunstancias actuales, la ESTSS ha iniciado un proyecto de investigaciÃ³n paneuropeo con cooperaciÃ³n internacional, destinado a estudiar las consecuencias de la pandemia en la salud mental, con enfoque en el trauma psicolÃ³gico y otras reacciones relacionadas con el estrÃ©s. Para fomentar intercambio de conocimiento, la European Journal of Psychotraumatology (EJPT), la revista oficial de ESTSS, publica un nÃºmero especial sobre COVID-19.

67,Risk of Mortality in Elderly Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients With Mental Health Disorders: A Nationwide Retrospective Study in South Korea,"This study aimed to investigate the different clinical characteristics among elderly coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with and without mental disorders in South Korea and determine if these characteristics have an association with underlying mental disorders causing mortality. A population-based comparative cohort study was conducted using the national claims database. Individuals aged â‰¥65 years with confirmed COVID-19 between January 1, 2020 and April 10, 2020 were assessed. The endpoints for evaluating mortality for all participants were death, 21 days after diagnosis, or April 10, 2020. The risk of mortality associated with mental disorders was estimated using Cox hazards regression. We identified 814 elderly COVID-19 patients (255 [31.3%] with mental disorder and 559 [68.7%] with nonmental disorder). Individuals with mental disorders were found more likely to be older, taking antithrombotic agents, and had diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive lung disease, and urinary tract infections than those without mental disorders. After propensity score stratification, our study included 781 patients in each group (236 [30.2%] with mental disorder and 545 [69.8%] with nonmental disorder). The mental disorder group showed higher mortality rates than the nonmental disorder group (12.7% [30/236] versus 6.8% [37/545]). However, compared to patients without mental disorders, the hazard ratio (HR) for mortality in elderly COVID-19 patients with mental disorders was not statistically significant (HR: 1.57, 95%CI: 0.95-2.56). Although the association between mental disorders in elderly individuals and mortality in COVID-19 is unclear, this study suggests that elderly patients with comorbid conditions and those taking psychiatric medications might be at a higher risk of COVID-19.","Lee, Cho, You, Park, Kim, Lee, Aizenstein, Andreescu, Karim, Hong, Rho, Park, Son",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.09.016,20201009.0,COVID-19; Elderly; mental disorder; mortality,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
68,"Communicable Diseases (Including COVID-19)-Induced Global Depression: Caused by Inadequate Healthcare Expenditures, Population Density, and Mass Panic","Coronavirus (COVID-19) is spreading at an enormous rate and has caused deaths beyond expectations due to a variety of reasons. These include: (i) inadequate healthcare spending causing, for instance, a shortage of protective equipment, testing swabs, masks, surgical gloves, gowns, etc.; (ii) a high population density that causes close physical contact among community members who reside in compact places, hence they are more likely to be exposed to communicable diseases, including coronavirus; and (iii) mass panic due to the fear of experiencing the loss of loved ones, lockdown, and shortage of food. In a given scenario, the study focused on the following key variables: communicable diseases, healthcare expenditures, population density, poverty, economic growth, and COVID-19 dummy variable in a panel of 76 selected countries from 2010 through 2019. The results show that the impact of communicable diseases on economic growth is positive because the infected countries get a reap of economic benefits from other countries in the form of healthcare technologies, knowledge transfers, cash transfers, international loans, aid, etc., to get rid of the diseases. However, the case is different with COVID-19 as it has seized the whole world together in a much shorter period of time and no other countries are able to help others in terms of funding loans, healthcare facilities, or technology transfers. Thus, the impact of COVID-19 in the given study is negatively impacting countries' economic growth that converts into a global depression. The high incidence of poverty and social closeness increases more vulnerable conditions that spread coronavirus across countries. The momentous increase in healthcare expenditures put a burden on countries' national healthcare bills that stretch the depression phase-out of the boundary. The forecasting relationship suggested the negative impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the global economy would last the next 10 years. Unified global healthcare policies, physical distancing, smart lockdowns, and meeting food challenges are largely required to combat the coronavirus pandemic and escape from global depression.","Anser, Yousaf, Khan, Sheikh, Nassani, Abro, Zaman",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.00398,20201006.0,(COVID-19); GMM estimator; communicable diseases; global depression; healthcare expenditures; population density; poverty incidence,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17

70,"A repeated cross-sectional survey assessing university students' stress, depression, anxiety, and suicidality in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland","The time of widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases can lead to elevated stress and mental health problems among all persons affected, and in particular those sub-groups of the population that are at an increased risk of mental health problems. One such vulnerable group constitutes university students. The aim of this study is to assess stress, depression, anxiety, and suicidality among different groups of university students (medical, psychology, and other). Using a repeated cross-sectional study design, we collected survey data among a large sample of 7228 university students from Poland (mean age = 22.78, s.d. = 4.40; 81% female). Data were collected in five waves, during the first 2 months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe (March and April 2020). The results demonstrate a significant increase in depression levels as the pandemic was progressing. We also found that female students scored significantly higher than male students on depression, anxiety, and stress. Psychology students recorded the lowest scores on depression and anxiety. Young adult students (aged 18-24 years) had more symptoms of depression, anxiety, and suicidality than adult students (â©¾25 years). These results provide insights into stress and mental health among university students during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings can be used for a more effective identification of students who may struggle during next stages of the pandemic and future crises.","Debowska, Horeczy, Boduszek, Dolinski",https://doi.org/10.1017/S003329172000392X,20201013.0,Anxiety; COVID-19 pandemic; depression; stress; suicidality; university students,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
71,[Psychological effects during the COVID-19 outbreak in Argentina],"After the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak, global measures were implemented with the aim of containing its progression. On March 20, 2020, the mandatory preventive quarantine began in Argentina. As a result of these events, previous studies conducted in the framework of this pandemic in China, have shown psychological consequences. The aim of this study is to explore, through a self-administered electronic survey, attitudes and fears regarding COVID-19, the development of depressive symptoms and the pattern of alcohol consumption among the argentinian population during quarantine (n = 759). As a result, we observed that fear of COVID-19 was greater in 55 to 59 years old people, with an abrupt drop above 70; that depressed mood and the increased of alcohol consumption were more frequent in youngest subjects, and that depressed mood was also frequent among subjects who lost their jobs during quarantine. Finally, we observed an elevated degree of agreement with the quarantine measure, even in some people who suffered a decrease in their income greater than 80% during quarantine. These results are useful for obtaining information about risk groups, enabling specific preventive and therapeutic strategies could be designed.

72,Management of psychiatric conditions and delirium during the COVID-19 pandemic across continents: lessons learned and recommendations,"With the uncertainties of COVID-19, people infected with coronavirus present with diverse psychiatric presentations. Some institutions have had to manage their patients with existing protocols, others have had to create them. In this article we aimed to report the challenges and good practices in the management of psychiatric conditions and delirium coexisting with COVID-19 across continents. Early Career Psychiatrists (ECPs) from across five continents were approached to share their experiences on the management of psychiatric conditions in patients with COVID-19 during the current pandemic. We collected information about the experiences from sixteen countries. Commonalities were similar psychiatric presentations and poor preparedness across countries. Differences were varying adjustments made in the management of psychiatric conditions coexisting with COVID-19 and different innovations. Good practices which can be adopted by other countries are novel approaches such as telepsychiatry, proactive consultation-liaison units and enhanced community services targeted at circumventing challenges faced when providing mental health services. These findings highlight the need for global preparedness in the mental health sector during outbreaks of infectious diseases, and the need for concerted efforts targeted at global and locally sensitive adaptation of existing protocols and the development of new guidelines for the management of psychiatric conditions for the present pandemic and subsequent occurrences.","Ojeahere, de Filippis, Ransing, Karaliuniene, Ullah, BytyÃ§i, Abbass, Kilic, Nahidi, Hayatudeen, Nagendrappa, Shoib, Jatchavala, Larnaout, Maiti, Ogunnubi, El Hayek, Bizri, Schuh Teixeira, Pereira-Sanchez, Pinto da Costa",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2020.100147,20201013.0,COVID-19; Coronavirus; Delirium; Early career psychiatrists (ECPs); Management; Psychiatric conditions,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
73,Health Anxiety and Mental Health Outcome During COVID-19 Lockdown in Italy: The Mediating and Moderating Roles of Psychological Flexibility,"The COVID-19 emergency has severely affected the Italian population. During a pandemic, those with high health anxiety are at risk of adverse mental health outcomes, including peritraumatic distress and mood disturbance. No prior research has explored the role of psychological flexibility in protecting people at high risk of poorer mental health impacts due to health anxiety during a pandemic. Psychological flexibility is the cornerstone of psychological health and resiliency. According to acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), it involves behaving consistently with one's chosen values even in the presence of emotional and mental discomfort. This study examined the mediating and moderating roles of psychological flexibility in the link between trait health anxiety and three mental health outcomes: COVID-19 peritraumatic distress, anxiety, and depression. We hypothesized that higher psychological flexibility would decrease the negative impacts of trait health anxiety on mental health outcomes. During the mandatory national lockdown (<i>M</i> = 35.70 days, <i>SD</i> = 8.41), 944 Italian adults (75.5% female, <i>M</i> = 38.86 years, <i>SD</i> = 13.20) completed an online survey consisting of standardized measures of psychological flexibility, trait health anxiety, COVID-19 distress, anxiety, and depression. Results indicated that psychological flexibility did not moderate the link between trait health anxiety and mental health outcomes. Rather, greater psychological flexibility mediated decreases in the adverse effects of trait health anxiety on COVID-19 distress, anxiety, and depression. In particular, two psychological flexibility processes, observing unhelpful thoughts rather than taking them literally (defusion) and values-based action (committed action), mediated decreases in the negative effects of trait health anxiety on all mental health outcomes. In contrast, the psychological flexibility process acceptance, which involves openness to inner discomfort, mediated increases in negative mental health outcomes. Overall, the combination of these processes mitigated the detrimental impacts of trait health anxiety on mental health during the emergency mandatory COVID-19 nationwide lockdown. Consistent with the ACT conceptualization of psychological flexibility, findings suggest embracing (rather than avoiding) inner discomfort and observing associated unhelpful thoughts, while also engaging in values-based action, increases resilience during adversity. Evidenced-based large-scale online public health interventions that target psychological flexibility in those experiencing health anxiety in the context of a pandemic are urgently needed. Many empirically-based ACT interventions are suited for this purpose.","Landi, Pakenham, Boccolini, Grandi, Tossani",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.02195,20201001.0,COVID-19; anxiety; depression; health anxiety; pandemic; psychological flexibility; quarantine,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
74,Effects of the lockdown on the mental health of the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy: Results from the COMET collaborative network,"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is an unprecedented traumatic event influencing the healthcare, economic, and social welfare systems worldwide. In order to slow the infection rates, lockdown has been implemented almost everywhere. Italy, one of the countries most severely affected, entered the &quot;lockdown&quot; on March 8, 2020. The COvid Mental hEalth Trial (COMET) network includes 10 Italian university sites and the National Institute of Health. The whole study has three different phases. The first phase includes an online survey conducted between March and May 2020 in the Italian population. Recruitment took place through email invitation letters, social media, mailing lists of universities, national medical associations, and associations of stakeholders (e.g., associations of users/carers). In order to evaluate the impact of lockdown on depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms, multivariate linear regression models were performed, weighted for the propensity score. The final sample consisted of 20,720 participants. Among them, 12.4% of respondents (NÂ =Â 2,555) reported severe or extremely severe levels of depressive symptoms, 17.6% (NÂ =Â 3,627) of anxiety symptoms and 41.6% (NÂ =Â 8,619) reported to feel at least moderately stressed by the situation at the DASS-21.According to the multivariate regression models, the depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms significantly worsened from the week April 9-15 to the week April 30 to May 4 (pÂ &lt;Â 0.0001). Moreover, female respondents and people with pre-existing mental health problems were at higher risk of developing severe depression and anxiety symptoms (pÂ &lt;Â 0.0001). Although physical isolation and lockdown represent essential public health measures for containing the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, they are a serious threat for mental health and well-being of the general population. As an integral part of COVID-19 response, mental health needs should be addressed.","Fiorillo, Sampogna, Giallonardo, Del Vecchio, Luciano, Albert, Carmassi, CarrÃ , Cirulli, Dell'Osso, Nanni, Pompili, Sani, Tortorella, Volpe",https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2020.89,20201014.0,Anxiety; COVID-19; depression; lockdown; pandemic; stress,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
75,The potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on child growth and development: a systematic review,"This was a systematic review of studies that examined the impact of epidemics or social restriction on mental and developmental health in parents and children/adolescents. The PubMed, WHO COVID-19, and SciELO databases were searched on March 15, 2020, and on April 25, 2020, filtering for children (0-18 years) and humans. The tools used to mitigate the threat of a pandemic such as COVID-19 may very well threaten child growth and development. These tools - such as social restrictions, shutdowns, and school closures - contribute to stress in parents and children and can become risk factors that threaten child growth and development and may compromise the Sustainable Development Goals. The studies reviewed suggest that epidemics can lead to high levels of stress in parents and children, which begin with concerns about children becoming infected. These studies describe several potential mental and emotional consequences of epidemics such as COVID-19, H1N1, AIDS, and Ebola: severe anxiety or depression among parents and acute stress disorder, post-traumatic stress, anxiety disorders, and depression among children. These data can be related to adverse childhood experiences and elevated risk of toxic stress. The more adverse experiences, the greater the risk of developmental delays and health problems in adulthood, such as cognitive impairment, substance abuse, depression, and non-communicable diseases. Information about the impact of epidemics on parents and children is relevant to policy makers to aid them in developing strategies to help families cope with epidemic/pandemic-driven adversity and ensure their children's healthy development.","AraÃºjo, Veloso, Souza, Azevedo, Tarro",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jped.2020.08.008,20201006.0,COVID-19; Child development; Coronavirus; SARS-COV2; Sustainable development goals; Toxic stress,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17

This was a survey study consisting of a 23-point questionnaire. The study involved surgical trainees that had been redeployed to the (ICU) across all hospitals in London during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey was sent to 90 surgical trainees who were between postgraduate years 2 to 4. Trainees in specialty training programs (&gt;5 years after graduation) were not included. Thirty-two trainees responded to the questionnaire and were included in the study results. All respondents spent between 4 and 8 weeks working in ICU. Prior to redeployment, 78% of participants had previous experience of ICU or an affiliated specialty, and &gt;90% had attended at least 1 educational course with relevance to ICU. There were statistically significant increases in confidence performing central venous cannulation and peripheral arterial catheterisation (p &lt; 0.05). With regards to clinical skills, respondents reported feeling more confident managing ventilated patients, patients on noninvasive ventilation, dialysis, and circulatory failure patients after working in ICU. Respondents (97%) felt that the experience would be beneficial to their future careers but 53% felt the redeployment had a negative impact on their mental health. Redeployment of surgical trainees to ICU led to increased confidence in a number of technical and nontechnical skills. However, proactive interventions are needed for training surgeons with regard to their psychological wellbeing in these extraordinary circumstances and to improve workforce planning for future pandemics.","Payne, Rahman, Bullingham, Vamadeva, Alfa-Wali",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsurg.2020.09.009,20201001.0,COVID-19; Pandemic; Surgical training; Wellbeing; Workforce,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17

A significant proportion of professionals reported symptoms of anxiety (31.4%) and depression (12.2%) from moderate to severe intensity. Symptoms of acute stress were reported by 14.5% of participants. We performed a regression analysis, which explained the 30% of the variance associated with the degree of emotional distress (Ry=0.30). The final model reveals that females (or young males), who are working in the frontline as nursing assistants, caretakers or radiology technicians, with the uncertainty of a possible infection, the perception of inadequate protection measures and having experienced the death of a close person by Covid-19, showed a heightened risk of experiencing psychological distress.

81,Associations of Mental Health and Personal Preventive Measure Compliance With Exposure to COVID-19 Information During Work Resumption Following the COVID-19 Outbreak in China: Cross-Sectional Survey Study,"Risk and crisis communication plays an essential role in public health emergency responses. The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered spontaneous and intensive media attention, which has affected people's adoption of personal preventive measures and their mental health. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between exposure to COVID-19-specific information and mental health (depression and sleep quality) and self-reported compliance with personal preventive measures (face mask wearing and hand sanitizing). We also tested whether these associations were moderated by thoughtful consideration of the veracity of the information to which people were exposed. A cross-sectional, closed web-based survey was conducted among a sample of 3035 factory workers at the beginning of work resumption following the COVID-19 outbreak in Shenzhen, China. A stratified two-stage cluster sampling design was used for recruitment. Multivariate linear and logistic regression models were used for the analyses. The prevalence of probable moderate-to-severe depression was 170/3035 (5.6%), while that of good or excellent sleep quality was 2110/3035 (69.5%). The prevalence of self-reported consistent face mask wearing in public places was 2903/3035 (95.7%), while that of sanitizing hands every time after returning from public spaces or touching public installations was 2151/3035 (70.9%). Of the 3035 respondents, 1013 to 1638 (33.3% to 54.0%) reported &gt;1 hour of daily exposure to COVID-19-specific information through web-based media and television. After controlling for significant background variables, higher information exposure via television and via newspapers and magazines was associated with better sleep quality and higher compliance with hand sanitizing. Higher exposure via unofficial web-based media was associated with higher compliance with hand sanitizing but was also associated with higher depressive symptoms. In contrast, higher exposure through face-to-face communication was associated with higher depressive symptoms, worse sleep quality, and lower compliance with hand sanitizing. Exposure to information about positive outcomes for patients with COVID-19, development of vaccines and effective treatments, and heroic stories about frontline health care workers were associated with both better mental health and higher compliance with preventive measures. Higher overall information exposure was associated with higher depressive symptoms among participants who were less likely to carefully consider the veracity of the information to which they were exposed; it was also associated with better sleep quality among people who reported more thoughtful consideration of information veracity. This study provides empirical evidence of how the amount, sources, and contents of information to which people were exposed influenced their mental health and compliance with personal preventive measures at the initial phase of work resumption in China. Thoughtful consideration of information quality was found to play an important moderating role.

82,The Resurgence of Cyber Racism During the COVID-19 Pandemic and its Aftereffects: Analysis of Sentiments and Emotions in Tweets,"With increasing numbers of patients with COVID-19 globally, China and the World Health Organization have been blamed by some for the spread of this disease. Consequently, instances of racism and hateful acts have been reported around the world. When US President Donald Trump used the term &quot;Chinese Virus,&quot; this issue gained momentum, and ethnic Asians are now being targeted. The online situation looks similar, with increases in hateful comments and posts. The aim of this paper is to analyze the increasing instances of cyber racism during the COVID-19 pandemic, by assessing emotions and sentiments associated with tweets on Twitter. In total, 16,000 tweets from April 11-16, 2020, were analyzed to determine their associated sentiments and emotions. Statistical analysis was carried out using R. Twitter API and the sentimentr package were used to collect tweets and then evaluate their sentiments, respectively. This research analyzed the emotions and sentiments associated with terms like &quot;Chinese Virus,&quot; &quot;Wuhan Virus,&quot; and &quot;Chinese Corona Virus.&quot; The results suggest that the majority of the analyzed tweets were of negative sentiment and carried emotions of fear, sadness, anger, and disgust. There was a high usage of slurs and profane words. In addition, terms like &quot;China Lied People Died,&quot; &quot;Wuhan Health Organization,&quot; &quot;Kung Flu,&quot; &quot;China Must Pay,&quot; and &quot;CCP is Terrorist&quot; were frequently used in these tweets. This study provides insight into the rise in cyber racism seen on Twitter.

The devastating immediate and long-term impact of violence on the mental health of children is well established. Despite commitments made by the international community to end violence against children and support their mental health, there has been a serious lack of investment and capacity to provide quality, rights-based, culturally appropriate mental health care globally. The arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic has magnified these challenges. This article outlines how the risk of children experiencing violence has increased and how the pandemic has weakened the capacity of child protection and mental health services to respond. The article argues for child protection, mental health and other core services to be prioritized during and after the pandemic.

84,[Immunopsychiatry and SARS-CoV-2Â pandemic: Links and possible consequences],"The SARS-CoV-2 (or COVID-19) pandemic has been propagating since December 2019, inducing a drastic increase in the prevalence of anxious and depressive disorders in the general population. Psychological trauma can partly explain these disorders. However, since psychiatric disorders also have an immuno-inflammatory component, the direct effects of the virus on the host's immune system, with a marked inflammatory response, but also the secondary inflammation to these psychosocial stressors, may cause the apparition or the worsening of psychiatric disorders. We describe here the probable immunopsychiatric consequences of the SARS-CoV-2Â pandemic, to delineate possible screening actions and care that could be planned. Data from previous pandemics, and existing data on the psychopathological consequences of the SARS-CoV-2Â pandemic, allowed us to review the possible immunopsychiatric consequences of the SARS-CoV-2Â pandemic, on the gestational environment, with the risk of consecutive neurodevelopmental disorders for the fetus on one hand, on the children and adults directly infected being at increased risks of psychiatric disorders on the other hand. As in previous pandemics, the activation of the immune system due to psychological stress and/or to infection during pregnancy, might lead to an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders for the fetus (schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders). Furthermore, in individuals exposed to psychological trauma and/or infected by the virus, the risk of psychiatric disorders, especially mood disorders, is probably increased. In this context, preventive measures and specialized care are necessary. Thus, it is important to propose a close follow-up to the individuals who have been infected by the virus, in order to set up the earliest care possible. Likewise, in pregnant women, screening of mood disorders during the pregnancy or the postpartum period must be facilitated. The follow-up of the babies born during the pandemic must be strengthened to screen and care for possible neurodevelopmental disorders.","Daaboul, Tamouza, Leboyer",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.07.002,20201001.0,Autism spectrum disorders; Immunopsychiatrie; Immunopsychiatry; Mood disorders; SARS-CoV-2; Schizophrenia; SchizophrÃ©nie; Troubles de lâ€™humeur; Troubles du spectre de lâ€™autisme,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
85,Self-Reported Compliance With Personal Preventive Measures Among Chinese Factory Workers at the Beginning of Work Resumption Following the COVID-19 Outbreak: Cross-Sectional Survey Study,"Maintaining compliance with personal preventive measures is important to achieve a balance of COVID-19 pandemic control and work resumption. The aim of this study was to investigate self-reported compliance with four personal measures to prevent COVID-19 among a sample of factory workers in Shenzhen, China, at the beginning of work resumption in China following the COVID-19 outbreak. These preventive measures included consistent wearing of face masks in public spaces (the workplace and other public settings); sanitizing hands using soap, liquid soap, or alcohol-based hand sanitizer after returning from public spaces or touching public installations and equipment; avoiding social and meal gatherings; and avoiding crowded places. The participants were adult factory workers who had resumed work in Shenzhen, China. A stratified two-stage cluster sampling design was used. We randomly selected 14 factories that had resumed work. All full-time employees aged â‰¥18 years who had resumed work in these factories were invited to complete a web-based survey. Out of 4158 workers who had resumed work in these factories, 3035 (73.0%) completed the web-based survey from March 1 to 14, 2020. Multilevel logistic regression models were fitted. Among the 3035 participants, 2938 (96.8%) and 2996 (98.7%) reported always wearing a face mask in the workplace and in other public settings, respectively, in the past month. However, frequencies of self-reported sanitizing hands (2152/3035, 70.9%), avoiding social and meal gatherings (2225/3035, 73.3%), and avoiding crowded places (1997/3035, 65.8%) were relatively low. At the individual level, knowledge about COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratios [AORs] from 1.16, CI 1.10-1.24, to 1.29, CI 1.21-1.37), perceived risk (AORs from 0.58, CI 0.50-0.68, to 0.85, CI 0.72-0.99) and severity (AOR 1.05, CI 1.01-1.09, and AOR 1.07, CI 1.03-1.11) of COVID-19, perceived effectiveness of preventive measures by the individual (AORs from 1.05, CI 1.00-1.10, to 1.09, CI 1.04-1.13), organization (AOR 1.30, CI 1.20-1.41), and government (AORs from 1.14, CI 1.04-1.25, to 1.21, CI 1.02-1.42), perceived preparedness for a potential outbreak after work resumption (AORs from 1.10, CI 1.00-1.21, to 1.50, CI 1.36-1.64), and depressive symptoms (AORs from 0.93, CI 0.91-0.94, to 0.96, CI 0.92-0.99) were associated with self-reported compliance with at least one personal preventive measure. At the interpersonal level, exposure to COVID-19-specific information through official media channels (AOR 1.08, CI 1.04-1.11) and face-to-face communication (AOR 0.90, CI 0.83-0.98) were associated with self-reported sanitizing of hands. The number of preventive measures implemented in the workplace was positively associated with self-reported compliance with all four preventive measures (AORs from 1.30, CI 1.08-1.57, to 1.63, CI 1.45-1.84). Measures are needed to strengthen hand hygiene and physical distancing among factory workers to reduce transmission following work resumption. Future programs in workplaces should address these factors at multiple levels.","Pan, Fang, Xin, Dong, Zhou, Hou, Li, Sun, Zheng, Yuan, Wang, He",https://doi.org/10.2196/22457,20201002.0,"COVID-19; compliance; cross-sectional; facemask wearing; hand hygiene; online; physical distancing; prevention; survey; work resumption, factory workers; Adult; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Disease Outbreaks; Employment; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Infection Control; Male; Occupational Health; Odds Ratio; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Self Report; Workplace; Young Adult",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17

87,The Effect and Mechanism of Adverse Childhood Experience on Suicide Ideation in Young Cancer Patients During Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently prevalent worldwide. This research aimed to explore the effect of adverse childhood experience (ACE) on suicide ideation in young cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Self-reported questionnaires analyzed the mediating effects of sleep quality, anxiety symptoms, and inflammatory conditions between ACE and suicide ideation. A total of 197 young cancer patients (age 18-40) completed questionnaires and a blood test. Correlation analysis and structural equation model were used to explore the relationships between ACE, sleep quality, anxiety symptom, serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and suicide ideation. The mediating roles of sleep quality, anxiety symptoms, and CRP levels on the influence of ACE on suicide ideation were explored. ACE was positively related to anxiety symptoms, CRP levels, and suicide ideation, and negatively related to sleep quality. Anxiety symptoms and CRP levels were positively related to suicide ideation, while sleep quality was negatively related to suicide ideation. Anxiety symptoms were positively related to CRP levels but negatively related to sleep quality. From these results, we found ACE affected suicide ideation directly and was mediated by roles sleep quality, anxiety symptom and CRP. ACE not only directly affected suicide ideation but also affected suicide ideation through sleep quality, anxiety symptoms, and inflammatory conditions in young cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, targeted intervention and help for cancer patients from the perspective of ACE should be put into practice.","Yang, Xiao, Li, Yang",https://doi.org/10.2147/RMHP.S266269,20200928.0,adverse childhood experience; anxiety symptom; coronavirus disease 2019; psychosocial oncology; sleep quality; suicide ideation,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
88,Mental Health Challenges of United States Healthcare Professionals During COVID-19,"As COVID-19 continues to impact global society, healthcare professionals (HCPs) are at risk for a number of negative well-being outcomes due to their role as care providers. The objective of this study was to better understand the current psychological impact of COVID-19 on HCPs in the United States This study used an online survey tool to collect demographic data and measures of well-being of adults age 18 and older living in the United States between March 20, 2020 and May 14, 2020. Measures included anxiety and stress related to COVID-19, depressive symptoms, current general anxiety, health questions, tiredness, control beliefs, proactive coping, and past and future appraisals of COVID-related stress. The sample included 90 HCPs and 90 age-matched controls (<i>M</i><sub>age</sub> = 34.72 years, <i>SD</i> = 9.84, range = 23 - 67) from 35 states of the United States. A multivariate analysis of variance was performed, using education as a covariate, to identify group differences in the mental and physical health measures. HCPs reported higher levels of depressive symptoms, past and future appraisal of COVID-related stress, concern about their health, tiredness, current general anxiety, and constraint, in addition to lower levels of proactive coping compared to those who were not HCPs (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, Î·<sup>2</sup> = 0.28). Within the context of this pandemic, HCPs were at increased risk for a number of negative well-being outcomes. Potential targets, such as adaptive coping training, for intervention are discussed.","Pearman, Hughes, Smith, Neupert",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.02065,20200928.0,anxiety; depression; health care professionals; pandemic (COVID-19); stress and coping,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
89,Evaluating the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic: perceived risk of COVID-19 infection and childhood trauma predict adult depressive symptoms in urban South Africa,"South Africa's national lockdown introduced serious threats to public mental health in a society where one in three individuals develops a psychiatric disorder during their life. We aimed to evaluate the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic using a mixed-methods design. This longitudinal study drew from a preexisting sample of 957 adults living in Soweto, a major township near Johannesburg. Psychological assessments were administered across two waves between August 2019 and March 2020 and during the first 6 weeks of the lockdown (late March-early May 2020). Interviews on COVID-19 experiences were administered in the second wave. Multiple regression models examined relationships between perceived COVID-19 risk and depression. Full data on perceived COVID-19 risk, depression, and covariates were available in 221 adults. In total, 14.5% of adults were at risk for depression. Higher perceived COVID-19 risk predicted greater depressive symptoms (p &lt; 0.001), particularly among adults with histories of childhood trauma, though this effect was marginally significant (p = 0.063). Adults were about two times more likely to experience significant depressive symptoms for every one unit increase in perceived COVID-19 risk (p = 0.021; 95% CI 1.10-3.39). Qualitative data identified potent experiences of anxiety, financial insecurity, fear of infection, and rumination. Higher perceived risk of COVID-19 infection is associated with greater depressive symptoms during the first 6 weeks of quarantine. High rates of severe mental illness and low availability of mental healthcare amidst COVID-19 emphasize the need for immediate and accessible psychological resources.","Kim, Nyengerai, Mendenhall",https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291720003414,20201001.0,COVID-19; South Africa; childhood trauma; depression; risk perception,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
90,Evaluation of anxiety and depression in patients with morphea taking immunosuppressive drugs during the COVID-19 pandemic,"During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, individuals especially those with chronic diseases face various problems like psychological distress. To evaluate anxiety and depression among morphea patients taking immunosuppressants compared with controls during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this case-control study, electronic data of 42 eligible morphea patients and 42 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects were extracted. All participants were asked about adherence to the health protocols and the symptoms of COVID-19. To investigate anxiety and depression, we provided the participants with an online version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) Questionnaire. In this standard questionnaire, a score â‰¥ 11 represents a significant psychological disorder. The two groups did not differ significantly in the mean HADS-Anxiety (HADS-A) and HADS-Depression (HADS-D) scores (<i>p</i>=Â .08 and <i>p</i>=Â .79, respectively). HADS-A and HADS-D scores were â‰¥ 11 in 16.67% and 11.90% of the patients, respectively. Among the morphea patients, those with sleeping problems during COVID-19 had a significantly higher mean HADS-D score (<i>p</i>=Â .048). Notably, 21.43% of patients discontinued their treatment due to fear of COVID-19 and experienced disease recurrence. Adherence to health protocols was higher in patients compared with controls. The rate of COVID-19 occurrence was not significantly different between the groups. Although there was no significant difference in anxiety and depression between the groups, it is recommended to provide psychiatric counseling opportunities to morphea patients to improve treatment outcomes during this pandemic.","Shahidi Dadras, Ahmadzadeh, Younespour, Abdollahimajd",https://doi.org/10.1080/09546634.2020.1819528,20201001.0,Anxiety; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; coronavirus disease 2019; depression; immunosuppressive treatment,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
91,"&quot;It's about how much we can do, and not how little we can get away with&quot;: Coronavirus-related legislative changes for social care in the United Kingdom","The coronavirus pandemic, referred to here as Covid-19, has brought into sharp focus the increasing divergence of devolved legislation and its implementation in the United Kingdom. One such instance is the emergency health and social care legislation and guidance introduced by the United Kingdom Central Government and the devolved Governments of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland in response to this pandemic. We provide a summary, comparison and discussion of these proposed and actual changes with a particular focus on the impact on adult social care and safeguarding of the rights of citizens. To begin, a summary and comparison of the relevant changes, or potential changes, to mental health, mental capacity and adult social care law across the four jurisdictions is provided. Next, we critique the suggested and actual changes and in so doing consider the immediate and longer term implications for adult social care, including mental health and mental capacity, at the time of publication.several core themes emerged: concerns around process and scrutiny; concerns about possible changes to the workforce and last, the possible threat on the ability to safeguard human rights. It has been shown that, ordinarily, legislative provisions across the jurisdictions of the UK are different, save for Wales (which shares most of its mental health law provisions with England). Such divergence is also mirrored in the way in which the suggested emergency changes could be implemented. Aside from this, there is also a wider concern about a lack of parity of esteem between social care and health care, a concern which is common to all. What is interesting is that the introduction of CVA 2020 forced a comparison to be made between the four UK nations which also shines a spotlight on how citizens can anticipate receipt of services.","Vicary, Stone, McCusker, Davidson, Spencer-Lane",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijlp.2020.101601,20201014.0,Adult social care; Coronavirus act (Scotland) 2020; Coronavirus act 2020; Covid-19; Law; Mental capacity; Mental health,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17

93,Mental health in the era of COVID-19: prevalence of psychiatric disorders in a cohort of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes during the social distancing,"In patients with diabetes, the prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms is about two to four times greater than in the general population. The association between diabetes and mental health disorders could be exacerbated in a stressful environment, and psychological distress could increase depressive symptoms and cause adverse diabetes outcomes. To assess the prevalence of mental health disorders in patients with diabetes during the social distancing period due to COVID-19 pandemic. This is a cross-sectional study developed to assess the impact of social distancing on a cohort of adults with type 1 (nâ€‰=â€‰52) and type 2 diabetes (nâ€‰=â€‰68) in Brazil. Inclusion criteria involved having an HbA1c test collected in the past 3Â months and having a valid telephone number in electronic medical records. The primary outcome was the prevalence of minor psychiatric disorders, assessed by survey (SRQ-20). Secondary outcomes included the prevalence of diabetes related emotional distress, eating and sleeping disorders, all assessed by validated surveys at the moment of the study. Statistical analyses included unpaired <i>t</i>-test for continuous variables and <i>Ï‡</i><sup>2</sup> test for categorical variables. Overall (nâ€‰=â€‰120), participants had a mean age of 54.8â€‰Â±â€‰14.4Â years-old, and HbA1c of 9.0â€‰Â±â€‰1.6% (75â€‰Â±â€‰17.5Â mmol/mol); 93% of patients showed signs of current mental suffering based on the surveys measured. Almost 43% of patients showed evidence of significant psychological distress, with a significant greater tendency in patients with type 2 diabetes. The presence of diabetes related emotional distress was found in 29.2% of patients; eating disorders in 75.8%; and moderate/severe sleeping disorders in 77.5%. We found a high prevalence of evidence of psychological distress among patients with diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic and this highlights the need for mental health access and support for patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.","Alessi, de Oliveira, Franco, Brino do Amaral, Becker, Knijnik, Kobe, de Carvalho, Telo, Schaan, Telo",https://doi.org/10.1186/s13098-020-00584-6,20200928.0,COVID-19 pandemic; Diabetes mellitus; Mental health; Quarantine; Social distancing,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17

We used the depression-anxiety-stress scale and self-designed questionnaire on professional pride, intention to work in the front-line and the extent of family support. Medical students from 4 medical schools in Fujian and Hunan were investigated. Their mental health status, professional pride and first-line work willingness with different characteristics were compared, and the influential factors for professional pride and first-line work willingness were analyzed. A total of 266 valid questionnaires were collected. During the pandemic, there were significant differences in the proportion of depressed students among different college and universities, majors and stages (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05), and the professional pride was significantly different (<i>P</i>&lt;0.001). Medical students with different mental health status showed significant differences in professional pride (<i>P</i>&lt;0.01). Marriage, pressure and extent of family support were the influential factors for their professional pride (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05). The latter two were also influential factors for their intention to work in the front-line (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05). During the pandemic, students from college and nursing have relatively better mental health and higher professional pride. The professional pride is low in medical students who married, with abnormal stress or low family support. The intention to work in front-line is decreased in students with abnormal stress or low family support. <b>ç›®çš„</b>: äº†è§£2019å† çŠ¶ç—…æ¯’ç—…å¤§æµè¡ŒæœŸé—´åŒ»å­¦ç”Ÿçš„å¿ƒç†å¥åº·ã€èŒä¸šè‡ªè±ªæ„Ÿä¸Žä¸€çº¿å·¥ä½œæ„æ„¿ï¼Œä¸ºè¿›è¡Œå¿ƒç†å¹²é¢„æä¾›å‚è€ƒã€‚<b>æ–¹æ³•</b>: é‡‡ç”¨æŠ‘éƒ-ç„¦è™‘-åŽ‹åŠ›é‡è¡¨å’Œè‡ªè¡Œè®¾è®¡çš„å…³äºŽèŒä¸šè‡ªè±ªæ„Ÿã€ä¸€çº¿å·¥ä½œæ„æ„¿å’Œå®¶äººæ”¯æŒç¨‹åº¦çš„è°ƒæŸ¥é—®å·ï¼Œé€šè¿‡é—®å·æ˜Ÿå¹³å°å¯¹ç¦å»ºã€æ¹–å—4æ‰€åŒ»å­¦é™¢æ ¡çš„åŒ»å­¦ç”Ÿè¿›è¡Œè°ƒæŸ¥ï¼Œæ¯”è¾ƒä¸åŒç‰¹å¾çš„åŒ»å­¦ç”Ÿçš„å¿ƒç†å¥åº·çŠ¶å†µã€èŒä¸šè‡ªè±ªæ„Ÿå’Œä¸€çº¿å·¥ä½œæ„æ„¿ï¼Œå¹¶åˆ†æžèŒä¸šè‡ªè±ªæ„Ÿä¸Žä¸€çº¿å·¥ä½œæ„æ„¿çš„å½±å“å› ç´ ã€‚<b>ç»“æžœ</b>: å›žæ”¶æœ‰æ•ˆé—®å·266ä»½ã€‚ç–«æƒ…æœŸé—´ä¸åŒé™¢æ ¡ã€ä¸“ä¸šã€é˜¶æ®µåŒ»å­¦ç”Ÿå‘ç”ŸæŠ‘éƒçš„æ¯”ä¾‹å’ŒèŒä¸šè‡ªè±ªæ„Ÿå·®å¼‚æœ‰ç»Ÿè®¡å­¦æ„ä¹‰(åˆ†åˆ«<i>P</i>&lt;0.05ï¼Œ<i>P</i>&lt;0.001)ï¼Œä¸åŒå¿ƒç†å¥åº·çŠ¶å†µçš„åŒ»å­¦ç”ŸèŒä¸šè‡ªè±ªæ„Ÿå·®å¼‚æœ‰ç»Ÿè®¡å­¦æ„ä¹‰(<i>P</i>&lt;0.01)ï¼Œå©šå§»ã€åŽ‹åŠ›ã€å®¶äººæ”¯æŒç¨‹åº¦æ˜¯åŒ»å­¦ç”ŸèŒä¸šè‡ªè±ªæ„Ÿçš„å½±å“å› ç´ (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05)ï¼ŒåŽä¸¤è€…ä¹Ÿæ˜¯åŒ»å­¦ç”Ÿä¸€çº¿å·¥ä½œæ„æ„¿çš„å½±å“å› ç´ (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05)ã€‚<b>ç»“è®º</b>: ç–«æƒ…æœŸé—´å¤§ä¸“é™¢æ ¡ã€æŠ¤ç†ä¸“ä¸šåŒ»å­¦ç”Ÿå¿ƒç†å¥åº·çŠ¶å†µè¾ƒå¥½ï¼ŒèŒä¸šè‡ªè±ªæ„Ÿè¾ƒé«˜ï¼Œå·²å©šã€åŽ‹åŠ›å¼‚å¸¸ã€å®¶äººæ”¯æŒç¨‹åº¦ä½Žçš„åŒ»å­¦ç”ŸèŒä¸šè‡ªè±ªæ„Ÿè¾ƒä½Žï¼ŒåŽ‹åŠ›å¼‚å¸¸ã€å®¶äººæ”¯æŒç¨‹åº¦ä½Žçš„åŒ»å­¦ç”Ÿä¸€çº¿å·¥ä½œæ„æ„¿ä¸‹é™ã€‚.","Zhan, Sun, Xie, Wen, Fu",https://doi.org/10.11817/j.issn.1672-7347.2020.200440,20200908.0,"coronavirus disease 2019; intention to work in front-line; medical students; mental health; professional pride; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Family; Humans; Intention; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Professionalism; Social Support; Stress, Psychological; Students, Medical; Surveys and Questionnaires",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17

Using star platform of questionnaire, the staff in the general hospital were investigated via Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS-21), Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS) and Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ). The influential factors were discussed by descriptive analysis, rank sum test, single factor analysis, correlation analysis and multiple factors binary logistic regression analysis. A total of 2 060 valid questionnaires were collected. The negative emotions of nurses and cleaners were the most obvious. The depression scores, anxiety scores and stress scores for nurses and cleaners were 5.06Â±7.47, 6.36Â±7.84, 9.75Â±8.65, and 6.72Â±8.84, 4.51Â±6.56, 9.69Â±9.56, respectively. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis showed that staff types, education levels, job status, economic situation and concerns on the supplies of protective goods were the main influential factors for depression; staff types, contacting status with infected patients, economic situation, concerns on the supplies of protective goods, history of disease were the main influential factors for anxiety; contacting status with infected patients, economic situation, concerns on the supplies of protective goods were the main influential factors for stress. There are differences in psychological characteristics among different groups of staff in the general hospital under the outbreak. Thus psychological protection and intervention measures should be formulated according to different groups and work status. <b>ç›®çš„</b>: äº†è§£2019å† çŠ¶ç—…æ¯’ç—…(coronavirus disease 2019ï¼ŒCOVID-19)ç–«æƒ…æœŸé—´ç»¼åˆåŒ»é™¢å‘˜å·¥çš„å¿ƒç†çŽ°çŠ¶å¹¶åˆ†æžå…¶å½±å“å› ç´ ï¼Œä¸ºåŒ»é™¢å‘˜å·¥å¿ƒç†æœåŠ¡æä¾›å‚è€ƒä¾æ®ã€‚<b>æ–¹æ³•</b>: é€šè¿‡é—®å·æ˜Ÿå¹³å°ï¼Œåº”ç”¨æŠ‘éƒ-ç„¦è™‘-åŽ‹åŠ›é‡è¡¨(Depressionï¼ŒAnxiety and Stress Scaleï¼ŒDASS-21)ã€ç¤¾ä¼šæ”¯æŒè¯„å®šé‡è¡¨(Social Support Rating Scaleï¼ŒSSRS)ã€ç®€æ˜“åº”å¯¹æ–¹å¼é‡è¡¨(Simplified Coping Style Questionnaireï¼ŒSCSQ)å¯¹æŸä¸‰çº§ç»¼åˆåŒ»é™¢çš„å‘˜å·¥è¿›è¡Œè°ƒæŸ¥ï¼Œé‡‡ç”¨æè¿°æ€§åˆ†æžã€ç§©å’Œæ£€éªŒã€å•å› ç´ åˆ†æžã€ç›¸å…³æ€§åˆ†æžåŠå¤šå› ç´ äºŒå…ƒlogisticå›žå½’åˆ†æžæŽ¢è®¨ç›¸å…³å½±å“å› ç´ ã€‚<b>ç»“æžœ</b>: å›žæ”¶æœ‰æ•ˆé—®å·2 060ä»½ã€‚æŠ¤å£«å’Œä¿æ´å‘˜è´Ÿæ€§æƒ…ç»ªæœ€æ˜Žæ˜¾ï¼Œå…¶ä¸­æŠ¤å£«æŠ‘éƒå¾—åˆ†5.06Â±7.47ï¼Œç„¦è™‘å¾—åˆ†6.36Â±7.84ï¼ŒåŽ‹åŠ›å¾—åˆ†9.75Â±8.65ï¼›ä¿æ´å‘˜æŠ‘éƒå¾—åˆ†6.72Â±8.84ï¼Œç„¦è™‘å¾—åˆ†4.51Â±6.56ï¼ŒåŽ‹åŠ›å¾—åˆ†9.69Â±9.56ã€‚å¤šå› ç´ äºŒå…ƒlogisticå›žå½’åˆ†æžæ˜¾ç¤ºï¼šå²—ä½ç±»åˆ«ã€æ–‡åŒ–ç¨‹åº¦ã€èŒåŠ¡ã€ç–«æƒ…å¯¹ç»æµŽçš„å½±å“ã€é˜²æŠ¤ç‰©è´¨ä¾›ç»™ä¸è¶³çš„æ‹…å¿ƒç¨‹åº¦æ˜¯æŠ‘éƒçš„å½±å“å› ç´ ï¼›å²—ä½ç±»åˆ«ã€ä¸Žæ„ŸæŸ“è€…æŽ¥è§¦æƒ…å†µã€ç–«æƒ…å¯¹ç»æµŽçš„å½±å“ã€é˜²æŠ¤ç‰©è´¨ä¾›ç»™ä¸è¶³çš„æ‹…å¿ƒç¨‹åº¦ã€ç–¾ç—…å²æ˜¯ç„¦è™‘çš„å½±å“å› ç´ ï¼›ä¸Žæ„ŸæŸ“è€…æŽ¥è§¦æƒ…å†µã€ç–«æƒ…å¯¹ç»æµŽå½±å“ï¼Œå¯¹é˜²æŠ¤ç‰©è´¨ä¾›ç»™ä¸è¶³çš„æ‹…å¿ƒç¨‹åº¦æ˜¯åŽ‹åŠ›çš„å½±å“å› ç´ ã€‚<b>ç»“è®º</b>: ç–«æƒ…æœŸé—´ç»¼åˆåŒ»é™¢ä¸åŒäººç¾¤çš„å¿ƒç†ç‰¹å¾æœ‰å·®å¼‚ï¼Œéœ€æ ¹æ®ä¸åŒäººç¾¤åŠå…¶å·¥ä½œçŠ¶æ€åˆ¶è®¢ç›¸åº”çš„å¿ƒç†é˜²æŠ¤åŠå¹²é¢„æŽªæ–½ã€‚.","Jiang, Liu, Zhao, Xie, Wang, Ouyang, Guo, Gong, Zhou, Li",https://doi.org/10.11817/j.issn.1672-7347.2020.200190,20200909.0,"anxiety; coronavirus disease 2019; depression; different groups of staff; influential factors; stress; Adaptation, Psychological; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Disease Outbreaks; Hospitals, General; Humans; Pandemics; Personnel, Hospital; Pneumonia, Viral; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
96,Does coronavirus pose a challenge to the diagnoses of anxiety and depression? A view from psychiatry,"Some authors have suggested that the emergence of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, and the subsequent pandemic has meant that the constructs of pathological anxiety and depression are meaningless owing to widespread anxiety and depressive symptoms. This paper examines what is required to make a diagnosis of a depressive or anxiety disorder and how this may differ from fleeting symptomatology in response to specific situations or stimuli. All people experience the emotions of both anxiety and depression, but far fewer have a persistent anxiety or depressive syndrome which interferes with their quality of life and functioning. The pandemic and its issues are then discussed, and existing studies examining the reactions of people living through the pandemic are presented. Finally, the paper examines possible ways to cope at times of increased stress and how we can try to protect ourselves from long-term mental health sequelae of chronic stress.",Drummond,https://doi.org/10.1192/bjb.2020.102,20201009.0,Anxiety; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; coronavirus; depression,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17

98,,"Since December 2019, 414,179 cases of people with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported. As a result of the rapid increase in confirmed cases and deaths, population and health personnel, have experienced psychological problems, such as anxiety, depression, and stress. Although scientific information on COVID-19 is constantly increasing, it mainly focuses on genetic, epidemiological aspects, and public health measures, leaving aside possible effects on mental health. In order to summarize the current evidence, we present a narrative review of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. So far, the presence of anxiety, depression, and stress has been reported mostly in general population. Nonetheless, mental health issues have also been reported in health care workers, especially among female professionals, nurses, and those who work directly with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19. In efforts to reduce the spread of the disease, attention should be paid to the diagnosis and treatment of mental health issues. We believe that addressing them adequately will empower Peru to contain and eradicate COVID-19.

A total of 857 LGB people in Hong Kong participated in a community-based survey study. Over one-fourth of them met the criteria for probable clinical depression (31.5%) and generalized anxiety disorder (27.9%). Besides general stressors, we identified sexual minority-specific stressors during the pandemic. 4.2% of the participants indicated that they had frequently experienced family conflict related to sexual orientation. One-third responded that they had largely reduced connection to the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender plus (LGBT+) community (34.7%). The results showed that sexual minority-specific COVID-19-related stressors explained significant variance in depressive and anxiety symptoms, above and beyond the contribution of general COVID-19-related stressors. Since LGB people are particularly vulnerable to poor mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, LGB people-targeting organizations need to understand more about family, space, and privacy concerns in order to provide better support, and LGB safe spaces and shelters may be needed as a policy response.","Suen, Chan, Wong",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113365,20201013.0,"COVID-19; Hong Kong; anxiety; depression; sexual minorities; Adult; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; Bisexuality; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Homosexuality, Female; Homosexuality, Male; Hong Kong; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Psychological Distress; Sexual Behavior; Sexual and Gender Minorities; Social Stigma; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
101,Sleep quality and mental health in the context of COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown in Morocco,"The lockdown of COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) is associated with several stressful factors that can negatively affect peoples' sleep quality and mental health. We conducted this study to evaluate sleep disorders and psychological impact associated with the spread of the COVID-19 and the lockdown on the Moroccan population. We also aimed to study the effects of respondents' beliefs and attitudes about sleep on sleep disorders, anxiety-related symptoms, and depressive symptoms. We used a questionnaire enclosing respondents' sociodemographic information, five psychological and behavioral tests including Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep (DBAS-16), Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) test. Our results highlighted widespread false beliefs about sleep and the prevalence of sleep disorders, anxiety, and depression-related symptoms within the Moroccan population. Nearly 82.3% of respondents revealed false beliefs about sleep. Furthermore, we confirmed a strong positive correlation between knowledge and attitudes about sleep and the prevalence of sleep disorders, anxiety, and depression-related symptoms. However, we found no significant difference in the prevalence of sleep and psychological disorders, between healthcare workers and other professions workers. Our study revealed a high prevalence of sleep disorders, anxiety, and depressive symptoms in the Moroccan population during the COVID-19 lockdown period. Moreover, false beliefs on sleep understanding were prevalent and were presenting a risk factor leading to sleep disorders, anxiety, and depressive symptoms.","Janati Idrissi, Lamkaddem, Benouajjit, Ben El Bouaazzaoui, El Houari, Alami, Labyad, Chahidi, Benjelloun, Rabhi, Kissani, Zarhbouch, Ouazzani, Kadiri, Alouane, Elbiaze, Boujraf, El Fakir, Souirti",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2020.07.045,20201016.0,"Anxiety; COVID-19; Depressive symptoms; Insomnia; Mental health; Morocco; Sleep knowledge; Sleep quality; Adult; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Morocco; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Sleep Wake Disorders; Social Isolation; Surveys and Questionnaires",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17

This is particularly disconcerting regarding children and adolescents, who rely on the ability to play to meet developmental milestones and who require more exercise than adults. Youth populations have been significantly disrupted by school closures and home confinement and are in developmental periods that overlap with the emergence of serious mental illness. Therefore, it is important to consider the mental health consequences for youths, and also explore ways to combat sedentary activity for this vulnerable population.","Mittal, Firth, Kimhy",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaac.2020.08.003,20201007.0,,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
103,Is the psychological impact of exposure to COVID-19 stronger in adolescents with pre-pandemic maltreatment experiences? A survey of rural Chinese adolescents,"Since the COVID-19 outbreak at the end of 2019, it has evolved into a global pandemic with tremendous mental health impact besides the threats to people's physical health. The aims were to examine whether exposure to COVID-19 predicts elevated levels of anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms and whether pre-pandemic maltreatment experiences exacerbate this impact on mental health in adolescents. The survey was conducted online from February 8 st to February 27th, 2020, and the questionnaires were distributed and retrieved through a web-based platform. This study includes a total of 6196 subjects, aged range from 11 to 18 years old. Several multivariable linear regressions were used to analyse the data. The largest variance in PTSS and anxiety problems was explained by ACEs, with more pre-pandemic maltreatment experiences predicting more PTSS (effect size beta = 0.16âˆ¼0.27), and more anxiety (effect size beta = 0.32âˆ¼0.47). Experienced or subjective fear of exposure to COVID-19 predicted statistically significant variance in PTSS and anxiety, and standardized betas ranged from 0.04 to 0.09. Participants who had adverse childhood experiences and had experienced exposure to COVID-19 showed elevated PTSS. After pre-pandemic maltreatment experiences the impact of exposure to COVID-19 on mental health may be stronger. Scars from the past seem to be vulnerabilities during societal upheaval. We therefore suggest that when exposed to COVID-19 rural adolescents should get prioritized professional family support and mental health counseling in particular when they have experienced family abuse and neglect in childhood, even though such support is more difficult to organize in rural areas.","Guo, Fu, Liu, Zhang, Wang, van IJzendoorn",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2020.104667,20200909.0,ACEs; Adolescents; Anxiety; Covid-19; Maltreatment; PTSS,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17

105,The Role of Anxiety and Cortisol in Outcomes of Patients With Covid-19,"The outbreak due to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is n global public health emergency and challenges psychological resilience. The central nervous system, endocrine system, and immune system are complex interacting systems. Cortisol has been implicated as the cause of a wide range of mental and physical health disorders; however, the impact of cortisol on outcomes in patients with COVID-19 is not clear. The current study enrolled patients with COVID-19 (onset of disease within 7 days of the first symptom) to evaluate the serum concentration of cortisol and levels of anxiety and depression using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to investigate a possible relationship between cortisol, depression, and anxiety levels and outcomes of patients with COVID-19. A total of 30 patients with COVID-19 were studied. The levels of cortisol and HADS score in patients who died of Covid-19 were significantly higher in comparison with surviving patients (P&lt;0.017 and P&lt;0.001 respectively). We also found that the HADS score was positively correlated with serum cortisol levels (r= 0.842, P=0.004). Our findings showed that stress and anxiety are associated with patients' outcomes.

106,"Stress, Anxiety, and Depression Levels Among Healthcare Staff During the COVID-19 Epidemic","In the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, medical staff Are in direct contact with the patients and experience high work pressure. Direct contact with the patients could create some psychological problems in this group. Thus, the prevalence of such problems must be investigated in them. The present study aimed to determine the level of stress, anxiety, and depression among the healthcare staff in Zanjan City, Iran, during the COVID-19 epidemic. This descriptive study has a cross-sectional design. The Sample of the study population consisted of 535 Staff healthcare members of Vali-e-Asr Hospital in Zanjan City, Iran. A sample of 200 of medical staff was randomly selected to participate in the present study. The required data were collected using the electronic version of Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS) tool. Descriptive statistics, as well as the inferential statistics (the Pearson correlation coefficient, Spearman correlation coefficient, Phi, and Cramer's correlation tests), were used to analyze the obtained data in SPSS. The mean age of the study participants was 40.60 years. The mean values of depression, anxiety, and stress in study samples were 6.27, 5.38, and 8.41, respectively. There was a significant relation between gender and variables of depression, anxiety, and stress. There was also an inverse relationship between stress and variables of educational level and age (P&lt;0/05). We found that our sample reported a normal degree of Depression, anxiety, and stress. The extent of stress induced by direct contact with patients was higher in female employees. Furthermore, with the increase in the education and age of the employees, their stress level decreased.","Hosseinzadeh-Shanjani, Hajimiri, Rostami, Ramazani, Dadashi",https://doi.org/10.32598/bcn.11.covid19.651.4,20200928.0,Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Medical staff; Stress,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
107,Hâ€³ITâ€³ting the Barriers for Exercising during Social Isolation,"Aerobic exercise is traditionally recommended to improve general health and prevent many non-communicable diseases. However, the measures adopted to control the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak culminated with closing of exercise facilities and fitness centers and, as a primary consequence, impaired aerobic exercise practice. This contributed to an increase in risk factors associated with physical inactivity such as insulin resistance, high blood pressure, low-grade inflammation, weight gain, and mental health problems. The scenario is worrisome, and it is important to propose alternatives for exercise practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interval training (IT) emerges as an exercise mode that might be feasible, low-cost, and potentially safe to be performed in many different places. IT consists of interspersing relative brief bouts of high-intensity exercise with recovery periods and promotes similar or greater health benefits when compared to moderate-intensity continuous exercise. Among the different types of IT, sprint interval training and &quot;Tabata protocols&quot; might be particularly useful during social isolation. These protocols can be controlled and performed without the need of complex equipment and can be adapted to different places, including domestic environments. In this article, we present variations of IT as possible alternatives to cope physical inactivity during COVID-19 pandemics with a focus on its practical applications. The protocols suggested can be performed without the need of specialized equipment or facilities, in a time-efficient manner, and aiming to prevent detraining or even improve physical fitness and general health.","Souza, Coswig, de Lira, Gentil",https://doi.org/10.3390/biology9090245,20200928.0,COVID-19; aerobic exercise; calisthenics; high-intensity interval training; immunity; intermittent exercise,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17

109,[Adaptations of an outpatient Dialectical Behavioral Therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic and consequences of the confinement on patients with borderline personality disorder],"<i>Background:</i> The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the accessibility of psychotherapy for particularly vulnerable patients during the period of confinement in the French-speaking part of Switzerland. We had to adapt our usual therapeutic programs. We illustrate this approach in an outpatient program of dialectical behavioral therapy for patients with borderline personality disorder. Each week the individual therapies took place by videoconference or phone. The skills training group was held individually by videoconference or phone and was supported by an online skills training program. Patients filled out their diary cards online. Intersession contact with the therapist remained available as usual and we could organize team consultation. The aim of this study is to describe how a sample of our patients experienced the period of confinement.<i>Method:</i> We compared the experiences of seven patients suffering from borderline personality disorder during two periods: eight weeks prior to confinement, and during the eight weeks of confinement. We analyzed their daily diary cards (n = 426) and their weekly frequency of problem behaviors (n = 69). We performed multilevel analyses to take into account the hierarchical structure of the data and the autocorrelation of observations.<i>Results:</i> The seven patients were predominantly female (85.7â€‰%) and had an average age of 35.1 (11.5) years. Measurements prior to the start of the pandemic indicated on average severe depression (Beck Depression Inventory, m = 30.9 (10.0)) and marked hopelessness (Beck Hopelessness Scale, m = 15.0 (5.0)). Analysis of the daily diary cards indicated that the confinement period significantly predicted a decrease in feelings of shame or guilt, fear and tension. At the same time, however, there was an increase in distress. Weekly monitoring of problem behaviors showed a decrease in binge-eating behaviors and a trend towards a decrease in alcohol consumption during confinement.<i>Conclusions:</i> Despite the small number of patients included, two types of repeated measurements indicated convergent results, with some improvements during confinement: a decrease of the feelings of fear, shame or guilt, and tension, and a decrease of the frequency of binge-eating behaviors. The decreased pace of daily social and professional life may explain these improvements. The diminution of the above-mentioned feelings as triggers for addictive and compulsive behaviors may also account for the improvements regarding binge-eating. However, they also experienced an increased distress that may reflect the loneliness experienced during this period. The pre-pandemic development of computerized tools that were already familiar to patients greatly facilitated the necessary adaptations to maintain an intensive therapeutic setting during the confinement. This may partly explain why these patients were able to adjust the challenges of this period.","Salamin, Rossier, Joye, Nolde, Pierrehumbert, Gothuey, Guenot",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2020.08.006,20200826.0,Borderline personality disorder; Confinement; Coronavirus; Dialectical behavior therapies; Pandemic; Psychiatry,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17

Disease enforced lockdowns are known to cause heightened levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. Our study aimed to investigate the immediate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic enforced lockdown on mental health and quality of life among general population aged 18Â years and to identify various coping strategies used under lockdown. An online survey was conducted between 1st of April-10th of May, 2020; using a validated questionnaire based on DASS-42, employing a snowball sampling technique. A total of 418 responses from 16 different countries were received. The respondents had a high level of depression and anxiety scores, which were significantly different among genders. Also, participants from developing countries-India and Pakistan had severe depression while as participants from India, Pakistan and Kingdom of Saudi Arabia had severe anxiety. We also found that among the various coping strategies, (a) watching television for entertainment, (b) social networking, (c) listening to music, (d) sleeping, (e) doing mundane house chores like cleaning, washing, etc. (f) eating well, and (g) clearing/finishing thepiled-up work were ranked among the most utilized coping strategies by all participants.

The interview focuses on the impact of remote working during the coronavirus epidemic, starting with the question of whether an effective therapeutic process can occur without physical co-presence. Isaacs Russell shares her immediate thoughts about the virtually overnight changes to our practice that came with the epidemic, and the work of the American Psychoanalytic Association's Covid-19 Advisory Team, on which she sits. Her responses are informed by recent cross-disciplinary and neuropsychological research on the digital age. She considers what happens to free association, evenly suspended attention and reverie when working by phone or online; the loss of the consulting room as a containing physical space for both clinician and patient; the relationship between place and time; and whether (and how) we can maintain a focus on transference and countertransference in the presence of the threat of death. The interview ends with her thoughts on whether we should assume that the landscape of analytic therapy will be permanently altered by Covid-19, and with her hope that general awareness of the impact of trauma on our mental health has been raised.",Isaacs Russell,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjp.12581,20200928.0,COVIDâ€19; PANDEMIC; PRESENCE; PSYCHOANALYSIS; PSYCHOTHERAPY; REMOTE THERAPY; SCREEN RELATIONS; TECHNOLOGY,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
115,"[PSYCOVID-19, psychological support device in the fields of mental health, somatic and medico-social]","In December 2019 the World Health Organization (WHO) recorded the first cases of an infectious disease that appeared in China in November of the same year. Generated by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV2, it is quickly named COVID-19 for COronaVirus Infectious Disease 2019. The spread of this unknown disease will soon have worldwide consequences: the contagiousness of the virus is extremely high and potentially lethal. In France, the population initially reacted with disbelief until the disease reached Europe and the first cases appeared on French territory, at the end of January. A few weeks later, on 16 March 2020, President Macron declared the country &quot;at war&quot; against COVID-19. The next day the population was placed in lockdown. At the present time, the country's activity is at a standstill. Schools, businesses and shops are closed. The French citizens are astounded. They suddenly have to face fear: fear of falling ill or that a close relative may fall ill, fear of being locked up and experiencing restrictions of liberties, fear of economic precariousness. And, above all, fear of uncertainty. In order to prevent the mental consequences of this crisis, psychological support units have been created with urgency at national scale. These units are intended to support the healthcare professionals as well as the patients and more broadly, the general population. The unit responsible for the department of Gironde has been set up quickly, over the weekend of March 21, 2020. The COVIDPSY33 listening unit has thus been created in Bordeaux by the Charles Perrens Hospital with support from the Agence RÃ©gionale de SantÃ© Nouvelle-Aquitaine (ARS). Simultaneously, the PSYCOVID-19 unit was created. This additional unit works in collaboration with the COVIDPSY33 platform and offers psychological assistance to the general population and caregivers in the sectors of Bordeaux Rive Droite, Bordeaux Gare, Rives de Garonne, Rives d'Arcins and Sud Gironde. It thus covers an area equivalent to approximately half of Gironde, the largest department in metropolitan France.

116,"[General sanitary containment during the Coronavirus epidemic: Medico-psychological consequences in general population, caregivers, and subjects suffering previously from mental disorders (Retrospective on the repercussions of lethal mass risks, scientific models of collective confinement, first clinical observations, implementation of countermeasures and innovative therapeutic strategies)]","The situation we are currently experiencing is unprecedented. Declaring a state of health emergency in order to curb a frightening epidemic, the authorities have decreed the home confinement of the majority of the population of our country for several weeks. In a few days, innumerable questions arise for very diverse spaces: epidemiological, immunological, sociological, information scientists, medical, administrative, political, etc. We propose a reflection intended to describe the psychological risks, to clarify the disorders found, and to discuss the means to take care of them in the duration. We base our thinking on a review of the literature confronted with our current clinical experience, including concerning the possibilities of dematerialised medico-psychological monitoring. We recall the collective repercussions of emerging lethal mass risks, and in particular viral infectious agents, before approaching the existing scientific models of collective confinement according to military operations in war zones, polar wintering missions and aerospace conquest. It appears that for the study of a global containment, somewhat studied during previous pandemics, the conceptions of stress reaction and psychodynamic adaptation prove to be relevant. We detail the psychological consequences of confinement on individual mental health and their countermeasures according to three population typologies: general population, population of caregivers on the front line against the epidemic, and population of subjects already suffering from mental illness or seeing their disorders reappear. We also refer to works in social cognitive psychology explaining how, in an anxiety-provoking situation, reasoning can be biased and lead to choices that ultimately prove to be not very rational, in the opinion of those who made them. The current situation in the health sector is favourable in this, as evidenced by the &quot;debate on chloroquine&quot; widely reported in the media and on social networks, opposing conclusions most often decided on the basis of beliefs on contrary to evidence based medicine. The psychological repercussions of confinement appear conditioned by the multiple forms that it can take: voluntary or suffered, more or less prolonged, spent at home or in another place, lived in individual isolation or in a small community, associated other stressors and/or traumatic factors, etc. The home confinement of a population across a country has never been assessed. This experience seems to us to confront our society as a whole with the taboo of death, which is imposed, death more and more evaded as the &quot;Western man&quot; tries to move away from his terrestrial origins. In this sense, psychotraumatic type repercussions are to be prevented. In order to face multiple challenges, the healthcare system has adapted with, in particular, the development of the use of the Internet for the provision of information intended to better experience confinement, or even the generalisation of e-psychotherapy asking as many questions as it provides answers. These intricacies of computer techniques in the area of psychotherapy, techniques with which we had some questioning, became established as quickly as the virus: the task of clinicians and researchers to measure the issues and the consequences. Public health programs could emerge on the model of those already existing in order to manage well-known chronic endemic disorders: protection against the effects of an unbalanced diet associated with a sedentary lifestyle, fight against smoking and alcoholism, prevention of self-aggressive behaviour, etc. We will also need to support the caregivers who have been on the front line and who will emerge tested from this pandemic: depending on the sustainability of the action capacities of our healthcare system to return to its nominal state and also perhaps, so that it can face consequences resulting from other crises, especially social ones.","AuxÃ©mÃ©ry, Tarquinio",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2020.06.001,20200918.0,Confinement; Coronavirus; Epidemiology; Online psychotherapy; Psychopathology; Reaction to stress; Sociopathology,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17

Kessler psychological distress scale (<i>K</i>10) was used to evaluate stress symptoms. This study first conducted an online focus group discussion (OFGD) with the target population to develop the scale of &quot;e-Learning crack-up&quot; and &quot;fear of academic year loss&quot;. Afterward, a questionnaire was developed based on OFGD findings. An online survey was conducted amongst college students in Bangladesh using a purposive sampling technique. Results show that &quot;e-Learning crack-up&quot; perception has a significant positive impact on student's psychological distress, and fear of academic year loss is the crucial factor that is responsible for psychological distress during COVID-19 lockdown. This study can provide an understanding of how &quot;e-Learning crack-up&quot; and &quot;Fear of academic year loss&quot; influence college students' mental health.

The scores of the symptoms for PTSD, GAD, perceived threat, and stigma were different among the three profiles. The risk factors (i.e., perceived threat and stigma) that are related to comorbidity patterns were examined through a three-step method.

120,"Consumer Reported Care Deferrals Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, and the Role and Potential of Telemedicine: Cross-Sectional Analysis","The COVID-19 pandemic forced many health systems to proactively reduce care delivery to prepare for an expected surge in hospitalizations. There have been concerns that care deferral may have negative health effects, but it is hoped that telemedicine can provide a viable alternative. This study aimed to understand what type of health care services were being deferred during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, the role played by telemedicine to fill in care gaps, and changes in attitudes toward telemedicine. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of survey responses from 1694 primary care patients in a mid-sized northeastern city. Our main outcomes were use of telemedicine and reports of care deferral during the shutdown. Deferred care was widespread-48% (n=812) of respondents deferred care-but it was largely for preventive services, particularly dental and primary care, and did not cause concerns about negative health effects. In total, 30.2% (n=242) of those who delayed care were concerned about health effects, with needs centered around orthopedics and surgery. Telemedicine was viewed more positively than prior to the pandemic; it was seen as a viable option to deliver deferred care, particularly by respondents who were over 65 years of age, female, and college educated. Mental health services stood out for having high levels of deferred care. Temporary health system shutdowns will give rise to deferred care. However, much of the deferrals will be for preventive services. The effect of this on patient health can be moderated by prioritizing surgical and orthopedic services and delivering other services through telemedicine. Having telemedicine as an option is particularly crucial for mental health services.","Atherly, Van Den Broek-Altenburg, Hart, Gleason, Carney",https://doi.org/10.2196/21607,20201002.0,"COVID-19; alternative; deferred care; health effect; mental health; telemedicine; viability; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Attitude to Health; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Delivery of Health Care; Female; General Surgery; Health Care Rationing; Health Services; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Male; Mental Health Services; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Primary Health Care; Surveys and Questionnaires; Telemedicine; Young Adult",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17

The outbreak has been continuing to heavily impact the mental health of people. Developing key strategies to prevent mental illnesses is extremely important for the well-being of people. A survey conducted during the last week of March 2020 showed that 72% of Americans felt that their lives were impacted by the outbreak, which was a 32% increase from the survey conducted only 2Â weeks earlier. The results show a positive correlation between COVID-19 infections/casualties and growing public concern. These observations suggest possible increase in mental health illnesses in United States as a consequence of the pandemic. The authors review a recently published model on COVID-19 related fear among the people. The fear of being infected or dying from the disease is one of the most significant causes of mental health disorders. Loss of employment or the fear of losing employment is another major concern leading to mental illnesses. Several unique strategies to prevent or mitigate mental illnesses are discussed.","Bhattacharjee, Acharya",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11126-020-09836-0,20200909.0,Anxiety disorder; COVID-19; Mental health; Pandemic; Prevention strategies,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17

A cross-section survey-based study amongst doctors working within Obstetrics and Gynaecology in the United Kingdom. A total of 207 doctors completed the survey. Obstetricians and Gynaecologists reported significantly higher rates of both Major Depressive Disorder (versus, p = 0.023) and Generalised Anxiety Disorder (versus, p = 0.044) as compared to the UK-wide estimates. Sub-group analysis showed that anxiety was more common amongst female doctors as compared to males (versus, p = 0.047). Although the prevalence of GAD was higher amongst registrars compared to their Consultant and/or Senior House Officer counterparts, this was not statistically significant. Respondents felt that the most significant factor for work-related changes to mental health was keeping up to date with frequently changing guidelines and protocols related to COVID-19. Only of respondents felt able to talk to colleagues about their mental health. Key findings include the high prevalence of mental health conditions amongst doctors, demonstration of the persistent taboo that mental health carries within the speciality and the key contributory factors to poor mental health. Further work should be done to assess if changes to the way new and updating guidelines, protocols and pathways are disseminated reduces the impact on the mental health of doctors.

Public protective behaviors and perception play crucial roles in controlling the spread of illness and psychological status. We conducted a cross-sectional online survey in the hardest-hit Hubei province and other areas in China affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. Questions about their basic information, the perception of the COVID-19 outbreak, recent preventive or avoidance behaviors, and self-reported mental health scales including the Patient Health Questionnaire and Self-Rating Anxiety Scale were included. Binary logistic regressions were used to investigate the association between personal variables/perceptions and psychological distress. A total of 6261 people were included in the analysis, with 3613 (57.7%) in Hubei province (1743 in Wuhan). The majority of people have adopted preventive and avoidance behaviors. People from Hubei, with contact history, and people who were infected or whose family members were infected had a much higher prevalence of depression and anxiety. Providing truthful and sufficient information, informing the public about the severity of the disease, and perceptions that the outbreak can be controlled by protective behaviors were associated with lower prevalence of depression and anxiety. Assessing the public response, perception, and psychological burden during the outbreak may help improve public health recommendations and deliver timely psychological intervention.

Mental health is best ensured by urgently rebuilding the social and economic supports stripped away over the last decade. Governments must pump funds into local authorities to rebuild community services, peer support, mutual aid and local community and voluntary sector organisations.Â Health care organisations must tackle racism and discrimination to ensure genuine equal access to universal health care.Â Government must replace highly conditional benefit systems by something like a universal basic income. All economic and social policies must be subjected to a legally binding mental health audit.Â This may sound unfeasibly expensive, but the social and economic costs, not to mention the costs in personal and community suffering, though often invisible, are far greater.","Rose, Manning, Bentall, Bhui, Burgess, Carr, Cornish, Devakumar, Dowd, Ecks, Faulkner, Ruck Keene, Kirkbride, Knapp, Lovell, Martin, Moncrieff, Parr, Pickersgill, Richardson, Sheard",https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16123.1,20200928.0,BAME; Mental distress; benefit system reform; social disadvantage; universal basic income,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
125,Effect of Common Medications on the Expression of SARS-CoV-2 Entry Receptors in Kidney Tissue,"Besides the respiratory system, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was shown to affect other essential organs such as the kidneys. Early kidney involvement during the course of infection was associated with worse outcomes, which could be attributed to the direct SARS-CoV-2 infection of kidney cells. In this study, the effect of commonly used medications on the expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)2, and TMPRSS2 protein in kidney tissues was evaluated. This was done by in silico analyses of publicly available transcriptomic databases of kidney tissues of rats treated with multiple doses of commonly used medications. Of 59 tested medications, 56% modified ACE2 expression, whereas 24% modified TMPRSS2 expression. ACE2 was increased with only a few of the tested medication groups, namely the renin-angiotensin inhibitors, such as enalapril, antibacterial agents, such as nitrofurantoin, and the proton pump inhibitor, omeprazole. The majority of the other medications decreased ACE2 expression to variable degrees with allopurinol and cisplatin causing the most noticeable downregulation. The expression level of TMPRSS2 was increased with a number of medications, such as diclofenac, furosemide, and dexamethasone, whereas other medications, such as allopurinol, suppressed the expression of this gene. The prolonged exposure to combinations of these medications could regulate the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in a way that may affect kidney susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data presented here suggest that we should be vigilant about the potential effects of commonly used medications on kidney tissue expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2.","Saheb Sharif-Askari, Saheb Sharif-Askari, Alabed, Tayoun, Loney, Uddin, Senok, Al Heialy, Hamoudi, Kashour, Alsheikh-Ali, Hamid, Halwani",https://doi.org/10.1111/cts.12862,20200909.0,,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17

All aspects of training programmes have been affected. Trainees report that reduced caseload, sub-specialty experience, and supervised procedures are impairing learning. Cancelled educational activities, postponed examinations, and altered rotations threaten progression through training. Job prospects and international opportunities are downgraded. Work-related anxieties about provision of personal protective equipment, and risks to self and to colleagues are superimposed on concerns for family and friends and domestic disruption. These seismic changes have had consequences for well-being and mental health. In response, anaesthetists have developed innovations in teaching and trainee support. New technologies support trainer-trainee interactions, with a focus on e-learning. National training bodies and medical regulators that specify training and oversee assessment of trainees and their progression have provided flexibility in their requirements. Within anaesthesia departments, support transcends grades and job titles with lessons for the future.

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of poor sleep quality and its related factors among employees who returned to work during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our online cross-sectional study included 2,410 participants aged â‰¥17 years in Deqing and Taizhou, Zhejiang Province, China from 5th to 14th March 2020. The questionnaire covered information on demographic characteristics, health status, workplace, lifestyle, attitude towards COVID-19, assessment of anxiety, depression and sleep quality. The Chinese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (CPSQI) was administered to measure the poor sleep quality. Poor sleep quality was defined as a global PSQI score&gt;5. Factors associated with sleep quality were analyzed by logistic regression models. In sum near half (49.2%) of 2,410 returning workers were females and the average year of subjects was 36.3Â Â±Â 9.1 years. The overall prevalence of poor sleep quality was 14.9% (95%CI: 13.5%-16.3%). The average score of PSQI was 3.0Â Â±Â 2.5 and average sleep duration was 7.6Â Â±Â 1.2Â h. Independent related factors of poor sleep quality included age older than 24 years, higher education level, negative attitude towards COVID-19 control measures, anxiety and depression. Poor sleep quality was common and there was a shorter sleep duration among returning workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

128,COVID-19 lockdown in people with severe mental disorders in Spain: Do they have a specific psychological reaction compared with other mental disorders and healthy controls?,"The COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown restrictions could have adverse consequences for patients with severe mental disorders (SMD). Here, we aim to compare the early psychological impact (depression, anxiety, and stress responses, intrusive and avoidant thoughts, and coping strategies) on people with SMD (nâ€¯=â€¯125) compared with two control groups: common mental disorders (CMD, nâ€¯=â€¯250) and healthy controls (HC, nâ€¯=â€¯250). An anonymous online questionnaire using a snowball sampling method was conducted from March 19-26, 2020 and included sociodemographic and clinical data along with the DASS-21 and IES scales. We performed descriptive and bivariate analyses and multinomial and linear regression models. People with SMD had higher anxiety, stress, and depression responses than HC, but lower scores than CMD in all domains. Most people with SMD (87.2%) were able to enjoy free time, although control groups had higher percentages. After controlling for confounding factors, anxiety was the only significant psychological domain with lower scores in HC than people with SMD (ORâ€¯=â€¯0.721; 95% CI: 0.579-0.898). In the SMD group, higher anxiety was associated with being single (betaâ€¯=â€¯0.144), having COVID-19 symptoms (betaâ€¯=â€¯0.146), and a higher score on the stress subscale of DASS-21 (betaâ€¯=â€¯0.538); whereas being able to enjoy free time was a protective factor (betaâ€¯=â€¯-0.244). Our results showed that patients with SMD reacted to the pandemic and the lockdown restrictions with higher anxiety levels than the general public, and suggesting this domain could be a criterion for early intervention strategies and closer follow-up.","GonzÃ¡lez-Blanco, Dal Santo, GarcÃ­a-Ãlvarez, de la Fuente-TomÃ¡s, Moya Lacasa, Paniagua, SÃ¡iz, GarcÃ­a-Portilla, Bobes",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.schres.2020.07.018,20200909.0,Anxiety; Bipolar disorder; COVID-19; Pandemics; Psychological distress; Psychosis,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
129,Surgical Education in the Time of COVID: Understanding the Early Response of Surgical Training Programs to the Novel Coronavirus Pandemic,"Describe the early impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on general surgery residency training nationwide. A 31-question electronic survey was distributed to general surgery program directors. Qualitative data underwent iterative coding analysis. Quantitative data were evaluated with summary statistics and bivariate analyses. Eighty-four residency programs (33.6% response rate) with representation across US geographic regions, program affiliations, and sizes. Widespread changes were observed in the surgical training environment. One hundred percent of programs reduced the number of residents on rounds and 95.2% reduced the size of their in-hospital resident workforce; on average, daytime staffing decreased by nearly half. With telehealth clinics (90.5%) and remote inpatient consults (26.2%), both clinical care and resident didactics (86.9%) were increasingly virtual, with similar impact across all program demographics. Conversely, availability of some wellness initiatives was significantly higher among university programs than independent programs, including childcare (51.2% vs 6.7%), housing (41.9% vs 13.3%), and virtual mental health services (83.7% vs 53.3%). Changes in clinical care delivery dramatically reduced in face-to-face learning opportunities for surgical trainees during the COVID-19 pandemic. While this effect had equal impact across all program types, sizes, and geographies, the same cannot be said for wellness initiatives. Though all programs initiated some strategies to protect resident health, the disparity between university programs and independent programs may be cause for action.","White, Shaughnessy, Esposito, Slade, Korah, Yoo",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsurg.2020.07.036,20200911.0,COVID-19; coronavirus; general surgery; graduate medical education; resident wellness; virtual education,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
130,Work-Related and Personal Factors Associated With Mental Well-Being During the COVID-19 Response: Survey of Health Care and Other Workers,"The response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has created an unprecedented disruption in work conditions. This study describes the mental health and well-being of workers both with and without clinical exposure to patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The aim of this study is to measure the prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression, work exhaustion, burnout, and decreased well-being among faculty and staff at a university and academic medical center during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and describe work-related and personal factors associated with their mental health and well-being. All faculty, staff, and postdoctoral fellows of a university, including its medical school, were invited in April 2020 to complete an online questionnaire measuring stress, anxiety, depression, work exhaustion, burnout, and decreased well-being. We examined associations between these outcomes and factors including work in high-risk clinical settings and family/home stressors. There were 5550 respondents (overall response rate of 34.3%). Overall, 34% of faculty and 14% of staff (n=915) were providing clinical care, while 61% of faculty and 77% of staff were working from home. Among all workers, anxiety (prevalence ratio 1.37, 95% CI 1.09-1.73), depression (prevalence ratio 1.28, 95% CI 1.03-1.59), and high work exhaustion (prevalence ratio 1.24, 95% CI 1.13-1.36) were independently associated with community or clinical exposure to COVID-19. Poor family-supportive behaviors by supervisors were also associated with these outcomes (prevalence ratio 1.40, 95% CI 1.21-1.62; prevalence ratio 1.69, 95% CI 1.48-1.92; and prevalence ratio 1.54, 95% CI 1.44-1.64, respectively). Age &lt;40 years and a greater number of family/home stressors were also associated with these poorer outcomes. Among the subset of clinicians, caring for patients with COVID-19 and working in high-risk clinical settings were additional risk factors. Our findings suggest that the pandemic has had negative effects on the mental health and well-being of both clinical and nonclinical employees. Mitigating exposure to COVID-19 and increasing supervisor support are modifiable risk factors that may protect mental health and well-being for all workers.","Evanoff, Strickland, Dale, Hayibor, Page, Duncan, Kannampallil, Gray",https://doi.org/10.2196/21366,20200904.0,"COVID-19; coronavirus; health care workers; mental health; occupational health; pandemic; remote work; worker well-being; Adult; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Occupational Diseases; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17

SARS-CoV-2 cases and deaths in children are minimal compared to adults, but the pandemic impacts other 'essential' aspects of children's health including child development and the associated areas of paediatric behaviour, mental health, and maltreatment. Alongside the management of severe SARS-CoV-2 cases in emergency rooms and intensive care units, continuing to care for children with developmental disabilities must also be concurrently championed as 'essential' during this crisis. The potentially devastating lifelong effects of the pandemic and isolation on an already vulnerable population demand that action be taken now. Video conferences and phone calls are 'essential' instruments we can use to continue to provide quality care for our patients.","Fung, Ricci",https://doi.org/10.1093/pch/pxaa077,20200928.0, Child behaviour; COVID-19; Child development; Coronavirus; Pandemics,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
133,Psychological Distress and Its Correlates Among COVID-19 Survivors During Early Convalescence Across Age Groups,"To examine the psychological distress and the associated predictor factors of the 2019 corona-virus disease (COVID-19) on survivors in the early convalescence in Shenzhen. A survey questionnaire consisting of post-traumatic stress disorder self-rating scale (PTSD-SS), self-rating depression scale (SDS), and self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) was presented to COVID-19 survivors still in quarantine. Scores of each scale and subscale were dependent variables in the Mann-Whitney test and stepwise regression analysis. A total of 126 subjects were included in the study, the mean scores of PTSD-SS, SDS, and SAS were 45.5 Â± 18.9, 47.3 Â± 13.1, and 43.2 Â± 10.2, respectively, meanwhile, 9 (31.0%), 28 (22.2%), and 48 (38.1%) of the survivors met the cut-score for clinical significant symptoms of stress response, anxiety, and depression, respectively. Infected family members, and postinfection physical discomforts were significantly associated with scores on all three scales. Social support, retirement, and being female had significant associations with the PTSD-SS score. The survivors aged 60 or above experienced less severe stress response symptoms, fewer emotional symptoms of depression, and fewer anxiety symptoms than younger survivors. The occurrence rate of psychological distress among the COVID-19 survivors in early convalescence was high, highlighting the need for all COVID-19 survivors to be screened for psychological distress regularly for timely intervention. The predictors indicated by the current study may help to identify those at high-risk. Besides, the results indicated the older survivors suffered less emotional reactivity and fewer stress response symptoms from infectious diseases than the younger ones.","Cai, Hu, Ekumi, Wang, An, Li, Yuan",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.07.003,20200924.0,"COVID-19; anxiety; depression; older age; psychological distress; stress response; survivors; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; China; Convalescence; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Employment; Family; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Protective Factors; Psychological Distress; Retirement; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index; Sex Factors; Social Support; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Stress, Psychological; Survivors",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17

The outbreak will cause bad emotions such as tension, anxiety, fear, and so on. College students who have returned home from school face infection, isolation, and delay in starting school, and thus, their emotional stress should be observed. This study used self-designed questionnaires and artificial intelligence (AI) to assess and analyze the emotional state of over 30,000 college students during the outbreak period in January (T1) and home quarantine in February (T2). This survey used online questionnaire (www.wjx.cn) to investigate the emotion information of college students. In the T1 survey, the &quot;Typhoon Eye Effect&quot; appeared. College students in Hubei are calmer than those outside Hubei in T1. However, in T2, an emotional &quot;infection point&quot; appeared, there was an &quot;Exposure Effect&quot;, the negative emotions of students in Hubei largely increased and became higher than students outside Hubei. This survey found that there is an emotional &quot;infection point&quot; in February among college students, especially in the Hubei area. College students in Hubei are calmer than those outside Hubei in T1. In contrast, college students in Hubei were more nervous and scared than those outside Hubei in T2. This epidemic has caused the students to experience significant pressure and negative emotions. Therefore, universities and society should pay attention to their emotional adjustment, there are some suggestions such as establish the mental health organizations, test students' emotion status regularly.","Zhang, Cao, Wang, Wang, Lei, Shou, Xie, Huang, Luo, Luo, Bian, Zhang, Xiao",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.07.097,20200909.0,"College students; Emotional â€œinflection pointâ€; New coronavirus pneumonia (NCP); Self-regulation; Adolescent; Anxiety; Artificial Intelligence; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; Emergencies; Emotions; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Public Health; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
136,"Experiences of American Older Adults with Pre-existing Depression During the Beginnings of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Multicity, Mixed-Methods Study","To determine the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of older adults with pre-existing major depressive disorder (MDD). Participants were 73 community-living older adults with pre-existing MDD (mean age 69 [SD 6]) in Los Angeles, New York, Pittsburgh, and St Louis. During the first 2 months of the pandemic, the authors interviewed participants with a semistructured qualitative interview evaluating access to care, mental health, quality of life, and coping. The authors also assessed depression, anxiety, and suicidality with validated scales and compared scores before and during the pandemic. Five themes from the interviews highlight the experience of older adults with MDD: 1) They are more concerned about the risk of contracting the virus than the risks of isolation. 2) They exhibit resilience to the stress and isolation of physical distancing. 3) Most are not isolated socially, with virtual contact with friends and family. 4) Their quality of life is lower, and they worry their mental health will suffer with continued physical distancing. 5) They are outraged by an inadequate governmental response to the pandemic. Depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation symptom scores did not differ from scores before the pandemic. Most older adults with pre-existing MDD show resilience in the first 2 months of the COVID-19 pandemic but have concerns about the future. Policies and interventions to provide access to medical services and opportunities for social interaction are needed to help to maintain mental health and quality of life as the pandemic continues.","Hamm, Brown, Karp, Lenard, Cameron, Dawdani, Lavretsky, Miller, Mulsant, Pham, Reynolds, Roose, Lenze",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.06.013,20200907.0,"Covid-19 Pandemic; anxiety; depression; resilience; Aged; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; Comorbidity; Coronavirus Infections; Depressive Disorder, Major; Female; Humans; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Qualitative Research; Quality of Life; Suicidal Ideation; United States",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
137,Adapting Neurosurgery Practice During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the Indian Subcontinent,"The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has changed the practice of neurosurgery. Significant resources have been dedicated to the disease. The pandemic in the Indian subcontinent, compared with the rest of the world, is relatively delayed. The neurosurgical practice cannot remain unaffected by hugely disruptive measures such as a lockdown. The inevitable increase in COVID infections with the gradual relaxation of lockdown continues to pose a risk for health care providers. Therefore, it is imperative to evaluate whether the pandemic has had a discernible effect on health care providers, especially in terms of practice modifications in private establishments and publicly funded hospitals, the emotional impact on the surgeon, and the influence of social media on the psyche of the surgeon. An online questionnaire-based survey was prepared, with questions related to the COVID-specific themes of precautions taken in outpatient services and operating theaters, the influence of social media, the economic loss incurred, and the perceptible impact of telemedicine and webinars. The links to the survey were mailed to neurosurgeons in private and public practice countrywide. The responses were anonymized to ensure free and unbiased answers to the survey questions. A total of 176 responses were received from across the Indian subcontinent. The median age of respondents was 39 years (range, 32-70 years) and the postresidency experience was 7 years (range, 0-34 years). Respondents were an equitable mix of public and private practitioners. Of respondents, 46% were practicing restricted outpatient services, more in public institutions (PÂ = 0.22) which also had a higher incidence of tele-outpatient services (26% vs. 17%). Wearing surgical masks, N95 masks, and gloves were the most commonly practiced precautionary measures in outpatient services (&gt;60%). Although private practitioners were continuing elective cases (40%), public institutes were more cautious, with only emergency patients being operated on (29%). The greatest fear among all practitioners was passing the infection to their family (75%). Social media were helpful for brainstorming queries and updating practice modifications, but some surgeons admitted to receiving threats on social media platforms (37.5%). Depression and economic losses were palpable for approximately 30% neurosurgeons. The survey highlights the perception of neurosurgeons toward the pandemic and the difference in public-private practice. Suspension of elective procedures, severe curtailment of regular outpatient appointments, drastic modifications of the normal outpatient department/operating room practices, and apprehensions related to inadequacy of safety provided by personal protective equipment use and financial losses of private establishments were some of the visible themes in our survey results. Although telemedicine has not been as widely adopted as expected, online education has been favorably received.","Deora, Mishra, Tripathi, Garg, Tandon, Borkar, Varshney, Raut, Chaurasia, Chandra, Kale",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2020.07.038,20201009.0,"COVID-19; Coronavirus; Neurosurgery; Social media; Academic Medical Centers; Adult; Aged; Ambulatory Care; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Economics; Elective Surgical Procedures; Hospitals, Private; Hospitals, Public; Humans; India; Middle Aged; Neurosurgeons; Neurosurgery; Neurosurgical Procedures; Pandemics; Personal Protective Equipment; Pneumonia, Viral; Professional Practice; Social Media; Surveys and Questionnaires; Telemedicine",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17

Â Governments have taken public health protection measures to reduce the spread of the virus through non-pharmalogical measures. The impact of the pandemic and the public health response on individual and population mental health is unknown.Â <b>Methods:</b> We used Google Trends data (1 Jan 2020 - Â 30 Mar 2020) to investigate the impact of the pandemic and government measures to curb it on people's concerns, as indexed by changes in search frequency for topics indicating mental distress, social and economic stressors and mental health treatment-seeking. We explored the changes of key topics in Google trends in Italy, Spain, USA, UK, and Worldwide in relation to sentinel events during the pandemic. <b>Results:</b> Globally there appears to be significant concerns over the financial and work-related consequences of the pandemic, with some evidence that levels of fear are rising. Conversely relative searching for topics related to depression and suicide fell after the pandemic was announced, with some evidence that searches for the latter have risen recently. Concerns over education and access to medication appear to be particular social stressors. Whilst searches for face-to-face treatments have declined, those for self-care have risen. <b>Conclusions:</b> Monitoring Google trends shows promise as a means of tracking changing public concerns. In weeks to come it may enable policy makers to assess the impact of their interventions including those aiming to limit negative consequences, such as government funded financial safety nets.","Knipe, Evans, Marchant, Gunnell, John",https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15870.2,20200928.0,Anxiety; COVID-19; Coronavirus; Depression; Economic; Mental health; Pandemic; Suicide,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17

140,COVID-19 and Telepsychiatry: Development of Evidence-Based Guidance for Clinicians,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) presents unique challenges in health care, including mental health care provision. Telepsychiatry can provide an alternative to face-to-face assessment and can also be used creatively with other technologies to enhance care, but clinicians and patients may feel underconfident about embracing this new way of working. The aim of this paper is to produce an open-access, easy-to-consult, and reliable source of information and guidance about telepsychiatry and COVID-19 using an evidence-based approach. We systematically searched existing English language guidelines and websites for information on telepsychiatry in the context of COVID-19 up to and including May 2020. We used broad search criteria and included pre-COVID-19 guidelines and other digital mental health topics where relevant. We summarized the data we extracted as answers to specific clinical questions. Findings from this study are presented as both a short practical checklist for clinicians and detailed textboxes with a full summary of all the guidelines. The summary textboxes are also available on an open-access webpage, which is regularly updated. These findings reflected the strong evidence base for the use of telepsychiatry and included guidelines for many of the common concerns expressed by clinicians about practical implementation, technology, information governance, and safety. Guidelines across countries differ significantly, with UK guidelines more conservative and focused on practical implementation and US guidelines more expansive and detailed. Guidelines on possible combinations with other digital technologies such as apps (eg, from the US Food and Drug Administration, the National Health Service Apps Library, and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) are less detailed. Several key areas were not represented. Although some special populations such as child and adolescent, and older adult, and cultural issues are specifically included, important populations such as learning disabilities, psychosis, personality disorder, and eating disorders, which may present particular challenges for telepsychiatry, are not. In addition, the initial consultation and follow-up sessions are not clearly distinguished. Finally, a hybrid model of care (combining telepsychiatry with other technologies and in-person care) is not explicitly covered by the existing guidelines. We produced a comprehensive synthesis of guidance answering a wide range of clinical questions in telepsychiatry. This meets the urgent need for practical information for both clinicians and health care organizations who are rapidly adapting to the pandemic and implementing remote consultation. It reflects variations across countries and can be used as a basis for organizational change in the short- and long-term. Providing easily accessible guidance is a first step but will need cultural change to implement as clinicians start to view telepsychiatry not just as a replacement but as a parallel and complementary form of delivering therapy with its own advantages and benefits as well as restrictions. A combination or hybrid approach can be the most successful approach in the new world of mental health post-COVID-19, and guidance will need to expand to encompass the use of telepsychiatry in conjunction with other in-person and digital technologies, and its use across all psychiatric disorders, not just those who are the first to access and engage with remote treatment.","Smith, Ostinelli, Macdonald, Cipriani",https://doi.org/10.2196/21108,20200928.0,COVID-19; digital mental health; evidence-based guidance; mental health; systematic review; telepsychiatry,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17

The results suggest that fear of food shortage was the most pronounces one in both samples, followed by fear for oneself and finally by the fear for beloved others. Results suggest that optimists, those with high level of general trust and those who do not believe in conspiracy theories show lower level of fear and higher level of preventive behaviors. Pessimists on the other hand, show higher level of fear. Fear was related to all information sources suggesting that more information leads to higher intensity of fear – except information from the president which did not show any effect.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2020.110216,20201201.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
143,Revising our attitudes towards agonist medications and their diversion in a time of pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic led government regulators to relax prescribing rules for buprenorphine and methadone, the agonist medications that effectively treat opioid use disorder, allowing for take home supplies of up to 28 days. These changes prioritized the availability of these medications over concerns about their misuse and diversion, and they provided a means for overdose prophylaxis during the highly uncertain conditions of the pandemic. In considering how to capitalize on this shift, research should determine the extent to which increased diversion has occurred as a result, and what the consequences may have been. The shifts also set the stage to consider if methadone can be safely prescribed in primary care settings, and if the monthly injectable formulation of buprenorphine is a suitable alternative to increased supplies of sublingual strips if concerns about diversion persist. The disruptions of the pandemic have caused a surge in overdose deaths, so carefully considering the prophylactic potential of agonist medications, in addition to their role as a treatment, may help us address this mortality crisis.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108139,20201201.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17

146,Perinatal depressive and anxiety symptoms of pregnant women during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in China,"Background On January 20, 2020, a new coronavirus epidemic with human-to-human transmission was officially declared by the Chinese government, which caused significant public panic in China. In light of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, pregnant women may be particularly vulnerable and in special need for preventive mental health strategies. Thus far, no reports exist to investigate the mental health response of pregnant women to the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. Objective This study aimed to examine the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak on the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms and the corresponding risk factors among pregnant women across China. Study Design A multicenter, cross-sectional study was initiated in early December 2019 to identify mental health concerns in pregnancy using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. This study provided a unique opportunity to compare the mental status of pregnant women before and after the declaration of the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic. A total of 4124 pregnant women during their third trimester from 25 hospitals in 10 provinces across China were examined in this cross-sectional study from January 1, 2020, to February 9, 2020. Of these women, 1285 were assessed after January 20, 2020, when the coronavirus epidemic was publicly declared and 2839 were assessed before this pivotal time point. The internationally recommended Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale was used to assess maternal depression and anxiety symptoms. Prevalence rates and risk factors were compared between the pre- and poststudy groups. Results Pregnant women assessed after the declaration of coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic had significantly higher rates of depressive symptoms (26.0% vs 29.6%, P=.02) than women assessed before the epidemic declaration. These women were also more likely to have thoughts of self-harm (P=.005). The depressive rates were positively associated with the number of newly confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (P=.003), suspected infections (P=.004), and deaths per day (P=.001). Pregnant women who were underweight before pregnancy, primiparous, younger than 35 years, employed full time, in middle income category, and had appropriate living space were at increased risk for developing depressive and anxiety symptoms during the outbreak. Conclusion Major life-threatening public health events such as the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak may increase the risk for mental illness among pregnant women, including thoughts of self-harm. Strategies targeting maternal stress and isolation such as effective risk communication and the provision of psychological first aid may be particularly useful to prevent negative outcomes for women and their fetuses.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.05.009,20200801.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
147,COVID 19–Depression and Neurosurgeons,"Objective The goal of this survey was to determine factors associated with anxiety/depression among neurosurgeons during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods An online survey was performed of neurosurgeons worldwide, conducted over 3 weeks. Depression in neurosurgeons was assessed by Self-Reporting Questionnaire–20. Results A total of 375 responses were received from 52 countries. Among all neurosurgeons, 34% felt tense, 32.5% were unhappy, 25% experienced insomnia, almost 20% had headaches, and 5% had suicidal ideation during the pandemic. Of participants, 14% had a score on Self-Reporting Questionnaire–20 consistent with depression. The likelihood of depression was significantly higher among those who did not receive guidance about self-protection from their institutions (odds ratio [OR], 2.47), those who did not feel safe with provided personal protective equipments (OR, 3.13), and those whose families considered their workplace unsafe (OR, 2.29). Depression was less likely in neurosurgeons who had minor concerns, compared with those with significant health concerns for their families (OR, 0.36). In multivariate analysis after controlling for effects of other covariates, odds of depression were significantly higher among neurosurgeons who did not feel safe with the provided personal protective equipment (OR, 2.43) and who were exposed to a COVID-19–positive colleague (OR, 2.54). Participants who had moderate concerns for their families had lesser odds of anxiety/depression than did those with significant concerns (OR, 0.28). Conclusions Based on the modifiable risk factors of depression in this study, it is recommended that the safety of neurosurgeons be ensured by providing appropriate safety measures for them to regain their confidence and hence reduce the incidence of depression.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2020.06.007,20200801.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17

149,Suicidal behavior in light of COVID-19 outbreak: Clinical challenges and treatment perspectives,"Objectifs La pandémie de COVID-19 touche à ce jour plus de 3 000 000 de personnes à travers le monde et les mesures de prévention ont conduit au confinement de plus de la moitié de l’humanité. La communauté scientifique et les autorités politiques redoutent une épidémie de suicides secondaires à cette crise. L’objectif de cette revue de la littérature est d’analyser l’impact de la pandémie de COVID-19 sur les dimensions du processus suicidaire, son interaction avec les différents facteurs de risque. Nous proposons également des solutions innovantes pour y remédier. Méthodes Nous avons réalisé une revue narrative des articles internationaux traitant des grandes pandémies (COVID-19, SRAS) et de leur influence sur la vulnérabilité suicidaire. Résultats De nombreux facteurs sont susceptibles de majorer l’émergence d’idées de suicide et le passage à l’acte suicidaire au cours de cette crise. La distanciation et le confinement pourraient favoriser un sentiment de déconnexion et la perception d’une douleur sociale chez les individus vulnérables. Certaines populations déjà « à risque suicidaire élevé » pourraient être encore fragilisées par la pandémie actuelle : personnes âgées, personnel médical et individus exposés à une forte précarité économique. Plusieurs solutions innovantes adaptées aux contraintes de la distanciation et du confinement permettront de prévenir le risque suicidaire : outils de santé connectée, protocole VigilanS, thérapie comportementale et cognitive de troisième vague et pratique artistique. Conclusions Il est possible que cette crise inédite exacerbe certaines dimensions du processus suicidaire. Cependant, à l’heure de l’innovation, plusieurs outils de prévention du suicide ont toute leur place dans les nouveaux modes de soins et devront être expérimentés à grande échelle. Objective The COVID-19 pandemic affected today more than 3,000,000 worldwide, and more than half of humanity has been placed in quarantine. The scientific community and the political authorities fear an epidemic of suicide secondary to this crisis. The aim of this review is to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the dimensions of the suicidal process and its interaction with the various risk factors. We also propose innovative strategies to manage suicidal behavior in the context of pandemic. Methods We carried out a narrative review of international publications dealing with major pandemics (COVID-19, SARS) and their influence on suicidal vulnerability. Results Many factors are likely to increase the emergence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts during this crisis. Social distancing and quarantine could increase the feeling of disconnection and the perception of social pain in vulnerable individuals. Some populations at high suicidal risk could be further impacted by the current pandemic: the elderly, medical staff and individuals exposed to economic insecurity. Several innovative tools adapted to the constraints of social distancing and quarantine may prevent suicide risk: e-health, VigilanS, buddhist-derived practices and art engagement. Conclusions This unprecedented crisis may interact with certain dimensions of the suicidal process. However, it is time to innovate. Several suicide prevention tools all have their place in new modes of care and should be tested on a large scale.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.05.001,20200601.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
150,Mental health problems faced by healthcare workers due to the COVID-19 pandemic–A review,"Introduction The spread of novel corona virus (COVID-19) across the globe and the associated morbidity and mortality challenged the nations by several means. One such underrecognized and unaddressed area is the mental health issues medical staff develop during the pandemic. Materials and methods This review aimed to review the literature about mental health problems faced by health care workers (HCW) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Literature search was conducted in the following databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, Embase. All types of articles published in the last 4 months (January 2020-April 2020) which were relevant to the subject of the review were searched. A total of 23 articles were selected by initial screening and 6 articles were included in the final review. Results Review of all the 6 articles showed that current research focused on assessing several aspects of mental health affected in HCW due to COVID-19. Several sociodemographic variables like gender, profession, age, place of work, department of work and psychological variables like poor social support, self-efficacy were associated with increased stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, insomnia in HCW. There is increasing evidence that suggests that COVID-19 can be an independent risk factor for stress in HCW. Conclusion Regular screening of medical personnel involved in treating, diagnosing patients with COVID-19 should be done for evaluating stress, depression and anxiety by using multidisciplinary Psychiatry teams.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102119,20200601.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
151,Psychopathological consequences of confinement,"Les effets psychologiques de l’isolement ont déjà été décrits dans la littérature (expéditions polaires, sous-marins, prison). Néanmoins, l’échelle du confinement mis en œuvre à l’occasion de la pandémie à COVID-19 est inédite. Il nous faut non seulement relire les études publiées, mais aussi anticiper les problèmes psychologiques qui pourraient survenir pendant ou à distance du confinement. Nous avons fait le choix d’aller au-delà de la littérature COVID-19 pour examiner les implications des conséquences connues du confinement : l’ennui, l’isolement social, le stress, le manque de sommeil. L’anxiété, le trouble de stress post-traumatique, la dépression et les conduites suicidaires, les conduites addictives, les violences domestiques sont des effets décrits du confinement, mais les mécanismes d’émergence de ces troubles et leurs interrelations restent à étudier. Par exemple, quels sont les mécanismes d’émergence du trouble de stress post-traumatique dans le cadre du confinement ? Nous rappelons aussi les points de vigilance à garder sur des conséquences telles que les troubles des conduites alimentaires, les hallucinations, curieusement ignorées dans la littérature sur le confinement, alors qu’une vaste littérature fait le lien entre isolement social et hallucinations. Du fait de conséquences psychopathologiques larges, il nous faut partir à la recherche des différents symptômes pour permettre leur prise en charge. Nous résumons rapidement les approches diagnostiques et thérapeutiques déjà mises en place, comme la télémédecine, qui connaît un développement rapide à l’occasion de la crise du COVID-19. The psychological effects of isolation have already been described in the literature (polar expeditions, submarines, prison). Nevertheless, the scale of confinement implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented. In addition to reviewing the published studies, we need to anticipate the psychological problems that could arise during or at a distance from confinement. We have gone beyond the COVID-19 literature in order to examine the implications of the known consequences of confinement, like boredom, social isolation, stress, or sleep deprivation. Anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, suicidal or addictive behaviours, domestic violence are described effects of confinement, but the mechanisms of emergence of these disorders and their interrelationships remain to be studied. For example, what are the mechanisms of emergence of post-traumatic stress disorders in the context of confinement? We also remind the reader of points of vigilance to be kept in mind with regard to eating disorders and hallucinations. Hallucinations are curiously ignored in the literature on confinement, whereas a vast literature links social isolation and hallucinations. Due to the broad psychopathological consequences, we have to look for these various symptoms to manage them. We quickly summarize the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches already in place, such as telemedicine, which is undergoing rapid development during the COVID-19 crisis.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.007,20200601.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
152,Mental health care in French correctional facilities during the Covid-19 pandemic,"Objectif En France, les mesures de confinement ont été accompagnées de dispositions spécifiques pour les prisons : suspension des activités, parloirs et interventions extérieures. Plus de dix mille personnes détenues ont en outre été libérées pour diminuer le taux d’occupation des établissements et limiter la propagation du virus. L’objectif de cet article est de décrire la réorganisation des soins psychiatriques en milieu pénitentiaire en contexte de pandémie de Covid-19 et d’interroger les conséquences du confinement et des libérations anticipées sur la santé mentale des personnes détenues. Méthode Ce travail s’appuie sur une enquête menée en avril 2020 auprès des soignants de 42 unités sanitaires en milieu pénitentiaire et des 9 unités hospitalières spécialement aménagées en France. Une synthèse de la littérature internationale sur la question des soins psychiatriques en milieu pénitentiaire durant l’épidémie de Covid-19 a également été réalisée. Résultats L’épidémie de Covid-19 semble avoir été plutôt contenue dans les prisons françaises au cours de la période de confinement mais le poids des mesures mises en place sur la population carcérale est important. Les 3 niveaux de soins psychiatriques en milieu pénitentiaire ont instauré des mesures spécifiques pour assurer la continuité des soins, accompagner les personnes incarcérées et contenir l’épidémie. Parmi les plus importantes, on note la restriction des consultations, la création de « secteurs Covid », la déprogrammation des hospitalisations non urgentes, le renforcement des mesures d’hygiène et le remaniement des effectifs. Actuellement, les soignants sont principalement confrontés à des sevrages forcés, des symptomatologies anxieuses et des décompensations de troubles psychiatriques chroniques. Certaines libérations anticipées sont aussi très préoccupantes, pouvant entraîner des ruptures de soins, par manque de préparation des relais de prise en charge. Discussion Les remaniements en lien avec le confinement donnent une visibilité accrue au fossé qui sépare la psychiatrie en milieu libre de la psychiatrie en milieu pénitentiaire. Il nous apparaît important de rappeler la vulnérabilité des personnes incarcérées qui doivent impérativement être considérées dans les politiques de santé publique. Objective The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the 11 million people currently incarcerated worldwide is the subject of many concerns. Prisons and jails are filled with people suffering from many preexisting medical conditions increasing the risk of complications. Detainees’ access to medical services is already limited and overcrowding poses a threat of massive contagion. Beyond the health impact of the crisis, the tightening of prison conditions worries. On March 16, 2020, in France, the lockdown measures have been accompanied by specific provisions for prisons: all facilities have suspended visitations, group activities and external interventions. Over 10,000 prisoners have been released to reduce the prison population and the risk of virus propagation. These adjustments had major consequences on the healthcare system in French prisons. The objectives of this article are to describe the reorganization of the three levels of psychiatric care for inmates in France in the context of Covid-19 pandemic and to have a look at the impact of lockdown measures and early releases on mental health of prisoners. Methods This work is based on a survey conducted in April 2020 in France among psychiatric healthcare providers working in 42 ambulatory units for inmates and in the 9 full-time inpatient psychiatric wards exclusively for inmates called “UHSAs” (which stands for “unités hospitalières spécialement aménagées”, and can be translated as “specially equipped hospital units”). A review of the international literature on mental healthcare system for inmates during the Covid-19 epidemic has also been performed. Results The Covid-19 epidemic has been rather contained during the period of confinement in French prisons but the impact of confinement measures on the prison population is significant. The three levels of psychiatric care for inmates have implemented specific measures to ensure continuity of care, to support detainees during Coronavirus lockdown and to prevent an infection's spread. Among the most important are: limitation of medical consultations to serious and urgent cases, creation of “Covid units”, cancellation of voluntary psychiatric hospitalizations, reinforcement of preventive hygiene measures and reshuffling of medical staff. Prolonged confinement has consequences on mental health of detainees. Currently, mental health workers are facing multiple clinical situations such as forced drug and substance withdrawal (linked to difficulties in supplying psychoactive substances), symptoms of anxiety (due to concerns for their own and their relatives’ well-being) and decompensation among patients with severe psychiatric conditions. Early releases from prison may also raise some issues. People recently released from prison are identified as at high risk of death by suicide and drug overdose. The lack of time to provide the necessary link between health services within prisons and health structures outside could have serious consequences, emphasizing the well-known “revolving prison doors” effect. Discussion The current lockdown measures applied in French jails and prisons point out the disparities between psychiatric care for inmates and psychiatric care for general population. Giving the high vulnerability of prison population, public health authorities should pay more attention to health care in prisons.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.05.002,20200601.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
153,Ensuring mental health care during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in France: A narrative review,"Objectif L’absence de préparation du système de soins psychiatriques à l’épidémie de virus SARS-CoV-2 fait redouter fait redouter un scénario pessimiste pour la santé physique et mentale des patients suivis en psychiatrie. L’objectif de cet article est de proposer des éléments de guidance pour réorganiser les soins psychiatriques dans le contexte de pandémie Covid-19. Méthode Les auteurs ont réalisé une synthèse de la littérature internationale combinée au partage des expériences locales françaises. Résultats Les patients souffrant de troubles psychiques semblent particulièrement vulnérables à ce virus et à la pandémie : vulnérabilités liées aux comorbidités médicales, à l’âge, aux troubles cognitifs qui peuvent entraver le respect des consignes de confinement et aux complications psychosociales. Plusieurs initiatives ont été prises pour assurer la continuité des soins et contenir l’épidémie : création en psychiatrie d’unité Covid+ co-supervisée par des médecins généralistes ou internistes, restriction des consultations aux cas sévères et redéploiement des soins en téléconsultation, accompagnement de type case-management pour les sorties précoces ou l’impossibilité d’hospitaliser, accompagnements spécifiques pour les complications psychiques du confinement. Les populations suivies en pédopsychiatrie, en psychiatrie du sujet âgé, en addictologie ou détenues en prison doivent bénéficier d’une attention particulière. Plusieurs questions restent en suspend : la question de l’interaction négative ou positive des traitements sur l’infection SARS-CoV-2, l’épidémiologie de l’infection chez les personnes souffrant de troubles psychiques, leur adaptation à un confinement long. Discussion Une prise de conscience par les décideurs politiques de la grande vulnérabilité de ces populations et des institutions psychiatriques dans cette situation de catastrophe sanitaire est urgente. Objective The lack of ressources and coordination to face the epidemic of coronavirus raises concerns for the health of patients with mental disorders in a country where we keep in memory the dramatic experience of famine in psychiatric hospitals during the Second World War. This article aims at proposing guidance to ensure mental health care during the SARS-CoV epidemy in France. Methods Authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature and local initiatives in France. Results We identified four types of major vulnerabilities in patients suffering from mental disorders during this pandemic: (1) medical comorbidities that are more frequently found in patients suffering from mental disorders (cardiovascular and pulmonary pathologies, diabetes, obesity, etc.) which represent risk factors for severe infections with Covid-19; (2) age (the elderly constituting the population most vulnerable to coronavirus); (3) cognitive and behavioral troubles which can hamper compliance with confinement and hygiene measures and finally and (4) psychosocial vulnerability due to stigmatization and/or socio-economic difficulties. Furthermore, the mental health healthcare system is more vulnerable than other healthcare systems. Current government plans are poorly adapted to psychiatric establishments in a context of major shortage of organizational, material and human resources. In addition, a certain number of structural aspects make the psychiatric institution particularly vulnerable: many beds are closed, wards have a high density of patients, mental health community facilities are closed, medical teams are understaffed and poorly trained to face infectious diseases. We could also face major issues in referring patients with acute mental disorders to intensive care units. To maintain continuity of psychiatric care in this pandemic situation, several directions can be considered, in particular with the creation of Covid+ units. These units are under the dual supervision of a psychiatrist and of an internist/infectious disease specialist; all new entrants should be placed in quarantine for 14 days; the nurse staff should benefit from specific training, from daily medical check-ups and from close psychological support. Family visits would be prohibited and replaced by videoconference. At the end of hospitalization, in particular for the population of patients in compulsory ambulatory care situations, specific case-management should be organized with the possibility of home visits, in order to support them when they get back home and to help them to cope with the experience of confinement, which is at risk to induce recurrences of mental disorders. The total or partial closure of mental health community facilities is particularly disturbing for patients but a regular follow-up is possible with telemedicine and should include the monitoring of the suicide risk and psychoeducation strategies; developing support platforms could also be very helpful in this context. Private psychiatrists have also a crucial role of information with their patients on confinement and barrier measures, but also on measures to prevent the psychological risks inherent to confinement: maintenance of sleep regularity, physical exercise, social interactions, stress management and coping strategies, prevention of addictions, etc. They should also be trained to prevent, detect and treat early warning symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, because their prevalence was high in the regions of China most affected by the pandemic. Discussion French mental healthcare is now in a great and urgent need for reorganization and must also prepare in the coming days and weeks to face an epidemic of emotional disorders due to the containment of the general population.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.03.001,20200601.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17

In this review, we will discuss the challenges posed by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic for patients on home dialysis, the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 on various aspects of their care, and the resultant rapid adaptations in policy/health-care delivery mechanisms with implications for the future care of patients on home dialysis.",,https://doi.org/10.1053/j.ackd.2020.07.001,20200101.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
157,Impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on the quality of life for women with ovarian cancer,"Background The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented challenges for the oncology community. For people living with cancer, treatments are interrupted, surgeries cancelled, and regular oncology evaluations rescheduled. People with cancer and their physicians must balance plausible fears of coronavirus disease 2019 and cancer treatment with the consequences of delaying cancer care. Objective We aim to evaluate the experience of women with ovarian cancer during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Study Design Women with a current or previous diagnosis of ovarian cancer completed an online survey focusing on treatment interruptions and quality of life. The quality of life was measured with the Cancer Worry Scale and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. The survey was distributed through survivor networks and social media. Univariate and multivariable linear regression analysis were used to evaluate the effect of participant characteristics on quality of life survey scores. Results A total of 603 women, from 41 states, visited the survey website between March 30, 2020, and April 13, 2020, and 555 (92.0%) completed the survey. The median age was 58 years (range, 20–85). At the time of survey completion, 217 participants (43.3%) were in active treatment. A total of 175 participants (33%) experienced a delay in some component of their cancer care. Ten (26.3%) of the 38 participants scheduled for surgery experienced a delay, as did 18 (8.3%) of the 217 participants scheduled for nonsurgical cancer treatment. A total of 133 participants (24.0%) had a delayed physician appointment, 84 (15.1%) laboratory tests, and 53 (9.6%) cancer-related imaging. Among the cohort, 88.6% (489) reported significant cancer worry, 51.4% (285) borderline or abnormal anxiety, and 26.5% (147) borderline or abnormal depression. On univariate analysis, age less than 65 years, being scheduled for cancer treatment or cancer surgery, delay in oncology care, being self-described as immunocompromised, and use of telemedicine were all associated with higher levels of cancer worry. Higher anxiety scores were associated with age less than 65 years and being self-described as immunocompromised. Higher depression scores were associated with age less than 65 years, being scheduled for cancer surgery, delay in oncology care, being self-described as immunocompromised, and use of telemedicine. On multivariable linear regression analysis, age less than 65 and being self-described as immunocompromised were independently predictive of greater cancer worry, anxiety, and depression, and delay in cancer care was predictive of anxiety and depression. Conclusion The coronavirus disease 2019 crisis is affecting care of patients with ovarian cancer; surgeries, treatments, scheduled physician appointments, laboratory tests, and imaging are cancelled or delayed. Younger age, presumed immunocompromise, and delay in cancer care were associated with significantly higher levels of cancer worry, anxiety, and depression. Providers must work with patients to balance competing risks of coronavirus disease 2019 and cancer, recognizing that communication is a critical clinical tool to improve quality of life in these times.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.06.049,20200101.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
158,Immunopsychiatry and SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: Links and possible consequences,"Objectif La pandémie de SARS-CoV-2 (ou COVID-19) se propage depuis décembre 2019, et a été, comme attendu, accompagnée d’une augmentation drastique de la prévalence des troubles anxieux et dépressifs dans la population générale. Les traumatismes psychologiques peuvent bien sûr, expliquer une partie de ces troubles. Cependant, dans la mesure où les troubles psychiatriques sont également associés à une composante immuno-inflammatoire, les effets directs du virus sur le système immunitaire de l’hôte, avec une réponse inflammatoire marquée, mais également l’inflammation secondaire à ces facteurs de stress psychosociaux, peuvent entraîner l’apparition ou l’aggravation de pathologies psychiatriques. Cet article vise donc à identifier les possibles conséquences immuno-psychiatriques de la pandémie de SARS-CoV-2 qui pourraient être utiles en termes de dépistage et/ou de prise en charge. Méthode Nous nous sommes appuyés sur les données issues des précédentes pandémies et les données existantes à ce jour sur les conséquences psychopathologiques de la pandémie de SARS-CoV-2, pour réaliser une revue de la littérature narrative sur les possibles conséquences immuno-psychiatriques de la pandémie de SARS-CoV-2. Nous avons ciblé l’environnement gestationnel en raison des risques de troubles neuro-développementaux pour le fœtus, d’une part, et les enfants et adultes directement infectés avec les risques de développer des troubles psychiatriques, d’autre part. Résultats Comme durant les précédentes pandémies, l’activation du système immunitaire due au stress et/ou à l’infection pendant la grossesse pourrait conduire à un risque accru de troubles du neuro-développement chez le fœtus (schizophrénie et troubles du spectre de l’autisme). De plus, chez les individus exposés à des traumatismes psychologiques et/ou infectés par le virus, le risque de troubles psychiatriques, notamment de troubles de l’humeur, est probable. Conclusion Dans ce contexte, des mesures de dépistage et de prise en charge dédiées sont indispensables. Il est, de fait, important de proposer aux individus ayant été infectés par le virus, un suivi rapproché afin de mettre en place une prise en charge la plus précoce possible. De même chez les femmes enceintes, le dépistage de troubles de l’humeur pendant la grossesse ou en post-partum doit être facilité. Le suivi des bébés nés pendant la période pandémique doit être renforcé afin de dépister et de prendre en charge d’éventuels troubles du neuro-développement. Objective The SARS-CoV-2 (or COVID-19) pandemic has been propagating since December 2019, inducing a drastic increase in the prevalence of anxious and depressive disorders in the general population. Psychological trauma can partly explain these disorders. However, since psychiatric disorders also have an immuno-inflammatory component, the direct effects of the virus on the host's immune system, with a marked inflammatory response, but also the secondary inflammation to these psychosocial stressors, may cause the apparition or the worsening of psychiatric disorders. We describe here the probable immunopsychiatric consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, to delineate possible screening actions and care that could be planned. Method Data from previous pandemics, and existing data on the psychopathological consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, allowed us to review the possible immunopsychiatric consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, on the gestational environment, with the risk of consecutive neurodevelopmental disorders for the fetus on one hand, on the children and adults directly infected being at increased risks of psychiatric disorders on the other hand. Results As in previous pandemics, the activation of the immune system due to psychological stress and/or to infection during pregnancy, might lead to an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders for the fetus (schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders). Furthermore, in individuals exposed to psychological trauma and/or infected by the virus, the risk of psychiatric disorders, especially mood disorders, is probably increased. Conclusion In this context, preventive measures and specialized care are necessary. Thus, it is important to propose a close follow-up to the individuals who have been infected by the virus, in order to set up the earliest care possible. Likewise, in pregnant women, screening of mood disorders during the pregnancy or the postpartum period must be facilitated. The follow-up of the babies born during the pandemic must be strengthened to screen and care for possible neurodevelopmental disorders.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.07.002,20200101.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
159,Emotional impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on healthcare workers in one of the most important infection outbreaks in Europe,"Antecedentes y objetivo La actual pandemia de Covid-19 ha puesto a los profesionales sanitarios de todo el mundo ante un desafío sin precedentes. Esto les ha podido causar dificultades emocionales y problemas de salud mental. El objetivo del presente estudio fue analizar el estado emocional de los trabajadores del Hospital de Igualada (Barcelona), mientras se enfrentaban a uno de los focos de contagio más importantes de Europa. Pacientes y métodos Se incluyó a un total de 395 trabajadores. Se realizó una evaluación transversal entre los meses de marzo y abril. Se recogió información sobre síntomas de ansiedad, depresión, estrés. También se recogieron datos demográficos y sobre factores potencialmente estresantes. Resultados Un porcentaje significativo de profesionales reportó síntomas de ansiedad (71,6%) y depresión (60,3%). El 14,5% informó de síntomas de estrés agudo. Se realizó un análisis de regresión que explicó el 30% de la variancia asociada al nivel de malestar emocional (Ry=0,30). Los factores de riesgo asociados a mayor malestar psicológico fueron el hecho de ser mujer (o hombre joven), trabajar como auxiliar de enfermería, celador o técnico de radiología, estar en contacto directo con pacientes Covid-19, no haber realizado la PCR, tener la sensación de no contar con los elementos de protección personales y haber experimentado la muerte de una persona cercana por Covid-19. Conclusiones El afrontamiento inicial de la situación de crisis asociada a la pandemia de Covid-19 tuvo un importante impacto emocional en los profesionales sanitarios analizados. Background and objectives The Covid-19 pandemic has put healthcare professionals around the world in an unprecedented challenge. This may cause some emotional difficulties and mental health problems. The aim of the present study was to analyze the emotional status among the health care workers form the Hospital of Igualada (Barcelona), while they were facing with Covid-19 in one of the most affected regions in all of Europe. Patients and methods A total of 395 participants were included in the study. A cross-sectional assessment was carried out between the months of March and April. Information about anxiety, depression, and stress was gathered. We also collected demographic data and concerning potentially stressful factors. Results A significant proportion of professionals reported symptoms of anxiety (31.4%) and depression (12.2%) from moderate to severe intensity. Symptoms of acute stress were reported by 14.5% of participants. We performed a regression analysis, which explained the 30% of the variance associated with the degree of emotional distress (Ry=0.30). The final model reveals that females (or young males), who are working in the frontline as nursing assistants, caretakers or radiology technicians, with the uncertainty of a possible infection, the perception of inadequate protection measures and having experienced the death of a close person by Covid-19, showed a heightened risk of experiencing psychological distress.

Método Se realizó una búsqueda bibliográfica, sin límite de fecha, en las bases de datos Medline, CINAHL®, PsycINFO®, Scopus y Web of Science™ empleando como palabras clave las siguientes: «emotional management», «health crisis» y «health crisis response». Inicialmente, se identificaron 73 estudios y, tras seleccionarlos según criterios de elegibilidad, se incluyeron 10. Resultados Las principales recomendaciones según la evidencia disponible indican medidas de manejo emocional como ofrecer grupos de apoyo a profesionales, garantizar su no discriminación social, fortalecer su confianza y capacidad de control mediante acciones formativas, así como reforzar el reconocimiento de las enfermeras por parte de la comunidad. Discusión y conclusiones La evidencia acumulada procede de la experiencia ante los brotes epidémicos anteriores por coronavirus SARS-CoV-1 y MERS-CoV. El estrés fue el aspecto más estudiado, en relación con cuestiones como el estigma social, el profesionalismo, la intención de cuidar, el burnout, los conflictos éticos, la ansiedad, la depresión o la culpa. El manejo emocional de las crisis sanitarias ante el coronavirus exige una estrategia individual, colectiva, social e institucional, para reforzar la seguridad en todos los frentes y reducir el temor mediante medidas eficaces de control utilizando recursos materiales y humanos suficientes y efectivos. Objective To make a synthesis of the available scientific evidence in the emotional management of the declared health crisis in the face of coronavirus. Methods A bibliographic search was made, without date limit, in Medline, CINAHL®, PsycINFO®, Scopus and Web of Science™ databases using the following keywords “emotional management”, “health crisis” and “health crisis response”. Initially, 73 studies were identified and, after selecting them according to eligibility criteria, 10 were included. Results The main recommendations based on the available evidence indicate emotional management measures such as offering support groups to professionals, ensuring their social non-discrimination, strengthening their confidence and control capacity through training actions, as well as reinforcing the recognition of nurses by the community. Discussion and conclusions The accumulated evidence comes from experience with previous outbreaks of SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. Stress was the most studied aspect, concerning issues such as social stigma, professionalism, intention to care, burnout, ethical conflicts, anxiety, depression or guilt.

163,Prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in the pediatric population from the family and community perspective,"Partiendo del informe sobre la situación de la COVID-19 en España, del 3 de abril del 2020, los casos confirmados ascienden a 117.710, de los que 343 tienen una edad inferior a 14 años (< 1%). Es fundamental conocer la especificidad de este proceso en la población infantil, así como las recomendaciones específicas para una adecuada prevención y cuidado de los niños durante la pandemia por la COVID-19. Este artículo tiene como objetivo analizar la evidencia científica sobre las recomendaciones específicas para la atención pediátrica en casos de COVID-19 desde el ámbito familiar y comunitario. Se han seleccionado y analizado las principales recomendaciones y medidas preventivas en los entornos de Atención Primaria de salud y el domicilio desde un enfoque integrador dónde se incluyen los aspectos biopsicosociales del niño durante el confinamiento. La importancia de los cuidados de la infancia frente a la enfermedad radican sobre todo en asegurar las correctas medidas de prevención del contagio por la condición de actuar como posibles portadores durante un período de incubación de hasta 21 días. La recomendación es que los niños participen activamente en las acciones preventivas habituales para la contención de la expansión de la enfermedad. A nivel domiciliario, el aislamiento supone un importante reto para las familias donde se presentan manifestaciones de incertidumbre, miedo e indefensión ante los cambios y entre las recomendaciones se encuentran establecer rutinas orden mediante horarios de actividades y ocio unido a las medidas de higiene. Dada la rapidez con la que se ha producido la pandemia por SARS-CoV-2, existen pocas evidencias del impacto en niños en España por el momento. Es necesario desarrollar estudios específicos sobre prevención y tratamiento en la edad pediátrica para mejorar las recomendaciones disponibles. Based on the report on the situation of COVID-19 in Spain, dated April 3, 2020, the confirmed cases amount to 117,710, of which 343 are under 14 years of age (< 1%). It is essential to know the specificity of this process in the child population, as well the specific recommendations for proper prevention and care of children during the COVID-19 pandemic. The paper aim is to analyze the scientific evidence on the specific recommendations for pediatric care in cases of COVID-19 from the family and community settings. The main recommendations and preventive measures in primary health care settings and at home have been selected and analyzed from an integrative approach that includes the biopsychosocial aspects of the child during confinement. The importance of caring for children in the face of the disease lies above all in ensuring the correct measures for the prevention of contagion due to the condition of acting as possible carriers during an incubation period of up to 21 days. The recommendation is that children actively participate in routine preventive actions to contain the spread of the disease. At the household level, isolation is an important challenge for families where there are manifestations of uncertainty, fear and helplessness in the face of changes and among the recommendations are establishing routines and order through schedules of activities and leisure together with hygiene measures. Given the rapidity with which the COVID-19 pandemic has occurred, there is little evidence at the moment. Research on prevention and treatment in the pediatric age needs to be developed to improve the available recommendations.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enfcli.2020.05.005,20200101.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17

En esta situación, el personal sanitario está viviendo altos niveles de estrés por la sobrecarga de trabajo y las condiciones de este. El objetivo del presente estudio fue evaluar los factores que pueden desestabilizar la salud mental de dichos profesionales en nuestro contexto. Materiales y métodos La muestra estuvo compuesta por 421 profesionales de la salud. Los datos se recogieron mediante un cuestionario online que se les envió a través del correo electrónico. Se empleó el DASS-21 para evaluar las variables de ansiedad, estrés y depresión, y la EAI para medir las dificultades con el sueño. Además, se recogieron otras variables descriptivas de la muestra que podrían estar relacionadas con estos niveles de sintomatología psicológica. Resultados Los resultados muestran que la pandemia de la COVID-19ha generado entre el personal sanitario síntomas de estrés, ansiedad, depresión e insomnio, con mayores niveles entre las mujeres y profesionales de más edad. Variables como haber estado en contacto con el virus o el miedo en el trabajo desencadenaron una mayor sintomatología. Conclusiones En esta situación crítica, el colectivo de profesionales se sitúa en primera línea, por lo que está expuesto directamente determinados riesgos y estresores. Esto contribuye a que desarrollen sintomatología psicológica diversa. Consecuentemente, se recomienda ofrecerles ayuda psicológica para reducir el impacto emocional del COVID-19 y asegurar así no solo su salud mental, sino también el adecuado cuidado que dispensan. Introduction After the outbreak of the COVID-19 was considered a global pandemic in March 2020, the state of alarm was declared in Spain. In this situation, health professionals are experiencing high levels of stress due to the overload of work the pandemic is generating and the conditions in which they are working. The aim of this study was to evaluate the factors that can destabilize the mental health of these professionals in our context. Materials and methods The sample was composed of 421 health professionals. The data were gathered by an online questionnaire sent to them by e-mail. The DASS-21 was used to assess anxiety, stress and depression, and the EAI to measure sleep difficulties. In addition, other descriptive variables that could be related to psychological symptomatology were collected from the sample. Results The results show that the COVID-19 pandemic has generated symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression and insomnia among health workers, with higher levels among women and older professionals. Some factors such as having been in contact with the virus or fear at work, triggered greater symptomatology. Conclusions In this critical situation, professionals are in the front line and therefore, are directly exposed to certain risks and stressors. This contributes to the development of diverse psychological symptoms. Consequently, it is recommended to offer them psychological help in order to reduce the emotional impact of the COVID-19, and thus, to ensure not only the mental health of our health professionals, but also the adequate care they provide.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rpsm.2020.05.004,20200101.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
166,"48th SME North American manufacturing research conference, NAMRC 48 (Cancelled due to COVID-19) influence of 3D topography on tribological behavior of grinding wheel","Grinding is extensively used as surface generation process in finishing operations, which makes it imperative that the generated surface adheres closely to strict quality check norms failing which the component will be rejected incurring a loss to the industry. To ensure the intended surface quality falls within tolerances, the grinding wheel plays an important role as an abrasive tool. The finished surface is a direct outcome of grinding wheel topography and its various microscopic interactions with the surface creating a compelling need for in-depth understanding. Study and characterization of grinding wheel topography in the present paper aim to understand the behavior of forces in the contact area. Due to stochastic abrasive grain distribution and quasi-static surface wear, 3-dimensional parameters hold a better physical significance in explaining the nature of microscopic interactions and their impact on the behavior of forces. Experiments are performed in a manner to wear out grinding wheels of the same specification with varying number of passes in an attempt to highlight the influence of varying topography on tribological interactions in the grind zone. The variation in topography at a specific interval of time is captured using a confocal laser scanning microscope and further processed for surface characterization whereas forces are captured using a dynamometer. SEM micrographs are presented to understand the type of wear on the wheel surface. The outcome of present paper enables to understand and report the surface interactions quantified in terms of cutting, ploughing and rubbing whereas surface parameters are characterized as per ISO 25178. The reasoning behind variations during surface interactions was discussed and interpretations were reported.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.080,20200101.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
167,Mechanisms of COVID-19 Mental Health Burden,"New Zealand's COVID-19 lockdown in March and April 2020 was among the world's most stringent. Similar to other countries, New Zealand's lockdown occurred amidst pervasive health and economic uncertainties. However, New Zealanders experienced comparatively less psychological distress. To test theories of pandemic distress mitigation, we use national longitudinal responses with pre-COVID-19 baselines and systematically quantify psychological distress trajectories within the same individuals during the lockdown (pre-COVID-19 = 2018/2019; stringent-lockdown = March/April 2020; N = 940). Most distress indicators were minimally elevated. However, there was a three-fold increase in feelings of worthlessness. Neither satisfaction with the government, nor business-satisfaction, nor a sense of neighbourhood community were effective distress defences. Perceived social-belonging and health-satisfaction mitigated feelings of worthlessness. A silver lining was a relief from feelings of effort, which social-belonging fostered. That social-belonging and health satisfaction could quell serious distress among those low in government confidence, low in business satisfaction, and low neighbourhood community proves that distress mitigation is possible without shifting a population's general political, economic, and civic attitudes. Protection of income and containment of infectious disease threat reduces mental health burdens. Though feelings of worthlessness surge during lockdown, such feelings attenuate from interpersonal belonging with people one already knows.",Joseph Bulbulia et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46163-B20-33A,20200623.0,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods|Statistical Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Individual Differences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; employment; brms; kessler-6; glmm; bayesian; ordinal; stan; anxiety; longitudinal; covid-19; mental health,PsyArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
168,Decision making and mental health across adulthood during social distancing,"Covid-19-related social-distancing measures have dramatically limited physical social contact between individuals of all ages. We wondered how these new societal conditions would impact the choices of individuals of different ages and if social distancing measures would have a differential emotional impact on older individuals. Early media reports suggested that older adults were more likely to ignore social distancing guidelines. We conducted two online studies to examine temporal discounting of monetary, health, and social rewards, COVID-19 beliefs, social distancing behaviors, and mental health symptoms. We used the initial study (N = 233) to form our hypotheses about social distancing behaviors and we ran the second, pre-registered study (N = 243) to determine if these relationships replicated. We found that although older adults were more likely to prefer smaller, sooner (i.e., temporal discount) social and health-related rewards in decision-making tasks, there were no adult age differences in social distancing behavior. The increased motivation for immediate social contact in older age appears to be balanced by a similarly increased motivation for physical health. Although older adults reported being more likely to contract Covid-19 and experience more severe health consequences, they experienced fewer overall Covid-19-related mental health symptoms compared to younger adults. These data contradict media anecdotes and suggest that older adults are not only similarly compliant with distancing guidelines, but also are faring relatively better emotionally during the pandemic while overall mental health issues are higher than normal in the population.",Kendra Leigh Seaman et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46008-064-E80,20200717.0,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Judgment and Decision Making; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; social distancing; covid-19; temporal discounting; mental health; aging,PsyArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
169,Longitudinal changes in mental health and the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from the UK Household Longitudinal Study,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has had a range of negative social and economic effects that may contribute to a rise in mental health problems. In this observational population-based study, we examined longitudinal changes in the prevalence of mental health problems from before to during the COVID-19 crisis and identified subgroups that are psychologically vulnerable during the pandemic. Methods Participants (N =14,393; Observations =48,486) were adults drawn from wave 9 (2017-2019) of the nationally representative United Kingdom Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS) and followed-up across three waves of assessment in April, May, and June, 2020. Mental health problems were assessed using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Results The population prevalence of mental health problems (GHQ-12 score =3) increased by 13.5 percentage points from 24.3% in 2017-2019 to 37.8% in April, 2020 and remained elevated in May (34.7%) and June (31.9%), 2020. All sociodemographic groups examined showed statistically significant increases in mental health problems in April, 2020. The increase was largest among those aged 18-34 years (18.6 percentage points, 95% CI [14.3%-22.9%]), followed by females and high income and education groups. Levels of mental health problems subsequently declined between April and June, 2020 but remained significantly above pre-COVID-19 levels. Additional analyses showed that the rise in mental health problems observed throughout the COVID-19 pandemic was unlikely to be due to seasonality or year-to-year variation.

170,Cognitive Reappraisal and Self-Compassion as Emotion Regulation Strategies for Parents during COVID-19: An online RCT,"Objective. Parenting during pandemic restrictions places extreme demands on everyday family life, leading to increased stress levels for parents and distressed parent-child interactions. The goal of this RCT study was to investigate whether cognitive reappraisal and self-compassion are helpful emotion regulation (ER) strategies to reduce individual and parental stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method. An online intervention for parents was developed focusing on the application of ER strategies to pandemic requirements of families. N = 265 participants were randomly assigned to either cognitive reappraisal (CR; n = 88), self-compassion (SC; n = 90) or wait-list control (WLC; n = 87) group. Interventions included two video sessions (day 1 and day 3) and three email reminders to transfer the application of ER strategies to daily family life (days 2, 4, 5). Parents’ perceived individual stress and parental stress were assessed at baseline (T0), at T1 prior to the booster session, and at T2 (7 days after baseline). Results. Significant decreases from T0 to T2 emerged for both primary stress outcomes in both intervention groups. Individual stress significantly decreased in CR compared to WLC at T2. No time × group interactions for parental stress were found. However, mediation analyses suggested that parental stress was indirectly decreased via reductions in individual stress for CR compared to WLC at both time points. Conclusions. COVID-19 will not be the last pandemic to affect family life.

Results from a large multi-country online survey (N=8,229) showed average elevated levels of anxiety and depression (especially in the USA, UK, and Brazil), associated with feelings of low control and social isolation. Although social isolation increased with the duration of quarantine, it was mitigated by frequent communication with close others. Other mitigating factors include adaptive but not maladaptive coping, and the perception and trust that one’s government is dealing with the outbreak. Taking individual actions to avoid contracting the virus were associated with higher anxiety, except when done professionally by essential workers. We suggest that the psychological detrimental effects of lockdown can be alleviated by maintaining frequent social contact, adaptive coping, and governmental actions which show capability, benevolence, and integrity in managing a public health crisis.",Valerie Van Mulukom et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4617A-B65-F7C,20200722.0,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; government; sense of control; psychological well-being; lockdown; quarantine; anxiety; covid-19; survey; psychology; coronavirus; social isolation; depression; mental health,PsyArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
172,Exposure to COVID-19 Pandemic Stress: Associations with Depression and Anxiety in Emerging Adults in the US,"Background: Stressful events due to the COVID-19 pandemic are likely to have profound effects on mental health, and validated methods for assessing these experiences and associations with psychopathology are needed. We developed the Pandemic Stress Questionnaire (PSQ) and tested its psychometric properties, characterized experiences in emerging adults, and examined associations with internalizing symptoms. Methods: Emerging adults (N=450) completed the PSQ and measures of internalizing symptoms and perceived stress through an online platform in May 2020. One month later, 288 participants completed a follow-up questionnaire to assess reliability of the PSQ and longitudinal associations between stress and internalizing symptoms. Results: Results supported the validity/reliability of the PSQ and indicated that stressful events were highly prevalent in May, particularly among younger, female, and Black emerging adults. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were high overall, but decreased at the follow-up assessment. Pandemic-related stress was moderately associated with both depression and anxiety at each assessment, but baseline stress did not predict change in symptoms when controlling for baseline symptoms. Conclusions: Results provide empirical evidence that emerging adults are at high risk for depression and anxiety related to the psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and highlight specific types of experiences associated with greatest risk. Further, this study provides support for a questionnaire measure of experiences related to the COVID-19 pandemic that can be applied in future work to advance understanding of risk and resilience in response to stressful events.",Autumn Kujawa et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4614D-D78-F8E,20200629.0,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; coronavirus; young adult; pandemics; depression; anxiety,PsyArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17

Here, we explore if disordered social media use promotes fear of COVID-19, which in turn increases stress and depression in users. The study also explores several risk and protective factors that may affect the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and stress and depression. There were 174 participants that completed an online survey that measured disordered social media use, fear of COVID-19, perceived stress, and depression symptomatology. We found that disordered social media use predicts perceived stress indirectly through fear of COVID-19. Disordered social media use had a direct relationship with depression scores and this relationship is mediated by fear of COVID-19. We also found that the positive relationship between fear of COVID-19 and perceived stress is stronger for older people than younger people.

Using open and axial coding, we identified N=1902 thematic units (M=2.64, SD=.701) and 14 thematic categories, including mental health, physical health, family, friends, social connection and community, academics, missing important events, socioeconomic, routine, COVID rules and adjustment (e.g., social distancing), contraction/exposure to COVID, technology (e.g., screen time), and future plans. Adolescents most commonly reported challenges related to academics (23.7%), but also cited high numbers of challenges in mental (14.8%) and physical health (13.2%), and friend (11.4%) domains.

175,"Social isolation, mental health, and use of digital interventions in youth during the COVID-19 pandemic: a nationally representative survey","Summary Background: Public health measures to curb SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates may have negative psychosocial consequences in youth. Digital interventions may help to mitigate these effects. We investigated the associations between social isolation, cognitive preoccupation, worries, and anxiety, objective social risk indicators, psychological distress as well as use of, and attitude towards, mobile health (mHealth) interventions in youth during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Data were collected as part of the ‘Mental Health And Innovation During COVID-19 Survey’ —a cross-sectional panel study including a representative sample of individuals aged 16 to 25 years (N=666; Mage 21·3) (assessment period: 07.05.-16.05.2020). Outcomes: Overall, 38% of youth met criteria for moderate psychological distress and 30% felt ‘often’ or ‘very often’ socially isolated, even after most restrictive infection control measures had been lifted. Social isolation, COVID-19-related worries and anxiety, and objective risk indicators were associated with psychological distress, with evidence of dose-response relationships for some of these associations. For instance, psychological distress was progressively more likely to occur as levels of social isolation increased (reporting ‘never’ as reference group: ‘occasionally’: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 9·1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4·3 – 19·1, p<0·001; ‘often’: aOR 22·2, CI 9·8 – 50·2, p<0·001;’very often’: aOR 42·3, CI 14·1 – 126·8, p<0·001). There was evidence that psychological distress, worries, and anxiety were associated with a positive attitude towards using digital interventions, whereas high levels of psychological distress, worries, and anxiety were associated with actual use.

176,“My Husband Thinks I’m Crazy”: COVID-19-Related Conflict in Couples with Young Children,"Objective: We examine how disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic are creating conflicts for couples with young children. Background: National polls suggest that COVID-19 has led to increased conflict for couples in the U.S. Although scholars have not examined the source of these new conflicts, pre-pandemic research suggests that pandemic-related disruptions may create conflicts around paid work and parenting, economic security, politics, and health decision-making. Method: This study uses the Pandemic Parenting Study, a mixed-methods study of Southern Indiana mothers, conducted April-May 2020, and involving surveys (N=139), diary entries (N=104), and in-depth interviews (N=65). We examine mothers’ reports of pandemic-related changes in their frustrations with their partners and how those changes vary with the disruptions couples have experienced during the pandemic. We then use qualitative data to understand how pandemic-related disruptions are generating conflicts for couples and what consequences those conflicts have. Results: A substantial minority of mothers (39%) report pandemic-related increases in their frustrations with their partners. These frustrations are particularly common among mothers whose partners are (reportedly) providing insufficient support with pandemic parenting or dismissing mothers’ concerns about COVID-19. Mothers blame themselves for these conflicts and feel responsible for reducing them, including by leaving the workforce, beginning use of antidepressants, or ignoring their own concerns about COVID-19. Conclusion: The pandemic has exacerbated longstanding sources of conflict (related to partners’ insufficient support with parenting) and created new sources of conflict (related to partners’ dismissals of mothers’ concerns about COVID-19), with serious implications for mothers, families, and public health.",Jessica Mccrory Calarco et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46176-680-C96,20201009.0,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family; relationships; work-family; family; conflict; health; decision-making; covid-19; parenthood,SocArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
177,In Case You Haven't Heard…,"Thirty-five percent of workers who telecommute said their mental health had deteriorated as a result of doing so amid the COVID-19 lockdown, according to a survey conducted by researchers at Keio University in Tokyo, among other institutions, Fox Business reported April 13. The survey was conducted online March 26–28, involving 8,475 employees — including nonregular workers — aged 20 to 64. Of the 21% of respondents who said they work from home, one-half of them did so in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Among the telecommuters, 50.7% said it had no impact on their mental health, and 14.3% said their mental health had improved. Of the respondents who said doing telework had worsened their mental state, 41.3% said it was difficult to separate their work and personal lives, followed by 39.9% who said they weren't able to exercise enough and 39.7% who said they had difficulty communicating with co-workers. Professor Isamu Yamamoto of the Keio University Faculty of Business and Commerce, who conducted the survey, said: “There is a risk that working hours will get longer if the boundaries between work and personal life become blurred. It is necessary to establish a rigid system in which work can be carried out in a planned manner, such as by setting working hours and the timing of contact with supervisors.”",,https://doi.org/10.1002/mhw.32333,20200417.0,,PMC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17

179,"Le confinement généralisé pendant l’épidémie de Coronavirus: Conséquences médico-psychologiques en populations générales, soignantes, et de sujets souffrant antérieurement de troubles psychiques","Background. – The situation we are currently experiencing is unprecedented. Declaring a state of health emergency in order to curb a frightening epidemic, the authorities have decreed the home confinement of the majority of the population of our country for several weeks. In a few days, innumerable questions arise for very diverse spaces: epidemiological, immunological, sociological, information scientists, medical, administrative, political, etc. Objective. – We propose a reflection intended to describe the psychological risks, to clarify the disorders found and, to discuss the means to take care of them in the duration. Material and methods. – We base our thinking on a review of the literature confronted with our current clinical experience, including concerning the possibilities of dematerialized medico-psychological monitoring. Results. – We recall the collective repercussions of emerging lethal mass risks, and in particular viral infectious agents, before approaching the existing scientific models of collective confinement according to military operations in hostile zones, polar wintering missions and aerospace conquest. It appears that for the study of a global containment, somewhat studied during previous pandemics, the conceptions of stress reaction and psychodynamic adaptation prove to be relevant. We detail the psychological consequences of confinement on individual mental health and their countermeasures according to three population typologies: general population, population of caregivers on the front line against the epidemic, and population of subjects already suffering from mental illness or seeing their disorders reappear. We also refer to works in social cognitive psychology explaining how, in an anxiety-provoking situation, reasoning can be biased and lead to choices that ultimately prove to be not very rational, in the opinion of those who made them. The current situation in the health sector is favorable in this, as evidenced by the ""debate on chloroquine"" widely reported in the media and on social networks, opposing conclusions most often decided on the basis of beliefs on contrary to evidence based medicine. Discussion. – The psychological repercussions of confinement appear conditioned by the multiple forms that it can take: voluntary or suffered, more or less prolonged, spent at home or in another place, lived in individual isolation or in a small community, associated other stressors and/or traumatic factors, etc. The home confinement of a population across a country has never been assessed. This experience seems to us to confront our society as a whole with the taboo of death which is imposed, death more and more evaded as the ""Western man"" tries to move away from his terrestrial origins. In this sense, psychotraumatic type repercussions are to be prevented. In order to face multiple challenges, the healthcare system has adapted with, in particular, the development of the use of the Internet for the provision of information intended to better experience confinement, or even the generalization of psychotherapy remotely asking as many questions as it provides answers. These intricacies of computer techniques in the area of psychotherapy, techniques with which we had some mistrust, became established as quickly as the virus: the task of clinicians and researchers to measure the issues and the consequences. Conclusion. – Public health programs could emerge on the model of those already existing in order to manage well-known chronic endemic disorders: protection against the effects of an unbalanced diet associated with a sedentary lifestyle, fight against smoking and alcoholism, prevention of self-aggressive behavior, etc. We will also need to support the caregivers who have been on the front line and who will emerge tested from this pandemic: will depend on the sustainability of the action capacities of our healthcare system to return to its nominal state and also perhaps, so that it can face other crises, especially social ones.","Auxéméry, Yann; Tarquinio, Cyril",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2020.06.001,20200605.0,,PMC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17

In a data brief released last month, the OIG notes that people with opioid use disorder (OUD) could be particularly hard hit by COVID-19, because of increased risk of respiratory disease, and that most Medicare beneficiaries at serious risk of opioid misuse or overdose in 2017 received high amounts of opioids the following year. However, only a quarter received a prescription for naloxone, which reverses opioid overdoses. In addition, only 7% of beneficiaries who were at serious risk in 2017 who were diagnosed with an OUD received a medication-assisted treatment drug, “possibly because of challenges that beneficiaries have in accessing prescribers.” For the policy brief, go to https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-02-19-00130.asp.",,https://doi.org/10.1002/adaw.32741,20200529.0,,PMC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17

Especially, medical appliances, medical implants and surgical operation tools for brain and bone invariably need small diameter-deep hole drilling for hard-to-machine metals such as stainless steel and Ti6Al4V. The authors newly designed and manufactured a small diameter-deep hole drilling machine by applying technological developments which consist of a direct drive servo spindle motor controlled more precisely, removable steady rests to prevent for a slender fluted hollow shaft of gun drill to be deflected and a highly pressure circulation system of cutting fluid to prevent being clogged with chips. By using the small diameter-deep hole drilling machine and a special gun drill (specially made to order in BOTEK) a drilling of <U+03D5>1.0×400 mm (L/D=400) for Ti6Al4V was carried out. As a result, it was ascertained that the drilled hole has high accuracy in the items of hole diameter, concentricity, roundness and inner surface roughness.","Inada, Hidenori; Inada, Hiroshi; Yagishita, H.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.066,20201231.0,,Elsevier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17

184,"A Key, Not a Straitjacket: The Case for Interim Mental Health Legislation Pending Complete Prohibition of Psychiatric Coercion in Accordance with the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities","The practice of coercion on the basis of psychosocial disability is plainly discriminatory. This has resulted in a demand from the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (the CRPD Committee) for a paradigm shift away from the traditional biomedical model and a global ban on compulsion in the psychiatric context. However, that has not occurred. This paper considers conflicting pronouncements of the CRPD Committee and other United Nations bodies. Assuming the former’s interpretations of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disability (CRPD) are accurate, involuntary psychiatric detention and enforced treatment on the basis of psychosocial disability are prima facie discriminatory and unlawful practices. However, dedicated mental health legislation both permits discrimination and protects and enhances rights. This paper proposes a practical way out of the present impasse: the global introduction of interim “holding” legislation lacking full compliance with the CRPD. While imperfect, such a framework would facilitate a move toward a complete ban on psychiatric coercion. The paper outlines four essential ingredients that any interim legislation ought to contain, including clear timebound targets for full CRPD implementation. It concludes by urging the CRPD Committee to take the unprecedented step of issuing a general comment providing reluctant “permission” for the progressive realization of respect for articles 12 and 14 of the CRPD.","Davidson, Laura",https://doi.org/nan,20200621.0,,PMC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17

186,Depression Detection with Multi-Modalities Using a Hybrid Deep Learning Model on Social Media,"Social networks enable people to interact with one another by sharing information, sending messages, making friends, and having discussions, which generates massive amounts of data every day, popularly called as the user-generated content. This data is present in various forms such as images, text, videos, links, and others and reflects user behaviours including their mental states. It is challenging yet promising to automatically detect mental health problems from such data which is short, sparse and sometimes poorly phrased. However, there are efforts to automatically learn patterns using computational models on such user-generated content. While many previous works have largely studied the problem on a small-scale by assuming uni-modality of data which may not give us faithful results, we propose a novel scalable hybrid model that combines Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (BiGRUs) and Convolutional Neural Networks to detect depressed users on social media such as Twitter-based on multi-modal features. Specifically, we encode words in user posts using pre-trained word embeddings and BiGRUs to capture latent behavioural patterns, long-term dependencies, and correlation across the modalities, including semantic sequence features from the user timelines (posts). The CNN model then helps learn useful features. Our experiments show that our model outperforms several popular and strong baseline methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining deep learning with multi-modal features. We also show that our model helps improve predictive performance when detecting depression in users who are posting messages publicly on social media.","Zogan, Hamad; Wang, Xianzhi; Jameel, Shoaib; Xu, Guandong",https://doi.org/nan,20200703.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
187,How Does COVID-19 impact Students with Disabilities/Health Concerns?,"The impact of COVID-19 on students has been enormous, with an increase in worries about fiscal and physical health, a rapid shift to online learning, and increased isolation. In addition to these changes, students with disabilities/health concerns may face accessibility problems with online learning or communication tools, and their stress may be compounded by additional risks such as financial stress or pre-existing conditions. To our knowledge, no one has looked specifically at the impact of COVID-19 on students with disabilities/health concerns. In this paper, we present data from a survey of 147 students with and without disabilities collected in late March to early April of 2020 to assess the impact of COVID-19 on these students' education and mental health. Our findings show that students with disabilities/health concerns were more concerned about classes going online than their peers without disabilities. In addition, students with disabilities/health concerns also reported that they have experienced more COVID-19 related adversities compared to their peers without disabilities/health concerns. We argue that students with disabilities/health concerns in higher education need confidence in the accessibility of the online learning tools that are becoming increasingly prevalent in higher education not only because of COVID-19 but also more generally. In addition, educational technologies will be more accessible if they consider the learning context, and are designed to provide a supportive, calm, and connecting learning environment.","Zhang, Han; Nurius, Paula; Sefidgar, Yasaman; Morris, Margaret; Balasubramanian, Sreenithi; Brown, Jennifer; Dey, Anind K.; Kuehn, Kevin; Riskin, Eve; Xu, Xuhai; Mankoff, Jen",https://doi.org/nan,20200511.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17

However, its influence on people's mental health conditions has not received as much attention. To study this subject, we choose social media as our main data resource and create by far the largest English Twitter depression dataset containing 2,575 distinct identified depression users with their past tweets. To examine the effect of depression on people's Twitter language, we train three transformer-based depression classification models on the dataset, evaluate their performance with progressively increased training sizes, and compare the model's""tweet chunk""-level and user-level performances. Furthermore, inspired by psychological studies, we create a fusion classifier that combines deep learning model scores with psychological text features and users' demographic information and investigate these features' relations to depression signals. Finally, we demonstrate our model's capability of monitoring both group-level and population-level depression trends by presenting two of its applications during the COVID-19 pandemic. We hope this study can raise awareness among researchers and the general public of COVID-19's impact on people's mental health.","Zhang, Yipeng; Lyu, Hanjia; Liu, Yubao; Zhang, Xiyang; Wang, Yu; Luo, Jiebo",https://doi.org/nan,20200701.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
189,Examination of community sentiment dynamics due to covid-19 pandemic: a case study from Australia,"The outbreak of the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused unprecedented impacts to people's daily life around the world. Various measures and policies such as lock-down and social-distancing are implemented by governments to combat the disease during the pandemic period. These measures and policies as well as virus itself may cause different mental health issues to people such as depression, anxiety, sadness, etc. In this paper, we exploit the massive text data posted by Twitter users to analyse the sentiment dynamics of people living in the state of New South Wales (NSW) in Australia during the pandemic period. Different from the existing work that mostly focuses the country-level and static sentiment analysis, we analyse the sentiment dynamics at the fine-grained local government areas (LGAs). Based on the analysis of around 94 million tweets that posted by around 183 thousand users located at different LGAs in NSW in five months, we found that people in NSW showed an overall positive sentimental polarity and the COVID-19 pandemic decreased the overall positive sentimental polarity during the pandemic period. The fine-grained analysis of sentiment in LGAs found that despite the dominant positive sentiment most of days during the study period, some LGAs experienced significant sentiment changes from positive to negative. This study also analysed the sentimental dynamics delivered by the hot topics in Twitter such as government policies (e.g. the Australia's JobKeeper program, lock-down, social-distancing) as well as the focused social events (e.g. the Ruby Princess Cruise). The results showed that the policies and events did affect people's overall sentiment, and they affected people's overall sentiment differently at different stages.","Zhou, Jianlong; Yang, Shuiqiao; Xiao, Chun; Chen, Fang",https://doi.org/nan,20200622.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
190,Detecting Community Depression Dynamics Due to COVID-19 Pandemic in Australia,"The recent COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented impact across the globe. We have also witnessed millions of people with increased mental health issues, such as depression, stress, worry, fear, disgust, sadness, and anxiety, which have become one of the major public health concerns during this severe health crisis. For instance, depression is one of the most common mental health issues according to the findings made by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Depression can cause serious emotional, behavioural and physical health problems with significant consequences, both personal and social costs included. This paper studies community depression dynamics due to COVID-19 pandemic through user-generated content on Twitter. A new approach based on multi-modal features from tweets and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is proposed to build depression classification models. Multi-modal features capture depression cues from emotion, topic and domain-specific perspectives. We study the problem using recently scraped tweets from Twitter users emanating from the state of New South Wales in Australia. Our novel classification model is capable of extracting depression polarities which may be affected by COVID-19 and related events during the COVID-19 period. The results found that people became more depressed after the outbreak of COVID-19. The measures implemented by the government such as the state lockdown also increased depression levels. Further analysis in the Local Government Area (LGA) level found that the community depression level was different across different LGAs. Such granular level analysis of depression dynamics not only can help authorities such as governmental departments to take corresponding actions more objectively in specific regions if necessary but also allows users to perceive the dynamics of depression over the time.","Zhou, Jianlong; Zogan, Hamad; Yang, Shuiqiao; Jameel, Shoaib; Xu, Guandong; Chen, Fang",https://doi.org/nan,20200705.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
191,"Robot art, in the eye of the beholder?: Personalization through self-disclosure facilitates visual communication of emotions in representational art","Socially assistive robots could help to support people's well-being in contexts such as art therapy where human therapists are scarce, by making art such as paintings together with people in a way that is emotionally contingent and creative. However, current art-making robots are typically either contingent, controlled as a tool by a human artist, or creative, programmed to paint independently, possibly because some complex and idiosyncratic concepts related to art, such as emotion and creativity, are not yet well understood. For example, the role of personalized taste in forming beauty evaluations has been studied in empirical aesthetics, but how to generate art that appears to an individual to express certain emotions such as happiness or sadness is less clear. In the current article, a collaborative prototyping/Wizard of Oz approach was used to explore generic robot art-making strategies and personalization of art via an open-ended emotion profile intended to identify tricky concepts. As a result of conducting an exploratory user study, participants indicated some preference for a robot art-making strategy involving""visual metaphors""to balance exogenous and endogenous components, and personalized representational sketches were reported to convey emotion more clearly than generic sketches. The article closes by discussing personalized abstract art as well as suggestions for richer art-making strategies and user models. Thus, the main conceptual advance of the current work lies in suggesting how an interactive robot can visually express emotions through personalized art; the general aim is that this could help to inform next steps in this promising area and facilitate technological acceptance of robots in everyday human environments.","Cooney, Martin",https://doi.org/nan,20200508.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17

Besides direct physical and economic threats, the pandemic also indirectly impact people's mental health conditions, which can be overwhelming but difficult to measure. The problem may come from various reasons such as unemployment status, stay-at-home policy, fear for the virus, and so forth. In this work, we focus on applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze tweets in terms of mental health. We trained deep models that classify each tweet into the following emotions: anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise and trust. We build the EmoCT (Emotion-Covid19-Tweet) dataset for the training purpose by manually labeling 1,000 English tweets. Furthermore, we propose and compare two methods to find out the reasons that are causing sadness and fear.","Li, Irene; Li, Yixin; Li, Tianxiao; Alvarez-Napagao, Sergio; Garcia-Gasulla, Dario; Suzumura, Toyotaro",https://doi.org/nan,20200422.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17

We analyze 4 million Twitter messages related to the COVID-19 pandemic using a list of 25 hashtags such as""coronavirus,""""COVID-19,""""quarantine""from March 1 to April 21 in 2020. We use a machine learning approach, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to identify popular unigram, bigrams, salient topics and themes, and sentiments in the collected Tweets. Popular unigrams include""virus,""""lockdown,""and""quarantine.""Popular bigrams include""COVID-19,""""stay home,""""corona virus,""""social distancing,""and""new cases.""We identify 13 discussion topics and categorize them into five different themes, such as""public health measures to slow the spread of COVID-19,""""social stigma associated with COVID-19,""""coronavirus news cases and deaths,""""COVID-19 in the United States,""and""coronavirus cases in the rest of the world"". Across all identified topics, the dominant sentiments for the spread of coronavirus are anticipation that measures that can be taken, followed by a mixed feeling of trust, anger, and fear for different topics. The public reveals a significant feeling of fear when they discuss the coronavirus new cases and deaths than other topics. The study shows that Twitter data and machine learning approaches can be leveraged for infodemiology study by studying the evolving public discussions and sentiments during the COVID-19. Real-time monitoring and assessment of the Twitter discussion and concerns can be promising for public health emergency responses and planning. Already emerged pandemic fear, stigma, and mental health concerns may continue to influence public trust when there occurs a second wave of COVID-19 or a new surge of the imminent pandemic.","Xue, Jia; Chen, Junxiang; Hu, Ran; Chen, Chen; Zheng, ChengDa; Liu, Xiaoqian; Zhu, Tingshao",https://doi.org/nan,20200526.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
194,Detecting Topic and Sentiment Dynamics Due to COVID-19 Pandemic Using Social Media,"The outbreak of the novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) has greatly influenced people's daily lives across the globe. Emergent measures and policies (e.g., lockdown, social distancing) have been taken by governments to combat this highly infectious disease. However, people's mental health is also at risk due to the long-time strict social isolation rules. Hence, monitoring people's mental health across various events and topics will be extremely necessary for policy makers to make the appropriate decisions. On the other hand, social media have been widely used as an outlet for people to publish and share their personal opinions and feelings. The large scale social media posts (e.g., tweets) provide an ideal data source to infer the mental health for people during this pandemic period. In this work, we propose a novel framework to analyze the topic and sentiment dynamics due to COVID-19 from the massive social media posts. Based on a collection of 13 million tweets related to COVID-19 over two weeks, we found that the positive sentiment shows higher ratio than the negative sentiment during the study period. When zooming into the topic-level analysis, we find that different aspects of COVID-19 have been constantly discussed and show comparable sentiment polarities. Some topics like ``stay safe home""are dominated with positive sentiment. The others such as ``people death""are consistently showing negative sentiment. Overall, the proposed framework shows insightful findings based on the analysis of the topic-level sentiment dynamics.","Yin, Hui; Yang, Shuiqiao; Li, Jianxin",https://doi.org/nan,20200705.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
195,Keynesian models of depression Supply shocks and the COVID-19 Crisis,"The objective of this work is twofold: to expand the depression models proposed by Tobin and analyse a supply shock, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, in this Keynesian conceptual environment. The expansion allows us to propose the evolution of all endogenous macroeconomic variables. The result obtained is relevant due to its theoretical and practical implications. A quantity or Keynesian adjustment to the shock produces a depression through the effect on aggregate demand. This depression worsens in the medium/long-term. It is accompanied by increases in inflation, inflation expectations and the real interest rate. A stimulus tax policy is also recommended, as well as an active monetary policy to reduce real interest rates. On the other hand, the pricing or Marshallian adjustment foresees a more severe and rapid depression in the short-term. There would be a reduction in inflation and inflation expectations, and an increase in the real interest rates. The tax or monetary stimulus measures would only impact inflation. This result makes it possible to clarify and assess the resulting depression, as well as propose policies. Finally, it offers conflicting predictions that allow one of the two models to be falsified.","Romana, Ignacio Escanuela",https://doi.org/nan,20200711.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17

In the UK and Ireland, online community support initiatives (OCSIs) have emerged to help people manage their lives. Yet, little is known about how people engaged with these or whether they influenced subsequent mood. We conducted surveys to explore how people in the UK and Ireland engaged with OCSIs, and found that 70% did so to offer support (e.g. to provide company). Those who did so reported feeling significantly calmer afterwards, those who engaged for general concerns (e.g. in response to anti-social behaviour) reported feeling significantly more anxious afterwards, but there was no difference in reported mood for those who engaged for other reasons (e.g. to share experiences or views). Thus, engaging with an OCSI for altruistic purposes might help to make people feel calmer.","Elphick, Camilla; Stuart, Avelie; Philpot, Richard; Walkington, Zoe; Frumkin, Lara; Zhang, Min; Levine, Mark; Price, Blaine; Pike, Graham; Nuseibeh, Bashar; Bandara, Arosha",https://doi.org/nan,20200612.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
197,"Assessing the impact of the coronavirus lockdown on unhappiness, loneliness, and boredom using Google Trends","The COVID-19 pandemic has led many governments to implement lockdowns. While lockdowns may help to contain the spread of the virus, it is possible that substantial damage to population well-being will result. This study relies on Google Trends data and tests whether the lockdowns implemented in Europe and America led to changes in well-being related topic search terms. Using different methods to evaluate the causal effects of lockdown, we find a substantial increase in the search intensity for boredom in Europe and the US. We also found a significant increase in searches for loneliness, worry and sadness, while searches for stress, suicide and divorce on the contrary fell. Our results suggest that people's mental health may have been severely affected by the lockdown.","Brodeur, Abel; Clark, Andrew E.; Fleche, Sarah; Powdthavee, Nattavudh",https://doi.org/nan,20200425.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
198,A chatbot architecture for promoting youth resilience,"E-health technologies have the potential to provide scalable and accessible interventions for youth mental health. As part of a developing an ecosystem of e-screening and e-therapy tools for New Zealand young people, a dialog agent, Headstrong, has been designed to promote resilience with methods grounded in cognitive behavioral therapy and positive psychology. This paper describes the architecture underlying the chatbot. The architecture supports a range of over 20 activities delivered in a 4-week program by relatable personas. The architecture provides a visual authoring interface to its content management system. In addition to supporting the original adolescent resilience chatbot, the architecture has been reused to create a 3-week 'stress-detox' intervention for undergraduates, and subsequently for a chatbot to support young people with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, with all three systems having been used in field trials. The Headstrong architecture illustrates the feasibility of creating a domain-focused authoring environment in the context of e-therapy that supports non-technical expert input and rapid deployment.","Holt-Quick, Chester; Warren, Jim; Stasiak, Karolina; Williams, Ruth; Christie, Grant; Hetrick, Sarah; Hopkins, Sarah; Cargo, Tania; Merry, Sally",https://doi.org/nan,20200515.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
199,"A Survey of State-of-the-Art on Blockchains: Theories, Modelings, and Tools","To draw a roadmap of current research activities of the blockchain community, we first conduct a brief overview of state-of-the-art blockchain surveys published in the recent 5 years. We found that those surveys are basically studying the blockchain-based applications, such as blockchain-assisted Internet of Things (IoT), business applications, security-enabled solutions, and many other applications in diverse fields. However, we think that a comprehensive survey towards the essentials of blockchains by exploiting the state-of-the-art theoretical modelings, analytic models, and useful experiment tools is still missing. To fill this gap, we perform a thorough survey by identifying and classifying the most recent high-quality research outputs that are closely related to the theoretical findings and essential mechanisms of blockchain systems and networks. Several promising open issues are also summarized finally for future research directions. We wish this survey can serve as a useful guideline for researchers, engineers, and educators about the cutting-edge development of blockchains in the perspectives of theories, modelings, and tools.","Huang, Huawei; Kong, Wei; Zhou, Sicong; Zheng, Zibin; Guo, Song",https://doi.org/nan,20200707.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
200,Visualising COVID-19 Research,"The world has seen in 2020 an unprecedented global outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, a new strain of coronavirus, causing the COVID-19 pandemic, and radically changing our lives and work conditions. Many scientists are working tirelessly to find a treatment and a possible vaccine. Furthermore, governments, scientific institutions and companies are acting quickly to make resources available, including funds and the opening of large-volume data repositories, to accelerate innovation and discovery aimed at solving this pandemic. In this paper, we develop a novel automated theme-based visualisation method, combining advanced data modelling of large corpora, information mapping and trend analysis, to provide a top-down and bottom-up browsing and search interface for quick discovery of topics and research resources. We apply this method on two recently released publications datasets (Dimensions' COVID-19 dataset and the Allen Institute for AI's CORD-19). The results reveal intriguing information including increased efforts in topics such as social distancing; cross-domain initiatives (e.g. mental health and education); evolving research in medical topics; and the unfolding trajectory of the virus in different territories through publications. The results also demonstrate the need to quickly and automatically enable search and browsing of large corpora. We believe our methodology will improve future large volume visualisation and discovery systems but also hope our visualisation interfaces will currently aid scientists, researchers, and the general public to tackle the numerous issues in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bras, Pierre Le; Gharavi, Azimeh; Robb, David A.; Vidal, Ana F.; Padilla, Stefano; Chantler, Mike J.",https://doi.org/nan,20200513.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17

Interaction with other players in virtual communities has been found to have a positive influence on the mental health of those suffering from a lack of societal connection. A framework for further research has also been developed that focuses on the critical situation of the COVID-19 lockdown,as this is an urgent topic with a huge impact on our health.Some gaming service providers have been proactive in redesigning game programming to be suitable for the lockdown situation, and this enables players to enjoy physical activities even at home.","Oe, Hiroko",https://doi.org/nan,20200501.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17

203,"Universal Masking is Urgent in the COVID-19 Pandemic: SEIR and Agent Based Models, Empirical Validation, Policy Recommendations","We present two models for the COVID-19 pandemic predicting the impact of universal face mask wearing upon the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus--one employing a stochastic dynamic network based compartmental SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) approach, and the other employing individual ABM (agent-based modelling) Monte Carlo simulation--indicating (1) significant impact under (near) universal masking when at least 80% of a population is wearing masks, versus minimal impact when only 50% or less of the population is wearing masks, and (2) significant impact when universal masking is adopted early, by Day 50 of a regional outbreak, versus minimal impact when universal masking is adopted late. These effects hold even at the lower filtering rates of homemade masks. To validate these theoretical models, we compare their predictions against a new empirical data set we have collected that includes whether regions have universal masking cultures or policies, their daily case growth rates, and their percentage reduction from peak daily case growth rates. Results show a near perfect correlation between early universal masking and successful suppression of daily case growth rates and/or reduction from peak daily case growth rates, as predicted by our theoretical simulations. Our theoretical and empirical results argue for urgent implementation of universal masking. As governments plan how to exit societal lockdowns, it is emerging as a key NPI; a""mouth-and-nose lockdown""is far more sustainable than a""full body lockdown"", on economic, social, and mental health axes. An interactive visualization of the ABM simulation is at http://dek.ai/masks4all. We recommend immediate mask wearing recommendations, official guidelines for correct use, and awareness campaigns to shift masking mindsets away from pure self-protection, towards aspirational goals of responsibly protecting one's community.","Kai, De; Goldstein, Guy-Philippe; Morgunov, Alexey; Nangalia, Vishal; Rotkirch, Anna",https://doi.org/nan,20200422.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17

The public anxiety has increased the psychological burden on government and healthcare professionals, resulting in a government worker suicide in Japan. The terrified people are asking the government for border measures. However, are border measures possible for this virus? By analyzing 48 almost complete virus genome sequences, we found out that the viruses that invaded Taiwan, the United States, and Japan were introduced independently. We identified thirteen parsimony-informative sites and three groups (CTC, TCC, and TCT). Viruses found outside China did not form a monophyletic clade, opposite to previous study. These results suggest the difficulty of implementing effective border measures against this virus.","Matsuda, Tomoko; Suzuki, Hikoyu; Ogata, Norichika",https://doi.org/nan,20200220.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
205,Global Data Science Project for COVID-19 Summary Report,"This paper aims at providing the summary of the Global Data Science Project (GDSC) for COVID-19. as on May 31 2020. COVID-19 has largely impacted on our societies through both direct and indirect effects transmitted by the policy measures to counter the spread of viruses. We quantitatively analysed the multifaceted impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our societies including people's mobility, health, and social behaviour changes. People's mobility has changed significantly due to the implementation of travel restriction and quarantine measurements. Indeed, the physical distance has widened at international (cross-border), national and regional level. At international level, due to the travel restrictions, the number of international flights has plunged overall at around 88 percent during March. In particular, the number of flights connecting Europe dropped drastically in mid of March after the United States announced travel restrictions to Europe and the EU and participating countries agreed to close borders, at 84 percent decline compared to March 10th. Similarly, we examined the impacts of quarantine measures in the major city: Tokyo (Japan), New York City (the United States), and Barcelona (Spain). Within all three cities, we found the significant decline in traffic volume. We also identified the increased concern for mental health through the analysis of posts on social networking services such as Twitter and Instagram. Notably, in the beginning of April 2020, the number of post with #depression on Instagram doubled, which might reflect the rise in mental health awareness among Instagram users. Besides, we identified the changes in a wide range of people's social behaviors, as well as economic impacts through the analysis of Instagram data and primary survey data.","Garcia-Gasulla, Dario; Napagao, Sergio Alvarez; Li, Irene; Maruyama, Hiroshi; Kanezashi, Hiroki; P'erez-Arnal, Raquel; Miyoshi, Kunihiko; Ishii, Euma; Suzuki, Keita; Shiba, Sayaka; Kurokawa, Mariko; Kanzawa, Yuta; Nakagawa, Naomi; Hanai, Masatoshi; Li, Yixin; Li, Tianxiao",https://doi.org/nan,20200610.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17

207,Gravity: a blockchain-agnostic cross-chain communication and data oracles protocol,"This paper intends to propose the architecture of a blockchain-agnostic protocol designed for communication of blockchains amongst each other (i.e. cross-chain), and for blockchains with the outside world (i.e. data oracles). The expansive growth of cutting-edge technology in the blockchain industry outlines the need and opportunity for addressing oracle consensus in a manner both technologically and economically efficient as well as futureproof. Blockchain-agnosticism is inherently limited if proposing a technological solution involves adding one more architectural layer. As such, Gravity protocol is designed to be a truly blockchain-agnostic protocol. By ensuring parity through direct integration and by leveraging the stability and security of the respective interconnected ecosystems, Gravity circumvents the need for a dedicated, public blockchain and a native token. Ultimately, Gravity protocol intends to address scalability challenges by providing a solid infrastructure for the creation of gateways, cross-chain applications, and sidechains. This paper introduces and defines the concept of Oracle Consensus and its implementation in the Gravity protocol named the Pulse Consensus algorithm. The proposed consensus architecture allows Gravity to be considered a singular decentralized blockchain-agnostic oracle.","Pupyshev, Aleksei; Gubanov, Dmitry; Dzhafarov, Elshan; Sapranidi, llya; Kardanov, Inal; Zhuravlev, Vladimir; Khalilov, Shamil; Jansen, Marc; Laureyssens, Sten; Pavlov, Igor; Ivanov, Sasha",https://doi.org/nan,20200702.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17

The impact could include missed visits, alternative methods for assessments (such as virtual visits), alternative locations for assessments (such as local labs), and study drug interruptions. We focus on safety planning for Phase 2-4 clinical trials and integrated summaries for submissions. Starting from the recommended safety analyses proposed in white papers and a workshop, created as part of an FDA/PHUSE collaboration (PHUSE 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019), we assess what modifications might be needed. Impact from COVID-19 will likely affect treatment arms equally, so analyses of adverse events from controlled data can, to a large extent, remain unchanged. However, interpretation of summaries from uncontrolled data (summaries that include open-label extension data) will require even more caution than usual. Special consideration will be needed for safety topics of interest, especially events expected to have a higher incidence due to a COVID-19 infection or due to quarantine or travel restrictions (e.g., depression).

In particular, when individuals self-report their experiences over the course of the virus on social media, it can allow for identification of the emotions each stage of symptoms engenders in the patient. Posts to the Reddit forum r/COVID19Positive contain first-hand accounts from COVID-19 positive patients, giving insight into personal struggles with the virus. These posts often feature a temporal structure indicating the number of days after developing symptoms the text refers to. Using topic modelling and sentiment analysis, we quantify the change in discussion of COVID-19 throughout individuals' experiences for the first 14 days since symptom onset. Discourse on early symptoms such as fever, cough, and sore throat was concentrated towards the beginning of the posts, while language indicating breathing issues peaked around ten days. Some conversation around critical cases was also identified and appeared at a roughly constant rate. We identified two clear clusters of positive and negative emotions associated with the evolution of these symptoms and mapped their relationships. Our results provide a perspective on the patient experience of COVID-19 that complements other medical data streams and can potentially reveal when mental health issues might appear.","Murray, Curtis; Mitchell, Lewis; Tuke, Jonathan; Mackay, Mark",https://doi.org/nan,20200521.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17

Designing appropriate interventions and identifying the concerns of those most at risk requires methods that can extract worries, concerns and emotional responses from text data. We examine gender differences and the effect of document length on worries about the ongoing COVID-19 situation. Our findings suggest that i) shorter texts do not offer an as adequate insight into psychological processes as longer texts. We further find ii) marked gender differences in topics concerning emotional responses. Women worried more about their loved ones and severe health concerns while men were more occupied with effects on the economy and society. The findings align with general gender differences in language found elsewhere, but the current unique circumstances likely amplified these effects.

213,How to deal with the negative psychological impact of COVID-19 for people who pay attention to anxiety and depression,"BACKGROUND: The fear of insecurity and uncertainty caused by 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the separation and loss of certain important relationships, and the great changes in lifestyle have awakened strong emotional response, which may cause psychological problems to the general population. However, there are few researches on how the people who pay attention to anxiety and depression coping with negative psychological during the epidemic or major disaster. This study aimed to identify what behaviors can effectively reduce negative emotions during the epidemic. METHODS: From February 1, to March 8 in 2020, we conducted a web-based survey and collected information on general demographic data. The probable depression, anxiety symptoms and coping behaviors was assessed by Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalized anxiety disorder-7 and the self-made Coping Behaviors Questionnaires. RESULT: Among 17249 responders, 7923 and 9326 completed the assessment of depression and anxiety respectively, and all responders finished the assessment of the coping behaviors questionnaires. Our survey population had a high prevalence rate of possible depression disorders and anxiety disorders were34.66% and 56.93%, respectively. Those who are old, female, low education, low income, and cohabiting were more likely to suffer depression and/or anxiety. Students are a high-risk group suffering from depression and/or anxiety. After adjusting for social-demographic factors (e.g. age, sex), depression and anxiety were positively associated with self-injury, doing housework, and having sex or masturbating and negatively associated with singing, drawing, or writing, dating friends online, singing, attending lectures, and doing yoga. CONCLUSION: During the epidemic, our findings identify some spontaneous coping behaviors that can probably relieve the psychological impact of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.","Ge, Fenfen; Wan, Mentong; Zheng, Anni; Luo, Guan; Zhang, Jun",https://doi.org/10.1093/pcmedi/pbaa023,20200623.0,,PMC; WHO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
214,“I feel like death on legs”: COVID-19 isolation and mental health,"Abstract This study investigates the personal and collective responses to COVID-19, as it is described in personal stories and newspaper reports and examines the social and economic impact of the pandemic on different societies. Although some studies have been done on the impact of COVID-19, these studies focus on epidemiology, the importance of language diversity and reflections on the pandemic. None of the studies so far have focused specifically on the impact the coronavirus has had on different societies because of the global lockdown and restrictions on people’s movements. This study attempts to address this gap in the literature by focusing on how the language used in personal stories and newspaper reports reveal the impact of COVID-19 on different societies by investigating how self-isolation and lockdown measures is leading to mental health breakdown in individuals and affecting wider social and economic collapse. Prior literature (Gortner and Pennebaker, 2003) suggests that the media generally parallel society’s psychological response to traumatic events making newspapers an important collective resource similar to personal stories. The scale of the pandemic is such that it has been likened to a situation of war. In this climate, where the response to the pandemic is analogous to fighting a war, it was interesting to see what effect the enforced lockdown has on people’s mental health well-being and what priorities the media focus on. Smith, Anderson-Hanley, Langrock, and Compas (2005) have shown that language use in descriptions of traumatic experiences can shed insight into successful and unsuccessful coping strategies. I have therefore chosen to look at two different countries, Sri Lanka and Britain in order to investigate the following research questions: (1) Is self-isolation due to COVID-19 having an effect on mental health in Britain? And (2) What are the priorities of different countries during the crisis as evident in newspaper reports? To answer these two research questions, I have collected a small corpus of personal stories from Britain and two small corpora of newspaper reports from Britain and Sri Lanka over a span of one month. The data was analysed using corpus linguistics methodology such as keyword analysis of the two newspaper reports using AntConc (Anthony, 2019) and the personal stories were analysed using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) (Pennebaker, 2015). The findings from LIWC shows that the enforced self-isolation is leading to mental health breakdown but that there are also positive emotions of the desire to help and solidarity with others. The analysis of the news reports show that Britain’s priorities are centered on the government’s handling of the crisis and the economy whereas Sri Lankan newspapers focus on educating people about the dangers of COVID-19.","Herat, Manel",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssaho.2020.100042,20200707.0,,Elsevier; PMC; WHO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
215,What does social distancing mean for patients in forensic mental health settings?,"Governments across the globe have called for social distancing measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Secure settings will not be able to comply with these strictly, nor will they have the same recourse to the novel and creative solutions the general population does. Activities have been restricted in quality, quantity and scope; transfers and discharges have been halted and patient progress put on pause. Understanding how and what ways these restrictions will affect patients is crucial. This is especially salient given that large numbers of the general population have reported heightened mental health burden in recent surveys. However, it is not yet clear how and in what ways the COVID-19 restrictions will affect the mental health of patients in secure care. Past research investigating patients experiences of restrictions on autonomy in secure care that were present before the pandemic can be helpful here. Studies suggest that patient experience restrictions in care in myriad subjective ways. These include limitations on family contact, outside leave, and making hot drinks but also more profoundly on their autonomy, sense of self, and personhood. Quantitative studies have found correlations between experiences of restrictiveness and ward atmosphere, quality of life, suicidal ideation, depression and general psychological state in this patient group. This paper suggests how we can use past research exploring patient expereinces of restrictive interventions to guide the implementation of social distancing measures in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Tomlin, Dr Jack",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsiml.2020.100018,20200428.0,,Elsevier; PMC; WHO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17

Her responses are informed by recent cross-disciplinary and neuropsychological research on the digital age. She considers what happens to free association, evenly suspended attention and reverie when working by phone or online; the loss of the consulting room as a containing physical space for both clinician and patient; the relationship between place and time; and whether (and how) we can maintain a focus on transference and countertransference in the presence of the threat of death. The interview ends with her thoughts on whether we should assume that the landscape of analytic therapy will be permanently altered by Covid-19, and with her hope that general awareness of the impact of trauma on our mental health has been raised.","Isaacs Russell, Gillian",https://doi.org/10.1111/bjp.12581,20200709.0,,PMC; WHO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17

220,Introduction: changing cultures of speed,"This chapter outlines the widespread acceptance of speed as a positive aspect of urban transport during the 20th century, along with a growing recognition in recent decades that speed may not provide the advantages that have long been assumed. In 21st century urban planning, no longer are higher speeds always seen as the main objective. New goals are increasingly recognised as being more important: accessibility, liveability, economic vitality, child-friendliness, sustainability and health. The concept of ‘health’ in this book applies to human health, as well as economic health and environmental health. We explain how all of these types of health can be enhanced using the simple strategy of slowing city transport. A brief history of increases in transport speed is followed by a discussion of the evolution of the culture of speed in modern societies, to a level that can be compared to an addiction. An important aspect of the culture of speed is the story of motordom, the grouping of automobile clubs, car dealers and car manufacturers that began in the United States in the 1920s. A concerted campaign by motordom comprehensively dismissed the public’s negative views on speed. We then outline how, from the 1980s onwards, new thinking began to emerge about motorised city transport, in which the value of slowing it down became more widely discussed. We provide examples of various slow movements that have emerged since the 1980s. While some citizens and policy-makers may question (or even ridicule) the idea of slow movements, we reflect on where the ‘fast movement’ has taken us over the last 100 years. This chapter concludes with a preview of the chapters and parts of the book.","Tranter, Paul; Tolley, Rodney",https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-815316-1.00001-0,20200626.0,,Elsevier; PMC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-10-17
221,El impacto de la Gran Recesión en la salud mental en España,"The objective of this article is to identify the effects of the Great Recession on the mental health of people residing in Spain. After presenting a conceptual framework on the mechanisms through which economic crises affect mental health, we describe the main results of 45 papers identified in our search. Studies indicate a worsening of mental health in Spain in the years of economic crisis, especially in men. Working conditions (unemployment, low wages, instability, precariousness) emerge as one of the main channels through which mental health is put at risk or deteriorates. This deterioration occurs with intensity in particularly vulnerable groups, such as immigrant population and families with economic burdens. In the case of suicides, the results were inconclusive. Regarding the use of health care services, an increase in the consumption of certain drugs seems to be identified, although the conclusions of all the studies are not coincidental. Social inequalities in mental health do not seem to have remitted. We conclude that Spain needs to improve information systems to a better understanding of the health effects of economic crises. In terms of public policies, together with the reinforcement of health services aimed at addressing mental health problems, an income guarantee network for people in vulnerable situations should be promoted, as well as the development of policies aimed at the labour market.","Oliva, Juan; López-Varcárcel, Beatriz González; Pérez, Patricia Barber; Peña-Longobardo, Luz María; Garrido, Rosa M.

222,Covid-19 et remaniement des défenses contre la dépression chez les soignants en Ehpad,"Résumé Les réponses des Ehpad à la pandémie et au confinement actuel révèlent et amplifient les défenses habituelles des soignants contre la dépression. Le fait que le danger de mort et l’obligation d’enfermer les résidents viennent de l’extérieur, et le maniement permanent des mesures de protection physique ne suppriment pas le sentiment d’inutilité et l’angoisse de mort qu’ils tolèrent ou évitent d’ordinaire. L’auteur montre qu’ils ajoutent au contraire à leur inquiétude et par conséquent à leur besoin de parole et d’écoute. Summary The responses of nursing homes to the present pandemic and lock-down reveal and amplify the usual defensive mechanisms deployed by professional caregivers against depression. The danger of death and the need to confine the residents, both coming from the outside world, and the permanent management of physical protective measures do not remove the feeling of uselessness and the anxiety of death that the nursing staff habitually tolerates or avoids. On the contrary, these aspects add to caregivers’ need to talk and be listened to.","Charazac, P.
