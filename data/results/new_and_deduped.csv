0,Impact of housing conditions on changes in youth's mental health following the initial national COVID-19 lockdown: A cohort study,"BackgroundYouths mental health has on average declined initially during the pandemic and few studies have investigated whether these declines were dependent on housing conditions.

MethodsWe used data from 7445 youth from the Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC), collected at participants 18th year of life and subsequently three weeks into the initial national lockdown (April 2020). We examined associations between housing conditions (access to outdoor spaces, urbanicity, household density, and household composition) and changes in mental health parameters (mental well-being, Quality of Life (QoL) and loneliness. We report results from multivariate linear and logistic regression models.

FindingsYouth without access to outdoor spaces had a greater decrease in mental well-being compared to those with a garden, mean difference: -0{middle dot}83 (95 % CI -1{middle dot}19,-0{middle dot}48), and correspondingly greater odds of onset of low mental well-being, OR: 1{middle dot}68 (95 % CI 1{middle dot}15, 2{middle dot}47). Youth in higher density households and those living alone also had greater odds of onset of low mental well-being (OR: 1{middle dot}23 (95 % CI 1{middle dot}05, 1{middle dot}43) and OR: 1{middle dot}47 (95 % CI 1{middle dot}05, 2{middle dot}07), respectively). Onset of low QoL was associated with living in denser households, as well as living alone. Living alone more than doubled odds of onset of loneliness, OR: 2{middle dot}12 (95 % CI 1{middle dot}59, 2{middle dot}82).

InterpretationNot all youth were equally affected by the pandemic and our findings inform policy makers that youth living alone, in denser households, and without direct access to outdoor spaces are especially vulnerable to mental health declines.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSMental health is associated with certain housing characteristics, such as access to green space and household composition. Additionally, we know that mental health amongst youth has been especially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and/or social restrictions, at a time where a majority of youth spend more time at home. Cross-sectional studies have indicated that housing conditions during the initial lockdowns were associated with mental health among youth.

Added value to this studyWe are able to provide evidence that housing conditions have been important factors in how youths mental health has changed, due to data collections in our cohort before and during the pandemic. We demonstrate that living alone without access to outdoor spaces and in denser households during lockdown are all associated with deteriorations in mental health in a longitudinal design. The deteriorations in mental well-being are at a level indicative of anxiety and/or depression, indicating that these mental health changes are meaningful from a public health perspective. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine associations longitudinally in a youth cohort.

Implications of all the available evidenceNot all youth will be equally affected by the pandemic and social restrictions. Public health recommendations could be that youth avoid living alone, in dense households and without access to outdoor spaces during a lockdown, if this is at all possible to choose. Additionally, mental health and public health professionals should be aware of these vulnerabilities as they seek to assist youth at times when social restrictions are in place to control community transmission. Additionally, as we look to the future and work towards equitable and health-promoting housing, we must consider aspects that are important to mental health during pandemics and otherwise.",Jonathan Groot; Amélie Cléo Keller; Andrea Joensen; Tri-Long Nguyen; Anne-Marie Nybo Andersen; Katrine Strandberg-Larsen,https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.16.20245191,20201222.0,,medRxiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
1,Magnitude and associated factors of suicidal ideation and attempt among people with epilepsy attending outpatient treatment at primary public hospitals in northwest Ethiopia: a multicentre cross-sectional study,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess magnitude and associated factors of suicidal ideation and attempt among people with epilepsy attending outpatient treatment at primary public hospitals, northwest Ethiopia using suicide module of World Mental Health Survey initiative version of the WHO, composite international diagnostic interview. DESIGN: Multicentre-based cross-sectional study was used. SETTING: Data were collected using face to face interview from patients with epilepsy who attended outpatient treatment at primary public hospitals at northwest Ethiopia. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients with epilepsy (n=563) who came to attend outpatient treatment during the study period were included in the study using systematic random sampling technique. OUTCOME MEASURES: Suicidal ideation, suicidal attempt and factors associated with suicidal ideation and attempt. RESULTS: The overall magnitude of suicidal ideation and attempt was 26.5% and 12.6%, respectively. Being woman adjusted OR ((AOR)=1.68, 95% CI 1.09 to 3.23), living alone (AOR=2.4, 95% CI 1.47 to 3.92), divorced/widowed/(AOR=2.2, 95% CI 1.09 to 7.8), family history of suicidal attempt (AOR=2.53, 95% CI 1.34 to 4.79), depression (AOR=3.18, 95% CI 1.85 to 5.45), anxiety (AOR=2.92, 95% CI 1.68 to 5.09), comorbid medical illness (AOR=2.60, 95% CI 1.17 to 5.82) and poor social support (AOR=2.35, 95% CI 1.26 to 4.40) were statistically associated with suicidal ideation. Depression (AOR=4.87, 95% CI 2.56 to 9.28) living alone (AOR=2.66, 95% CI 1.62 to 5.41), family history of committed suicide (AOR=2.80, 95% CI 1.24 to 6.39), taking medication for mental illness (AOR=2.17, 95% CI 1.06 to 4.46), hazardous alcohol use (AOR=2.10, 95% CI 1.05 to 4.23) were statistically associated with suicidal attempts at a p value <0.05. CONCLUSION: This study showed that the magnitude of suicidal ideation and attempt was high among people with epilepsy. Being woman, living alone, having depression and anxiety, single, divorced/widowed in marital status, family history of suicidal attempt and poor social support were statistically associated with suicidal ideation. Having depression, living alone, family history of suicide attempt, hazardous alcohol use and drug taking for mental illness were statistically associated with suicidal attempt. Based on the findings of this study early screening, detection and management of suicide were recommended in people with epilepsy.","Nigussie, Kabtamu; Tesfaye, Bizuneh; Lemma, Alemu; Kerebih, Habtamu",https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-043227,,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMJ Open;11(1): e043227, 2021 Jan 04.; Publication details: BMJ Open;11(1): e043227, 2021 Jan 04.; Publication type: article",WHO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

31,"Anxiety and depression symptoms, the recovery from symptoms, and loneliness before and after the COVID-19 outbreak among the general population: Findings from a Dutch population-based longitudinal study","Examine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health and loneliness in the general population. More specifically, the study focused on prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms, the extent to which individuals with existing symptoms recovered or not, the prevalence of subtypes of loneliness, and the extent to which loneliness before and during this pandemic was associated with anxiety and depression symptoms. Data was extracted from the longitudinal LISS panel, based on a probability sample of the Dutch population, with assessments on loneliness in October 2019 (T1) and June 2020 (T4), and anxiety and depression symptoms in November 2019 (T2), March 2020 (T3) and June 2020 (T4; Ntotal = 4,084). Loneliness was examined with the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale and anxiety and depression symptoms with the Mental Health Inventory (MHI-5). Repeated measures multivariate logistic regression analyses (RMMLRA) showed a statistical significant lower prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms after the outbreak (T4 = 15.3%) than before (T2 = 16.8%) and during the COVID-19 outbreak (T3 = 17.2%). According to the Reliable Change Index, the distribution of recovery categories (remission, improvement, unchanged and worsening symptoms) after the outbreak did not differ significantly from the distribution of these categories before the outbreak. RMMLRA revealed that the prevalence of emotional loneliness increased significantly after the outbreak (T1 = 18.4%, T4 = 24.8%). Among individuals who were not lonely before and after the outbreak the prevalence of symptoms decreased significantly (T2 = 7.0%, T4 = 4.4%) and, likewise, among those who were not lonely anymore after the outbreak (T2 = 21.5%, T4 = 14.5%). However, the prevalence of symptoms increased significantly among those who became lonely during the pandemic (T2 = 17.9%, T4 = 26.3%). Findings suggest that this pandemic did not negatively affect the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms nor the normal recovery of symptoms among the general population during the first four months, but that emotional loneliness increased.","van der Velden, Hyland, Contino, von Gaudecker, Muffels, Das",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245057,20210107.0,,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
32,Psychological impacts from COVID-19 among university students: Risk factors across seven states in the United States,"University students are increasingly recognized as a vulnerable population, suffering from higher levels of anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and disordered eating compared to the general population. Therefore, when the nature of their educational experience radically changes-such as sheltering in place during the COVID-19 pandemic-the burden on the mental health of this vulnerable population is amplified. The objectives of this study are to 1) identify the array of psychological impacts COVID-19 has on students, 2) develop profiles to characterize students' anticipated levels of psychological impact during the pandemic, and 3) evaluate potential sociodemographic, lifestyle-related, and awareness of people infected with COVID-19 risk factors that could make students more likely to experience these impacts. Cross-sectional data were collected through web-based questionnaires from seven U.S. universities. Representative and convenience sampling was used to invite students to complete the questionnaires in mid-March to early-May 2020, when most coronavirus-related sheltering in place orders were in effect. We received 2,534 completed responses, of which 61% were from women, 79% from non-Hispanic Whites, and 20% from graduate students. Exploratory factor analysis on close-ended responses resulted in two latent constructs, which we used to identify profiles of students with latent profile analysis, including high (45% of sample), moderate (40%), and low (14%) levels of psychological impact. Bivariate associations showed students who were women, were non-Hispanic Asian, in fair/poor health, of below-average relative family income, or who knew someone infected with COVID-19 experienced higher levels of psychological impact. Students who were non-Hispanic White, above-average social class, spent at least two hours outside, or less than eight hours on electronic screens were likely to experience lower levels of psychological impact. Multivariate modeling (mixed-effects logistic regression) showed that being a woman, having fair/poor general health status, being 18 to 24 years old, spending 8 or more hours on screens daily, and knowing someone infected predicted higher levels of psychological impact when risk factors were considered simultaneously. Inadequate efforts to recognize and address college students' mental health challenges, especially during a pandemic, could have long-term consequences on their health and education.","Browning, Larson, Sharaievska, Rigolon, McAnirlin, Mullenbach, Cloutier, Vu, Thomsen, Reigner, Metcalf, D'Antonio, Helbich, Bratman, Alvarez",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245327,20210107.0,,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
33,Mental health of medical professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic in eight European countries - A cross-sectional survey,"The death toll of COVID-19 topped 170,000 in Europe by the end of May 2020. COVID-19 has caused an immense psychological burden on the population, especially doctors and nurses who are faced with high infection risks and increased workload. To compare the mental health of medical professionals with non-medical professionals in different European countries during COVID-19, assuming that medical professionals, particularly those exposed to COVID-19 at work, would have higher depression, anxiety and stress. To determine their main stressors and most frequently used coping strategies during the crisis. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted during peak COVID-19 months in eight European countries. The questionnaire included demographic data and whether the participants were exposed to COVID-19 at work or not. Mental health was assessed via the Depression-Anxiety-Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21). A 12-item checklist on preferred coping strategies and another 23-item questionnaire on major stressors was filled by the medical professionals. The sample (N=609) consisted of 189 doctors, 165 nurses and 255 non-medical professionals. Participants from France and the UK were more often assigned to the group with severe/extremely severe depression, anxiety and stress on DASS-21. Non-medical professionals had significantly higher scores for depression and anxiety. Among medical professionals no significant link was reported between direct contact with COVID-19 patients at work and anxiety, depression or stress. Â´Uncertainty about when the epidemic will be under controlÂ´ was the most stressful aspect for healthcare professionals while Â´taking protective measuresÂ´&quot; was the most frequently used coping strategy among all participants. COVID-19 poses a major challenge to the mental health of working professionals as a considerable proportion of our participants showed high values for depression, anxiety and stress. Even though medical professionals showed less mental stress than non-medical professionals, sufficient help should be offered to all occupational groups with an emphasis on effective coping strategies.","Hummel, Oetjen, Du, Posenato, Resende de Almeida, Losada DurÃ¡n, Ribeiro, Frisardi, Hopper, Rashid, Nasser, KÃ¶nig, Rudofsky, Weidt, Zafar, Nadine, Gwendolyn, Schultz",https://doi.org/10.2196/24983,20210107.0,,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
34,Psychiatric Clinical Profiles and Pharmacological Interactions in COVID-19 Inpatients Referred to a Consultation Liaison Psychiatry Unit: a Cross-Sectional Study,"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) can affect mental health in different ways. There is little research about psychiatric complications in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The aim of the study was to describe the psychiatric clinical profile and pharmacological interactions in COVID-19 inpatients referred to a Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry (CLP) unit. This is a cross-sectional study, carried out at a tertiary hospital in Spain, in inpatients admitted because of COVID-19 and referred to our CLP Unit from March 17,2020 to April 28,2020. Clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records. The patients were divided in three groups depending on psychiatric diagnosis: delirium, severe mental illness (SMI) and non-severe mental illness (NSMI). Of 71 patients included (median [ICR] age 64 [54-73] years; 70.4% male), 35.2% had a delirium, 18.3% had a SMI, and 46.5% had a NSMI. Compared to patients with delirium and NSMI, patients with SMI were younger, more likely to be institutionalized and were administered less anti-COVID19 drugs. Mortality was higher among patients with delirium (21.7%) than those with SMI (0%) or NSMI (9.45%). The rate of side effects due to interactions between anti-COVID19 and psychiatric drugs was low, mainly drowsiness (4.3%) and borderline QTc prolongation (1.5%). Patients affected by SMI were more often undertreated for COVID-19. However, the rate of interactions was very low, and avoidable with a proper evaluation and drug-dose adjustment. Half of the patients with SMI were institutionalized, suggesting that living conditions in residential facilities could make them more vulnerable to infection.","Arbelo, LÃ³pez-Pelayo, SaguÃ©, Madero, PinzÃ³n-Espinosa, Gomes-da-Costa, Ilzarbe, Anmella, Llach, Imaz, CÃ¡mara, Pintor",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11126-020-09868-6,20210107.0,COVID-19; Consultation-liaison psychiatry; Delirium; Mental health residential facilities; Pharmacological interactions; Psychopharmacology,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
35,The Impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic on Healthcare Workers with Pre-Existing Psychiatric Conditions,"Both healthcare workers (HCWs) and psychiatric patients during the COVID-19 pandemic appear to have elevated prevalence of psychiatric symptoms, but little is known about HCWs with psychiatric diagnoses. To examine their response to the pandemic, we analyzed their perspective, and association with psychiatric symptoms and stress among HCW with psychiatric diagnosis. Using an online survey of HCW, we analyzed demographics, work information, health factors, open-ended question, sources of stress and standardized mental health scales (Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8), and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL)). Sixteen out of 129 HCWs reported a pre-existing psychiatric diagnosis (median age 32Â years, 8 were females, 8 work in the emergency department). Their perception of the impact severity on symptoms was significantly correlated with all the mental health scales and with stress from avoiding physical contact. In multivariate analysis, PSS score and PCL score were associated with self-rated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on symptoms (standardized betaâ€‰=â€‰.51 for PCL and standardized betaâ€‰=â€‰.55 for PSS). GAD-7 score was significantly related to both impact (standardized betaâ€‰=â€‰.44) and stress from avoiding physical contact (standardized betaâ€‰=â€‰.53). HCWs with psychiatric diagnoses reported a range of perception of the impact of the pandemic on their symptoms with increased severity associated with worse psychiatric outcomes and more stress from avoiding physical contact with others. There is a growing importance to protect HCWs mental health, including those with pre-existing psychiatric diagnosis, and proactively counter psychosocial consequences of healthcare crises.","MacKenzie, Daviskiba, Dow, Johnston, Balon, Javanbakht, Arfken",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11126-020-09870-y,20210107.0,COVID-19; Healthcare workers; Mental health; Psychiatry; Stress; Stress response,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
36,Setting the Agenda for Reproductive and Maternal Health in the Era of COVID-19: Lessons from a Cruel and Radical Teacher,"COVID-19 exposes major gaps in the MCH safety net and illuminates the disproportionate consequences borne by people living in low resource communities where systemic racism, community disinvestment, and social marginalization creates a perfect storm of vulnerability. We draw eight lessons from the first 8 months of the pandemic, describing how COVID-19 has intensified pre-existing gaps in the MCH support network and created new problems. For each lesson identified, we present supporting evidence and a call for specific actions that can be taken by MCH practitioners, researchers and advocates. LESSON #1: COVID-19 hits communities of color hardest, exposing and exacerbating health inequities caused by systemic racism. LESSON #2: Women experience the most devastating social, economic and mental health tolls during COVID-19. LESSON #3: Virulent pathogens find and exacerbate cracks in our public health and health care systems. LESSON #4: COVID-19 has become a pretext to limit access to sexual and reproductive health care. LESSON #5: COVID-19 has exposed and deepened fault lines in maternity care: over-medicalization, discrimination, lack of workforce diversity, underutilization of collaborative team approaches, and lack of post-delivery follow-up. LESSON #6: The pandemic adds impetus to much-needed Medicaid policy reforms that can have a lasting positive effect on maternal health. LESSON #7: Social and health policy changes, heretofore deemed infeasible, ARE possible under pandemic threat. LESSON #8: Finally, an overarching COVID-19 lesson: We are all inextricably connected. COVID-19 is a loud wake up call for renewed action by MCH epidemiologists, policy-makers, and advocates.","McCloskey, Amutah-Onukagha, Bernstein, Handler",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10995-020-03033-y,20210107.0,COVID-19; Maternal health; Reproductive health,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
37,Applying Restorative Environments in the Home Office While Sheltering-in-Place,"The objective of this review was to spotlight specific methods for people working from home to apply restorative environment research to improve productivity and mental health during shelter-in-place. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to sheltering-in-place and telework. While necessary, these strategies may lead to negative consequences such as social isolation and worse performance. However, nature environments have been shown to have a variety of positive effects in several different settings, including improved attention, positive affect, and increased job satisfaction, and these may be translated to the home workspace setting. This provides a narrative review of the environmental psychology literature, describing articles involving nature in a task performance or stress context and how it has been applied. It then moves on to discuss how these findings could possibly be applied in the context of workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although beneficial results are mixed, the review found a variety of relatively simple and cost-effective methods that could assist workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, including taking a break in nature and implementing nature in the workspace. The application of restorative environment research could be an efficient way of mitigating the negative psychological effects due to at-home sheltering and telework in order to combat COVID-19.","Craig, Neilson, Altman, Travis, Vance",https://doi.org/10.1177/0018720820984286,20210107.0,affective factors; home health; job stress; stress; workspace design,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
38,Mental health of Italian adults during COVID-19 pandemic,"On 31 January 2020, a new type of coronavirus was first confirmed in Italy and spread rapidly across the country leading to a national lockdown. The aim of this pilot study was to explore the impact of the public health emergency due to COVID-19 on individual's mental health among 299 Italian adults after a month of home isolation due to COVID-19. Cross-sectional study design. Adults of the general population were invited to a voluntary online health survey. Hierarchical multiple regressions were used to examine diverse psycho-social and stressful contextual factors associated with symptoms of psychopathology. Results indicated that females reported higher symptoms of depression, anxiety and circadian rhythm dysregulation, than males. Age and the capacity to adapt to a new environment and to cope with illness were negatively associated with all symptoms of psychopathology. Conversely, engaging in verbally aggressive behaviours and having experienced stressful events related to COVID-19 were positively related to psychopathological symptoms. Finally, social support was negatively associated with depressive symptoms, and substance use during the past months was related to circadian rhythm dysregulation. The findings of this study raise particular concern about psychological well-being considering the negative associations between stressful events during the COVID-19 pandemic, symptoms of psychological distress, and perceived social support. These results have possible significant clinical implications.","Amendola, Spensieri, Hengartner, Cerutti",https://doi.org/10.1111/bjhp.12502,20210107.0,COVID-19; circadian rhythm dysregulation; internalizing symptoms; psychotic-like experiences; public health emergencies,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

A prospective cohort (NÂ =Â 1,044) of people recruited online, purposively targeting vulnerable populations. After a baseline survey (April 2020), participants completed 3 months of daily ecological momentary assessments (EMA). Dietary, physical activity, alcohol, smoking, vaping and substance use behaviours collected retrospectively for the pre-COVID-19 period were compared with daily EMA surveys over the first 30 days during early lockdown. Predictors of behaviour change were assessed using multivariable regression models. 30% of the cohort had a COVID-19 at risk health condition, 37% were classed as deprived and 6% self-reported a mental health condition. Relative to pre-pandemic levels, participants ate almost one portion of fruit and vegetables less per day (vegetables mean difference -0.33, 95% CI -0.40, -0.25; fruit -0.57, 95% CI -0.64, -0.50), but showed no change in high sugar portions per day (-0.03, 95% CI -0.12, 0.06). Participants spent half a day less per week doing â‰¥30Â min of moderate to vigorous physical activity (-0.57, 95% CI -0.73, -0.40) but slightly increased days of strength training (0.21, 95% CI 0.09, 0.34), increased alcohol intake (AUDIT-C score change 0.25, 95% CI 0.13, 0.37), though did not change smoking, vaping or substance use behaviour. Worsening health behaviour change was associated with being younger, female and higher body mass index. The cohort reported worsening health behaviours during early lockdown.

This article reviews the main articles that have been published so far about the direct and indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on these particularly fragile populations. The pandemic associated to COVID-19 has shifted most of the health resources to the emergency area and has consequently left the three main medical areas dealing with the elderly population (oncology, time-dependent diseases and degenerative disease) temporarily &quot;uncovered&quot;. In the phase following the emergency, it will be crucial to guarantee to each area the economic and organizational resources to quickly return to the level of support of the prepandemic state. The emergency phase represented a significant occasion of discussion on the possibilities of telemedicine which will inevitably become increasingly important, but all the limits of its use in the elderly population have to be considered. In the post-lockdown recovery phase, alongside the classic medical evaluation, the psychological evaluation must become even more important for doctors caring about people with cognitive decline as well as with their caregivers.","Iodice, Cassano, Rossini",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10072-020-04902-8,20210107.0,Alzheimerâ€™s disease; Anxiety; Behavioral effects; COVID-19; Depressive disorders; Mild cognitive impairment,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
42,Head lice were also affected by COVID-19: a decrease on Pediculosis infestation during lockdown in Buenos Aires,"Pediculosis is a worldwide disease affecting school-aged children produced by the presence of the head louse, Pediculus humanus capitis De Geer, an obligate ectoparasite on the human scalp feeding exclusively on blood. Transmission occurs primarily through direct physical head-to-head contact. In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a variant of the coronavirus. Therefore, on March 18, 2020, the Argentinean government established mandatory isolation for an indefinite period. This obligatory isolation interrupted regular classes avoiding direct contact between children, thus affecting the dispersal route of individuals and the evolution of head louse populations. In this study, we evaluated through an online survey how confinement affected the prevalence of lice during lockdown compared to the situation prior to confinement. The survey allowed to discriminate the different control strategies, the number of treatments, and the amount of insects recorded by parents. Data of 1118 children obtained from 627 surveys were analyzed. As the main result, it was observed that prevalence of lice decreased significantly from before (69.6%) to during (43.9%) COVID-19 lockdown. Moreover, head lice infestation was more effectively controlled in households with up to 2 children in comparison to households with 3 or more children. This is the first study that analyzed the prevalence of head lice during COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, this work demonstrated the impact of social distance in the population dynamics of head lice and how it could affect the control strategies in the future.","Galassi, Ortega-Insaurralde, Adjemian, Gonzalez-Audino, Picollo, Toloza",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00436-020-07038-y,20210107.0,Buenos Aires; Covid-19; Head lice; Lockdown; Pediculosis,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
43,Psychological Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Frontline Health Workers in Low- and Middle-Income Countries,"Healthcare systems in many countries have been overwhelmed by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, with increasing demands to contain and respond to the virus. The result has been increased pressure on frontline health workers. As the pandemic unfolds, the impact on health systems in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) is becoming apparent. In lower resource settings, the detrimental effects on frontline health workers will likely be significant due to fragmented infrastructure, low compensation, and significant shortages of necessary resources such as personal protective equipment. These high stress conditions, coupled with risk of infection and fears and anxieties among patients, can result in grave psychosocial consequences for frontline health workers, who play a vital role in delivering the bulk of primary care services in LMICs. In this narrative review, we consider the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on frontline health workers in LMICs. We describe the important role of frontline health workers, summarize existing literature on burnout and risks to mental health in this essential workforce, and consider how public health emergencies exacerbate these concerns to showcase their vulnerability to mental health impacts of COVID-19. We explore emerging research on the detrimental effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on health workers and consider possible approaches to mitigate these consequences. This review draws from existing studies and emerging evidence to highlight the critical need to consider the wellbeing of frontline health workers, and to address these challenges as health systems respond to the pandemic.","Deng, Naslund",https://www.google.com/search?q=Psychological+Impact+of+COVID-19+Pandemic+on+Frontline+Health+Workers+in+Low-+and+Middle-Income+Countries.,20210107.0,,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

46,Psychological Effects on Health Science Students After Implementation of COVID-19 Quarantine and Distance Learning in Saudi Arabia,"Background The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted the globe dramatically. It has affected daily life noticeably and the teaching process is one of the significantly affected aspects as the learning approach has been shifted to distance learning (DL). These new changes may affect student performance and emotional well-being. This study aimed to assess the psychologicalÂ impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and distance learning on healthcare students. Method An online self-administered cross-sectional survey was distributed to healthcare students for the period between April 2020 to June 2020. The study included students from different universities in Saudi Arabia. Knowledge and perception of COVID-19 and the experience of distance learning during the pandemic period were assessed using a 5-point Likert scale. Psychological effect was evaluated using Four-Item Patient Health Questionnaire for Anxiety and Depression (PHQ-4). Results A total of 721 students completed the survey with the majority being females. Around 25% of students had experienced anxiety, while 35% had depression. Severe anxiety and depression were noted in over 6% of the participants. Younger age and female gender were more affected psychologically. Students with higher scores in PHQ-4 were strongly disagreeing that hand gloves and surgical masks may help in preventing COVID-19 transmission. Students with normal psychological assessment were more likely to favor DL, while students with moderate to severe anxiety and depression disagreed. Conclusion Healthcare students have alarmingly high levels of anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. General knowledge of the pandemic is not associated with the psychological impact. DL is a convenient approach for students with normal PHQ-4 scores. Programs to help students overcome the psychologicalÂ impact of COVID-19 are highly recommended.","Qanash, Al-Husayni, Alemam, Alqublan, Alwafi, Mufti, Qanash, Shabrawishi, Ghabashi",https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.11767,20210107.0,anxiety; coronavirus quarantine; covid 19; depression; distance learning programs; health professions students; health sciences; psycho-behavioral; saudi arabia,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

This study aims to explore the effect of various emotions on prosocial tendencies during the COVID-19 outbreak and the moderating effect of the severity of the epidemic. We explore these effects by conducting a text analysis of the content of posts by 387,730 Weibo users. The results show that the severity of the epidemic promotes prosocial tendencies; anger motivates prosocial tendencies significantly; and the severity of the epidemic moderates the effects of three emotions-anger, sadness, and surprise-on prosocial tendencies. These findings provide a reference for exploring the positive significance of major disasters.","Ye, Long, Liu, Xu",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.588701,20210107.0,COVID-19; big data; negative emotion; positive emotion; prosocial tendency,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

Mental health support has been hindered and teams are reinventing themselves to reach people in need. Nevertheless, decompensation of previous psychiatric disorders, increasing levels of depression and anxiety, economical handicaps and fear of the infection, are prompting several cases of COVID-19 related suicides worldwide. Every suicide affects between 5 and 80 individuals, which are known as suicide survivors. Suicide grief is particularly challenging, with rates of complicated grief as high as 40%. Suicide survivors are at increased risk of developing depression, anxiety disorders and of suicidal behaviors. Moreover, feelings of guilt and shame, as well as social stigma, are major obstacles for them to reach form help. This article aims to review the existing literature on COVID-19 related suicides, complicated grief in suicide survivors and highlight modifiable risk factors for both conditions, as well as propose some public health measures to reduce the impact of the pandemic context on self-inflicted harm and its consequences on families, friends and the community. Obstacles to access to mental health support need to be overcome through the use of technology. Technicians should actively approach populations more vulnerable to develop suicidal ideation. Social media have the obligation to provide accurate an non-sensationalistic information. Families and friends should maintain social proximity, despite the need for physical distancing. When a suicide death occurs, police forces and health staff should be prepared to share the news with the family using an empathic and humane approach and providing psychological support. Funerals, memorials and other services should be held as much as possible. Closer contacts should be signalized and closely followed in order to detect the need for specific interventions. Help seeking behaviors should be promoted. Additionally, people should be educated on suicide and its impacts, in order to reduce stigma.","Pinto, Soares, Silva, Curral, Coelho",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.626807,20210107.0,COVID-19; complicated grief; intervention; prevention; suicide; suicide survivors,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
49,Cannabis and COVID-19: Reasons for Concern,"The lockdown measures implemented to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2 may affect (illicit) drug consumption patterns. This rapid response study investigated changes in cannabis use in a non-probability sample of cannabis users in the Netherlands during the early lockdown period. We fielded an online cross-sectional survey 4-6 weeks after implementation of lockdown measures in the Netherlands on March 15, 2020. We measured self-reported \motives for changes in use, and assessed cannabis use frequency (use days), number of joints per typical use day, and route of administration in the periods before and after lockdown implementation. 1,563 cannabis users were recruited. Mean age was 32.7 Â± 12.0 years; 66.3% were male and 67.9% used cannabis (almost) daily. In total, 41.3% of all respondents indicated that they had increased their cannabis use since the lockdown measures, 49.4% used as often as before, 6.6% used less often, and 2.8% stopped (temporarily). One-third of those who were not daily users before the lockdown became (almost) daily users. Before the lockdown, most respondents (91.4%) used cannabis in a joint mixed with tobacco and 87.6% still did so. Among users of joints, 39.4% reported an increase in the average number consumed per use day; 54.2% stayed the same and 6.4% used fewer joints. This rapid response study found evidence that during the lockdown more users increased rather than decreased cannabis consumption according to both frequency and quantity. These data highlight the need to invest more resources in supporting cessation, harm reduction, and monitoring longer term trends in cannabis use.","van Laar, Oomen, van Miltenburg, Vercoulen, Freeman, Hall",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.601653,20210107.0,COVID-19; cannabis; corona; risks; route of administration,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
50,Prevalence of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms of High School Students in Shandong Province During the COVID-19 Epidemic,"<b>Background:</b> The coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) has brought physical risks as well as psychological challenges to the whole world. High school students are a special group suffering from both the academic pressure and the threat of the epidemic. The present study aims to conduct an online survey to investigate the psychological status of high school students in Shandong Province. <b>Methods:</b> Using a web-based cross-sectional survey, data was collected from 1,018 voluntary high school students assessed with demographic information, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and a self-designed online-study effect survey. Correlation analysis was performed to explore the relationships between depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and study effect. <b>Result:</b> The prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and a combination of depressive and anxiety symptoms was 52.4, 31.4, and 26.8%, respectively, among high school students in Shandong Province during the COVID-19 epidemic. And from moderate to severe severity level, the rates of depressive symptoms and anxious symptoms were 17.6 and 4.6%. Female students exhibited a higher rate and severity of mental symptoms than male, and grade one senior high school students got a higher rate and severity of mental symptoms than the other two grades. Nearly half of the students were not satisfied with their online-study effect. The PHQ-9 score had a strong positive correlation with the GAD-7 score. Both the PHQ-9 score the GAD-7 score had a negative correlation with the study-effect survey score. <b>Conclusion:</b> Quite a number of high school students suffered from depression and anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 epidemic. Sufficient attentions should be paid, and necessary supports should be provided, to protect the mental health of this special group.","Zhang, Zhai, Yang, Zhang, Zhou, Yang, Duan, Zhou",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.570096,20210107.0,COVID-19; anxiety; depression; high school students; mental health,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
51,"The Psychological Impact and Associated Factors of COVID-19 on the General Public in Hunan, China","This study aimed to assess the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic among the general public in Hunan Province, China, which could help develop psychological interventions and mental health programs. This online cross-sectional study recruited 571 participants through snowball sampling between February 2 and February 5, 2020. Data were collected through a general information questionnaire, the Public Emergency Psychological State Questionnaire, the Simple Coping Style Questionnaire, and the Public Disease Awareness on COVID-19 Scale. The total mean score of the public emergency psychological state of the sample was 0.27 (0.31) points, with only 5.78% of participants (n = 33) developing psychological distress. Avoidant coping style and disease awareness were weakly positively correlated (r<sub>s</sub> = 0.257, p &lt; 0.01) and weakly negatively correlated (r<sub>s</sub> = -0.124, p &lt;0.01) with psychological responses, respectively. There were significant psychological differences among the following variables: occupation, symptoms of fever or fatigue, discernment of the authenticity of COVID-19 information, and level of concern regarding COVID-19 (p &lt; 0.05). The COVID-19 pandemic appears to have had a minor psychological impact on the general population in Hunan Province. However, psychological health promotion in the general public is still required, especially for employees (such as company employees, migrant workers, and businessmen), individuals with COVID-19-like symptoms, limited discernment competence and unconcerned attitudes. The initiatives for improving psychological health among the general public could focus on delivering COVID-19 knowledge and alleviating avoidant coping styles. Our findings could provide important insight for the development of psychological support strategies in China, as well as in other places affected by the epidemic.","Shi, Guo, Luo, Lei, Li",https://doi.org/10.2147/RMHP.S280289,20210107.0,coping style; coronavirus disease 2019; disease awareness; psychological health; public health emergency,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
52,How can we build and maintain the resilience of our health care professionals during COVID-19? Recommendations based on a scoping review,"To explore how to build and maintain the resilience of frontline healthcare professionals exposed to COVID-19 outbreak working conditions. Scoping review supplemented with expert interviews to validate the findings. Hospitals. We searched PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, bioRxiv and medRxiv systematically and grey literature for articles focusing on the impact of COVID-19-like working conditions on the physical and/or mental health of healthcare professionals in a hospital setting. Articles using an empirical design about determinants or causes of physical and/or mental health and about interventions, measures and policies to preserve physical and/or mental health were included. Four experts were interviewed to reflect on the results from the scoping review. In total, 4471 records were screened leading to an inclusion of 73 articles. Recommendations prior to the outbreak fostering resilience included optimal provision of education and training, resilience training and interventions to create a feeling of being prepared. Recommendations during the outbreak consisted of (1) enhancing resilience by proper provision of information, psychosocial support and treatment (eg, create enabling conditions such as forming a psychosocial support team), monitoring the health status of professionals and using various forms and content of psychosocial support (eg, encouraging peer support, sharing and celebrating successes), (2) tasks and responsibilities, in which attention should be paid to kind of tasks, task mix and responsibilities as well as the intensity and weight of these tasks and (3) work patterns and working conditions. Findings of the review were validated by experts. Recommendations were developed on how to build and maintain resilience of frontline healthcare professionals exposed to COVID-19 outbreak working conditions. These practical and easy to implement recommendations can be used by hospitals and other healthcare organisations to foster and preserve short-term and long-term physical and mental health and employability of their professionals.","Rieckert, Schuit, Bleijenberg, Ten Cate, de Lange, de Man-van Ginkel, Mathijssen, Smit, Stalpers, Schoonhoven, Veldhuizen, Trappenburg",https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-043718,20210107.0,COVID-19; mental health; occupational &amp; industrial medicine; organisation of health services,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
53,Psychological impact of COVID-19 outbreak among Jimma University Medical Centere visitors in Southwestern Ethiopia: a cross-sectional study,"COVID-19 has posed several medical, psychosocial and economic impacts among the majority of the society. The ambiguity of its transmission, the intense desire of self-protection, family, and friends, the unknown impact of catching the disease itself, unstoppable spread, the panic and outright misinformation lead to acute stress reaction syndrome. However, reliable data related to this contagion lack the prevalence of acute stress reaction syndrome and associated factors among Jimma University Medical Centre hospital visitors in Southwestern Ethiopia. The main objective of the study was to assess the prevalence and factors associated with acute stress reaction syndrome during the COVID-19 outbreak among Jimma University Medical Centre Hospital visitors, Ethiopia. An interviewer-administered cross-sectional study was conducted among 247 visitors of the Jimma University Medical Centre in Ethiopia. The study was conducted within 2â€‰weeks of the first COVID-19 cases detected on 13 March 2020 in Ethiopia. Data on demographic and socioeconomic status were collected during the interview using structured questionnaires. The psychological impact was assessed using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, and symptoms of insomnia were measured using the Insomnia Severity Index. Social support was evaluated using Oslo three-item Social Support Scale. Logistic regression was employed to determine the associations between dependent and independent variables. Besides, psychosocial stress score was generated using principal component analysis. A paired permutation test was also performed to determine the variability of psychosocial stress between groups. The mean age of participants was 30.47 years, and 76.5% of the participants were male. Acute stress reaction syndrome was detected in 44.1% of hospital visitors. Of the participants, 38.5%, 17.4%, 8.5% and 35.6% had a minimal, mild, moderate and severe psychological impact, respectively. Factors positively associated with acute stress reaction syndrome were individuals who perceived that COVID-19 leads to stigma (adjusted OR (AOR): 3.24, 95%â€‰CI 1.11 to 9.45), mild insomnia (AOR: 14.74, 95%â€‰CI 6.14 to 35.40), moderate to severe insomnia (AOR: 35.1, 95%â€‰CI 10.76 to 114.66), low social support (AOR: 4.08, 95%â€‰CI 1.31 to 12.67) and governmental employees (AOR: 8.09, 95%â€‰CI 1.38 to 47.18). The study revealed the existence of a high prevalence of acute stress reaction syndrome during the COVID-19 outbreak among different groups of the community. Therefore, our results will contribute to the global awareness of the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak.","Yitayih, Lemu, Mekonen, Mecha, Ambelu",https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-043185,20210107.0,adult psychiatry; anxiety disorders; depression &amp; mood disorders; public health; rehabilitation medicine,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

Adults with ongoing COVID-19 sequelae more than three months after hospital discharge Inclusion criteria: 1) Adults â‰¥18 years; 2) â‰¥ 3 months after any hospital discharge related to COVID-19 infection, regardless of need for critical care or ventilatory support; 3) substantial (as defined by the participant) COVID-19 related physical and/or mental health problems; 4) access to, and able/supported to use email and internet audio/video; 4) able to provide informed consent; 5) able to understand spoken and written English, Bengali, Gujarati, Urdu, Punjabi or Mandarin, themselves or supported by family/friends. 1) exercise contraindicated; 2) severe mental health problems preventing engagement; 3) previous randomisation in the present study; 4) already engaged in, or planning to engage in an alternative NHS rehabilitation programme in the next 12 weeks; 5) a member of the same household previously randomised in the present study. Intervention 1: The Rehabilitation Exercise and psycholoGical support After covid-19 InfectioN (REGAIN) programme: an eight week, online, home-based, supervised, group rehabilitation programme. Intervention 2: A thirty-minute, on-line, one-to-one consultation with a REGAIN practitioner (best-practice usual care). The primary outcome is health-related quality of life (HRQoL) - PROMISÂ® 29+2 Profile v2.1 (PROPr) - measured at three months post-randomisation. Secondary outcomes include dyspnoea, cognitive function, health utility, physical activity participation, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom severity, depressive and anxiety symptoms, work status, health and social care resource use, death - measured at three, six and 12 months post-randomisation. Participants will be randomised to best practice usual care or the REGAIN programme on a 1:1.03 basis using a computer-generated randomisation sequence, performed by minimisation and stratified by age, level of hospital care, and case level mental health symptomatology. Once consent and baseline questionnaires have been completed by the participant online at home, randomisation will be performed automatically by a bespoke web-based system. To ensure allocation concealment from both participant and REGAIN practitioner at baseline, randomisation will be performed only after the baseline questionnaires have been completed online at home by the participant. After randomisation has been performed, participants and REGAIN practitioners cannot be blind to group allocation. Follow-up outcome assessments will be completed by participants online at home.

55,Framing global discourses on non-communicable diseases: a scoping review,"The choices that policymakers make are shaped by how their problems are framed. At last, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have risen high on the global policy agenda, but there are many disputed issues. First, what are they? Their name refers not to what they are but what they are not. Second, where do their boundaries lie? What diseases are included? Third, should we view their causes as mainly biomedical, behavioural, or social, or a combination? Our failure to resolve these issues has been invoked as a reason for our limited progress in developing and implementing effective remedies. In this scoping review, we ask &quot;What is known from the existing literature about how NCDs are framed in the global policy discourses?&quot; We answer it by reviewing the frames employed in policy and academic discourses. We searched nine electronic databases for articles published since inception to 31 May 2019. We also reviewed websites of eight international organisations to identify global NCDs policies. We extracted data and synthesised findings to identify key thematic frames. We included 36 articles and nine policy documents on global NCDs policies. We identified five discursive domains that have been used and where there are differing perspectives. These are: &quot;Expanding the NCDs frame to include mental health and air pollution&quot;; &quot;NCDs and their determinants&quot;; &quot;A rights-based approach to NCDs&quot;; &quot;Approaches to achieving policy coherence in NCDs globally&quot;; and &quot;NCDs as part of Sustainable Socio-economic Development&quot;. We further identified 12 frames within the five discursive domains. This scoping review identifies issues that remain unresolved and points to a need for alignment of perspectives among global health policy actors, as well as synergies with those working on mental health, maternal health, and child health. The current COVID-19 pandemic warrants greater consideration of its impact on global NCDs policies. Future global strategies for NCDs need to consider explicitly how NCDs are framed in a changing global health discourse and ensure adequate alignment with implementation and global health issues. There is a need for global strategies to recognise the pertinent role of actors in shaping policy discourses.","Tan, Han, Shrestha, Wu, Shiraz, Koh, McKee, Legido-Quigley",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-020-05958-0,20210107.0,Framing analysis; Health policy; Non-communicable diseases; Policy discourses,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
56,Using medical reality television as a technology-enhanced learning strategy to provide authentic patient care experiences during clinical placements: a case study research investigation,"Over the last decade, the use of technology-enhanced learning (TEL) has rapidly expanded and diversified. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a growing demand for distance and online learning strategies to support and even replace learning experiences previously afforded by clinical placements and clerkships. An intriguing but under-researched modality is the use of medical reality television to provide authentic experiences of patient care. This strategy does not feature in published medical educational literature, though promising research is emerging from other disciplines. A programme of learning using medical reality television clips to facilitate case-based learning was developed according to the principles of 'anchored instruction', a technology-based educational theory. Clips were taken from the UK television show '24 hours in A&amp;E'. Medical students' learning experiences were investigated using a qualitative approach addressing the following research questions: - What is the perceived emotional experience of medical students when watching reality television in an educational context? - How do medical students relate their experience of watching reality television in a formal educational setting to their perceived learning needs in the clinical environment? A case study research methodology was adopted within the interpretivist paradigm<sub>.</sub> Data were triangulated from semi-structured interviews with students and non-participant observation of the teaching session. Field notes and transcripts were analysed through an inductive thematic analysis. In response to the medical reality television, a diverse range of emotions were expressed including: excitement, amusement, concern, nervousness, sadness and joy. Students identified gaps in their clinical knowledge such as interpreting results, practical aspects of prescribing and end of life care. Key themes were increased student engagement and a promotion of holistic care practices. Students perceived reality television as a highly realistic and relatable medium and an enjoyable, memorable way to contextualise learning from the classroom to real life, a finding mirrored in previous studies in other fields. The high degree of emotion expressed may explain the improved subjective memorability of the cases. Medical reality television offers a unique means of engaging students by providing authentic experiences of patient care and should be valued alongside other technology-enhanced learning strategies.","Osborne, Harrison, Fisher, Bateman",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-020-02432-7,20210107.0,Case study research; Coronavirus; Covid-19; Distance learning; Education; Emotion; Medical; Medical student; Online learning; Technology-enhanced learning; Television; Undergraduate,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
57,Evaluating the impact of Archway: a personalized program for 1st year student success and mental health and wellbeing,"First-year students entering postsecondary education must navigate a new and complex academic and social environment. Research indicates that this transition and developmental period can be challenging and stressful - academically, emotionally and socially - and that mental health and wellbeing can be compromised. Additionally, mental health disorders can also compromise students' ability to successfully navigate this transition. In the COVID-19 pandemic, the incoming 2020 cohort of first-year students face heightened and new challenges. Most will have spent the conclusion of high school learning virtually, in quarantine, in an uncertain and difficult time, and are then experiencing their first year of university while living, learning and socializing off-campus, virtually and remotely. In response to COVID-19 and with an appreciation of the considerable stresses students face generally and particularly in 2020-21, and the potential effects on mental health and wellbeing, McMaster University, a mid-sized research intensive university with approximately 30,000 students, has developed an innovative program to support students, called Archway. This initiative has been developed to help to prevent and to intervene early to address common transitional issues students experience that can influence mental health and wellbeing, with the ultimate goals of increasing student connectedness, supports, and retention. The current study will use a mixed-method design to evaluate Archway and gain a better understanding of the transition into first-year postsecondary for students who engage and participate in Archway at various levels. The study will not only help to determine the effect of this program for students during COVID-19, but it will help us to better understand the challenges of this transition more broadly. Findings have the potential to inform future efforts to support students and protect their mental health and wellbeing through the use of virtual and remote platforms and mechanisms that meet their increasingly diverse needs and circumstances.","Kwan, Brown, MacKillop, Beaudette, Van Koughnett, Munn",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-10057-0,20210107.0,Emerging adulthood; Mental health; Support program; Transition; Wellbeing,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

Cardiovascular comorbidities and complications, including right ventricular dysfunction, are common and are associated with worse outcomes in patients with COVID-19. The data on the clinical usefulness of the 12-lead ECG to aid with prognosis are limited. This study retrospectively evaluated records from 480 patients who were consecutively admitted with COVID-19. ECGs obtained at presentation in the emergency department (ED) were considered index ECGs. RHS-ECG was defined by any new right-axis deviation, S<sub>1</sub>Q<sub>3</sub>T<sub>3</sub> pattern, or ST depressions with T-wave inversions in leads V<sub>1</sub> to V<sub>3</sub> or leads II, III, and aVF. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to assess whether RHS-ECGs were independently associated with primary outcomes. ECGs from the ED were available for 314 patients who were included in the analysis. Most patients were in sinus rhythm, with sinus tachycardia being the most frequent dysrhythmia. RHS-ECG findings were present in 40 (11%) patients. RHS-ECGs were significantly associated with the incidence of adverse outcomes and an independent predictor of mortality (adjusted odds ratio [adjOR]: 15.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.1 to 45.2; pÂ &lt;Â 0.001), the need for mechanical ventilation (adjOR: 8.8; 95%Â CI: 3.4 to 23.2; pÂ &lt;Â 0.001), and their composite (adjOR: 12.1; 95%Â CI: 4.3 to 33.9]; pÂ &lt;Â 0.001).

62,Suicidal Ideation Among Individuals Who Have Purchased Firearms During COVID-19,"Given the increase in firearm purchases during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study seeks to determine the extent to which COVID-19 firearm purchasers differ in terms of suicide risk from nonfirearm owners and firearm owners who did not make a purchase during COVID-19. Participants (N=3,500) were recruited through Qualtrics Panels to participate in an online survey examining methods for self-protection. ANCOVAs were utilized to assess suicidal ideation. Multivariate ANCOVAs were used to examine firearm storage practices and storage changes during COVID-19. Data were collected in late June and early July 2020, and analyses were conducted in July 2020. Individuals who purchased a firearm during COVID-19 more frequently reported lifetime, past-year, and past-month suicidal ideation than nonfirearm owners and firearm owners who did not make a purchase during COVID-19. COVID-19 purchasers with lifetime ideation were less likely to hide loaded firearms in a closet than those without lifetime ideation. COVID-19 purchasers with past-year or past-month ideation were more likely to use locking devices than COVID-19 purchasers without past-month ideation. In contrast to firearm owners more generally, COVID-19 firearm purchasers appear far more likely to have experienced suicidal ideation and appear less likely to use certain unsafe firearm storage methods but also report a greater number of storage changes during COVID-19 that made firearms less secure. Future research should seek to further understand those who purchased a firearm during COVID-19 and determine ways to increase secure storage among firearm owners.","Anestis, Bond, Daruwala, Bandel, Bryan",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2020.10.013,20201228.0,,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

We analyzed questionnaire data from the end of May 2020 from 180 hospitals (102,578 beds) certified by the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine. Acute (emergency) medicine physicians treated severe COVID-19 patients in more than half of hospitals. Emergency medical teams consisted of acute medicine physicians and other specialists. Frontline acute care physicians were concerned about their risk of infection in 80% of hospitals, and experienced stress due to a lack of personal protective equipment. Twenty-six of the 143 hospitals that had a mental health check/consultation system in place indicated that there was a doctor who experienced mental health problems. Of the 37 hospitals without a system, only one hospital was aware of the presence of a doctor complaining of mental health problems. Acute care physicians and physicians in other departments experienced high levels of stress as they fought to arrange COVID-19 treatment teams and inpatient COVID-19 wards for infected patients. Medical materials and equipment may be sufficient for a second or third wave; however, active support is needed for the physical and mental care of medical staff. Mental health problems may be missed in facilities without mental check and consultation system.","Oda, Tanabe, Nishimura, Muguruma, Matsuyama, Sugawara, Ogura",https://doi.org/10.1002/ams2.614,20201219.0,COVIDâ€19; medical staff; mental care system; survey,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
64,Relationship of Physical Activity With Anxiety and Depression Symptoms in Chinese College Students During the COVID-19 Outbreak,"During the COVID-19 outbreak, many citizens were asked to stay at home in self-quarantine, which can pose a significant challenge with respect to remaining physically active and maintaining mental health. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of inadequate physical activity, anxiety, and depression and to explore the relationship of physical activity with anxiety and depression symptoms among Chinese college students during quarantine. Using a web-based cross-sectional survey, we collected data from 1,396 Chinese college students. Anxiety and depression were assessed with the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), respectively. The data on physical activity were collected by types of physical activity and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-SF). During the COVID-19 outbreak, about 52.3% of Chinese college students had inadequate physical activity. The rates of anxiety and depression symptoms were 31.0 and 41.8%, respectively. A high level of physical activity (Î² = -0.121, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) was significantly closely associated with low anxiety, while a moderate (Î² = -0.095, <i>P</i> = 0.001), or high (Î² = -0.179, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) level of physical activity was significantly closely associated with reduced depression after adjusting confounding demographic factors. Moreover, specific types of physical activity, such as stretching and resistance training, were negatively correlated with both anxiety and depression; doing household chores was negatively correlated with depression. Our findings highlight specific levels and types of home-based physical activities that need to be taken into consideration to protect the mental health of college students during the COVID-19 epidemic.","Xiang, Tan, Sun, Yang, Zhao, Liu, Hou, Hu",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.582436,20201218.0,COVID-19; anxiety; college students; depression; physical activity,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
65,Beneficial Effects of Exercise on Depression and Anxiety During the Covid-19 Pandemic: A Narrative Review,"First reported in Dec 2019, the on-going COVID-19 pandemic has become a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). The isolation and quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic limited the physical and social activities of the population, which contributed to the increased prevalence of mental disorder. Depression and anxiety are the most common mental illnesses conferring a serious impact on individuals' life quality. This review summarizes the mental health consequences of COVID-19, especially for depression and anxiety. Exercise as an intervention for anxiety and depression has been demonstrated in both of the animal studies and human clinical trials. The underlying mechanism including the regulation on the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), D-Î²-hydroxybutyrate, synaptic transmission, hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis, tryptophan hydroxylase, GSK3Î²/Î²-catenin pathway, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and PGC-1Î±1-PPAR axis. In addition, we summarized the exercise strategies to fight against anxiety and depression according to the information from American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), World Health Organization and recent literatures about physical exercise during COVID-19.","Hu, Tucker, Wu, Yang",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.587557,20201218.0,COVID-19; anxiety; depression; isolation; physical exercise; quarantine,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
66,Effect of Psychological-Behavioral Intervention on the Depression and Anxiety of COVID-19 Patients,"The COVID-19 epidemic has caused increasing public panic and mental health stress. In this study, we explore the prevalence and factors linked to anxiety and depression in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. A total of 144 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 underwent depression and anxiety assessment by using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Social support level was also evaluated by the Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS) at admission. Results showed that gender, age, oxygen saturation, and social support were associated with anxiety for COVID-19 patients. In addition, age, family infection with SARS-CoV-2, and social support were the risk factors associated with depression. Moreover, we designed a psychological-behavioral intervention (PBI) program that included psychological support and breathing exercises, and explored its effects on patients with COVID-19. Of the 144 participants, 26 patients with both anxiety and depression symptoms (cutoff score of â‰¥8 on HADS-A and HADS-D) were randomly assigned to the intervention group and the control group at a 1:1 ratio. After 10-day treatment, the HADS scores of depression and anxiety were significantly reduced in the intervention group, and PSSS scores were also significantly improved. However, no significant differences in HADS and PSSS scores between pre- and post-treatment were found in the control group. Our findings indicate that mental concern and appropriate intervention are essential parts of clinical care for COVID-19 patients.","Kong, Kong, Zheng, Tang, Chen, Zhou, Li, Diao, Wu, Jiao, Su, Dong",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.586355,20201218.0,COVID-19; anxiety; depression; psychological-behavioral intervention; social support,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
67,"Mental Health Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on International University Students, Related Stressors, and Coping Strategies","<b>Background:</b> The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted university teaching globally. The mental health impacts on international university students have been overlooked. <b>Aims:</b> This study examined the differences in COVID-19-related stressors and mental health impacts between international university students studying in the UK or USA who returned to their home country or region (returnees) and those who stayed in their institution country (stayers), and identified COVID-19-related stressors and coping strategies that were predictors of mental health. <b>Method:</b> An online questionnaire survey was conducted from April 28 through May 12, 2020 using an exponential, non-discriminative snowball sampling strategy (registered at the National Institutes of Health: NCT04365361). <b>Results:</b> A total of 124 full-time international university students (36.3% male) were included: 75.8% had returned to their home country or region for reasons related to COVID-19; 77.4% were pursuing a bachelor's program, and 53.2% were in programs with practicum component. 84.7% of all students had moderate-to-high perceived stress, 12.1% had moderate-to-severe symptoms of anxiety and depression, and 17.7% had moderate-to-severe symptoms of insomnia. Compared with returnees, stayers had significantly higher stress from COVID-19-related stressors such as personal health and lack of social support (Cohen's d: 0.57-1.11), higher perceived stress [10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10)] {22.6 Â± 6.2 vs. 19.1 Â± 6.1, Î² [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 4.039 (0.816, 7.261), Cohen's d: 0.52}, and more severe insomnia symptoms [Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)] [11.8 Â± 6.1 vs. 7.6 Â± 5.2, Î² (95% CI): 3.087 (0.262, 5.912), Cohen's d: 0.45], with moderate-to-large effect sizes. Compared with males, females reported significantly higher stress from uncertainties about academic program (Cohen's d: 0.45) with a small effect size. In the total sample, stress related to academics (e.g., personal attainment, uncertainties about academic program, and changes in teaching/learning format), health (including personal health and health of family and friends), availability of reliable COVID-19-related information, and lack of social support predicted more negative mental health impacts. Resilience, positive thinking, and exercise were predictors of less severe mental health impacts. <b>Conclusions:</b> Stayers experienced more adverse mental health impacts than returnees. We call on educators and mental health professionals to provide appropriate support for international students, particularly the stayers, during the pandemic.","Lai, Lee, Wang, Feng, Lai, Ho, Lam, Ip, Lam",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.584240,20201218.0,anxiety; coping; depression; insomnia; mental health; stress; students; university,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
68,A Systematic Review of the Impact of Viral Respiratory Epidemics on Mental Health: An Implication on the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic,"<b>Background:</b> The twenty-first century viral respiratory epidemics have taught us valuable lessons. Our systematic review examined the impact of these epidemics, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), on mental health among different population groups, drawing on their insights for recommendations for the current COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> Searches were performed on PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, and Cochrane on April 4, 2020. Studies that had undefined mental health outcomes or did not use a validated scale for measure were excluded. Quality assessment was carried out <i>via</i> the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. <b>Results:</b> We included 95 studies, most of which were conducted in Hong Kong (31.6%) and China (21.4%). A total of 30 (30.9%) studies are on the general public, 41 (42.2%) on healthcare workers, and 26 (26.6%) on patients and quarantined individuals. Furthermore, 36 (37.1%) of the studies are of high quality, 48 (49.5%) are of moderate quality, and 13 (13.4%) are of low quality. The most significant mental health outcomes reported include anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. The subgroups identified to have a higher risk of psychiatric symptoms among the general public include females, the elderly, individuals with chronic illness, migrant workers, and students. Long-term mental health impact was reported in some healthcare workers and epidemic patients, even up to 3 years in the former. Interestingly, when compared to non-quarantined groups, quarantine was not significantly associated with worse mental health outcomes. <b>Conclusion:</b> Important implications for the COVID-19 pandemic were highlighted. Respiratory epidemics pose a significant psychological morbidity onto many population groups. Psychological support for vulnerable groups, including healthcare workers and patients, should be implemented to prevent them from spiraling into clinical psychiatric conditions.","Luo, Chua, Xiong, Ho, Ho",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.565098,20201218.0,COVID-19; MERS; SARS; coronavirus; epidemics; influenza; mental health,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
69,"Time Trends of the Public's Attention Toward Suicide During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Retrospective, Longitudinal Time-Series Study","The COVID-19 pandemic has overwhelmed health care systems around the world. Emerging evidence has suggested that substantially few patients seek help for suicidality at clinical settings during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has elicited concerns of an imminent mental health crisis as the course of the pandemic continues to unfold. Clarifying the relationship between the public's attention to knowledge about suicide and the public's attention to knowledge about the COVID-19 pandemic may provide insight into developing prevention strategies for a putative surge of suicide in relation to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The goal of this retrospective, longitudinal time-series study is to understand the relationship between temporal trends of interest for the search term &quot;suicide&quot; and those of COVID-19-related terms, such as &quot;social distancing,&quot; &quot;school closure,&quot; and &quot;lockdown.&quot; We used the Google Trends platform to collect data on daily interest levels for search terms related to suicide, several other mental health-related issues, and COVID-19 over the period between February 14, 2020 and May 13, 2020. A correlational analysis was performed to determine the association between the search term ''suicide'' and COVID-19-related search terms in 16 countries. The Mann-Kendall test was used to examine significant differences between interest levels for the search term &quot;suicide&quot; before and after school closure. We found that interest levels for the search term &quot;suicide&quot; statistically significantly inversely correlated with interest levels for the search terms &quot;COVID-19&quot; or &quot;coronavirus&quot; in nearly all countries between February 14, 2020 and May 13, 2020. Additionally, search interest for the term ''suicide'' significantly and negatively correlated with that of many COVID-19-related search terms, and search interest varied between countries. The Mann-Kendall test was used to examine significant differences between search interest levels for the term &quot;suicide&quot; before and after school closure. The Netherlands (P=.19), New Zealand (P=.003), the United Kingdom (P=.006), and the United States (P=.049) showed significant negative trends in interest levels for suicide in the 2-week period preceding school closures. In contrast, interest levels for suicide had a significant positive trend in Canada (P&lt;.001) and the United States (P=.002) after school closures. The public's attention to suicide might inversely correlate with the public's attention to COVID-19-related issues. Additionally, several anticontagion policies, such as school closure, might have led to a turning point for mental health crises, because the attention to suicidality increased after restrictions were implemented. Our results suggest that an increased risk of suicidal ideation may ensue due to the ongoing anticontagion policies. Timely intervention strategies for suicides should therefore be an integral part of efforts to flatten the epidemic curve.","Burnett, Eapen, Lin",https://doi.org/10.2196/24694,20210105.0,COVID-19; Google Trends; attention; crisis; infodemiology; infoveillance; mental health; school closure; suicide; time series; time trend; Attention; COVID-19; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Public Opinion; Retrospective Studies; Search Engine; Suicide; Time Factors,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
70,A Novel Artificial Intelligence-Powered Emotional Intelligence and Mindfulness App (Ajivar) for the College Student Population During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Quantitative Questionnaire Study,"Emotional intelligence (EI) and mindfulness can impact the level of anxiety and depression that an individual experiences. These symptoms have been exacerbated among college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ajivar is an app that utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to deliver personalized mindfulness and EI training. The main objective of this research study was to determine the effectiveness of delivering an EI curriculum and mindfulness techniques using an AI conversation platform, Ajivar, to improve symptoms of anxiety and depression during this pandemic. A total of 99 subjects, aged 18 to 29 years, were recruited from a second-semester group of freshmen students. All participants completed the online TestWell Wellness Inventory at the start and end of the 14-week semester. The comparison group members (49/99, 49%) were given routine mental wellness instruction. The intervention group members (50/99, 51%) were required to complete Ajivar activities in addition to routine mental wellness instruction during the semester, which coincided with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. This group also completed assessments to evaluate for anxiety, using the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale, and depression, using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Study participants reported a mean age of 19.9 (SD 1.94) years; 27% (27/99) of the group were male and 60% (59/99) identified as Caucasian. No significant demographic differences existed between the comparison and intervention groups. Subjects in the intervention group interacted with Ajivar for a mean time of 1424 (SD 1168) minutes. There was a significant decrease in anxiety, as measured by the GAD-7: the mean score was 11.47 (SD 1.85) at the start of the study compared to 6.27 (SD 1.44) at the end (P&lt;.001). There was a significant reduction in the symptoms of depression measured by the PHQ-9: the mean score was 10.69 (SD 2.04) at the start of the study compared to 6.69 (SD 2.41) at the end (P=.001). Both the intervention and comparison groups independently had significant improvements in the TestWell Wellness Inventory from pretest to posttest. The subgroups in the social awareness and spirituality inventories showed significant improvement in the intervention group. In a subgroup of participants (11/49, 22%) where the GAD-7 was available during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an increase in anxiety from the start of the study (mean score 11.63, SD 2.16) to mid-March (ie, onset of the pandemic) (mean score 13.03, SD 1.48; P=.23), followed by a significant decrease at the end of the study period (mean score 5.9, SD 1.44; P=.001).

The literature consulted indicates that healthcare workers, who are the first to respond, are generally the ones who pay the highest price. The present study assesses the extent of anxious and depressive symptoms among these actors responding to COVID-19, in the context of Cameroon. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to assess anxious and depressive symptoms. Data collection involved the use of a web questionnaire for this purpose through the Google Forms virtual platform. The questionnaire link was sent to professional groups spread throughout Cameroon's ten regions. A total of 331 health professionals were interviewed over the period from April 5 to 19, 2020. The results show a high rate of anxiety (41.8%) and depression (42.8%). There is a higher susceptibility to depression in young people (30-39 years). Fear of contamination and fear of death are modulators of depression and anxiety. The anxiety-depression comorbidity in the sample is 14.73%. The prevalence rates of major depressive disorder and adjustment disorder in the sample were 8.2% and 3.3%, respectively. The data presented confirm the trends recorded in the literature regarding the impact of fatal epidemics on the mental health of healthcare workers. The results indicate, as is the case with most of the work consulted in the literature, that the Covid 19 pandemic is significantly affecting the mental health of healthcare workers. This underlines the urgency of setting up a specialized aid and / or support system, in the context of the current pandemic, such as that of similar health crises. Such a device does not exist in Cameroon, where the mental health response remains weak. These results suggest that the healthcare staff involved in the response to COVID-19 in Cameroon are significantly affected in their mental health. This underlines the need for specialized psychological help for nursing staff.","Mboua, Keubo, Fouaka",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.evopsy.2020.11.002,20201231.0,Adjustment disorder; Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Major depressive disorder; Mental health,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
72,Effects of COVID-19 Epidemic Lockdown on Postpartum Depressive Symptoms in a Sample of Italian Mothers,"The extraordinary health emergency of the COVID-19 pandemic represents a new challenge for mental health researchers and clinical practitioners. The related containment measures may be a risk factor for psychological distress and mood disorders, especially in at-risk populations. This study aims to explore the impact of COVID-19 on postpartum depressive symptoms in mothers with children below 1 year of age. An online questionnaire survey was therefore conducted in Italy between May and June 2020. The survey consisted of several self-administered questionnaires: besides some <i>ad-hoc</i> questionnaires, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), the Scale of Perceived Social Support (SPSS) and the Maternity Social Support Scale (MSSS) were used. Two hundred forty-three Italian women were included in the study. The prevalence of postpartum depression symptomatology among mothers was 44%, as measured through the EPDS (cut-off &gt;12). Women who spent the isolation in northern Italy adopted maladaptive coping strategies significantly more than women living in areas at lower risk. The analysis highlighted a significant difference between the group that was not directly affected by the virus and women who have had a direct or indirect contact with it. Besides situational factors specific to the pandemic, the results show that there are some risk factors tied to the personal history of the mother (e.g., having had a previous abortion). These data should inform and enlighten future protocols of intervention.","Spinola, Liotti, Speranza, Tambelli",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.589916,20201216.0,COVID- 19; lockdown; mental health; motherhood; postpartum depression (PPD),PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
73,Mental Health Status of Psychogeriatric Patients During the 2019 New Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic and Effects on Caregiver Burden,"<b>Introduction:</b> There is a growing awareness about the noxious effects of the 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic on the mental health of the elderly. However, there is limited information from clinically driven research. The objectives of the present study were to examine the magnitude of psychiatric symptoms and to determine their association with caregiver distress, in a cross-section of community-dwelling older adults and a subsample of aging adults with Down syndrome (DS) attending a psychogeriatric service in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. <b>Method:</b> Telephone-based interviews and electronically filled self-assessment questionnaires were used to collect information from patients and caregivers, addressing their impressions and concerns about the pandemic and related effects on the patient's emotional state and behavior. Clinical information was obtained from hospital charts, medical records, and psychometric tests administered through telephone interviews [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q)]. <b>Results:</b> We included 100 consecutive participants, comprising 71 older adults with psychogeriatric/neurocognitive disorders and 29 aging adults with DS. Higher HADS and NPI-Q scores were significantly associated with caregiver distress (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) in both groups. Correlation analyses indicated strong, positive associations between caregiver burden and scores in HADS anxiety (HADS-A) and HADS depression (HADS-D) scales in the subsamples of euploid and DS subjects. Higher NPI-Q scores in the former group were also correlated with caregiver distress, with stronger associations for neuropsychiatric symptoms. Similar findings were observed among DS subjects. ANOVA tests indicated significant associations between NPI-Q scores and caregiver distress among dementia patients, as well as with HADS scores. Similar results were found after multiple linear regressions; as such, among the elderly subsample, higher scores in HADS-A (<i>p</i> = 0.002) and HADS-D (<i>p</i> = 0.001) predict a significant impact on caregiver burden (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.00001, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> 0.46); taking into consideration caregiver burden as a dependent variable and NPI-Q total score as an independent variable, we obtained significant strong prediction values for either DS (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.00001, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> 0.95) or elderly adults (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.00001, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> 0.88). <b>Conclusion:</b> During the COVID-19 pandemic, patients with neurocognitive disorders present with clinically relevant neuropsychiatric symptoms, with significant impact on caregiver distress. Apathy, aberrant motor behavior, sleep disorders, and psychoses were the main psychopathological domains, which had determined caregiver burden worsening.","Penteado, Loureiro, Pais, Carvalho, Sant'Ana, Valiengo, Stella, Forlenza",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.578672,20201216.0,Down syndrome; caregiver burden; caregiver distress; coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); mental health; pandemic; psychogeriatrics,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

An online questionnaire was applied with questions to assess sociodemographic characteristics and physical exercise during the CoVID-19 pandemic, in addition to depression, anxiety, and stress analysis. The study was approved by the local ethics committee (CAAE: 31521720.8.0000.5082). <b>Results:</b> One thousand one hundred and fifty four answered the questionnaire (69.84% female). During the isolation period, the number of participants who declared not to exercise was 54.16%. Women generaly presented higher levels of anxiety, depression, and stress when compared to men (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001 for all domains). The risk of having increased anxiety were 118% higher (OR = 2.183; 95% CI = 1.717-2.775), the risk of depression was 152% higher (OR = 2.525; 95% CI = 1.991-3.205), and the risk of stress symptoms increased 75.1% (OR = 1.751; 95% CI = 1.386-2.213) in the participants who did not perform PE when compared to those who maintain regular PE. <b>Conclusion:</b> People who was not involved with PE during the COVID-19 pandemic had higher anxiety, depression, and stress scores.

77,Healthy Dietary Intake Behavior Potentially Modifies the Negative Effect of COVID-19 Lockdown on Depression: A Hospital and Health Center Survey,"<b>Background:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic causes a huge burden for affected countries. Several public health interventions were applied to contain the infection. However, the pandemic itself and the lockdown measure negatively influence people's lifestyles and psychological health. <b>Purpose:</b> To explore determinants of healthy dietary intake and depression, and examine the interaction between healthy dietary intake and COVID-19 lockdown on depression. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional study was conducted at 18 hospitals and health centers from February 14 to May 31, 2020. Data of 8,291 outpatients were collected including patients' characteristics, clinical parameters, health literacy, healthy dietary intake (using the healthy eating score, HES), other health-related behaviors, and depression (using the patient health questionnaire, PHQ). Depression was defined as PHQ score â‰¥ 10. <b>Results:</b> Protective factors of healthy dietary intake and depression were higher education, better medication payment ability, higher social status, more physical activity, and higher health literacy, whereas older age, ever married, own business or other types of occupation, lockdown, suspected COVID-19 symptoms, and comorbidity were associated with lower HES scores and a higher depression likelihood. Besides, overweight/obesity and alcohol drinking were associated with lower HES scores. As compared with patients not under lockdown and with lowest HES score, those who were under lockdown and with lowest HES score had 10.6 times higher depression likelihood (odds ratio, OR, 10.60; 95% CI 6.88, 16.32; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), whereas people with higher HES score had 15% lower depression likelihood (OR 0.85; 95% CI 0.82, 0.89; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). <b>Conclusions:</b> Healthy dietary intake and depression were determined by several sociodemographic, clinical, and behavioral factors.

78,Poor Sleep Quality and Its Consequences on Mental Health During the COVID-19 Lockdown in Italy,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) seriously affected the whole of Italy. The extreme virulence and the speed of propagation resulted in restrictions and home confinement. This change was immediately perceived by people who found themselves exposed to feelings of uncertainty, fear, anger, stress, and a drastic change in the diurnal but above all nocturnal lifestyle. For these reasons, we aimed to study the quality of sleep and its connection to distress levels and to evaluate how lifestyle changed in the Italian population during the lockdown. By means of an Internet survey we recruited 6,519 adults during the whole of the COVID-19 lockdown (from March 10-1st phase to May 4-2nd phase). We investigated the sociodemographic and COVID-19-related information and assessed sleep quality using the Medical Outcomes Study-sleep scale (MOS-SS) and mental health with the short form of Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales-21 Items (DASS-21). Multiple logistic regression model was used to evaluate the multivariate association between the dependent variable (good sleeper vs. poor sleeper) and all the variables that were significant in the univariate analysis. A total of 3,562 (55.32%) participants reported poor sleep quality according to the MOS-Sleep Index II score. The multiple binary logistic regression results of poor sleepers revealed several risk factors during the outbreak restrictions: female gender, living in Central Italy, having someone close who died because of COVID-19, markedly changed sleep-wake rhythms characterized by earlier or postponed habitual bedtime, earlier habitual awakening time and reduced number of afternoon naps, and extremely severe levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. This is the first study designed to understand sleep quality and sleep habits during the whole of the lockdown period in the Italian population that provides more than 6,000 participants in a survey developed specifically for the health emergency related to COVID-19. Our study found that more than half of the Italian population had impaired sleep quality and sleep habits due to elevated psychological distress during the COVID-19 lockdown containment measures. A multidisciplinary action should be undertaken in order to plan appropriate responses to the current crisis caused by the lockdown for the COVID-19 outbreak.","Franceschini, Musetti, Zenesini, Palagini, Scarpelli, Quattropani, Lenzo, Freda, Lemmo, Vegni, Borghi, Saita, Cattivelli, De Gennaro, Plazzi, Riemann, Castelnuovo",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.574475,20201212.0,COVID-19; Italian lockdown; anxiety; clinical psychology; depression; sleep habits; sleep quality; stress,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
79,Association of Social Media Use With Mental Health Conditions of Nonpatients During the COVID-19 Outbreak: Insights from a National Survey Study,"Considerable research has been devoted to examining the mental health conditions of patients with COVID-19 and medical staff attending to these patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there are few insights concerning how the pandemic may take a toll on the mental health of the general population, and especially of nonpatients (ie, individuals who have not contracted COVID-19). This study aimed to investigate the association between social media use and mental health conditions in the general population based on a national representative sample during the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. We formed a national representative sample (N=2185) comprising participants from 30 provinces across China, who were the first to experience the COVID-19 outbreak in the world. We administered a web-based survey to these participants to analyze social media use, health information support received via social media, and possible psychiatric disorders, including secondary traumatic stress (STS) and vicarious trauma (VT). Social media use did not cause mental health issues, but it mediated the levels of traumatic emotions among nonpatients. Participants received health information support via social media, but excessive social media use led to elevated levels of stress (Î²=.175; P&lt;.001), anxiety (Î²=.224; P&lt;.001), depression (Î²=.201; P&lt;.001), STS (Î²=.307; P&lt;.001), and VT (Î²=.688; P&lt;.001). Geographic location (or geolocation) and lockdown conditions also contributed to more instances of traumatic disorders. Participants living in big cities were more stressed than those living in rural areas (P=.02). Furthermore, participants from small cities or towns were more anxious (P=.01), stressed (P&lt;.001), and depressed (P=.008) than those from rural areas. Obtaining more informational support (Î²=.165; P&lt;.001) and emotional support (Î²=.144; P&lt;.001) via social media increased their VT levels. Peer support received via social media increased both VT (Î²=.332; P&lt;.001) and STS (Î²=.130; P&lt;.001) levels. Moreover, geolocation moderated the relationships between emotional support on social media and VT (F<sub>2</sub>=3.549; P=.029) and the association between peer support and STS (F<sub>2</sub>=5.059; P=.006). Geolocation also interacted with health information support in predicting STS (F<sub>2</sub>=5.093; P=.006). COVID-19 has taken a severe toll on the mental health of the general population, including individuals who have no history of psychiatric disorders or coronavirus infection. This study contributes to the literature by establishing the association between social media use and psychiatric disorders among the general public during the COVID-19 outbreak. The study findings suggest that the causes of such psychiatric disorders are complex and multifactorial, and social media use is a potential factor. The findings also highlight the experiences of people in China and can help global citizens and health policymakers to mitigate the effects of psychiatric disorders during this and other public health crises, which should be regarded as a key component of a global pandemic response.","Zhong, Jiang, Xie, Qin",https://doi.org/10.2196/23696,20210101.0,COVID-19; health information support; mental health; secondary traumatic stress; social media; social support; vicarious trauma,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
80,"The effect of Emotional Freedom Techniques on nurses' stress, anxiety, and burnout levels during the COVID-19 pandemic: A randomized controlled trial","Infectious disease outbreaks pose psychological challenges to the general population, and especially to healthcare workers. Nurses who work with COVID-19 patients are particularly vulnerable to emotions such as fear and anxiety, due to fatigue, discomfort, and helplessness related to their high intensity work. This study aims to investigate the efficacy of a brief online form of Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT) in the prevention of stress, anxiety, and burnout in nurses involved in the treatment of COVID patients. The study is a randomized controlled trial. It complies with the guidelines prescribed by the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) checklist. It was conducted in a COVID-19 department at a university hospital in Turkey. We recruited nurses who care for patients infected with COVID-19 and randomly allocated them into an intervention group (nÂ =Â 35) and a no-treatment control group (nÂ =Â 37). The intervention group received one guided online group EFT session. Reductions in stress (p &lt; .001), anxiety (p &lt; .001), and burnout (p &lt; .001) reached high levels of statistical significance for the intervention group.

81,&quot;Staying at home&quot; to tackle COVID-19 pandemic: rhetoric or reality? Cross-cutting analysis of nine population groups vulnerable to homelessness in Japan,"Although the &quot;stay-at-home&quot; order is advocated against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the lives of individuals lacking adequate housing are threatened. We developed a framework to assess various populations with unstable housing in terms of socio-economic consequences of COVID-19, risk of COVID-19 infection and progression, existing/urgent measures, and remaining challenges. Within the framework, nine groups vulnerable to homelessness in Japan were classified into (i) &quot;people without accommodation,&quot; (ii) &quot;people living in temporary or crisis accommodation,&quot; and (iii) populations that include &quot;people living in severely inadequate and insecure accommodation.&quot; The assessment revealed that &quot;staying at home&quot; was physically and practically unattainable across groups. The study identified specific institutional, social, and cultural challenges apart from the common economic crisis, whereas the utilization of social welfare was low. Findings suggest that the rapid increase of groups classified as &quot;(i)&quot; and &quot;(ii)&quot; should be addressed by engaging stakeholders to enhance the availability and accessibility of social welfare and rescue measures, and to ensure safe and private accommodations for all groups. It is critical to enhance multi-sectoral collaboration in responding to the common and specific vulnerabilities of these population groups from health, socio-economic, and humanitarian perspectives. Under the pandemic, homelessness should be regarded less as a peculiar problem for specific populations but an extension of daily life. The framework can be a reference when planning the comprehensive yet concise assessment of populations with unstable housing in other countries to inform responses to the pandemic.","Fujita, Matsuoka, Kiyohara, Kumakura, Takeda, Goishi, Tarui, Inaba, Nagai, Hachiya, Fujita",https://doi.org/10.1186/s41182-020-00281-0,20201212.0,COVID-19; Homelessness; Staying at home; Vulnerable populations,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
82,Analysis of news media reports of suicides and attempted suicides during the COVID-19 lockdown in India,"Based on previous experience there is justifiable concern about suicidal behaviour and news media reporting of it during COVID-19 pandemic. This study used a systematic search of online news media reports (versions of newspapers, magazine and other digital publications) of suicidal behaviour during India's COVID-19 lockdown and compared it to corresponding dates in 2019. Data was gathered using a uniform search strategy from 56 online news media publications 24 March to 3 May for the years 2019 and 2020 using keywords, suicide, attempted suicide, hangs self and kills self. Demographic variables and methods used for suicide were compared for suicide and attempts between the 2Â years using chi-squared tests (Ï‡<sup>2</sup>). There were online news media reports of 369 cases of suicides and attempted suicides during COVID lockdown vs 220 reports in 2019, a 67.7% increase in online news media reports of suicidal behaviour. Compared to 2019, suicides reported during lockdown were significantly older (30 vs 50Â years, pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.05), men (71.2% vs 58.7%; pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.01), married (77.7% vs 49%; pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.01) and employed (82.9% vs 59.5%; pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.01). During the lockdown, significantly more suicides were by hanging (64.4% vs 42%), while poisoning (8.5% vs 21.5%) and jumping in front of a train (2% vs 9.4%) (pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.05) were significantly reduced. Comparison of COVID and non-COVID groups showed that online news media reports of COVID cases of suicide and attempted suicide were significantly more likely to be men (84.7% vs 60.4%; pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.01), older (31-50Â years 52.9% vs 25.8%; pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.01) employed (91.5% vs 64.3%; pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.01), had poor mental (40.1% vs 20.8%; pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.01) and poor physical health (24.8% vs 7.9%;11.8, pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.01). Increase in online news media reports of suicides and attempts during COVID-19 lockdown may indicate an increase in journalists' awareness about suicide or more sensational media reporting or may be a proxy indicator of a real community increase in suicidal behaviour. It is difficult to attribute changes in demographic profile and methods used only to changes in journalists' reporting behaviour and should be further explored. We therefore call upon the Government of India to urgently release national suicide data to help devise a comprehensive suicide prevention strategy to address COVID-19 suicidal behaviour.","Pathare, Vijayakumar, Fernandes, Shastri, Kapoor, Pandit, Lohumi, Ray, Kulkarni, Korde",https://doi.org/10.1186/s13033-020-00422-2,20201212.0,Attempted suicides; COVID-19; India; Lockdown; Reports; Suicide,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

84,The Impact of Coping Strategies and Perceived Family Support on Depressive and Anxious Symptomatology During the Coronavirus Pandemic (COVID-19) Lockdown,"The coronavirus pandemic represents a severe global crisis, affecting physical, and psychological health. Lockdown rules imposed to counteract the rapid growth of COVID-19, mainly social restrictions, have represented a risk factor for developing depressive and anxious symptoms. The research aims are to explore the effect of coping strategies and perceived social support on depressive and anxious symptomatology during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ninety-six healthy people (46 males, mean age = 39.3; <i>SD</i> = 16.6) completed through on-line platform: Socio-demographic questionnaire, Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (CISS), Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) and Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R), 3 weeks after the imposition of lockdown restrictions. SCL-90-R Depression scores showed significant positive correlation with CISS Emotion (<i>r</i> = 0.85; <i>p</i> = 0.001) and Avoidant (<i>r</i> = 0.34; <i>p</i> = 0.018), a significant negative correlation with MSPSS Family support (<i>r</i> = -0.43; <i>p</i> = 0.003). SCL-90-R Anxiety scores showed a significant positive correlation with CISS Emotion (<i>r</i> = 0.72; <i>p</i> = 0.001) and Avoidant (<i>r</i> = 0.35; <i>p</i> = 0.016). No significant correlations between both CISS Emotion and Avoidant scales with social support emerged. Two Multiple Linear Regression analysis were performed using, respectively, SCL-90-R Depression and Anxiety scores as dependent variables, and the CISS and MSPSS scales, age, and gender as predictors. The first regression model (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.78; adjusted <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.75) revealed CISS Emotion (Î² = 0.83; <i>p</i> = 0.001) and MSPSS Family support (Î² = -0.24; <i>p</i> = 0.004) had a predictive effect on SCL-90-R Depression scores. The second regression model (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.52; adjusted <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.472) revealed that only CISS Emotion (Î² = 0.71; <i>p</i> = 0.001) predicted the SCL-90-R Anxiety scores. In conclusion, during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns, coping focus on emotions seemed to increase anxious and depressive symptoms, probably due to the uncontrollable nature of the stressful event and the high emotional response. Family support which reduces the sense of loneliness had an exclusive role in mitigating depressive symptoms. These results highlight the importance of promoting psychological strategies to improve emotional regulation skills, reducing isolation from family, to prevent mood symptomatology in healthy citizens during large-scale health crises.","Mariani, Renzi, Di Trani, Trabucchi, Danskin, Tambelli",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.587724,20201208.0,COVID-19; anxiety; coping strategies; coronavirus pandemic; depression; perceived support,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
85,Identification of Functional Limitations and Discharge Destination in Patients With COVID-19,"The objectives of this study were to identify functional limitations in patients with coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) admitted to acute care hospitals; to evaluate functional limitations by demographic, medical, and encounter characteristics; and to examine functional limitations in relation to discharge destination. and Setting:This is a cross-sectional, retrospective study of adult patients with COVID-19 who were discharged from 2 different types of hospitals (academic medical center and a community hospital) within 1 health care system from January 1 to April 30,Â 2020. Patients were identified from the Cedars-Sinai COVID-19 data registry who had a new-onset positive test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. A total of 273 patients were identified, which included 230 patients who were discharged alive and 43 patients who died and were excluded from the study sample. Not applicable. Functional limitations in patients with COVID-19 in acute care hospitals and the predictors for discharge disposition. A total of 230 records were analyzed including demographic, encounter, medical, and functional variables. In a propensity score-matched cohort based on age and comorbidity, 88.2% had functional physical health deficits, 72.5% had functional mental health deficits, and 17.6% experienced sensory deficits. In the matched cohort, individuals discharged to an institution experienced greater physical (62.7% vs 25.5%, P&lt;.001) and mental health (49.0% vs 23.5%, P=.006) deficits than patients discharged home. Marital status (odds ratio, 3.17; P=.011) and physical function deficits (odds ratio, 3.63; P=.025) were associated with an increase odds ratio of discharge to an institution. This research highlights that functional status is a strong predictor for discharge destination to an institution for patients with COVID-19. Patients who were older, in the acute care hospital longer, and with comorbidities were more likely to be discharged to an institution. Rehabilitation is a significant aspect of the health care system for these vulnerable patients. The challenges of adjusting the role of rehabilitation providers and systems during the pandemic needs further exploration. Moreover, additional research is needed to look more closely at the many facets and timing of functional status needs, to shed light in use of interdisciplinary rehabilitation services, and to guide providers and health care systems in facilitating optimal recovery and patient outcomes.","Roberts, Wertheimer, Park, NuÃ±o, Riggs",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apmr.2020.11.005,20201228.0,COVID-19; Rehabilitation,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

87,Burnout and Associated Factors Among Health Care Workers in Singapore During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The strain on health care systems due to the COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased psychological distress among health care workers (HCWs). As this global crisis continues with little signs of abatement, we examine burnout and associated factors among HCWs. Cross-sectional survey study. Doctors, nurses, allied health professionals, administrative, and support staff in 4 public hospitals and 1 primary care service in Singapore 3Â months after COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic. Study questionnaire captured demographic and workplace environment information and comprised 3 validated instruments, namely the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI), Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Multivariate mixed model regression analyses were used to evaluate independent associations of mean OLBI-Disengagement and -Exhaustion scores. Further subgroup analysis was performed among redeployed HCWs. Among 11,286 invited HCWs, 3075 valid responses were received, giving an overall response rate of 27.2%. Mean OLBI scores were 2.38 and 2.50 for Disengagement and Exhaustion, respectively. Burnout thresholds in Disengagement and Exhaustion were met by 79.7% and 75.3% of respondents, respectively. On multivariate regression analysis, Chinese or Malay ethnicity, HADS anxiety or depression scores â‰¥8, shifts lasting â‰¥8Â hours, and being redeployed were significantly associated with higher OLBI mean scores, whereas high SAQ scores were significantly associated with lower scores. Among redeployed HCWs, those redeployed to high-risk areas in a different facility (offsite) had lower burnout scores than those redeployed within their own work facility (onsite). A higher proportion of HCWs redeployed offsite assessed their training to be good or better compared with those redeployed onsite. Every level of the health care workforce is susceptible to high levels of burnout during this pandemic. Modifiable workplace factors include adequate training, avoiding prolonged shifts â‰¥8Â hours, and promoting safe working environments. Mitigating strategies should target every level of the health care workforce, including frontline and nonfrontline staff. Addressing and ameliorating burnout among HCWs should be a key priority for the sustainment of efforts to care for patients in the face of a prolonged pandemic.","Tan, Kanneganti, Lim, Tan, Chua, Tan, Sia, Denning, Goh, Purkayastha, Kinross, Sim, Chan, Ooi",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2020.09.035,20201218.0,"COVID-19; anxiety; burnout; depression; health care workers; pandemic; Adult; Anxiety; Burnout, Professional; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Singapore; Surveys and Questionnaires",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
88,&quot;The psychological impact of COVID-19 on medical education of final year students in Pakistan: A cross-sectional study&quot;,"COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a strong impact on students' wellbeing, with associated uncertainty about the future. We conducted a cross-sectional survey to assess the psychological effects of COVID-19 on the medical education of final year students in Pakistan. We conducted prospective, cross-sectional survey, as a snapshot, from June 07, 2020 till June 16, 2020, among final year medical and dental students. The 20-questions survey questionnaire was based on rating-scale items to focus on psychological symptoms, institutional preparedness for such crisis and confidence in becoming a future doctor. Descriptive statistics were calculated using Multivariate regression analysis. Majority of participants (nâ€¯=â€¯1753/2661, 65.9%) were female. Despite timely closure of institutes, delay in the start of the online teaching (beta coefficient 0.08, P-value 0.02) was significantly correlated with the depressive symptoms. A significant percentage of students (nâ€¯=â€¯1594, 59.9%) wanted a delay in exit exams due to intimidation. A similar proportion of students also lost confidence to be a competent doctor in future which was positively associated with male gender (beta coefficient 0.21, P-valueâ€¯&lt;â€¯0.001). Our study shows that COVID-19 pandemic has brought significant psychological influence on the medical education of final year students. Despite a stressful crisis, final year medical and dental students are still willing to serve the community. In addition to supporting their emotions and psychological wellbeing, stress counselling, and transforming current medical curricula is crucial to pursue ceaseless medical education and to become a safe future doctor.","Dhahri, Arain, Memon, Rao, Mian",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2020.11.025,20201201.0,,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
89,"Young people, mental health and COVID-19 infection: the canaries we put in the coal mine","The number of people testing positive for Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) in the UK, particularly among young adults, is increasing. We report here on the mental health of young adults and related psychological and behavioural responses to the pandemic and consider the role of these factors in fuelling the increase in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in this group. An online survey was completed during the first six weeks of the first UK-wide lockdown by 3097 respondents, including data for 364 respondents aged 18-24 years. The survey included measures of mental health and indices capturing related psychological and behavioural responses to the pandemic. The mental health of 18- to 24-years-olds in the first 6 weeks of lockdown was significantly poorer than that of older respondents and previously published norms: with 84% reporting symptoms of depression and 72% reporting symptoms of anxiety. Young adults also reported significantly greater loneliness and reduced positive mood, both of which were also associated with greater mental health difficulties. We contend that the combination of mental health, social and economic considerations may have contributed to the rise of COVID-19 infections in young adults, and ascribing blame to this group will not aid our efforts to regain control of the disease.","Jia, Ayling, Chalder, Massey, Broadbent, Morling, Coupland, Vedhara",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2020.10.018,20210101.0,Behaviour; COVID-19; Mental health; Young people; Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior; Anxiety; Anxiety Disorders; COVID-19; Communicable Disease Control; Depression; Female; Humans; Loneliness; Male; Mental Health; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires; United Kingdom; Young Adult,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
90,Predictors of managers' mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic,"This study reports early evidence of managers' mental health and its predictors during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in May 2020. In a sample of 646 managers from 49 countries, 5.3% (32) of managers reached the cut-off levels for disorders in distress (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale-6; K-6), 7.3% (38) experienced anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder-7; GAD-7), and 10.7% (56) had depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9; PHQ-9). Age, relative income, and work status each predicted at least one of the conditions. Managers' 'illegitimate tasks' caused by COVID-19 predicted all three. Particularly noteworthy is the finding that the degree of downsizing an organization experienced during COVID-19 significantly predicted distress, anxiety, and depression for managers at the highest level (board members) only. This study helps identify managers in need of healthcare services as the COVID-19 pandemic affects organizations and their managers around the world. Este estudio informa sobre evidencia temprana en salud mental de los gerentes y sus predictores durante la pandemia de la enfermedad del coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) en mayo de 2020.

La edad, los ingresos relativos y la situaciÃ³n laboral predijeron por si solos al menos una de las condiciones. Las â€˜tareas ilegÃ­timasâ€™ de los gerentes causadas por COVID-19 predijeron las tres. Particularmente digno de menciÃ³n es el hallazgo de que el grado de reducciÃ³n que experimentÃ³ una organizaciÃ³n durante el COVID-19 predijo significativamente angustia, ansiedad y depresiÃ³n solo para los gerentes del mÃ¡s alto nivel (miembros del directorio).

92,A Digital Program (Hope) for People Living With Cancer During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Protocol for a Feasibility Randomized Controlled Trial,"During the COVID-19 lockdown period in the United Kingdom that began on March 23, 2020, more than a quarter of a million people with cancer reported worsening mental health. Help to Overcome Problems Effectively (Hope) is a self-management program for people with cancer, designed to provide support for distress, unmet needs, and poor psychological health. In light of social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic, digital delivery of the Hope Programme has become ever more vital for people with cancer. Previous pre-post studies of the digital Hope Programme have found reduced anxiety and depression and improved well-being for people with cancer. However, evaluation of this evidence has been limited by the lack of a control group in these previous studies. We now present a protocol for a feasibility randomized controlled trial of the digital Hope Programme for people with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. Primary outcomes will be recruitment, dropout, and adherence rates, and estimations of sample and effect size. To detect signals of efficacy, secondary outcomes will be participant mental health and well-being. Participants will be recruited by Macmillan Cancer Support (MCS) through their social media networks. The study will employ a feasibility wait-list randomized controlled trial (RCT) design, with people with cancer being randomized to join the digital Hope Programme immediately (intervention group [IG]) or join a 6-week waiting list (wait-list control group [WLCG]) with a 1:1 allocation ratio. Participants will complete digital measures of depression, anxiety, mental well-being, and confidence in managing their own health. Online questionnaires will be administered preprogram and 6 weeks postprogram. All people who had requested access to the Hope Programme from MCS (N=61) will be invited to participate in the trial. Baseline data collection commenced in April 2020, and the Hope Programme began for the IG in May 2020 and for the WLCG in June 2020. Postprogram data collection was completed by the end of August 2020. This feasibility study will provide data to inform the design of a future definitive trial. Wider-scale provision of the digital Hope Programme has potential to improve the lives of thousands of people with cancer and reduce the burden on health care providers during these unprecedented times.

94,Suicidal ideation among Bangladeshi university students early during the COVID-19 pandemic: Prevalence estimates and correlates,"Lockdown, social isolation, and interruption of daily life during the COVID-19 period have impacted many lives. University students are particularly vulnerable to such disruptions and may be particularly disposed to suicidal ideation, potentially creating a new public health crisis. This study aimed to assess suicidal ideation and associated factors among university students in Bangladesh during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted using the Google form (Google survey tool) from April to May 2020. Initially, 3366 respondents voluntarily completed the survey form. Finally, 3331 surveys were included in the final analyses after removing incomplete surveys. The data ware reviewed, rechecked, and analyzed with SPSS (25.0 version) software. A total of 1979 (59.4%) males and 1352 (40.6%) females participated. Respondents were between the ages of 18 to 28Â years (mean age 21.4Â years [SDÂ =Â 1.9]). The prevalence estimate of suicidal ideation was 12.8%. Potential risk factors included less sleep, excess sleep, cigarette smoking, past suicidal thoughts, suicide attempt history, family history of suicidality, depression, anxiety, and stress. Potential protective factors included being male, having lower SES, living in rural areas, regular physical exercise, and satisfactory study. Suicidal ideation was prevalent among Bangladeshi university students during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding the correlates of suicidal ideation may aid to develop targeted strategies to support students during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Tasnim, Islam, Sujan, Sikder, Potenza",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105703,20201215.0,Anxiety; Depression; Stress; Suicidal attempt; Suicidal thoughts,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
95,Mental Health Measurement in a Post Covid-19 World: Psychometric Properties and Invariance of the DASS-21 in Athletes and Non-athletes,"Psychological science faces a call to action researching the implications of the corona virus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. Rapid reviews have reported that maintaining rigorous research standards is a priority for the field, such as ensuring reliable and valid measurement, when investigating people's experience of Covid-19 (O'Connor et al., 2020). However, no research to date has validated a measure mental health symptomology for an athlete population. The current research addresses this gap by examining the internal consistency, factor structure, invariance, and convergent validity of the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21; Lovibond and Lovibond, 1995) in two athlete samples. Participants completed the DASS-21 and sport-specific measures of mental health such as the Profile of Mood States - Depression subscale (POMS-D), Sport Anxiety Scale-2 (SAS-2), Athlete Burnout Questionnaire (ABQ), and Athlete Psychological Strain Questionnaire (APSQ). In sample one (<i>n</i> = 894), results of exploratory structural equation modeling indicated that a three-factor model provided good fit to the data, but a bifactor model provided better fit. Factor loadings indicated minimal misspecification and higher loadings on the general-factor. Invariance testing suggested equivalence across gender, athletic expertise, sport type, and injury status. Further, latent mean differences analyses indicated that females and injured athletes scored higher than male and non-injured athletes on all DASS-21 factors reporting higher mental health symptomology, those with more expertise scored higher on the general-factor and depression and those with less expertise scored higher on anxiety and stress, and no differences between team and individual athletes. In sample two (<i>n</i> = 589), the bifactor structure was replicated. Results largely supported the scales convergent validity with depression predicting POMS-D scores, whereas all three subscales predicted the SAS-2, ABQ, and APSQ scores. Internal consistency was acceptable in both samples. The current work provides initial support for use of the DASS-21 as an operationalisation of mental health symptomology in athletes. Theoretical and practical implications of these results are discussed.","Vaughan, Edwards, MacIntyre",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.590559,20201117.0,anxiety; athletes; depression; mental health; psychometrics; stress,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
96,From &quot;<i>It Has Stopped Our Lives</i>&quot; to &quot;<i>Spending More Time Together Has Strengthened Bonds&quot;</i>: The Varied Experiences of Australian Families During COVID-19,"The present study uses a qualitative approach to understand the impact of COVID-19 on family life. Australian parents of children aged 0-18 years were recruited via social media between April 8 and April 28, 2020, when Australians were experiencing social distancing/isolation measures for the first time. As part of a larger survey, participants were asked to respond via an open-ended question about how COVID-19 had impacted their family. A total of 2,130 parents were included and represented a diverse range of family backgrounds. Inductive template thematic analysis was used to understand patterns of meaning across the texts. Six themes were derived from the data, including &quot;Boredom, depression and suicide: A spectrum of emotion,&quot; &quot;Families are missing the things that keep them healthy,&quot; &quot;Changing family relationships: The push pull of intimacy,&quot; &quot;The unprecedented demands of parenthood,&quot; &quot;The unequal burden of COVID-19,&quot; and &quot;Holding on to positivity.&quot; Overall, the findings demonstrated a breadth of responses. Messages around loss and challenge were predominant, with many families reporting mental health difficulties and strained family relationships. However, not all families were negatively impacted by the restrictions, with some families reporting positive benefits and meaning, including opportunities for strengthening relationships, finding new hobbies, and developing positive characteristics such as appreciation, gratitude, and tolerance.","Evans, Mikocka-Walus, Klas, Olive, Sciberras, Karantzas, Westrupp",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.588667,20201117.0,Australia; COVID-19; family relationships; qualitative study; social restrictions,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
97,Adversity History Predicts Self-Reported Autonomic Reactivity and Mental Health in US Residents During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"<b>Background:</b> The spread of the COVID-19 virus presents an unprecedented event that rapidly introduced widespread life threat, economic destabilization, and social isolation. The human nervous system is tuned to detect safety and danger, integrating body and brain responses via the autonomic nervous system. Shifts in brain-body states toward danger responses can compromise mental health. For those who have experienced prior potentially traumatic events, the autonomic threat response system may be sensitive to new dangers and these threat responses may mediate the association between prior adversity and current mental health. <b>Method:</b> The present study collected survey data from adult U.S. residents (<i>n</i> = 1,666; 68% female; Age <i>M</i> = 46.24, <i>SD</i> = 15.14) recruited through websites, mailing lists, social media, and demographically-targeted sampling collected between March and May 2020. Participants reported on their adversity history, subjective experiences of autonomic reactivity, PTSD and depression symptoms, and intensity of worry related to the COVID-19 pandemic using a combination of standardized questionnaires and questions developed for the study. Formal mediation testing was conducted using path analysis and structural equation modeling. <b>Results:</b> Respondents with prior adversities reported higher levels of destabilized autonomic reactivity, PTSD and depression symptoms, and worry related to COVID-19. Autonomic reactivity mediated the relation between adversity and all mental health variables (standardized indirect effect range for unadjusted models: 0.212-0.340; covariate-adjusted model: 0.183-0.301). <b>Discussion:</b> The data highlight the important role of autonomic regulation as an intervening variable in mediating the impact of adversity on mental health. Because of the important role that autonomic function plays in the expression of mental health vulnerability, brain-body oriented therapies that promote threat response reduction should be investigated as possible therapeutic targets.","Kolacz, Dale, Nix, Roath, Lewis, Porges",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.577728,20201117.0,COVID-19; PTSD; autonomic nervous system; coronavirus; depression; polyvagal theory; trauma; worry,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
98,"Association Between Depression, Health Beliefs, and Face Mask Use During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is associated with increases in psychiatric morbidity, including depression. It is unclear if people with depressive symptoms understand or apply COVID-19 information differently to the general population. Therefore, this study aimed to examine associations between depression, health beliefs, and face mask use during the COVID-19 pandemic among the general population in Hong Kong. This study gathered data from 11,072 Hong Kong adults via an online survey. Respondents self-reported their demographic characteristics, depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), face mask use, and health beliefs about COVID-19. Hierarchical logistic regression was used to identify independent variables associated with depression. The point-prevalence of probable depression was 46.5% (<i>n</i> = 5,150). Respondents reporting higher mask reuse (<i>OR</i> = 1.24, 95%CI 1.17-1.34), wearing masks for self-protection (<i>OR</i> = 1.03 95%CI 1.01-1.06), perceived high susceptibility (<i>OR</i> = 1.15, 95%CI 1.09-1.23), and high severity (<i>OR</i> = 1.33, 95%CI 1.28-1.37) were more likely to report depression. Depression was less likely in those with higher scores for cues to action (<i>OR</i> = 0.82, 95%CI 0.80-0.84), knowledge of COVID-19 (<i>OR</i> = 0.95, 95%CI 0.91-0.99), and self-efficacy to wear mask properly (<i>OR</i> = 0.90 95%CI 0.83-0.98). We identified a high point-prevalence of probable major depression and suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 outbreak in Hong Kong, but this should be viewed with caution due to the convenience sampling method employed. Future studies should recruit a representative probability sample in order to draw more reliable conclusions. The findings highlight that COVID-19 health information may be a protective factor of probable depression and suicidal ideation during the pandemic. Accurate and up-to-date health information should be disseminated to distressed and vulnerable subpopulations, perhaps using digital health technology, and social media platforms to prompt professional help-seeking behavior.","Bressington, Cheung, Lam, Suen, Fong, Ho, Xiang",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.571179,20201117.0,COVID-19; Hong Kong; depression; face mask; health belief model,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

Along with these findings, the risk of substance use, suicide, domestic violence, and complicated grief may increase. We further discuss interventions that can be applied at a governmental, institutional, and individual level to minimize the mental health consequences of the pandemic, such as using telehealth to provide remote support or practicing self-care. These interventions should be maintained after the initial outbreak, as current disturbances may impact long-term well-being. We encourage the development of longitudinal studies to assess long-term adaptive responses.","Dos Santos, PicÃ³-PÃ©rez, Morgado",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.565698,20201117.0,COVID-19; anxiety; depression; health services; mental health,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
100,"Self-reported changes in anxiety, depression and suicidality during the COVID-19 lockdown in Greece","There are only a few published empirical data on COVID-19's effects on the mental health. During lockdown, an online questionnaire registered demographic, health data, previous psychiatric history, current anxiety, depression and suicidality, believing in conspiracy theories and other domains. Data from 3399 persons were used (81.08% females; aged 34.02Â Â±Â 9.72 and 18.27% males; aged 36.38Â±10.33). Distress and clinical depression were identified with the use of cut-off and a previously developed algorithm respectively. A post-stratification method was used; descriptive statistics were calculated. Chi-square tests, multiple forward stepwise linear regression analyses and Factorial Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) tested relations among variables. Clinical depression was present in 9.31% of the stratified sample, while 8.5% had severe distress; increased anxiety was present in more than 45%. Suicidal thoughts increased in 10.40% and decreased in 4.42%. Beliefs in conspiracy theories were widely prevalent; at least half of cases were following various misconceptions. A model for the development of depression was created with general health status, previous history of depression, self-harm and suicidal attempts, family responsibility, economic change, and age acting as risk factors, while keeping a daily routine, pursuing religiousness/spirituality, and believing in conspiracy theories acting as protective factors. The model developed here revealed multiple vulnerabilities and an interplay leading from simple anxiety to clinical depression and suicidality through distress. This could be of practical utility since most of these factors are modifiable. Future research, as well as interventions, should focus specifically on them.","Fountoulakis, Apostolidou, Atsiova, Filippidou, Florou, Gousiou, Katsara, Mantzari, Padouva-Markoulaki, Papatriantafyllou, Sacharidi, Tonia, Tsagalidou, Zymara, Prezerakos, Koupidis, Fountoulakis, Chrousos",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.10.061,20201216.0,"COVID-19; Depression; Lockdown; Mental health, conspiracy theories; Suicidality",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

This is a pooled cross-sectional study. Online survey data were analysed from 2000 Japanese adults collected in April and May 2020. Information was obtained on 13 COVID-19 preventive behaviours and anxiety and depressive symptoms using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale and Patient Health Questionnaire-9, respectively. Linear regression analysis was used to examine the associations. In models adjusted for demographic and socio-economic factors, anxiety (coefficient:Â -0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI]:Â -1.30, -0.24) and depressive symptoms (coefficient:Â -0.82, 95% CI:Â -1.34, -0.30) were both associated with significantly lower engagement in COVID-19 preventive behaviours.

102,Increasing Social Connectedness for Underserved Older Adults Living With Depression: A Pre-Post Evaluation of PEARLS,"To evaluate PEARLS effectiveness for increasing social connectedness among underserved older adults with depression. Multisite, pre-post single-group evaluation. Community-based social service organizations (Nâ€¯=â€¯16) in five U.S. states, purposively sampled for maximum variation of participants and providers. A total of 320 homebound older adults (mean(SD) age 72.9(9.6), 79% female, 44% people of color, 81% low-income, 61% living alone, average four chronic conditions) with clinically significant depression (PHQ-9 mean(SD) 12.7(4.6)). Four to 6 month home-based depression care management model delivered by trained front-line providers. Brief validated social connectedness scales: Duke Social Support Index 10-item (DSSI-10), PROMIS-Social Isolation (6-item), UCLA-Loneliness (3-item); sociodemographic and health measures. At baseline, PEARLS participants overall and with â‰¥1 of the following characteristics were less socially connected: younger (50-64), white, LGBTQ+, not partnered, not caregiving, living alone, financial limitations, chronic conditions, and/or recently hospitalized. Six-months post-PEARLS enrollment, participants significantly increased social interactions and satisfaction with social support (DSSI-10 t[312]â€¯=â€¯5.2, p &lt;0.001); and reduced perceived isolation (PROMIS t[310]â€¯=â€¯6.3, p &lt;0.001); and loneliness (UCLA t[301]â€¯=â€¯3.7, p =0.002), with small to moderate effect sizes (Cohen's d DSSI-10: 0.28, PROMIS-SI: 0.35, UCLA: 0.21). Increased social connectedness was associated with reduced depression. Improvements in social connectedness (except social interactions) persisted during early COVID-19. Being Latino and/or having difficulty paying for basic needs was associated with less improvement in post-PEARLS social connectedness. PEARLS has potential to improve social connectedness among underserved older adults, though additional supports may be needed for persons facing multiple social determinants of health. Further research is needed to establish causality.","Steinman, Parrish, Mayotte, Bravo Acevedo, Torres, Markova, Boddie, Lachenmayr, Montoya, Parker, Conton-Pelaez, Silsby, Snowden",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.10.005,20201117.0,Social isolation; community; depression care management; loneliness; underserved,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
103,Videoconferencing-Based Telemental Health: Important Questions for the COVID-19 Era From Clinical and Patient-Centered Perspectives,"The COVID-19 pandemic has intensified the search for digital approaches in mental health treatment, particularly due to patients and clinicians practicing social distancing. This has resulted in the dramatic growth of videoconferencing-based telemental health (V-TMH) services. It is critical for behavioral health providers and those in the mental health field to understand the implications of V-TMH expansion on the stakeholders who use such services, such as patients and clinicians, to provide the service that addresses both patient and clinical needs. Several key questions arise as a result, such as the following: (1) in what ways does V-TMH affect the practice of psychotherapy (ie, clinical needs), (2) to what extent are ethical and patient-centered concerns warranted in terms of V-TMH services (ie, patient needs), and (3) how do factors related to user experience affect treatment dynamics for both the patient and therapist (ie, patient and clinical needs)? We discuss how behavioral health providers can consider the future delivery of mental health care services based on these questions, which pose strong implications for technological innovation, the adaptation of treatments to new technologies, and training professionals in the delivery of V-TMH services and other digital health interventions.","Chiauzzi, Clayton, Huh-Yoo",https://doi.org/10.2196/24021,20201231.0,COVID-19; ethics; lived experience; mental health; patient-centered; privacy; psychotherapy; telehealth; telemental health; videoconferencing,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
104,Italians on the Age of COVID-19: The Self-Reported Depressive Symptoms Through Web-Based Survey,"The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected the Italian community. The widespread use of quarantine had the desired impact of controlling the epidemic, although it caused many psychological consequences. To date, compliance of the Italian public with voluntary home quarantine has been very high, but little is known about the impact of psychological health on sociodemographic categories during the quarantine. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of depressive symptoms in specific sociodemographic categories during the COVID-19 quarantine lockdown and the potential factors that contribute to, or mitigate, these effects. In the very early stage of the nationwide lockdown, 3,672 quarantined Italian adult residents (65% females, ranging from 18 to 85 years) participated in a web-based cross-sectional survey, including measures of depressive symptoms, which were measured by the Teate depression inventory, and state anxiety levels. The overall prevalence was 27.8% for moderate and 9.3% for severe levels of depressive symptoms. A generalized logistic model was used to identify the factors associated with mental health problems. Among these factors, sociodemographic variables (e.g., sex, age, employment status) and adherence to quarantine guidelines were analyzed. Females, younger people, students, singles, residents in northern Italy, people who were reluctant to adhere to quarantine guidelines, and people less worried about being infected with COVID-19 were at high risk of developing depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 epidemic, also after controlling for state anxiety. These findings showed that public levels of depressive symptoms did not increase the greater likelihood of being infected. Our study suggested that the monitoring of psychological outcomes for outbreaks could identify groups at higher risk of psychological morbidities due to the current pandemic in order to target future psychological interventions for implementation.","Balsamo, Carlucci",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.569276,20201113.0,anxiety; coronavirus disease 2019; depression; mental health; worry,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

107,Emotional impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on healthcare workers in one of the most important infection outbreaks in Europe,"The Covid-19 pandemic has put healthcare professionals around the world in an unprecedented challenge. This may cause some emotional difficulties and mental health problems. The aim of the present study was to analyze the emotional status among the health care workers form the Hospital of Igualada (Barcelona), while they were facing with Covid-19 in one of the most affected regions in all of Europe. A total of 395 participants were included in the study. A cross-sectional assessment was carried out between the months of March and April. Information about anxiety, depression, and stress was gathered. We also collected demographic data and concerning potentially stressful factors. A significant proportion of professionals reported symptoms of anxiety (31.4%) and depression (12.2%) from moderate to severe intensity. Symptoms of acute stress were reported by 14.5% of participants. We performed a regression analysis, which explained the 30% of the variance associated with the degree of emotional distress (RÂ²â€¯=â€¯0.30). The final model reveals that females (or young males), who are working in the frontline as nursing assistants, caretakers or radiology technicians, with the uncertainty of a possible infection, the perception of inadequate protection measures and having experienced the death of a close person by Covid-19, showed a heightened risk of experiencing psychological distress. Coping with the Covid-19 pandemic caused a significant impact on emotional status of healthcare workers involved in this study.

112,A Mental Health Surveillance System for the General Population During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Protocol for a Multiwave Cross-sectional Survey Study,"The COVID-19 outbreak can potentially be categorized as a traumatic event. Public health surveillance is one of the cornerstones of public health practice, and it empowers decision makers to lead and manage public health crises and programs more effectively by providing timely and useful evidence. This paper presents the protocol for a study that aims to identify, track, and monitor trends in the population in Saudi Arabia at risk of major depressive disorders and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study utilizes continuous, cross-sectional, national-level mental health screening via computer-assisted phone interviews, conducted in four waves on a monthly basis (between May and August 2020). Arabic-speaking adults, aged â‰¥18 years, and living in Saudi Arabia were recruited via a random phone list. This surveillance system used the proportional quota sampling technique to achieve an equal distribution of participants, stratified by age and gender, and region, within and across the 13 administrative regions of Saudi Arabia. A sample size of 4056 participants per wave was calculated to achieve enough power to detect changes in mental health status. The questionnaire includes the Arabic version of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to measure depressive symptoms and the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) to measure anxiety. In addition, it will collect data on sociodemographic variables and potential risk factors. Study recruitment began in May 2020. The data analysis was completed in October 2020, and the final report is expected to be published by the end of December 2020. Monitoring the population's mental health status during the COVID-19 pandemic will inform decision makers of any potential deterioration in mental health on a national level and among subgroups, including across regions, age groups, and gender groups. It will allow decision makers to recognize issues and intervene sooner. It will also provide valuable scientific data to help understand the effects of epidemics and pandemics on mental health. As far as we know, this is the only study that attempts to monitor the mental health status of the general population on a monthly basis.

Cross-sectional telephone interview survey. Academic sleep labs. Iranian adults â‰¥ 18 years old with confirmed OSA. Among 275 participants with OSA, 20% (nÂ =Â 55) were suspected to have history of COVID-19 but had no positive test, and 18% (nÂ =Â 51) were in the definite COVID-19 group according to their reported symptoms or confirmed positive test. Having severe OSA (apnea hypopnea index â‰¥ 30) was associated with an increased risk of definite COVID-19, with an odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of 2.31 (0.87-5.55) compared to having mild OSA in definite COVID-19 group. Those not undergoing treatment for OSA had an OR (95% CI) of 2.43 (1.26-4.67) for definite COVID-19 compared to those accepting treatment in definite COVID-19 group. Total sleep times (TSTs) were 354, 340, and 320 minutes in healthy, suspected, and COVID-19 groups, respectively; TST was associated with COVID-19 (P-valueÂ =Â .04). Similarly, sleep efficiency (SE) scores were 75.7, 74.2, and 67.9% for the healthy, suspected, and COVID-19 groups, respectively (P-valueÂ =Â .005); Beck Depression scores were 13.8, 13.0, and 17.7, respectively (P-valueÂ =Â .056).

Total numbers of patients with myocardial infarctions, stroke, appendicitis, and cholecystitis diagnosed decreased. The percentage of visits for mental health symptoms increased. There was an increase in deaths, driven by out-of-hospital mortality. Fewer patients presenting with acute and time-sensitive diagnoses suggests that patients are deferring care. This may be further supported by an increase in out-of-hospital mortality.

118,Anxiety of Nurses to support Wuhan in fighting against COVID-19 Epidemic and its Correlation With Work Stress and Self-efficacy,"We aimed to investigate the anxiety of nurses who are supporting Wuhan in fighting against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and explore relevant influencing factors. The COVID-19 outbreak poses a major threat to public health worldwide. Nurses play an important role in this epidemic. However, available data on the mental health among these nurses are limited. A descriptive, cross-sectional survey was performed. An online questionnaire was completed by 200 nurses who went to Wuhan to help to fight against COVID-19 from another province. Data collection tools include the Chinese version of the Stress Overload Scale (SOS), the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES). Descriptive, single-factor correlation and multiple regression analyses were used in exploring related influencing factors. Reporting followed the STROBE guidelines. The scores of SAS, SOS and GSES range from 20 to 80, 22 to 110 and 10 to 40, respectively, and the SAS (31.79Â Â±Â 7.32) and SOS (40.19Â Â±Â 12.92) and GSES scores (24.83Â Â±Â 6.60) were obtained. Anxiety was positively correlated with stress (rÂ =Â .679, pÂ &lt;Â .001) but negatively correlated with self-efficacy (rÂ =Â -.326, pÂ &lt;Â .001). Multiple regression analysis showed that professional qualification, sleep, stress and self-efficacy were the main factors affecting nurse anxiety (pÂ =Â .006, &lt;.001, &lt;.001, .039, respectively). Nurses who are supporting Wuhan in fighting against COVID-19 were under a low level of anxiety. The current study suggests work stress reduction might be a key factor in reducing anxiety and maintaining mental health to support nurses who are fighting against COVID-19 infection.","Mo, Deng, Zhang, Lang, Pang, Liao, Wang, Tao, Huang",https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15549,20201122.0,COVID-2019; Wuhan; anxiety; mental health; nurses; social support; work stress,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
119,Revising our attitudes towards agonist medications and their diversion in a time of pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic led government regulators to relax prescribing rules for buprenorphine and methadone, the agonist medications that effectively treat opioid use disorder, allowing for take home supplies of up to 28Â days. These changes prioritized the availability of these medications over concerns about their misuse and diversion, and they provided a means for overdose prophylaxis during the highly uncertain conditions of the pandemic. In considering how to capitalize on this shift, research should determine the extent to which increased diversion has occurred as a result, and what the consequences may have been. The shifts also set the stage to consider if methadone can be safely prescribed in primary care settings, and if the monthly injectable formulation of buprenorphine is a suitable alternative to increased supplies of sublingual strips if concerns about diversion persist. The disruptions of the pandemic have caused a surge in overdose deaths, so carefully considering the prophylactic potential of agonist medications, in addition to their role as a treatment, may help us address this mortality crisis.","Del Pozo, Rich",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108139,20201116.0,"Analgesics, Opioid; Buprenorphine; COVID-19; Coronavirus Infections; Drug Overdose; Humans; Methadone; Opiate Substitution Treatment; Opioid-Related Disorders; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Prescription Drug Diversion",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
120,Extraversion Moderates the Relationship Between the Stringency of COVID-19 Protective Measures and Depressive Symptoms,"From the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, psychologists are theorizing that, as compared to introverts, extraverts experience more profound negative social consequences from protective measures (e.g., travel restrictions and bans on public gatherings). As the empirical evidence for this claim is lacking, this study tested the hypothesis that extraversion moderates the relationship between the stringency of COVID-19 protective measures and depressive symptoms. Our results were based on survey data from 93,125 respondents collected in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 20-April 6, 2020) across 47 countries and publicly available data on measure stringency. Findings demonstrate that extraversion moderates the relationship between measure stringency in the early days of the pandemic and depressive symptoms. For introverts, measure stringency has a negative effect on depressive symptoms, while for extraverts, it has a positive, but non-significant effect on depressive symptoms. This study suggests that, although stringent measures generally help people to worry less and feel safer, the lifestyle associated with such measures feels more natural to introverts than to extraverts.","Wijngaards, Sisouw de Zilwa, Burger",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.568907,20201103.0,COVID-19; COVID-19 protective measures; depressive symptoms; extraversion; mental healthâ€”related quality of life,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
121,Mental Health Through the COVID-19 Quarantine: A Growth Curve Analysis on Italian Young Adults,"Health emergencies, such as epidemics, have detrimental and long-lasting consequences on people's mental health, which are higher during the implementation of strict lockdown measures. Despite several recent psychological researches on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic highlighting that young adults represent a high risk category, no studies specifically focused on young adults' mental health status have been carried out yet. This study aimed to assess and monitor Italian young adults' mental health status during the first 4 weeks of lockdown through the use of a longitudinal panel design. Participants (<i>n</i> = 97) provided self-reports in four time intervals (1-week intervals) in 1 month. The Syndromic Scales of Adult Self-Report 18-59 were used to assess the internalizing problems (anxiety/depression, withdrawn, and somatic complaints), externalizing problems (aggressive, rule-breaking, and intrusive behavior), and personal strengths. To determine the time-varying effects of prolonged quarantine, a growth curve modeling will be performed. The results showed an increase in anxiety/depression, withdrawal, somatic complaints, aggressive behavior, rule-breaking behavior, and internalizing and externalizing problems and a decrease in intrusive behavior and personal strengths from T1 to T4. The results contributed to the ongoing debate concerning the psychological impact of the COVID-19 emergency, helping to plan and develop efficient intervention projects able to take care of young adults' mental health in the long term.","Parola, Rossi, Tessitore, Troisi, Mannarini",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.567484,20201103.0,Achenbach adult self-report; coronavirus disease 2019; growth model; internalizing/externalizing problems; mental health; quarantine; young adult,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
122,"Associations of Social Isolation with Anxiety and Depression During the Early COVID-19 Pandemic: A Survey of Older Adults in London, UK","The COVID-19 pandemic is imposing a profound negative impact on the health and wellbeing of societies and individuals, worldwide. One concern is the effect of social isolation as a result of social distancing on the mental health of vulnerable populations, including older people. Within six weeks of lockdown, we initiated the CHARIOT COVID-19 Rapid Response Study, a bespoke survey of cognitively healthy older people living in London, to investigate the impact of COVID-19 and associated social isolation on mental and physical wellbeing. The sample was drawn from CHARIOT, a register of people over 50 who have consented to be contacted for aging related research. A total of 7,127 men and women (mean age=70.7 [SD=7.4]) participated in the baseline survey, May-July 2020. Participants were asked about changes to the 14 components of the Hospital Anxiety Depression scale (HADS) after lockdown was introduced in the UK, on 23<sup>rd</sup> March. A total of 12.8% of participants reported feeling worse on the depression components of HADS (7.8% men and 17.3% women) and 12.3% reported feeling worse on the anxiety components (7.8% men and 16.5% women). Fewer participants reported feeling improved (1.5% for depression and 4.9% for anxiety). Women, younger participants, those single/widowed/divorced, reporting poor sleep, feelings of loneliness and who reported living alone were more likely to indicate feeling worse on both the depression and/or anxiety components of the HADS. There was a significant negative association between subjective loneliness and worsened components of both depression (OR 17.24, 95% CI 13.20, 22.50) and anxiety (OR 10.85, 95% CI 8.39, 14.03). Results may inform targeted interventions and help guide policy recommendations in reducing the effects of social isolation related to the pandemic, and beyond, on the mental health of older people.","Robb, de Jager, Ahmadi-Abhari, Giannakopoulou, Udeh-Momoh, McKeand, Price, Car, Majeed, Ward, Middleton",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.591120,20201103.0,COVID-19; anxiety; depression; loneliness; mental health; older adults; social isolation,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
123,The Effect of COVID-19 on Mental Health and Wellbeing in a Representative Sample of Australian Adults,"There is minimal knowledge about the impact of large-scale epidemics on community mental health, particularly during the acute phase. This gap in knowledge means we are critically ill-equipped to support communities as they face the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to provide data urgently needed to inform government policy and resource allocation now and in other future crises. The study was the first to survey a representative sample from the Australian population at the early acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Depression, anxiety, and psychological wellbeing were measured with well-validated scales (PHQ-9, GAD-7, WHO-5). Using linear regression, we tested for associations between mental health and exposure to COVID-19, impacts of COVID-19 on work and social functioning, and socio-demographic factors. Depression and anxiety symptoms were substantively elevated relative to usual population data, including for individuals with no existing mental health diagnosis. Exposure to COVID-19 had minimal association with mental health outcomes. Recent exposure to the Australian bushfires was also unrelated to depression and anxiety, although bushfire smoke exposure correlated with reduced psychological wellbeing. In contrast, pandemic-induced impairments in work and social functioning were strongly associated with elevated depression and anxiety symptoms, as well as decreased psychological wellbeing. Financial distress due to the pandemic, rather than job loss <i>per se</i>, was also a key correlate of poorer mental health. These findings suggest that minimizing disruption to work and social functioning, and increasing access to mental health services in the community, are important policy goals to minimize pandemic-related impacts on mental health and wellbeing. Innovative and creative strategies are needed to meet these community needs while continuing to enact vital public health strategies to control the spread of COVID-19.","Dawel, Shou, Smithson, Cherbuin, Banfield, Calear, Farrer, Gray, Gulliver, Housen, McCallum, Morse, Murray, Newman, Rodney Harris, Batterham",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.579985,20201103.0,COVID-19; anxiety; bushfire; coronavirus; depression; financial strain; mental health,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
124,Mental Health Outcomes in Perinatal Women During the Remission Phase of COVID-19 in China,"Since the middle of March, the COVID-19 outbreak has been well contained in China. The prevention and control measures for the outbreak have been downgraded to a normalized level. However, until now, the change in level of psychological health amongst perinatal women during the remission phase of the COVID-19 outbreak has not been investigated in China. The aim of this current study was to assess the symptoms of anxiety, depression, insomnia and quality of life (QOL) in perinatal women and to identify potential risk factors associated with these symptoms. This was a cross-sectional, hospital-based survey conducted between March 25<sup>th</sup> till June 5<sup>th</sup>, 2020 in southern China. Convenient sampling method was adopted. Women's anxiety, depression, insomnia symptoms and QOL was examined through standardized measurements. Multivariate logistic regression and Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted for the same. A total of 625 perinatal women completed the study; of them, 195 women (31.2%, 95%CI=27.56%-34.84%) reported anxiety, 120 (19.2%, 95%CI=16.10%-22.30%) reported depression, and 87 (13.9%, 95%CI=11.20%-16.64%) experienced symptoms of insomnia. Previous adverse experiences during pregnancy was a significant risk factor for anxiety (OR=1.628, 95%CI=1.069-2.480, P=0.023), depression (OR=1.853, 95%CI=1.153-2.977, P=0.011), and insomnia (OR=2.160, 95%CI=1.290-3.616, P=0.003). Participants having infected friends/families/colleagues were more likely to report anxiety (OR=2.195, 95%CI=1.245-3.871, P=0.007) and depression (OR=2.666, 95%CI=1.482-4.794, P=0.001). Those women whose regular check-ups were severely interrupted by the COVID-19 were also more likely to experience symptoms of anxiety (OR=2.935, 95%CI=1.701-5.062, P&lt;0.001) and insomnia (OR=2.195, 95%CI=1.098-4.390, P=0.026). The COVID-19 pandemic does affect the mental health and well being of perinatal women. Increased attention should be paid to women who have infected friends/families/colleagues and those with previous adverse experiences during pregnancy. Coping strategies that relieve psychological stress during the COVID-19 outbreak should be provided to prevent adverse outcomes for women and their infants.","Zeng, Li, Sun, Luo, Garg, Liu, Zhang, Zhang",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.571876,20201103.0,COVID-19; China; mental health; perinatal; women,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
125,Twitter Discussions and Emotions About the COVID-19 Pandemic: Machine Learning Approach,"It is important to measure the public response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Twitter is an important data source for infodemiology studies involving public response monitoring. The objective of this study is to examine COVID-19-related discussions, concerns, and sentiments using tweets posted by Twitter users. We analyzed 4 million Twitter messages related to the COVID-19 pandemic using a list of 20 hashtags (eg, &quot;coronavirus,&quot; &quot;COVID-19,&quot; &quot;quarantine&quot;) from March 7 to April 21, 2020. We used a machine learning approach, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to identify popular unigrams and bigrams, salient topics and themes, and sentiments in the collected tweets. Popular unigrams included &quot;virus,&quot; &quot;lockdown,&quot; and &quot;quarantine.&quot; Popular bigrams included &quot;COVID-19,&quot; &quot;stay home,&quot; &quot;corona virus,&quot; &quot;social distancing,&quot; and &quot;new cases.&quot; We identified 13 discussion topics and categorized them into 5 different themes: (1) public health measures to slow the spread of COVID-19, (2) social stigma associated with COVID-19, (3) COVID-19 news, cases, and deaths, (4) COVID-19 in the United States, and (5) COVID-19 in the rest of the world. Across all identified topics, the dominant sentiments for the spread of COVID-19 were anticipation that measures can be taken, followed by mixed feelings of trust, anger, and fear related to different topics. The public tweets revealed a significant feeling of fear when people discussed new COVID-19 cases and deaths compared to other topics. This study showed that Twitter data and machine learning approaches can be leveraged for an infodemiology study, enabling research into evolving public discussions and sentiments during the COVID-19 pandemic. As the situation rapidly evolves, several topics are consistently dominant on Twitter, such as confirmed cases and death rates, preventive measures, health authorities and government policies, COVID-19 stigma, and negative psychological reactions (eg, fear). Real-time monitoring and assessment of Twitter discussions and concerns could provide useful data for public health emergency responses and planning. Pandemic-related fear, stigma, and mental health concerns are already evident and may continue to influence public trust when a second wave of COVID-19 occurs or there is a new surge of the current pandemic.","Xue, Chen, Hu, Chen, Zheng, Su, Zhu",https://doi.org/10.2196/20550,20201221.0,COVID-19; Twitter; Twitter data; infodemic; infodemiology; infoveillance; machine learning; public discussion; public sentiment; social media; virus; COVID-19; Data Collection; Emotions; Humans; Machine Learning; SARS-CoV-2; Social Media,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
126,"Depression and Coping Among COVID-19-Infected Individuals After 10 Days of Mandatory in-Hospital Quarantine, Irbid, Jordan","In-hospital mandatory quarantine of asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19-infected individuals was part of the national control strategy used to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak in Jordan. This study aims to evaluate depression, associated stressors, and various coping methods used among adult quarantined COVID-19-infected individuals. This cross-sectional study included all COVID-19-infected individuals who were obligatorily quarantined at King Abdullah University Hospital, Irbid, Jordan from March 15 to April 20, 2020. Symptoms of depression were assessed using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire after 10 days of quarantine. In addition, several questions regarding the patients' sights with the health-care system, and coping methods were added. Demographic characteristics, clinical presentation, and comorbidities were collected from the medical records. Out of 91 quarantined COVID-19 patients, a total of 66 completed the survey, with a participation rate of 72.5%. The majority were relatively young; the mean Â± SD age was 35.8 Â± 16.2 years (range 18-79), 59.1% were females and 47% were asymptomatic. A considerable proportion of patients (44%) reported symptoms of depression, with 21% were at high risk of major depressive disorder. Depression symptoms were significantly more common among females than males [PHQ-9 score â‰¥10: 13 (92.9%) vs 1 (7.1%), respectively; <i>p</i>=0.004]. The majority of patients (71.2%) reported having problems with health-care services. Insufficient involvement in making treatment decisions was the most commonly reported concern (59.1%). Patients who reported problems in maintaining privacy, reaching out to their physicians, or receiving conflicting information from the medical staff, had more symptoms of depression compared with the satisfied ones (<i>p</i>&lt;0.05). On the other hand, those who were receiving sufficient support from the family, friends, or medical staff during quarantine, were less likely to have depression symptoms (<i>p</i>&lt;0.05). Furthermore, symptoms of depression were less in patients who stayed in touch with others using phone calls, texting, or social media (<i>p</i>=0.024). Symptoms of depression were common among both symptomatic and asymptomatic quarantined COVID-19 patients. The support of family, friends, and medical staff was an essential alleviating factor. Facilitating adequate communication may promote the mental well-being of COVID-19-infected patients and help in reducing the risk of depression during the in-hospital quarantine.","Samrah, Al-Mistarehi, Aleshawi, Khasawneh, Momany, Momany, Abu Za'nouneh, Keelani, Alshorman, Khassawneh",https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S267459,20201030.0,COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; coronavirus; depression; psychological disorder; quarantine,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
127,Behavior of Callers to a Crisis Helpline Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Quantitative Data Analysis,"The World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 to be an international pandemic in March 2020. While numbers of new confirmed cases of the disease and death tolls are rising at an alarming rate on a daily basis, there is concern that the pandemic and the measures taken to counteract it could cause an increase in distress among the public. Hence, there could be an increase in need for emotional support within the population, which is complicated further by the reduction of existing face-to-face mental health services as a result of measures taken to limit the spread of the virus. The objective of this study was to determine whether the COVID-19 pandemic has had any influence on the calls made to Samaritans Ireland, a national crisis helpline within the Republic of Ireland. This study presents an analysis of calls made to Samaritans Ireland in a four-week period before the first confirmed case of COVID-19 (calls=41,648, callers=3752) and calls made to the service within a four-week period after a restrictive lockdown was imposed by the government of the Republic of Ireland (calls=46,043, callers=3147). Statistical analysis was conducted to explore any differences between the duration of calls in the two periods at a global level and at an hourly level. We performed k-means clustering to determine the types of callers who used the helpline based on their helpline call usage behavior and to assess the impact of the pandemic on the caller type usage patterns. The analysis revealed that calls were of a longer duration in the postlockdown period in comparison with the pre-COVID-19 period. There were changes in the behavior of individuals in the cluster types defined by caller behavior, where some caller types tended to make longer calls to the service in the postlockdown period. There were also changes in caller behavior patterns with regard to the time of day of the call; variations were observed in the duration of calls at particular times of day, where average call durations increased in the early hours of the morning. The results of this study highlight the impact of COVID-19 on a national crisis helpline service. Statistical differences were observed in caller behavior between the prelockdown and active lockdown periods. The findings suggest that service users relied on crisis helpline services more during the lockdown period due to an increased sense of isolation, worsening of underlying mental illness due to the pandemic, and reduction or overall removal of access to other support resources. Practical implications and limitations are discussed.","Turkington, Mulvenna, Bond, Ennis, Potts, Moore, Hamra, Morrissey, Isaksen, Scowcroft, O'Neill",https://doi.org/10.2196/22984,20201114.0,COVID-19; caller behavior; clustering; coronavirus; crisis helplines; machine learning; mental health; pandemic,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

The Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) has substantial experience in mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) in crises, and COVID-19 has driven further innovation to support mental health and well-being. Global and regional guidance has been developed quickly, applying lessons learnt from previous disease outbreaks to respond to the pandemic at a systems level, for different population groups, and for countries of different income levels. Preliminary results from a global rapid assessment survey to assess the impact of COVID-19 on MHPSS services, indicate that 20 of the 22 EMR Member States have MHPSS as integral components of national COVID-19 response plans; one-third have allocated additional funding. However, MHPSS services have been severely impacted by the pandemic, including psychotherapy, psychosocial interventions, community services, and services for children/adolescents. Innovative solutions such as crisis hotlines, tele-consultations, digital self-help platforms, novel approaches to ensure supply of psychotropic medicines, and task sharing/shifting for basic psychosocial support, are being used in many countries to overcome service disruptions and maintain care for those with mental conditions.","Eaton, Rahman, Gater, Saxena, Hammerich, Saeed",https://doi.org/10.26719/2020.26.10.1148,20201116.0,"Africa, Northern; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; Coronavirus Infections; Disasters; Global Health; Health Behavior; Health Promotion; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Mental Health; Mental Health Services; Middle East; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Resilience, Psychological; SARS-CoV-2; Social Determinants of Health; Socioeconomic Factors",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

Pregnant women living in Quebec province (N = 1014) have been recruited in April 2020 through social media, while a state of health emergency was declared. Participants were divided in 4 groups, according to self-reported frequency of news media consulting (little or none; one time a day; several times a day; constant). They filled measures of depressive symptoms, negative affects, post-traumatic stress symptoms and anxiety specific to COVID-19. Instrument scores were grouped under a unique factor of psychological distress. An ANCOVA controlling for age, gestational age, education level, household annual revenue and a diagnosed mental disorder present at the time of participation in study shows that news media exposure frequency is significantly associated with psychological distress severity in pregnant women, during COVID-19 pandemic, F(3,998) = 27.02, p &lt; 0.001, Î·2 partial = 0.08. Given the mean comparisons <i>a posteriori</i>, higher psychological distress rates are found as soon as news media exposure exceeds once a day (effect sizes between 0.38 and 0.81).

This study aimed to identify individual and structural factors associated with mental health disorders (MHD) in the NGO's healthcare workers (HCW) in the early stage of the outbreak. Data were collected between April 6 and 11, 2020 for 135 HCW in ARCAD SantÃ© PLUS's 18 community-based HIV care centers. Outcomes corresponded to the PHQ-9, GAD-7 and ISI instruments for depression, anxiety and insomnia, respectively. A general mixture model with a negative binomial distribution was implemented. Most HCW were men (60.7%) and median age was 40 years IQR[33-46]. Symptoms of depression, anxiety and insomnia were declared by 71.9, 73.3, and 77% participants, respectively. Women were at greater risk of MHD. A lack of personal protection equipment and human resources, especially nurses, was associated with a high risk of MHD. Health policy must place non-front line HCW, including those in NGOs, at the core of the healthcare system response to the COVID-19 outbreak, as they ensure continuity of care for many diseases including HIV. The efficacy of public health strategies depends on the capacity of HCW to fully with and competently perform their duties.","Sagaon-Teyssier, Kamissoko, Yattassaye, Diallo, Rojas Castro, Delabre, Pouradier, Maradan, Bourrelly, CissÃ©, Vidal, KeÃ¯ta, Spire",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hpopen.2020.100017,20201224.0,COVID-19; HIV; Healthcare workers; Mali; Mental health,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

To investigate the trajectory of mental health and well-being during the first 6 weeks of lockdown in adults in the UK. A quota survey design and a sampling frame that permitted recruitment of a national sample was employed. Findings for waves 1 (31 March to 9 April 2020), 2 (10 April to 27 April 2020) and 3 (28 April to 11 May 2020) are reported here. A range of mental health factors was assessed: pre-existing mental health problems, suicide attempts and self-harm, suicidal ideation, depression, anxiety, defeat, entrapment, mental well-being and loneliness. A total of 3077 adults in the UK completed the survey at wave 1. Suicidal ideation increased over time. Symptoms of anxiety, and levels of defeat and entrapment decreased across waves whereas levels of depressive symptoms did not change significantly. Positive well-being also increased. Levels of loneliness did not change significantly over waves.

133,Mental health presentations to Christchurch Hospital Emergency Department during COVID-19 lockdown,"To describe mental health presentations to a tertiary ED in New Zealand during a national COVID-19 lockdown. A retrospective, comparative cohort study in Christchurch Hospital, New Zealand. There was a 3510 (37%)-patient decrease in all presentations to Christchurch Hospital ED during the 5-week COVID-19 lockdown period from 26 March 2020 to 28 April 2020, compared to a 111 (1.2%)-patient decrease in the same time period in the previous year (P &lt;â€‰0.00001). There is usually a seasonal reduction in mental health attendances at this time of year compared to the weeks before. In 2019, there was a 49 (9.8%)-patient reduction in mental health presentations, whereas in 2020 there was a 193 (34%)-patient reduction (P &lt;â€‰0.001). In 2020, the proportion of mental health attendances compared to all ED attendances during the 5-week lockdown period was similar to the 5-week pre-lockdown period (564/9460 vs 371/5950, P =â€‰0.48). The proportion of mental health patients presenting due to overdose increased by 6.5% (158/564 vs 128/371, P =â€‰0.035); those due to self-harm increased by 3.5% (35/564 vs 36/371, P =â€‰0.049). The proportion of mental health presentations due to anxiety, depression and other non-self-harm/overdose complaints decreased by 10% (371/564 vs 207/371, P =â€‰0.002). The proportion of overdoses of paracetamol and ibuprofen increased by 13.4% during lockdown (22/158 vs 35/128, P =â€‰0.005). During the COVID-19 lockdown, both overall ED presentations as well as mental health-related presentations decreased. There was a relative increase in overdoses and self-harm, particularly involving paracetamol and ibuprofen.","Joyce, Richardson, McCombie, Hamilton, Ardagh",https://doi.org/10.1111/1742-6723.13667,20201109.0,COVID-19; emergency department; mental health; overdose; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

137,Social support and acute stress symptoms (ASSs) during the COVID-19 outbreak: deciphering the roles of psychological needs and sense of control,"<b>Background:</b> A cute stress symptoms (ASSs) are likely to be a common mental health problem in the acute period following the 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) outbreak. To address this risk, substantial social support has been provided to relieve ASSs during the COVID-19 outbreak. However, the effectiveness of these support methods for relieving ASSs has not yet been assessed. <b>Objective:</b> The current study sought to examine the underlying mechanisms by which social support relieves ASSs, among primary and secondary school teachers. <b>Method:</b>Â A sample of 751 primary and secondary school teachers was selected to answer self-reported questionnaires regarding ASSs, social support, psychological needs, and the sense of control. <b>Results:</b> Structural equation modelling revealed that social support had a non-significant direct relationship with ASSs, and a significant indirect relationship with reduced ASSs via the needs for autonomy and relatedness, and via the paths from three types of psychological needs to the sense of control. <b>Conclusion:</b> These findings suggest that social support can play a relieving role in ASSs when the support satisfies individuals' psychological needs and improves their sense of control. To alleviate ASSs among primary and secondary school teachers, more attention should be paid to satisfying their specific psychological needs and improving their sense of control. <b>Antecedentes:</b> Es probable que los sÃ­ntomas de estrÃ©s agudo (SEAs) sean un problema de salud mental frecuente en el periodo agudo que sigue al nuevo brote de neumonÃ­a por coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). Para enfrentar este riesgo, se ha brindado un considerable soporte social para aliviar los SEAs durante el brote del COVID-19. Sin embargo, aÃºn no se han evaluado la efectividad de estos mÃ©todos de soporte para aliviar los SEAs.<b>Objetivo:</b> Para cubrir esta brecha, este estudio buscÃ³ evaluar los mecanismos subyacentes mediante los cuales el soporte social alivia los SEAs en profesores de escuelas primarias y secundarias.<b>MÃ©todo:</b> Se tomÃ³ una muestra de 751 profesores de escuelas primarias y secundarias para que respondieran cuestionarios de auto-reporte relacionadas con SEAs, soporte social, necesidades psicolÃ³gicas y la sensaciÃ³n de control.<b>Resultados:</b> El modelo de ecuaciones estructurales revelÃ³ que el soporte social tenÃ­a una relaciÃ³n directa, no significativa, con los SEAs; y que tenÃ­a una relaciÃ³n significativa indirecta con una reducciÃ³n de los SEAs a travÃ©s de las necesidades de autonomÃ­a y relaciÃ³n, y a travÃ©s de las vÃ­as de tres tipos de necesidades psicolÃ³gicas de la sensaciÃ³n de control.<b>Conclusiones:</b> Estos hallazgos sugieren que el soporte social puede desempeÃ±ar un papel de alivio sobre los SEAs cuando el soporte satisface las necesidades psicolÃ³gicas de los individuos y mejora su sensaciÃ³n de control.

138,Psychosocial Safety Climate of Employees During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Iran: A Policy Analysis,"Iran is among the top 15 countries in the world in terms of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infection rates. The numbers of infections and deaths are still increasing in September 2020. This study aims to investigate the impact of the policies on terminating the quarantine period on the perception of psychosocial safety by employees and workers in Iran. In this study, policy announcements and regulations, media reports, and the results were collected from 2 previously published population surveys that collected employees' views of the government approach to quarantine. The information thus collected was then analyzed using the &quot;What is the Problem Represented (WPR)&quot; approach for data analysis introduced by Carol Bacchi, and focuses on the question, &quot;What effects are produced by the representation of the problem?&quot; The Iranian Government decided to quarantine people and close most sectors during the New Year holidays in Iran in March 2020. The duration of quarantine was only 2 weeks, and the government then ordered government organizations and industrial companies to reopen. The advantage of a short quarantine period is assumed to be the reinstatement of productivity while the disadvantage is the likely risk of further transmission of the virus. The government approach to and communication about the quarantine period has neglected to consider the psychosocial safety climate of employees, who have to go to their workplaces using buses, subways, or other vehicles, and who are under pressure mentally because of fear of infection, dismissal for non-attendance, and the consequent economic problems. The government approach necessarily impacts on the perceived psychosocial safety climate of employees, and hence influences the causes of work stress. If the psychosocial safety climate is not considered and improved, it may reduce the quality of services and products, and increase accidents.","Seddighi, Dollard, Salmani",https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2020.370,20201125.0,COVID-19; Iran; human resources management; mental health; occupational health; policy analysis; psychosocial safety climate,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
139,The Impact of COVID-19 Stay-At-Home Orders on Health Behaviors in Adults,"Stay-at-home orders in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have forced abrupt changes to daily routines. This study assessed lifestyle changes across different BMI classifications in response to the global pandemic. The online survey targeting adults was distributed in April 2020 and collected information on dietary behaviors, physical activity, and mental health. All questions were presented as &quot;before&quot; and &quot;since&quot; the COVID-19 pandemic. In total, 7,753 participants were included; 32.2% of the sample were individuals with normal weight, 32.1% had overweight, and 34.0% had obesity. During the pandemic, overall scores for healthy eating increased (Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.001), owing to less eating out and increased cooking (Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.001). Sedentary leisure behaviors increased, while time spent in physical activity (absolute time and intensity adjusted) declined (Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.001). Anxiety scores increased 8.78â€‰Â±â€‰0.21 during the pandemic, and the magnitude of increase was significantly greater in people with obesity (Pâ€‰â‰¤â€‰0.01). Weight gain was reported in 27.5% of the total sample compared with 33.4% in participants with obesity. The COVID-19 pandemic has produced significant health effects, well beyond the virus itself. Government mandates together with fear of contracting the virus have significantly impacted lifestyle behaviors alongside declines in mental health. These deleterious impacts have disproportionally affected individuals with obesity.","Flanagan, Beyl, Fearnbach, Altazan, Martin, Redman",https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.23066,20201218.0,,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
140,COVID-19 pandemic and mental distress in multiple sclerosis: implications for clinical management,"In multiple sclerosis (MS), disease-related factors and dysfunctional coping might favor the development of mental distress induced by COVID-19 containment measures. Aim of this study was exploring the relationship between disability, coping strategies, daily life reorganization and neuropsychiatric symptoms in an Italian MS population during the COVID-19 lockdown, in order to identify potentially modifiable factors that could inform clinical management of mental distress in people with MS. We explored the relationship between mental distress, disability and coping strategies in the Italian MS population under lockdown. Structural equation modeling was applied to information collected via web survey to identify modifiable factors that could account for mental distress. A total of 845 participants (497 with MS and 348 controls) were included in the study. The MS group had higher scores than the control group for depression (PÂ =Â 0.005), but not for anxiety, emotional dyscontrol or sleep disturbances. The structural equation modeling explained 74% of the variance observed in depression score. Within the model, three latent factors were characterized from measured variables: motor disability and cognitive dysfunction contributed to disability (Î²Â =Â 0.509 and Î²Â =Â 0.836; PÂ &lt;Â 0.001); positive attitude and exercise contributed to active attitude (Î²Â =Â 0.386 and Î²Â =Â 0.297; PÂ &lt;Â 0.001); and avoidance, social support and watching television contributed to passive attitude (Î²Â =Â 0.301, Î²Â =Â 0.243 and Î²Â =Â 0.212; PÂ &lt;Â 0.001). With regard to the relationship between latent factors and their influence on depression, disability contributed to passive attitude (Î²Â =Â 0.855; PÂ &lt;Â 0.001), while both passive and active attitude significantly influenced depression (Î²Â =Â 0.729 and Î²Â =Â -0.456; PÂ &lt;Â 0.001). As a practical implication of our model, favoring exercise would enhance active attitude and its positive impact on mental well-being while, at the same time, reducing the negative impact of disability on depression, representing a valuable tool in facing COVID-19-related mental distress.","Costabile, Carotenuto, Lavorgna, Borriello, Moiola, Inglese, Petruzzo, Trojsi, Ianniello, Nozzolillo, Cellerino, Boffa, Rosa, Servillo, Moccia, Bonavita, Filippi, Lanzillo, Brescia Morra, Petracca",https://doi.org/10.1111/ene.14580,20201120.0,COVID-19; coping; depression; exercise; multiple sclerosis,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
141,&quot;Physical Sex Is Over for Now&quot;: Impact of COVID-19 on the Well-Being and Sexual Health of Adolescent Sexual Minority Males in the US,"This study aimed to explore how the COVID-19 pandemic and physical distancing measures have impacted the well-being and sexual health among adolescent sexual minority males (ASMM) during the initial phase of physical distancing mandates in the U.S. From March 27, 2020, to May 8, 2020, U.S. ASMM (NÂ = 151; aged 14-17 years) completed the online baseline survey of a sexual health intervention trial. COVID-19-related closed- and open-ended questions were included. A mixed-methods approach assessed COVID-19-related changes in well-being and sexual health by outness with an accepting guardian. The majority (57%) of participants reported being worried about COVID-19. Almost all (91%) were physically distancing. Participants noted that COVID-19 changed school, home, work, and family life. Participants highlighted that COVID-19 reduced their ability to socialize and had a deleterious effect on their mental health. In the past 3 months, participants reported seeing sexual partners in person less often, masturbating and viewing pornography more often, and sexting and messaging on men-seeking-men websites/phone applications about the same amount. Many described being physically distanced from sexual partners, and some noted an increase in their use of virtual ways to connect with partners (e.g., video chatting). There were no differences by outness with an accepting guardian in quantitative or qualitative responses. These findings provide a snapshot of the initial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic among a convenience sample of U.S. ASMM and underscore the need to provide access to resources sensitive to their social, developmental, and sexual health needs during this crisis.","Nelson, Gordon, John, Stout, Macapagal",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.08.027,20201224.0,ASMM; Adolescents; COVID-19; Mental health; Sexual health; Sexual minority; YMSM; Adolescent; Adolescent Health; COVID-19; Humans; Internet; Male; Sexual Partners; Sexual and Gender Minorities; Surveys and Questionnaires; United States,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

143,Virtual Reality Behavioral Activation as an Intervention for Major Depressive Disorder: Case Report,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a global problem with an increasing incidence and prevalence. There has additionally been an increase in depression due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Behavioral activation is considered an evidence-based treatment for MDD. However, there are many barriers that could hinder one's ability to engage in behavioral activation, with COVID-19 &quot;shelter-in-place&quot; and social distancing orders being current and large impediments. Virtual reality (VR) has been successfully used to help treat a variety of mental health conditions, but it has not yet been used as a method of administering behavioral activation to a clinical population. Using VR to engage in behavioral activation could eliminate barriers that pandemic precautions place and help decrease symptoms of depression that are especially exacerbated in these times. The following case report examines the feasibility, acceptability, and tolerability of VR behavioral activation for an adult with MDD during a global pandemic. This participant was part of a larger pilot study, and the case serves as a description of the VR intervention. The participant engaged in a weekly 50-minute psychotherapy Zoom session for 4 weeks, in which a modified behavioral activation protocol was administered using a VR headset to simulate activities. Data on mood ratings, homework compliance, and headset use were obtained from the headset. Acceptability, tolerability, and depression symptoms were obtained using self-report rating scales. The intervention was feasible, acceptable, and tolerable, as reported by this participant. The participant's depressive symptoms decreased by five-points on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 over a month, with a beginning score of 10 (moderate depression) and a final score of 5 (mild depression).

144,Trauma-informed responses in addressing public mental health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic: position paper of the European Society for Traumatic Stress Studies (ESTSS),"The COVID-19 pandemic has changed life in Europe and globally. The pandemic affects both individuals and the broader society across many domains, including physical and psychological health, the economy and general welfare. The measures taken to counteract the pandemic have significantly altered daily life and, along with the threat of contracting the coronavirus and uncertainties surrounding future developments, created a complex system of stressors with a negative impact on public mental health. This paper aims to outline the ESTSS strategy to address mental health issues related to COVID-19 and focuses on (1) trauma-informed policies, (2) capacity building, (3) collaborative research and (4) knowledge-exchange. To facilitate implementation of a trauma-informed approach and appropriate measures, ESTSS has developed a toolkit of recommendations on mental health and psychosocial assistance to be provided during the different phases of crisis and its aftermath. To promote capacity building, ESTSS offers a certification programme based on a curriculum in psychotraumatology and corresponding on-line training to the European community of mental health professionals. To assure evidence-based approaches and methods tailored to current circumstances, ESTSS has initiated a pan-European research project with international cooperation aimed at studying the mental health consequences of the pandemic, with a focus on psychological trauma and other stress-related reactions. To foster knowledge-exchange, the European Journal of Psychotraumatology (EJPT), the official journal of ESTSS, is publishing a special issue on COVID-19. La pandemia de COVID-19 ha cambiado la vida en Europa y en todo el mundo. La pandemia afecta tanto a los individuos como a la sociedad en general en muchos Ã¡mbitos, incluida la salud fÃ­sica y psicolÃ³gica, la economÃ­a y el bienestar general. Las medidas tomadas para contrarrestar la pandemia han alterado significativamente la vida diaria y, junto con la amenaza de contraer el coronavirus y las incertidumbres que rodean los desarrollos futuros, crearon un complejo sistema de estresores con un impacto negativo en la salud mental pÃºblica. En este artÃ­culo se pretende esbozar la estrategia de la ESTSS para abordar los problemas de salud mental relacionados con COVID-19 y se centra en: 1. PolÃ­ticas informadas en trauma, 2. capacitaciÃ³n, 3. investigaciÃ³n colaborativa, 4. e intercambio de conocimientos. Para facilitar la implementaciÃ³n de un enfoque basado en el trauma y las medidas apropiadas, la ESTSS ha desarrollado un conjunto de herramientas de recomendaciones sobre salud mental y asistencia psicosocial que se proporcionarÃ¡ durante las diferentes fases de la crisis y sus consecuencias. Para fomentar la capacitaciÃ³n, la ESTSS ofrece un programa de certificaciÃ³n basado en un plan de estudios en psicotraumatologÃ­a y la formaciÃ³n on-line correspondiente a la comunidad europea de profesionales de la salud mental. Para asegurar enfoques y mÃ©todos basados en la evidencia adaptados a las circunstancias actuales, la ESTSS ha iniciado un proyecto de investigaciÃ³n paneuropeo con cooperaciÃ³n internacional, destinado a estudiar las consecuencias de la pandemia en la salud mental, con enfoque en el trauma psicolÃ³gico y otras reacciones relacionadas con el estrÃ©s. Para fomentar intercambio de conocimiento, la European Journal of Psychotraumatology (EJPT), la revista oficial de ESTSS, publica un nÃºmero especial sobre COVID-19.

146,Risk of Mortality in Elderly Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients With Mental Health Disorders: A Nationwide Retrospective Study in South Korea,"This study aimed to investigate the different clinical characteristics among elderly coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with and without mental disorders in South Korea and determine if these characteristics have an association with underlying mental disorders causing mortality. A population-based comparative cohort study was conducted using the national claims database. Individuals aged â‰¥65 years with confirmed COVID-19 between January 1, 2020 and April 10, 2020 were assessed. The endpoints for evaluating mortality for all participants were death, 21 days after diagnosis, or April 10, 2020. The risk of mortality associated with mental disorders was estimated using Cox hazards regression. We identified 814 elderly COVID-19 patients (255 [31.3%] with mental disorder and 559 [68.7%] with nonmental disorder). Individuals with mental disorders were found more likely to be older, taking antithrombotic agents, and had diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive lung disease, and urinary tract infections than those without mental disorders. After propensity score stratification, our study included 781 patients in each group (236 [30.2%] with mental disorder and 545 [69.8%] with nonmental disorder). The mental disorder group showed higher mortality rates than the nonmental disorder group (12.7% [30/236] versus 6.8% [37/545]). However, compared to patients without mental disorders, the hazard ratio (HR) for mortality in elderly COVID-19 patients with mental disorders was not statistically significant (HR: 1.57, 95%CI: 0.95-2.56). Although the association between mental disorders in elderly individuals and mortality in COVID-19 is unclear, this study suggests that elderly patients with comorbid conditions and those taking psychiatric medications might be at a higher risk of COVID-19.","Lee, Cho, You, Park, Kim, Lee, Aizenstein, Andreescu, Karim, Hong, Rho, Park, Son",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.09.016,20201130.0,"COVID-19; Elderly; mental disorder; mortality; Aged; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; Cohort Studies; Comorbidity; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Proportional Hazards Models; Republic of Korea; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; SARS-CoV-2",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
147,"Communicable Diseases (Including COVID-19)-Induced Global Depression: Caused by Inadequate Healthcare Expenditures, Population Density, and Mass Panic","Coronavirus (COVID-19) is spreading at an enormous rate and has caused deaths beyond expectations due to a variety of reasons. These include: (i) inadequate healthcare spending causing, for instance, a shortage of protective equipment, testing swabs, masks, surgical gloves, gowns, etc.; (ii) a high population density that causes close physical contact among community members who reside in compact places, hence they are more likely to be exposed to communicable diseases, including coronavirus; and (iii) mass panic due to the fear of experiencing the loss of loved ones, lockdown, and shortage of food. In a given scenario, the study focused on the following key variables: communicable diseases, healthcare expenditures, population density, poverty, economic growth, and COVID-19 dummy variable in a panel of 76 selected countries from 2010 through 2019. The results show that the impact of communicable diseases on economic growth is positive because the infected countries get a reap of economic benefits from other countries in the form of healthcare technologies, knowledge transfers, cash transfers, international loans, aid, etc., to get rid of the diseases. However, the case is different with COVID-19 as it has seized the whole world together in a much shorter period of time and no other countries are able to help others in terms of funding loans, healthcare facilities, or technology transfers. Thus, the impact of COVID-19 in the given study is negatively impacting countries' economic growth that converts into a global depression. The high incidence of poverty and social closeness increases more vulnerable conditions that spread coronavirus across countries. The momentous increase in healthcare expenditures put a burden on countries' national healthcare bills that stretch the depression phase-out of the boundary. The forecasting relationship suggested the negative impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the global economy would last the next 10 years. Unified global healthcare policies, physical distancing, smart lockdowns, and meeting food challenges are largely required to combat the coronavirus pandemic and escape from global depression.","Anser, Yousaf, Khan, Sheikh, Nassani, Abro, Zaman",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.00398,20201006.0,(COVID-19); GMM estimator; communicable diseases; global depression; healthcare expenditures; population density; poverty incidence,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
148,Severe SARS-CoV-2 disease in the context of a NF-ÎºB2 loss-of-function pathogenic variant,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus that emerged recently and has created a global pandemic. Symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been associated with a host of symptoms affecting numerous organ systems, including the lungs, cardiovascular system, kidney, central nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, and skin, among others. Although several risk factors have been identified as related to complications from and severity of COVID-19, much about the virus remains unknown. The host immune response appears to affect the outcome of disease. It is not surprising that patients with intrinsic or secondary immune compromise might be particularly susceptible to complications from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pathogenic loss-of-function or gain-of-function heterozygous variants in nuclear factor-ÎºB2 have been reported to be associated with either a combined immunodeficiency or common variable immunodeficiency phenotype. We evaluated the functional consequence and immunologic phenotype of a novel NFKB2 loss of function variant in a 17-year-old male patient and describe the clinical management of SARS-CoV-2 infection in this context. This patient required a 2-week hospitalization for SARS-CoV-2 infection, including 7 days of mechanical ventilation. We used biologic therapies to avert potentially fatal acute respiratory distress syndrome and treat hyperinflammatory responses. The patient had an immunologic phenotype of B-cell dysregulation with decreased switched memory B cells. Despite the underlying immune dysfunction, he recovered from the infection with intense management. This clinical case exemplifies some of the practical challenges in management of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in the context of underlying immune dysregulation.","Abraham, Marshall, Kuehn, Rueda, Gibbs, Guider, Stewart, Rosenzweig, Wang, Jean, Peeples, King, Hunt, Honegger, Ramilo, Mustillo, Mejias, Ardura, Shimamura",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2020.09.020,20201021.0,COVID-19; NF-ÎºB; NF-ÎºB pathway; NF-ÎºB2; SARS-CoV-2; immunodeficiency,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
149,Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States: Online Survey,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had numerous worldwide effects. In the United States, there have been 8.3 million cases and nearly 222,000 deaths as of October 21, 2020. Based on previous studies of mental health during outbreaks, the mental health of the population will be negatively affected in the aftermath of this pandemic. The long-term nature of this pandemic may lead to unforeseen mental health outcomes and/or unexpected relationships between demographic factors and mental health outcomes. This research focused on assessing the mental health status of adults in the United States during the early weeks of an unfolding pandemic. Data was collected from English-speaking adults from early April to early June 2020 using an online survey. The final convenience sample included 1083 US residents. The 71-item survey consisted of demographic questions, mental health and well-being measures, a coping mechanisms checklist, and questions about COVID-19-specific concerns. Hierarchical multivariable logistic regression was used to explore associations among demographic variables and mental health outcomes. Hierarchical linear regression was conducted to examine associations among demographic variables, COVID-19-specific concerns, and mental health and well-being outcomes. Approximately 50% (536/1076) of the US sample was aged â‰¥45 years. Most of the sample was White (1013/1054, 96%), non-Hispanic (985/1058, 93%), and female (884/1073, 82%). Participants reported high rates of depression (295/1034, 29%), anxiety (342/1007, 34%), and stress (773/1058, 73%). Older individuals were less likely to report depressive symptomology (OR 0.78, P&lt;.001) and anxiety symptomology (OR 0.72, P&lt;.001); in addition, they had lower stress scores (-0.15 points, SE 0.01, P&lt;.001) and increased well-being scores (1.86 points, SE 0.22, P&lt;.001). Individuals who were no longer working due to COVID-19 were 2.25 times more likely to report symptoms of depression (P=.02), had a 0.51-point increase in stress (SE 0.17, P=.02), and a 3.9-point decrease in well-being scores (SE 1.49, P=.009) compared to individuals who were working remotely before and after COVID-19. Individuals who had partial or no insurance coverage were 2-3 times more likely to report depressive symptomology compared to individuals with full coverage (P=.02 and P=.01, respectively). Individuals who were on Medicare/Medicaid and individuals with no coverage were 1.97 and 4.48 times more likely to report moderate or severe anxiety, respectively (P=.03 and P=.01, respectively). Financial and food access concerns were significantly and positively related to depression, anxiety, and stress (all P&lt;.05), and significantly negatively related to well-being (both P&lt;.001). Economy, illness, and death concerns were significantly positively related to overall stress scores (all P&lt;.05). Our findings suggest that many US residents are experiencing high stress, depressive, and anxiety symptomatology, especially those who are underinsured, uninsured, or unemployed. Longitudinal investigation of these variables is recommended. Health practitioners may provide opportunities to allay concerns or offer coping techniques to individuals in need of mental health care. These messages should be shared in person and through practice websites and social media.","Jewell, Farewell, Welton-Mitchell, Lee-Winn, Walls, Leiferman",https://doi.org/10.2196/22043,20201101.0,COVID-19; anxiety; depression; mental health; pandemic; stress; well-being,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

151,"A repeated cross-sectional survey assessing university students' stress, depression, anxiety, and suicidality in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland","The time of widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases can lead to elevated stress and mental health problems among all persons affected, and in particular those sub-groups of the population that are at an increased risk of mental health problems. One such vulnerable group constitutes university students. The aim of this study is to assess stress, depression, anxiety, and suicidality among different groups of university students (medical, psychology, and other). Using a repeated cross-sectional study design, we collected survey data among a large sample of 7228 university students from Poland (mean age = 22.78, s.d. = 4.40; 81% female). Data were collected in five waves, during the first 2 months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe (March and April 2020). The results demonstrate a significant increase in depression levels as the pandemic was progressing. We also found that female students scored significantly higher than male students on depression, anxiety, and stress. Psychology students recorded the lowest scores on depression and anxiety. Young adult students (aged 18-24 years) had more symptoms of depression, anxiety, and suicidality than adult students (â©¾25 years). These results provide insights into stress and mental health among university students during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings can be used for a more effective identification of students who may struggle during next stages of the pandemic and future crises.","Debowska, Horeczy, Boduszek, Dolinski",https://doi.org/10.1017/S003329172000392X,20201020.0,Anxiety; COVID-19 pandemic; depression; stress; suicidality; university students,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
152,[Psychological effects during the COVID-19 outbreak in Argentina],"After the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak, global measures were implemented with the aim of containing its progression. On March 20, 2020, the mandatory preventive quarantine began in Argentina. As a result of these events, previous studies conducted in the framework of this pandemic in China, have shown psychological consequences. The aim of this study is to explore, through a self-administered electronic survey, attitudes and fears regarding COVID-19, the development of depressive symptoms and the pattern of alcohol consumption among the argentinian population during quarantine (n = 759). As a result, we observed that fear of COVID-19 was greater in 55 to 59 years old people, with an abrupt drop above 70; that depressed mood and the increased of alcohol consumption were more frequent in youngest subjects, and that depressed mood was also frequent among subjects who lost their jobs during quarantine. Finally, we observed an elevated degree of agreement with the quarantine measure, even in some people who suffered a decrease in their income greater than 80% during quarantine. These results are useful for obtaining information about risk groups, enabling specific preventive and therapeutic strategies could be designed. Luego de que la OrganizaciÃ³n Mundial de la Salud (OMS) declarara la pandemia por el nuevo coronavirus (COVID-19), se implementaron medidas a nivel mundial con el objetivo de contener su progresiÃ³n. El 20 de marzo de 2020 se iniciÃ³ el confinamiento preventivo obligatorio en Argentina. Estudios realizados en el marco de esta pandemia en China, han evidenciado consecuencias psicolÃ³gicas como resultado del temor al contagio y de las medidas de aislamiento. El objetivo del presente estudio es explorar a travÃ©s de una encuesta autoadministrada por vÃ­a electrÃ³nica, actitudes y temores frente al COVID-19, la presencia de sintomatologÃ­a depresiva y el patrÃ³n de consumo de alcohol de la poblaciÃ³n argentina durante el confinamiento (n = 759). Como resultado, observamos que el temor al COVID-19 fue mayor en las personas de entre 55 y 59 aÃ±os, con un descenso abrupto en los mayores de 70; que el Ã¡nimo depresivo y el incremento en el consumo de alcohol fueron mÃ¡s frecuentes en los mÃ¡s jÃ³venes y que el estado de Ã¡nimo depresivo mostrÃ³ una frecuencia mayor en quienes perdieron el empleo durante el confinamiento. Finalmente, observamos que el grado de acuerdo de los participantes con la medida de confinamiento fue superior al 90% incluso en aquellas personas que sufrieron una disminuciÃ³n de sus ingresos mayor al 80% durante la cuarentena.

153,Management of psychiatric conditions and delirium during the COVID-19 pandemic across continents: lessons learned and recommendations,"With the uncertainties of COVID-19, people infected with coronavirus present with diverse psychiatric presentations. Some institutions have had to manage their patients with existing protocols, others have had to create them. In this article we aimed to report the challenges and good practices in the management of psychiatric conditions and delirium coexisting with COVID-19 across continents. Early Career Psychiatrists (ECPs) from across five continents were approached to share their experiences on the management of psychiatric conditions in patients with COVID-19 during the current pandemic. We collected information about the experiences from sixteen countries. Commonalities were similar psychiatric presentations and poor preparedness across countries. Differences were varying adjustments made in the management of psychiatric conditions coexisting with COVID-19 and different innovations. Good practices which can be adopted by other countries are novel approaches such as telepsychiatry, proactive consultation-liaison units and enhanced community services targeted at circumventing challenges faced when providing mental health services. These findings highlight the need for global preparedness in the mental health sector during outbreaks of infectious diseases, and the need for concerted efforts targeted at global and locally sensitive adaptation of existing protocols and the development of new guidelines for the management of psychiatric conditions for the present pandemic and subsequent occurrences.","Ojeahere, de Filippis, Ransing, Karaliuniene, Ullah, BytyÃ§i, Abbass, Kilic, Nahidi, Hayatudeen, Nagendrappa, Shoib, Jatchavala, Larnaout, Maiti, Ogunnubi, El Hayek, Bizri, Schuh Teixeira, Pereira-Sanchez, Pinto da Costa",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2020.100147,20201216.0,COVID-19; Coronavirus; Delirium; Early career psychiatrists (ECPs); Management; Psychiatric conditions,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

During a pandemic, those with high health anxiety are at risk of adverse mental health outcomes, including peritraumatic distress and mood disturbance. No prior research has explored the role of psychological flexibility in protecting people at high risk of poorer mental health impacts due to health anxiety during a pandemic. Psychological flexibility is the cornerstone of psychological health and resiliency. According to acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), it involves behaving consistently with one's chosen values even in the presence of emotional and mental discomfort. This study examined the mediating and moderating roles of psychological flexibility in the link between trait health anxiety and three mental health outcomes: COVID-19 peritraumatic distress, anxiety, and depression. We hypothesized that higher psychological flexibility would decrease the negative impacts of trait health anxiety on mental health outcomes. During the mandatory national lockdown (<i>M</i> = 35.70 days, <i>SD</i> = 8.41), 944 Italian adults (75.5% female, <i>M</i> = 38.86 years, <i>SD</i> = 13.20) completed an online survey consisting of standardized measures of psychological flexibility, trait health anxiety, COVID-19 distress, anxiety, and depression. Results indicated that psychological flexibility did not moderate the link between trait health anxiety and mental health outcomes. Rather, greater psychological flexibility mediated decreases in the adverse effects of trait health anxiety on COVID-19 distress, anxiety, and depression. In particular, two psychological flexibility processes, observing unhelpful thoughts rather than taking them literally (defusion) and values-based action (committed action), mediated decreases in the negative effects of trait health anxiety on all mental health outcomes. In contrast, the psychological flexibility process acceptance, which involves openness to inner discomfort, mediated increases in negative mental health outcomes. Overall, the combination of these processes mitigated the detrimental impacts of trait health anxiety on mental health during the emergency mandatory COVID-19 nationwide lockdown. Consistent with the ACT conceptualization of psychological flexibility, findings suggest embracing (rather than avoiding) inner discomfort and observing associated unhelpful thoughts, while also engaging in values-based action, increases resilience during adversity. Evidenced-based large-scale online public health interventions that target psychological flexibility in those experiencing health anxiety in the context of a pandemic are urgently needed. Many empirically-based ACT interventions are suited for this purpose.","Landi, Pakenham, Boccolini, Grandi, Tossani",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.02195,20201001.0,COVID-19; anxiety; depression; health anxiety; pandemic; psychological flexibility; quarantine,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
155,Effects of the lockdown on the mental health of the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy: Results from the COMET collaborative network,"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is an unprecedented traumatic event influencing the healthcare, economic, and social welfare systems worldwide. In order to slow the infection rates, lockdown has been implemented almost everywhere. Italy, one of the countries most severely affected, entered the &quot;lockdown&quot; on March 8, 2020. The COvid Mental hEalth Trial (COMET) network includes 10 Italian university sites and the National Institute of Health. The whole study has three different phases. The first phase includes an online survey conducted between March and May 2020 in the Italian population. Recruitment took place through email invitation letters, social media, mailing lists of universities, national medical associations, and associations of stakeholders (e.g., associations of users/carers). In order to evaluate the impact of lockdown on depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms, multivariate linear regression models were performed, weighted for the propensity score. The final sample consisted of 20,720 participants. Among them, 12.4% of respondents (NÂ =Â 2,555) reported severe or extremely severe levels of depressive symptoms, 17.6% (NÂ =Â 3,627) of anxiety symptoms and 41.6% (NÂ =Â 8,619) reported to feel at least moderately stressed by the situation at the DASS-21.According to the multivariate regression models, the depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms significantly worsened from the week April 9-15 to the week April 30 to May 4 (pÂ &lt;Â 0.0001). Moreover, female respondents and people with pre-existing mental health problems were at higher risk of developing severe depression and anxiety symptoms (pÂ &lt;Â 0.0001). Although physical isolation and lockdown represent essential public health measures for containing the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, they are a serious threat for mental health and well-being of the general population. As an integral part of COVID-19 response, mental health needs should be addressed.","Fiorillo, Sampogna, Giallonardo, Del Vecchio, Luciano, Albert, Carmassi, CarrÃ , Cirulli, Dell'Osso, Nanni, Pompili, Sani, Tortorella, Volpe",https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2020.89,20201021.0,"Anxiety; COVID-19; depression; lockdown; pandemic; stress; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Italy; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; SARS-CoV-2; Stress, Psychological; Universities; Young Adult",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
156,The potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on child growth and development: a systematic review,"This was a systematic review of studies that examined the impact of epidemics or social restriction on mental and developmental health in parents and children/adolescents. The PubMed, WHO COVID-19, and SciELO databases were searched on March 15, 2020, and on April 25, 2020, filtering for children (0-18 years) and humans. The tools used to mitigate the threat of a pandemic such as COVID-19 may very well threaten child growth and development. These tools - such as social restrictions, shutdowns, and school closures - contribute to stress in parents and children and can become risk factors that threaten child growth and development and may compromise the Sustainable Development Goals. The studies reviewed suggest that epidemics can lead to high levels of stress in parents and children, which begin with concerns about children becoming infected. These studies describe several potential mental and emotional consequences of epidemics such as COVID-19, H1N1, AIDS, and Ebola: severe anxiety or depression among parents and acute stress disorder, post-traumatic stress, anxiety disorders, and depression among children. These data can be related to adverse childhood experiences and elevated risk of toxic stress. The more adverse experiences, the greater the risk of developmental delays and health problems in adulthood, such as cognitive impairment, substance abuse, depression, and non-communicable diseases. Information about the impact of epidemics on parents and children is relevant to policy makers to aid them in developing strategies to help families cope with epidemic/pandemic-driven adversity and ensure their children's healthy development.","AraÃºjo, Veloso, Souza, Azevedo, Tarro",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jped.2020.08.008,20201006.0,COVID-19; Child development; Coronavirus; SARS-COV2; Sustainable development goals; Toxic stress,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

This was a survey study consisting of a 23-point questionnaire. The study involved surgical trainees that had been redeployed to the (ICU) across all hospitals in London during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey was sent to 90 surgical trainees who were between postgraduate years 2 to 4. Trainees in specialty training programs (&gt;5 years after graduation) were not included. Thirty-two trainees responded to the questionnaire and were included in the study results. All respondents spent between 4 and 8 weeks working in ICU. Prior to redeployment, 78% of participants had previous experience of ICU or an affiliated specialty, and &gt;90% had attended at least 1 educational course with relevance to ICU. There were statistically significant increases in confidence performing central venous cannulation and peripheral arterial catheterisation (p &lt; 0.05). With regards to clinical skills, respondents reported feeling more confident managing ventilated patients, patients on noninvasive ventilation, dialysis, and circulatory failure patients after working in ICU. Respondents (97%) felt that the experience would be beneficial to their future careers but 53% felt the redeployment had a negative impact on their mental health. Redeployment of surgical trainees to ICU led to increased confidence in a number of technical and nontechnical skills. However, proactive interventions are needed for training surgeons with regard to their psychological wellbeing in these extraordinary circumstances and to improve workforce planning for future pandemics.","Payne, Rahman, Bullingham, Vamadeva, Alfa-Wali",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsurg.2020.09.009,20201001.0,COVID-19; Pandemic; Surgical training; Wellbeing; Workforce,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

160,Hidden scars: the impact of violence and the COVID-19 pandemic on children's mental health,"More than 1 billion children are exposed to violence every year. The devastating immediate and long-term impact of violence on the mental health of children is well established. Despite commitments made by the international community to end violence against children and support their mental health, there has been a serious lack of investment and capacity to provide quality, rights-based, culturally appropriate mental health care globally. The arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic has magnified these challenges. This article outlines how the risk of children experiencing violence has increased and how the pandemic has weakened the capacity of child protection and mental health services to respond. The article argues for child protection, mental health and other core services to be prioritized during and after the pandemic. A failure to do so will undermine the international community's ability to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 and to fulfil its obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.",Maalla M'jid,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13034-020-00340-8,20200928.0,COVID-19 pandemic; Child rights; Mental health; Sustainable development goals; Violence against children,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

162,[Immunopsychiatry and SARS-CoV-2Â pandemic: Links and possible consequences],"The SARS-CoV-2 (or COVID-19) pandemic has been propagating since December 2019, inducing a drastic increase in the prevalence of anxious and depressive disorders in the general population. Psychological trauma can partly explain these disorders. However, since psychiatric disorders also have an immuno-inflammatory component, the direct effects of the virus on the host's immune system, with a marked inflammatory response, but also the secondary inflammation to these psychosocial stressors, may cause the apparition or the worsening of psychiatric disorders. We describe here the probable immunopsychiatric consequences of the SARS-CoV-2Â pandemic, to delineate possible screening actions and care that could be planned. Data from previous pandemics, and existing data on the psychopathological consequences of the SARS-CoV-2Â pandemic, allowed us to review the possible immunopsychiatric consequences of the SARS-CoV-2Â pandemic, on the gestational environment, with the risk of consecutive neurodevelopmental disorders for the fetus on one hand, on the children and adults directly infected being at increased risks of psychiatric disorders on the other hand. As in previous pandemics, the activation of the immune system due to psychological stress and/or to infection during pregnancy, might lead to an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders for the fetus (schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders). Furthermore, in individuals exposed to psychological trauma and/or infected by the virus, the risk of psychiatric disorders, especially mood disorders, is probably increased. In this context, preventive measures and specialized care are necessary. Thus, it is important to propose a close follow-up to the individuals who have been infected by the virus, in order to set up the earliest care possible. Likewise, in pregnant women, screening of mood disorders during the pregnancy or the postpartum period must be facilitated. The follow-up of the babies born during the pandemic must be strengthened to screen and care for possible neurodevelopmental disorders.","Daaboul, Tamouza, Leboyer",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.07.002,20201001.0,Autism spectrum disorders; Immunopsychiatrie; Immunopsychiatry; Mood disorders; SARS-CoV-2; Schizophrenia; SchizophrÃ©nie; Troubles de lâ€™humeur; Troubles du spectre de lâ€™autisme,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
163,Self-Reported Compliance With Personal Preventive Measures Among Chinese Factory Workers at the Beginning of Work Resumption Following the COVID-19 Outbreak: Cross-Sectional Survey Study,"Maintaining compliance with personal preventive measures is important to achieve a balance of COVID-19 pandemic control and work resumption. The aim of this study was to investigate self-reported compliance with four personal measures to prevent COVID-19 among a sample of factory workers in Shenzhen, China, at the beginning of work resumption in China following the COVID-19 outbreak. These preventive measures included consistent wearing of face masks in public spaces (the workplace and other public settings); sanitizing hands using soap, liquid soap, or alcohol-based hand sanitizer after returning from public spaces or touching public installations and equipment; avoiding social and meal gatherings; and avoiding crowded places. The participants were adult factory workers who had resumed work in Shenzhen, China. A stratified two-stage cluster sampling design was used. We randomly selected 14 factories that had resumed work. All full-time employees aged â‰¥18 years who had resumed work in these factories were invited to complete a web-based survey. Out of 4158 workers who had resumed work in these factories, 3035 (73.0%) completed the web-based survey from March 1 to 14, 2020. Multilevel logistic regression models were fitted. Among the 3035 participants, 2938 (96.8%) and 2996 (98.7%) reported always wearing a face mask in the workplace and in other public settings, respectively, in the past month. However, frequencies of self-reported sanitizing hands (2152/3035, 70.9%), avoiding social and meal gatherings (2225/3035, 73.3%), and avoiding crowded places (1997/3035, 65.8%) were relatively low. At the individual level, knowledge about COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratios [AORs] from 1.16, CI 1.10-1.24, to 1.29, CI 1.21-1.37), perceived risk (AORs from 0.58, CI 0.50-0.68, to 0.85, CI 0.72-0.99) and severity (AOR 1.05, CI 1.01-1.09, and AOR 1.07, CI 1.03-1.11) of COVID-19, perceived effectiveness of preventive measures by the individual (AORs from 1.05, CI 1.00-1.10, to 1.09, CI 1.04-1.13), organization (AOR 1.30, CI 1.20-1.41), and government (AORs from 1.14, CI 1.04-1.25, to 1.21, CI 1.02-1.42), perceived preparedness for a potential outbreak after work resumption (AORs from 1.10, CI 1.00-1.21, to 1.50, CI 1.36-1.64), and depressive symptoms (AORs from 0.93, CI 0.91-0.94, to 0.96, CI 0.92-0.99) were associated with self-reported compliance with at least one personal preventive measure. At the interpersonal level, exposure to COVID-19-specific information through official media channels (AOR 1.08, CI 1.04-1.11) and face-to-face communication (AOR 0.90, CI 0.83-0.98) were associated with self-reported sanitizing of hands. The number of preventive measures implemented in the workplace was positively associated with self-reported compliance with all four preventive measures (AORs from 1.30, CI 1.08-1.57, to 1.63, CI 1.45-1.84).

164,A rapid review investigating the potential impact of a pandemic on the mental health of young people aged 12-25 years,"In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a pandemic. Adolescence and early adulthood are peak times for the onset of mental health difficulties. Exposure to a pandemic during this vulnerable developmental period places young people at significant risk of negative psychological experiences. The objective of this research was to summarise existing evidence on the potential impact of a pandemic on the mental health of 12-25 year olds. A rapid review of the published peer-reviewed literature, published between 1985 and 2020, using PsycINFO (Proquest) and Medline (Proquest) was conducted. Narrative synthesis was used across studies to identify key themes and concepts. This review found 3,359 papers, which was reduced to 12 papers for data extraction. Results regarding the prevalence of psychological difficulties in youth were mixed, with some studies finding this group experience heightened distress during an infectious disease outbreak, and others finding no age differences or higher distress among adults. Gender, coping, self-reported physical health and adoption of precautionary measures appear to play a role in moderating the psychological impact of an infectious disease outbreak. Most studies were conducted after the peak of an epidemic/pandemic or in the recovery period. More longitudinal research with young people, particularly adolescents in the general population, before and during the early stages of an infectious disease outbreak is needed to obtain a clear understanding of how best to support young people during these events.","O'Reilly, Tibbs, Booth, Doyle, McKeague, Moore",https://doi.org/10.1017/ipm.2020.106,20201207.0,COVID-19; Coronavirus; epidemic; infectious disease outbreak; pandemic; rapid review; youth mental health,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

This research aimed to explore the effect of adverse childhood experience (ACE) on suicide ideation in young cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Self-reported questionnaires analyzed the mediating effects of sleep quality, anxiety symptoms, and inflammatory conditions between ACE and suicide ideation. A total of 197 young cancer patients (age 18-40) completed questionnaires and a blood test. Correlation analysis and structural equation model were used to explore the relationships between ACE, sleep quality, anxiety symptom, serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and suicide ideation. The mediating roles of sleep quality, anxiety symptoms, and CRP levels on the influence of ACE on suicide ideation were explored. ACE was positively related to anxiety symptoms, CRP levels, and suicide ideation, and negatively related to sleep quality. Anxiety symptoms and CRP levels were positively related to suicide ideation, while sleep quality was negatively related to suicide ideation. Anxiety symptoms were positively related to CRP levels but negatively related to sleep quality. From these results, we found ACE affected suicide ideation directly and was mediated by roles sleep quality, anxiety symptom and CRP. ACE not only directly affected suicide ideation but also affected suicide ideation through sleep quality, anxiety symptoms, and inflammatory conditions in young cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, targeted intervention and help for cancer patients from the perspective of ACE should be put into practice.","Yang, Xiao, Li, Yang",https://doi.org/10.2147/RMHP.S266269,20200928.0,adverse childhood experience; anxiety symptom; coronavirus disease 2019; psychosocial oncology; sleep quality; suicide ideation,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

168,Evaluating the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic: perceived risk of COVID-19 infection and childhood trauma predict adult depressive symptoms in urban South Africa,"South Africa's national lockdown introduced serious threats to public mental health in a society where one in three individuals develops a psychiatric disorder during their life. We aimed to evaluate the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic using a mixed-methods design. This longitudinal study drew from a preexisting sample of 957 adults living in Soweto, a major township near Johannesburg. Psychological assessments were administered across two waves between August 2019 and March 2020 and during the first 6 weeks of the lockdown (late March-early May 2020). Interviews on COVID-19 experiences were administered in the second wave. Multiple regression models examined relationships between perceived COVID-19 risk and depression. Full data on perceived COVID-19 risk, depression, and covariates were available in 221 adults. In total, 14.5% of adults were at risk for depression. Higher perceived COVID-19 risk predicted greater depressive symptoms (p &lt; 0.001), particularly among adults with histories of childhood trauma, though this effect was marginally significant (p = 0.063). Adults were about two times more likely to experience significant depressive symptoms for every one unit increase in perceived COVID-19 risk (p = 0.021; 95% CI 1.10-3.39). Qualitative data identified potent experiences of anxiety, financial insecurity, fear of infection, and rumination. Higher perceived risk of COVID-19 infection is associated with greater depressive symptoms during the first 6 weeks of quarantine. High rates of severe mental illness and low availability of mental healthcare amidst COVID-19 emphasize the need for immediate and accessible psychological resources.","Kim, Nyengerai, Mendenhall",https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291720003414,20201001.0,COVID-19; South Africa; childhood trauma; depression; risk perception,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

To evaluate anxiety and depression among morphea patients taking immunosuppressants compared with controls during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this case-control study, electronic data of 42 eligible morphea patients and 42 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects were extracted. All participants were asked about adherence to the health protocols and the symptoms of COVID-19. To investigate anxiety and depression, we provided the participants with an online version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) Questionnaire.

Next, we critique the suggested and actual changes and in so doing consider the immediate and longer term implications for adult social care, including mental health and mental capacity, at the time of publication.several core themes emerged: concerns around process and scrutiny; concerns about possible changes to the workforce and last, the possible threat on the ability to safeguard human rights. It has been shown that, ordinarily, legislative provisions across the jurisdictions of the UK are different, save for Wales (which shares most of its mental health law provisions with England). Such divergence is also mirrored in the way in which the suggested emergency changes could be implemented. Aside from this, there is also a wider concern about a lack of parity of esteem between social care and health care, a concern which is common to all. What is interesting is that the introduction of CVA 2020 forced a comparison to be made between the four UK nations which also shines a spotlight on how citizens can anticipate receipt of services.","Vicary, Stone, McCusker, Davidson, Spencer-Lane",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijlp.2020.101601,20201021.0,"Adult social care; Coronavirus act (Scotland) 2020; Coronavirus act 2020; Covid-19; Law; Mental capacity; Mental health; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; Commitment of Mentally Ill; Coronavirus Infections; Health Care Reform; Humans; Legislation, Medical; Mental Competency; Mental Disorders; Mental Health Services; Northern Ireland; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; SARS-CoV-2; United Kingdom",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
171,Mental health in the era of COVID-19: prevalence of psychiatric disorders in a cohort of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes during the social distancing,"In patients with diabetes, the prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms is about two to four times greater than in the general population. The association between diabetes and mental health disorders could be exacerbated in a stressful environment, and psychological distress could increase depressive symptoms and cause adverse diabetes outcomes. To assess the prevalence of mental health disorders in patients with diabetes during the social distancing period due to COVID-19 pandemic. This is a cross-sectional study developed to assess the impact of social distancing on a cohort of adults with type 1 (nâ€‰=â€‰52) and type 2 diabetes (nâ€‰=â€‰68) in Brazil. Inclusion criteria involved having an HbA1c test collected in the past 3Â months and having a valid telephone number in electronic medical records. The primary outcome was the prevalence of minor psychiatric disorders, assessed by survey (SRQ-20). Secondary outcomes included the prevalence of diabetes related emotional distress, eating and sleeping disorders, all assessed by validated surveys at the moment of the study. Statistical analyses included unpaired <i>t</i>-test for continuous variables and <i>Ï‡</i><sup>2</sup> test for categorical variables. Overall (nâ€‰=â€‰120), participants had a mean age of 54.8â€‰Â±â€‰14.4Â years-old, and HbA1c of 9.0â€‰Â±â€‰1.6% (75â€‰Â±â€‰17.5Â mmol/mol); 93% of patients showed signs of current mental suffering based on the surveys measured. Almost 43% of patients showed evidence of significant psychological distress, with a significant greater tendency in patients with type 2 diabetes. The presence of diabetes related emotional distress was found in 29.2% of patients; eating disorders in 75.8%; and moderate/severe sleeping disorders in 77.5%. We found a high prevalence of evidence of psychological distress among patients with diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic and this highlights the need for mental health access and support for patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.","Alessi, de Oliveira, Franco, Brino do Amaral, Becker, Knijnik, Kobe, de Carvalho, Telo, Schaan, Telo",https://doi.org/10.1186/s13098-020-00584-6,20200928.0,COVID-19 pandemic; Diabetes mellitus; Mental health; Quarantine; Social distancing,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

We used the depression-anxiety-stress scale and self-designed questionnaire on professional pride, intention to work in the front-line and the extent of family support. Medical students from 4 medical schools in Fujian and Hunan were investigated. Their mental health status, professional pride and first-line work willingness with different characteristics were compared, and the influential factors for professional pride and first-line work willingness were analyzed. A total of 266 valid questionnaires were collected. During the pandemic, there were significant differences in the proportion of depressed students among different college and universities, majors and stages (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05), and the professional pride was significantly different (<i>P</i>&lt;0.001). Medical students with different mental health status showed significant differences in professional pride (<i>P</i>&lt;0.01). Marriage, pressure and extent of family support were the influential factors for their professional pride (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05). The latter two were also influential factors for their intention to work in the front-line (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05). During the pandemic, students from college and nursing have relatively better mental health and higher professional pride. The professional pride is low in medical students who married, with abnormal stress or low family support. The intention to work in front-line is decreased in students with abnormal stress or low family support. <b>ç›®çš„</b>: äº†è§£2019å† çŠ¶ç—…æ¯’ç—…å¤§æµè¡ŒæœŸé—´åŒ»å­¦ç”Ÿçš„å¿ƒç†å¥åº·ã€èŒä¸šè‡ªè±ªæ„Ÿä¸Žä¸€çº¿å·¥ä½œæ„æ„¿ï¼Œä¸ºè¿›è¡Œå¿ƒç†å¹²é¢„æä¾›å‚è€ƒã€‚<b>æ–¹æ³•</b>: é‡‡ç”¨æŠ‘éƒ-ç„¦è™‘-åŽ‹åŠ›é‡è¡¨å’Œè‡ªè¡Œè®¾è®¡çš„å…³äºŽèŒä¸šè‡ªè±ªæ„Ÿã€ä¸€çº¿å·¥ä½œæ„æ„¿å’Œå®¶äººæ”¯æŒç¨‹åº¦çš„è°ƒæŸ¥é—®å·ï¼Œé€šè¿‡é—®å·æ˜Ÿå¹³å°å¯¹ç¦å»ºã€æ¹–å—4æ‰€åŒ»å­¦é™¢æ ¡çš„åŒ»å­¦ç”Ÿè¿›è¡Œè°ƒæŸ¥ï¼Œæ¯”è¾ƒä¸åŒç‰¹å¾çš„åŒ»å­¦ç”Ÿçš„å¿ƒç†å¥åº·çŠ¶å†µã€èŒä¸šè‡ªè±ªæ„Ÿå’Œä¸€çº¿å·¥ä½œæ„æ„¿ï¼Œå¹¶åˆ†æžèŒä¸šè‡ªè±ªæ„Ÿä¸Žä¸€çº¿å·¥ä½œæ„æ„¿çš„å½±å“å› ç´ ã€‚<b>ç»“æžœ</b>: å›žæ”¶æœ‰æ•ˆé—®å·266ä»½ã€‚ç–«æƒ…æœŸé—´ä¸åŒé™¢æ ¡ã€ä¸“ä¸šã€é˜¶æ®µåŒ»å­¦ç”Ÿå‘ç”ŸæŠ‘éƒçš„æ¯”ä¾‹å’ŒèŒä¸šè‡ªè±ªæ„Ÿå·®å¼‚æœ‰ç»Ÿè®¡å­¦æ„ä¹‰(åˆ†åˆ«<i>P</i>&lt;0.05ï¼Œ<i>P</i>&lt;0.001)ï¼Œä¸åŒå¿ƒç†å¥åº·çŠ¶å†µçš„åŒ»å­¦ç”ŸèŒä¸šè‡ªè±ªæ„Ÿå·®å¼‚æœ‰ç»Ÿè®¡å­¦æ„ä¹‰(<i>P</i>&lt;0.01)ï¼Œå©šå§»ã€åŽ‹åŠ›ã€å®¶äººæ”¯æŒç¨‹åº¦æ˜¯åŒ»å­¦ç”ŸèŒä¸šè‡ªè±ªæ„Ÿçš„å½±å“å› ç´ (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05)ï¼ŒåŽä¸¤è€…ä¹Ÿæ˜¯åŒ»å­¦ç”Ÿä¸€çº¿å·¥ä½œæ„æ„¿çš„å½±å“å› ç´ (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05)ã€‚<b>ç»“è®º</b>: ç–«æƒ…æœŸé—´å¤§ä¸“é™¢æ ¡ã€æŠ¤ç†ä¸“ä¸šåŒ»å­¦ç”Ÿå¿ƒç†å¥åº·çŠ¶å†µè¾ƒå¥½ï¼ŒèŒä¸šè‡ªè±ªæ„Ÿè¾ƒé«˜ï¼Œå·²å©šã€åŽ‹åŠ›å¼‚å¸¸ã€å®¶äººæ”¯æŒç¨‹åº¦ä½Žçš„åŒ»å­¦ç”ŸèŒä¸šè‡ªè±ªæ„Ÿè¾ƒä½Žï¼ŒåŽ‹åŠ›å¼‚å¸¸ã€å®¶äººæ”¯æŒç¨‹åº¦ä½Žçš„åŒ»å­¦ç”Ÿä¸€çº¿å·¥ä½œæ„æ„¿ä¸‹é™ã€‚.","Zhan, Sun, Xie, Wen, Fu",https://doi.org/10.11817/j.issn.1672-7347.2020.200440,20200908.0,"coronavirus disease 2019; intention to work in front-line; medical students; mental health; professional pride; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; China; Coronavirus Infections; Family; Humans; Intention; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Professionalism; SARS-CoV-2; Social Support; Stress, Psychological; Students, Medical; Surveys and Questionnaires",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

Using star platform of questionnaire, the staff in the general hospital were investigated via Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS-21), Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS) and Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ). The influential factors were discussed by descriptive analysis, rank sum test, single factor analysis, correlation analysis and multiple factors binary logistic regression analysis. A total of 2 060 valid questionnaires were collected. The negative emotions of nurses and cleaners were the most obvious. The depression scores, anxiety scores and stress scores for nurses and cleaners were 5.06Â±7.47, 6.36Â±7.84, 9.75Â±8.65, and 6.72Â±8.84, 4.51Â±6.56, 9.69Â±9.56, respectively. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis showed that staff types, education levels, job status, economic situation and concerns on the supplies of protective goods were the main influential factors for depression; staff types, contacting status with infected patients, economic situation, concerns on the supplies of protective goods, history of disease were the main influential factors for anxiety; contacting status with infected patients, economic situation, concerns on the supplies of protective goods were the main influential factors for stress. There are differences in psychological characteristics among different groups of staff in the general hospital under the outbreak. Thus psychological protection and intervention measures should be formulated according to different groups and work status. <b>ç›®çš„</b>: äº†è§£2019å† çŠ¶ç—…æ¯’ç—…(coronavirus disease 2019ï¼ŒCOVID-19)ç–«æƒ…æœŸé—´ç»¼åˆåŒ»é™¢å‘˜å·¥çš„å¿ƒç†çŽ°çŠ¶å¹¶åˆ†æžå…¶å½±å“å› ç´ ï¼Œä¸ºåŒ»é™¢å‘˜å·¥å¿ƒç†æœåŠ¡æä¾›å‚è€ƒä¾æ®ã€‚<b>æ–¹æ³•</b>: é€šè¿‡é—®å·æ˜Ÿå¹³å°ï¼Œåº”ç”¨æŠ‘éƒ-ç„¦è™‘-åŽ‹åŠ›é‡è¡¨(Depressionï¼ŒAnxiety and Stress Scaleï¼ŒDASS-21)ã€ç¤¾ä¼šæ”¯æŒè¯„å®šé‡è¡¨(Social Support Rating Scaleï¼ŒSSRS)ã€ç®€æ˜“åº”å¯¹æ–¹å¼é‡è¡¨(Simplified Coping Style Questionnaireï¼ŒSCSQ)å¯¹æŸä¸‰çº§ç»¼åˆåŒ»é™¢çš„å‘˜å·¥è¿›è¡Œè°ƒæŸ¥ï¼Œé‡‡ç”¨æè¿°æ€§åˆ†æžã€ç§©å’Œæ£€éªŒã€å•å› ç´ åˆ†æžã€ç›¸å…³æ€§åˆ†æžåŠå¤šå› ç´ äºŒå…ƒlogisticå›žå½’åˆ†æžæŽ¢è®¨ç›¸å…³å½±å“å› ç´ ã€‚<b>ç»“æžœ</b>: å›žæ”¶æœ‰æ•ˆé—®å·2 060ä»½ã€‚æŠ¤å£«å’Œä¿æ´å‘˜è´Ÿæ€§æƒ…ç»ªæœ€æ˜Žæ˜¾ï¼Œå…¶ä¸­æŠ¤å£«æŠ‘éƒå¾—åˆ†5.06Â±7.47ï¼Œç„¦è™‘å¾—åˆ†6.36Â±7.84ï¼ŒåŽ‹åŠ›å¾—åˆ†9.75Â±8.65ï¼›ä¿æ´å‘˜æŠ‘éƒå¾—åˆ†6.72Â±8.84ï¼Œç„¦è™‘å¾—åˆ†4.51Â±6.56ï¼ŒåŽ‹åŠ›å¾—åˆ†9.69Â±9.56ã€‚å¤šå› ç´ äºŒå…ƒlogisticå›žå½’åˆ†æžæ˜¾ç¤ºï¼šå²—ä½ç±»åˆ«ã€æ–‡åŒ–ç¨‹åº¦ã€èŒåŠ¡ã€ç–«æƒ…å¯¹ç»æµŽçš„å½±å“ã€é˜²æŠ¤ç‰©è´¨ä¾›ç»™ä¸è¶³çš„æ‹…å¿ƒç¨‹åº¦æ˜¯æŠ‘éƒçš„å½±å“å› ç´ ï¼›å²—ä½ç±»åˆ«ã€ä¸Žæ„ŸæŸ“è€…æŽ¥è§¦æƒ…å†µã€ç–«æƒ…å¯¹ç»æµŽçš„å½±å“ã€é˜²æŠ¤ç‰©è´¨ä¾›ç»™ä¸è¶³çš„æ‹…å¿ƒç¨‹åº¦ã€ç–¾ç—…å²æ˜¯ç„¦è™‘çš„å½±å“å› ç´ ï¼›ä¸Žæ„ŸæŸ“è€…æŽ¥è§¦æƒ…å†µã€ç–«æƒ…å¯¹ç»æµŽå½±å“ï¼Œå¯¹é˜²æŠ¤ç‰©è´¨ä¾›ç»™ä¸è¶³çš„æ‹…å¿ƒç¨‹åº¦æ˜¯åŽ‹åŠ›çš„å½±å“å› ç´ ã€‚<b>ç»“è®º</b>: ç–«æƒ…æœŸé—´ç»¼åˆåŒ»é™¢ä¸åŒäººç¾¤çš„å¿ƒç†ç‰¹å¾æœ‰å·®å¼‚ï¼Œéœ€æ ¹æ®ä¸åŒäººç¾¤åŠå…¶å·¥ä½œçŠ¶æ€åˆ¶è®¢ç›¸åº”çš„å¿ƒç†é˜²æŠ¤åŠå¹²é¢„æŽªæ–½ã€‚.","Jiang, Liu, Zhao, Xie, Wang, Ouyang, Guo, Gong, Zhou, Li",https://doi.org/10.11817/j.issn.1672-7347.2020.200190,20200909.0,"anxiety; coronavirus disease 2019; depression; different groups of staff; influential factors; stress; Adaptation, Psychological; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; China; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Disease Outbreaks; Hospitals, General; Humans; Pandemics; Personnel, Hospital; Pneumonia, Viral; SARS-CoV-2; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
174,Does coronavirus pose a challenge to the diagnoses of anxiety and depression? A view from psychiatry,"Some authors have suggested that the emergence of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, and the subsequent pandemic has meant that the constructs of pathological anxiety and depression are meaningless owing to widespread anxiety and depressive symptoms. This paper examines what is required to make a diagnosis of a depressive or anxiety disorder and how this may differ from fleeting symptomatology in response to specific situations or stimuli. All people experience the emotions of both anxiety and depression, but far fewer have a persistent anxiety or depressive syndrome which interferes with their quality of life and functioning. The pandemic and its issues are then discussed, and existing studies examining the reactions of people living through the pandemic are presented. Finally, the paper examines possible ways to cope at times of increased stress and how we can try to protect ourselves from long-term mental health sequelae of chronic stress.",Drummond,https://doi.org/10.1192/bjb.2020.102,20201009.0,Anxiety; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; coronavirus; depression,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

As a result of the rapid increase in confirmed cases and deaths, population and health personnel, have experienced psychological problems, such as anxiety, depression, and stress. Although scientific information on COVID-19 is constantly increasing, it mainly focuses on genetic, epidemiological aspects, and public health measures, leaving aside possible effects on mental health. In order to summarize the current evidence, we present a narrative review of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. So far, the presence of anxiety, depression, and stress has been reported mostly in general population. Nonetheless, mental health issues have also been reported in health care workers, especially among female professionals, nurses, and those who work directly with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19. In efforts to reduce the spread of the disease, attention should be paid to the diagnosis and treatment of mental health issues.

177,Rapid response to crisis: Health system lessons from the active period of COVID-19,"This paper outlines the need for a health systems approach and rapid response strategy for gathering information necessary for policy decisions during pandemics and similar crises. It suggests a new framework for assessing the phases of the pandemic. The paper draws its information and conclusions from a rapid synthesis and translation process (RSTP) of a series of webinars and online discussions from the Pandemic-Mental Health International Network (Pan-MHIN) - policy experts from across 16 locations in Australia, Denmark, Italy, Spain, Taiwan, the UK and the USA. While the initial focus of this research was on mental health, COVID-19 has raised much broader issues and questions for health planners. We identified gaps affecting the capacity to respond effectively and quickly, including in relation to system indicators, the inadequacy of the prior classification of the phases of the pandemic, the absences of a healthcare ecosystem approach, and the quick shift to digital technologies. The strengths and weaknesses of COVID-19 responses across different systems, services, sites and countries been identified and compared, including both low and high impacted areas. There is an urgent need for managerial epidemiology based on healthcare ecosystem research encompassing multidisciplinary teams, visualization tools and decision analytics for rapid response. Policy and healthcare context played a key role in the response to COVID-19. Its severity, the containment measures and the societal response varied greatly across sites and countries. Understanding this variation is vital to assess the impact of COVID-19 in specific areas such as ageing or mental health.","Salvador-Carulla, Rosenberg, Mendoza, Tabatabaei-Jafari",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hlpt.2020.08.011,20201118.0,COVID-19; Health planning; Health systems research; Information systems,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
178,COVID-19 Racism and Mental Health in Chinese American Families,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has fueled xenophobia against Chinese Americans. We examined the rates of 6 types of COVID-19 racism and racial discrimination experienced by Chinese American parents and youth and the associations with their mental health. We recruited a population-based sample of Chinese American families to participate in this self-reported survey study conducted from March 14, 2020, to May 31, 2020. Eligible parent participants identified as ethnically/racially Chinese, lived in the United States, and had a 4- to 18-year-old child; their eligible children were 10 to 18 years old. The sample included 543 Chinese American parents (mean [SD] age, 43.44 [6.47] years; 425 mothers [78.3%]), and their children (<i>N</i> = 230; mean [SD] age, 13.83 [2.53] years; 111 girls [48.3%]). Nearly half of parents and youth reported being directly targeted by COVID-19 racial discrimination online (parents: 172 [31.7%]; youth: 105 [45.7%]) and/or in person (parents: 276 [50.9%]; youth: 115 [50.2%]). A total of 417 (76.8%) parents and 176 (76.5%) youth reported at least 1 incident of COVID-19 vicarious racial discrimination online and/or in person (parents: 481 [88.5%]; youth: 211 [91.9%]). A total of 267 (49.1%) parents and 164 (71.1%) youth perceived health-related Sinophobia in America, and 274 (50.4%) parents and 129 (56.0%) youth perceived media-perpetuated Sinophobia. Higher levels of parent- and youth-perceived racism and racial discrimination were associated with their poorer mental health.

The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Peritraumatic Dissociative Experience Questionnaire were used. Factors independently associated with reported symptoms of mental health disorders were identified.<b>Measurements and Main Results:</b> The response rate was 67%, with 1,058 respondents (median age 33 yr; 71% women; 68% nursing staff). The prevalence of symptoms of anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic dissociation was 50.4%, 30.4%, and 32%, respectively, with the highest rates in nurses. By multivariable analysis, male sex was independently associated with lower prevalence of symptoms of anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic dissociation (odds ratio of 0.58 [95% confidence interval, 0.42-0.79], 0.57 [95% confidence interval, 0.39-0.82], and 0.49 [95% confidence interval, 0.34-0.72], respectively). HCPs working in non-university-affiliated hospitals and nursing assistants were at high risk of symptoms of anxiety and peritraumatic dissociation. Importantly, we identified the following six modifiable determinants of symptoms of mental health disorders: fear of being infected, inability to rest, inability to care for family, struggling with difficult emotions, regret about the restrictions in visitation policies, and witnessing hasty end-of-life decisions.<b>Conclusions:</b> HCPs experience high levels of psychological burden during the COVID-19 pandemic.

A total of 857 LGB people in Hong Kong participated in a community-based survey study. Over one-fourth of them met the criteria for probable clinical depression (31.5%) and generalized anxiety disorder (27.9%). Besides general stressors, we identified sexual minority-specific stressors during the pandemic. 4.2% of the participants indicated that they had frequently experienced family conflict related to sexual orientation. One-third responded that they had largely reduced connection to the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender plus (LGBT+) community (34.7%). The results showed that sexual minority-specific COVID-19-related stressors explained significant variance in depressive and anxiety symptoms, above and beyond the contribution of general COVID-19-related stressors. Since LGB people are particularly vulnerable to poor mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, LGB people-targeting organizations need to understand more about family, space, and privacy concerns in order to provide better support, and LGB safe spaces and shelters may be needed as a policy response.","Suen, Chan, Wong",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113365,20201013.0,"COVID-19; Hong Kong; anxiety; depression; sexual minorities; Adult; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; Bisexuality; COVID-19; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Homosexuality, Female; Homosexuality, Male; Hong Kong; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Psychological Distress; SARS-CoV-2; Sexual Behavior; Sexual and Gender Minorities; Social Stigma; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

We conducted this study to evaluate sleep disorders and psychological impact associated with the spread of the COVID-19 and the lockdown on the Moroccan population. We also aimed to study the effects of respondents' beliefs and attitudes about sleep on sleep disorders, anxiety-related symptoms, and depressive symptoms. We used a questionnaire enclosing respondents' sociodemographic information, five psychological and behavioral tests including Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep (DBAS-16), Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) test. Our results highlighted widespread false beliefs about sleep and the prevalence of sleep disorders, anxiety, and depression-related symptoms within the Moroccan population. Nearly 82.3% of respondents revealed false beliefs about sleep. Furthermore, we confirmed a strong positive correlation between knowledge and attitudes about sleep and the prevalence of sleep disorders, anxiety, and depression-related symptoms. However, we found no significant difference in the prevalence of sleep and psychological disorders, between healthcare workers and other professions workers. Our study revealed a high prevalence of sleep disorders, anxiety, and depressive symptoms in the Moroccan population during the COVID-19 lockdown period. Moreover, false beliefs on sleep understanding were prevalent and were presenting a risk factor leading to sleep disorders, anxiety, and depressive symptoms.","Janati Idrissi, Lamkaddem, Benouajjit, Ben El Bouaazzaoui, El Houari, Alami, Labyad, Chahidi, Benjelloun, Rabhi, Kissani, Zarhbouch, Ouazzani, Kadiri, Alouane, Elbiaze, Boujraf, El Fakir, Souirti",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2020.07.045,20201016.0,"Anxiety; COVID-19; Depressive symptoms; Insomnia; Mental health; Morocco; Sleep knowledge; Sleep quality; Adult; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Morocco; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; SARS-CoV-2; Sleep Wake Disorders; Social Isolation; Surveys and Questionnaires",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

This is particularly disconcerting regarding children and adolescents, who rely on the ability to play to meet developmental milestones and who require more exercise than adults. Youth populations have been significantly disrupted by school closures and home confinement and are in developmental periods that overlap with the emergence of serious mental illness. Therefore, it is important to consider the mental health consequences for youths, and also explore ways to combat sedentary activity for this vulnerable population.","Mittal, Firth, Kimhy",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaac.2020.08.003,20201119.0,"Adolescent; COVID-19; Child; Coronavirus Infections; Exercise; Humans; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Sedentary Behavior",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

185,Is the psychological impact of exposure to COVID-19 stronger in adolescents with pre-pandemic maltreatment experiences? A survey of rural Chinese adolescents,"Since the COVID-19 outbreak at the end of 2019, it has evolved into a global pandemic with tremendous mental health impact besides the threats to people's physical health. The aims were to examine whether exposure to COVID-19 predicts elevated levels of anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms and whether pre-pandemic maltreatment experiences exacerbate this impact on mental health in adolescents. The survey was conducted online from February 8 st to February 27th, 2020, and the questionnaires were distributed and retrieved through a web-based platform. This study includes a total of 6196 subjects, aged range from 11 to 18 years old. Several multivariable linear regressions were used to analyse the data. The largest variance in PTSS and anxiety problems was explained by ACEs, with more pre-pandemic maltreatment experiences predicting more PTSS (effect size beta = 0.16âˆ¼0.27), and more anxiety (effect size beta = 0.32âˆ¼0.47). Experienced or subjective fear of exposure to COVID-19 predicted statistically significant variance in PTSS and anxiety, and standardized betas ranged from 0.04 to 0.09. Participants who had adverse childhood experiences and had experienced exposure to COVID-19 showed elevated PTSS. After pre-pandemic maltreatment experiences the impact of exposure to COVID-19 on mental health may be stronger. Scars from the past seem to be vulnerabilities during societal upheaval. We therefore suggest that when exposed to COVID-19 rural adolescents should get prioritized professional family support and mental health counseling in particular when they have experienced family abuse and neglect in childhood, even though such support is more difficult to organize in rural areas.","Guo, Fu, Liu, Zhang, Wang, van IJzendoorn",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2020.104667,20201223.0,ACEs; Adolescents; Anxiety; Covid-19; Maltreatment; PTSS,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
186,The Role of Anxiety and Cortisol in Outcomes of Patients With Covid-19,"The outbreak due to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is n global public health emergency and challenges psychological resilience. The central nervous system, endocrine system, and immune system are complex interacting systems. Cortisol has been implicated as the cause of a wide range of mental and physical health disorders; however, the impact of cortisol on outcomes in patients with COVID-19 is not clear. The current study enrolled patients with COVID-19 (onset of disease within 7 days of the first symptom) to evaluate the serum concentration of cortisol and levels of anxiety and depression using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to investigate a possible relationship between cortisol, depression, and anxiety levels and outcomes of patients with COVID-19. A total of 30 patients with COVID-19 were studied. The levels of cortisol and HADS score in patients who died of Covid-19 were significantly higher in comparison with surviving patients (P&lt;0.017 and P&lt;0.001 respectively). We also found that the HADS score was positively correlated with serum cortisol levels (r= 0.842, P=0.004). Our findings showed that stress and anxiety are associated with patients' outcomes.

187,"Stress, Anxiety, and Depression Levels Among Healthcare Staff During the COVID-19 Epidemic","In the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, medical staff Are in direct contact with the patients and experience high work pressure. Direct contact with the patients could create some psychological problems in this group. Thus, the prevalence of such problems must be investigated in them. The present study aimed to determine the level of stress, anxiety, and depression among the healthcare staff in Zanjan City, Iran, during the COVID-19 epidemic. This descriptive study has a cross-sectional design. The Sample of the study population consisted of 535 Staff healthcare members of Vali-e-Asr Hospital in Zanjan City, Iran. A sample of 200 of medical staff was randomly selected to participate in the present study. The required data were collected using the electronic version of Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS) tool. Descriptive statistics, as well as the inferential statistics (the Pearson correlation coefficient, Spearman correlation coefficient, Phi, and Cramer's correlation tests), were used to analyze the obtained data in SPSS. The mean age of the study participants was 40.60 years. The mean values of depression, anxiety, and stress in study samples were 6.27, 5.38, and 8.41, respectively. There was a significant relation between gender and variables of depression, anxiety, and stress. There was also an inverse relationship between stress and variables of educational level and age (P&lt;0/05). We found that our sample reported a normal degree of Depression, anxiety, and stress. The extent of stress induced by direct contact with patients was higher in female employees. Furthermore, with the increase in the education and age of the employees, their stress level decreased.","Hosseinzadeh-Shanjani, Hajimiri, Rostami, Ramazani, Dadashi",https://doi.org/10.32598/bcn.11.covid19.651.4,20200928.0,Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Medical staff; Stress,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
188,Hâ€³ITâ€³ting the Barriers for Exercising during Social Isolation,"Aerobic exercise is traditionally recommended to improve general health and prevent many non-communicable diseases. However, the measures adopted to control the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak culminated with closing of exercise facilities and fitness centers and, as a primary consequence, impaired aerobic exercise practice. This contributed to an increase in risk factors associated with physical inactivity such as insulin resistance, high blood pressure, low-grade inflammation, weight gain, and mental health problems. The scenario is worrisome, and it is important to propose alternatives for exercise practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interval training (IT) emerges as an exercise mode that might be feasible, low-cost, and potentially safe to be performed in many different places. IT consists of interspersing relative brief bouts of high-intensity exercise with recovery periods and promotes similar or greater health benefits when compared to moderate-intensity continuous exercise. Among the different types of IT, sprint interval training and &quot;Tabata protocols&quot; might be particularly useful during social isolation. These protocols can be controlled and performed without the need of complex equipment and can be adapted to different places, including domestic environments. In this article, we present variations of IT as possible alternatives to cope physical inactivity during COVID-19 pandemics with a focus on its practical applications. The protocols suggested can be performed without the need of specialized equipment or facilities, in a time-efficient manner, and aiming to prevent detraining or even improve physical fitness and general health.","Souza, Coswig, de Lira, Gentil",https://doi.org/10.3390/biology9090245,20201027.0,COVID-19; aerobic exercise; calisthenics; high-intensity interval training; immunity; intermittent exercise,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

A quantitative/qualitative cross-sectional survey was used among adults currently enrolled in health-related research (Nâ€‰=â€‰250; 85% women;â€‰&gt;â€‰50% currently enrolled in behavioral weight loss intervention). COVID-19 was perceived as a severe threat by most (62.3%). Related to COVID-19, 29.6% of participants reported moderate/severe symptoms of anxiety/depression, and 68.4% reported moderate/severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology, with women more likely to demonstrate moderate/severe anxiety/depression (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.047) and PTSD symptomatology (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.028) relative to men. Those with moderate/severe levels of anxiety/depression (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0154) and distress (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0330) were more likely to report a decreased desire to participate in research. Among those in behavioral interventions, individuals perceiving COVID-19 as a moderate/severe threat or experiencing moderate/severe depression or PTSD symptomatology were 4 to 19 times more likely to report that COVID-19 affected their ability to adhere to behavioral recommendations. Qualitative analysis identified four themes describing COVID-19's impact on research experiences: transition, remote intervention delivery, ability to adhere to program goals, and research participation interest. These data suggest that participants engaged in health-related research perceive COVID-19 as a significant threat, affecting mental health, desire to participate in research, and ability to adhere to intervention recommendations.","Cardel, Manasse, Krukowski, Ross, Shakour, Miller, Lemas, Hong",https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.23016,20201204.0,"Adult; Anxiety; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Research Subjects; SARS-CoV-2; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

191,[Adaptations of an outpatient Dialectical Behavioral Therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic and consequences of the confinement on patients with borderline personality disorder],"<i>Background:</i> The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the accessibility of psychotherapy for particularly vulnerable patients during the period of confinement in the French-speaking part of Switzerland. We had to adapt our usual therapeutic programs. We illustrate this approach in an outpatient program of dialectical behavioral therapy for patients with borderline personality disorder. Each week the individual therapies took place by videoconference or phone. The skills training group was held individually by videoconference or phone and was supported by an online skills training program. Patients filled out their diary cards online. Intersession contact with the therapist remained available as usual and we could organize team consultation. The aim of this study is to describe how a sample of our patients experienced the period of confinement.<i>Method:</i> We compared the experiences of seven patients suffering from borderline personality disorder during two periods: eight weeks prior to confinement, and during the eight weeks of confinement. We analyzed their daily diary cards (n = 426) and their weekly frequency of problem behaviors (n = 69). We performed multilevel analyses to take into account the hierarchical structure of the data and the autocorrelation of observations.<i>Results:</i> The seven patients were predominantly female (85.7â€‰%) and had an average age of 35.1 (11.5) years. Measurements prior to the start of the pandemic indicated on average severe depression (Beck Depression Inventory, m = 30.9 (10.0)) and marked hopelessness (Beck Hopelessness Scale, m = 15.0 (5.0)). Analysis of the daily diary cards indicated that the confinement period significantly predicted a decrease in feelings of shame or guilt, fear and tension. At the same time, however, there was an increase in distress. Weekly monitoring of problem behaviors showed a decrease in binge-eating behaviors and a trend towards a decrease in alcohol consumption during confinement.<i>Conclusions:</i> Despite the small number of patients included, two types of repeated measurements indicated convergent results, with some improvements during confinement: a decrease of the feelings of fear, shame or guilt, and tension, and a decrease of the frequency of binge-eating behaviors. The decreased pace of daily social and professional life may explain these improvements. The diminution of the above-mentioned feelings as triggers for addictive and compulsive behaviors may also account for the improvements regarding binge-eating. However, they also experienced an increased distress that may reflect the loneliness experienced during this period. The pre-pandemic development of computerized tools that were already familiar to patients greatly facilitated the necessary adaptations to maintain an intensive therapeutic setting during the confinement. This may partly explain why these patients were able to adjust the challenges of this period.","Salamin, Rossier, Joye, Nolde, Pierrehumbert, Gothuey, Guenot",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2020.08.006,20200826.0,Borderline personality disorder; Confinement; Coronavirus; Dialectical behavior therapies; Pandemic; Psychiatry,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

Her responses are informed by recent cross-disciplinary and neuropsychological research on the digital age. She considers what happens to free association, evenly suspended attention and reverie when working by phone or online; the loss of the consulting room as a containing physical space for both clinician and patient; the relationship between place and time; and whether (and how) we can maintain a focus on transference and countertransference in the presence of the threat of death.

Generated by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV2, it is quickly named COVID-19 for COronaVirus Infectious Disease 2019. The spread of this unknown disease will soon have worldwide consequences: the contagiousness of the virus is extremely high and potentially lethal. In France, the population initially reacted with disbelief until the disease reached Europe and the first cases appeared on French territory, at the end of January. A few weeks later, on 16 March 2020, President Macron declared the country &quot;at war&quot; against COVID-19. The next day the population was placed in lockdown. At the present time, the country's activity is at a standstill. Schools, businesses and shops are closed. The French citizens are astounded. They suddenly have to face fear: fear of falling ill or that a close relative may fall ill, fear of being locked up and experiencing restrictions of liberties, fear of economic precariousness. And, above all, fear of uncertainty. In order to prevent the mental consequences of this crisis, psychological support units have been created with urgency at national scale. These units are intended to support the healthcare professionals as well as the patients and more broadly, the general population. The unit responsible for the department of Gironde has been set up quickly, over the weekend of March 21, 2020. The COVIDPSY33 listening unit has thus been created in Bordeaux by the Charles Perrens Hospital with support from the Agence RÃ©gionale de SantÃ© Nouvelle-Aquitaine (ARS).

Declaring a state of health emergency in order to curb a frightening epidemic, the authorities have decreed the home confinement of the majority of the population of our country for several weeks. In a few days, innumerable questions arise for very diverse spaces: epidemiological, immunological, sociological, information scientists, medical, administrative, political, etc. We propose a reflection intended to describe the psychological risks, to clarify the disorders found, and to discuss the means to take care of them in the duration. We base our thinking on a review of the literature confronted with our current clinical experience, including concerning the possibilities of dematerialised medico-psychological monitoring. We recall the collective repercussions of emerging lethal mass risks, and in particular viral infectious agents, before approaching the existing scientific models of collective confinement according to military operations in war zones, polar wintering missions and aerospace conquest. It appears that for the study of a global containment, somewhat studied during previous pandemics, the conceptions of stress reaction and psychodynamic adaptation prove to be relevant. We detail the psychological consequences of confinement on individual mental health and their countermeasures according to three population typologies: general population, population of caregivers on the front line against the epidemic, and population of subjects already suffering from mental illness or seeing their disorders reappear. We also refer to works in social cognitive psychology explaining how, in an anxiety-provoking situation, reasoning can be biased and lead to choices that ultimately prove to be not very rational, in the opinion of those who made them. The current situation in the health sector is favourable in this, as evidenced by the &quot;debate on chloroquine&quot; widely reported in the media and on social networks, opposing conclusions most often decided on the basis of beliefs on contrary to evidence based medicine. The psychological repercussions of confinement appear conditioned by the multiple forms that it can take: voluntary or suffered, more or less prolonged, spent at home or in another place, lived in individual isolation or in a small community, associated other stressors and/or traumatic factors, etc. The home confinement of a population across a country has never been assessed. This experience seems to us to confront our society as a whole with the taboo of death, which is imposed, death more and more evaded as the &quot;Western man&quot; tries to move away from his terrestrial origins. In this sense, psychotraumatic type repercussions are to be prevented. In order to face multiple challenges, the healthcare system has adapted with, in particular, the development of the use of the Internet for the provision of information intended to better experience confinement, or even the generalisation of e-psychotherapy asking as many questions as it provides answers. These intricacies of computer techniques in the area of psychotherapy, techniques with which we had some questioning, became established as quickly as the virus: the task of clinicians and researchers to measure the issues and the consequences. Public health programs could emerge on the model of those already existing in order to manage well-known chronic endemic disorders: protection against the effects of an unbalanced diet associated with a sedentary lifestyle, fight against smoking and alcoholism, prevention of self-aggressive behaviour, etc. We will also need to support the caregivers who have been on the front line and who will emerge tested from this pandemic: depending on the sustainability of the action capacities of our healthcare system to return to its nominal state and also perhaps, so that it can face consequences resulting from other crises, especially social ones.","AuxÃ©mÃ©ry, Tarquinio",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2020.06.001,20200918.0,Confinement; Coronavirus; Epidemiology; Online psychotherapy; Psychopathology; Reaction to stress; Sociopathology,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
198,"[Jail incarceration, social sanitary confinement and ways of escape]","Jail incarceration and social confinement due to a sanitary stay-at-home law against the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic are compared to the introduction of dance workshops for imprisoned women charged with long sentences, then followed by an outside performance <i>Soul Kitchen</i>. The whole experience, organized by a famous contemporary choreographer Angelin Preljocaj, is filmed by ValÃ©rie MÃ¼ller, producing <i>Danser sa peine (To dance her sentence/her sorrow),</i> nominated for an award. The sessions are planned: two hours and a half, 2 times a week, for four months, no technique required.

199,Impact of &quot;e-Learning crack-up&quot; perception on psychological distress among college students during COVID-19 pandemic: A mediating role of &quot;fear of academic year loss&quot;,"While literature reveals the positive perception of e-Learning, this study examined and assessed the impact of e-Learning crack-up perceptions on psychological distress among college students during COVID-19 pandemic. Kessler psychological distress scale (<i>K</i>10) was used to evaluate stress symptoms. This study first conducted an online focus group discussion (OFGD) with the target population to develop the scale of &quot;e-Learning crack-up&quot; and &quot;fear of academic year loss&quot;. Afterward, a questionnaire was developed based on OFGD findings. An online survey was conducted amongst college students in Bangladesh using a purposive sampling technique. Results show that &quot;e-Learning crack-up&quot; perception has a significant positive impact on student's psychological distress, and fear of academic year loss is the crucial factor that is responsible for psychological distress during COVID-19 lockdown. This study can provide an understanding of how &quot;e-Learning crack-up&quot; and &quot;Fear of academic year loss&quot; influence college students' mental health. Theoretically, this study extends and validated the scope of Kessler's psychological distress scale with two new contexts. Practically, this study will help the government and policymakers identify the student's mental well-being and take more appropriate action to address these issues.","Hasan, Bao",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105355,20201226.0,COVID-19; Fear of academic year loss; Psychological distress; e-Learning crack-up,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

A total of 1172 (683 female and 489 male) children and adolescents aged 8-18Â years were involved in completing the measurements of PTSD, GAD, perceived threat of COVID-19, and COVID-19-related courtesy stigma. The Latent Profile Analysis identified the three profiles of the symptoms for PTSD and GAD which were labeled as Moderate PTSD, Mild Comorbidity, and Severe Comorbidity. The scores of the symptoms for PTSD, GAD, perceived threat, and stigma were different among the three profiles. The risk factors (i.e., perceived threat and stigma) that are related to comorbidity patterns were examined through a three-step method. The possibility of entry into the Severe Comorbidity Profile increased with increasing perceived threat and stigma. The mental health care interventions for children and adolescents who are susceptible to COVID-19 can be developed to reduce perceived threat and stigma.","Li, Duan, Chen",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105235,20200909.0,COVID-19; GAD; Latent profile; PTSD; Perceived threat; Stigma,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
201,&quot;The COVID-19 Pandemic and its Effect on Mental Health in USA - A Review with Some Coping Strategies&quot;,"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in enormous losses in terms of human lives and economy in United States. The outbreak has been continuing to heavily impact the mental health of people. Developing key strategies to prevent mental illnesses is extremely important for the well-being of people. A survey conducted during the last week of March 2020 showed that 72% of Americans felt that their lives were impacted by the outbreak, which was a 32% increase from the survey conducted only 2Â weeks earlier. The results show a positive correlation between COVID-19 infections/casualties and growing public concern. These observations suggest possible increase in mental health illnesses in United States as a consequence of the pandemic. The authors review a recently published model on COVID-19 related fear among the people. The fear of being infected or dying from the disease is one of the most significant causes of mental health disorders. Loss of employment or the fear of losing employment is another major concern leading to mental illnesses. Several unique strategies to prevent or mitigate mental illnesses are discussed.","Bhattacharjee, Acharya",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11126-020-09836-0,20201105.0,"Anxiety disorder; COVID-19; Mental health; Pandemic; Prevention strategies; Adaptation, Psychological; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; Coronavirus Infections; Employment; Fear; Humans; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; SARS-CoV-2; United States",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
202,Mental health amongst obstetrics and gynaecology doctors during the COVID-19 pandemic: Results of a UK-wide study,"To explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. A cross-section survey-based study amongst doctors working within Obstetrics and Gynaecology in the United Kingdom. A total of 207 doctors completed the survey. Obstetricians and Gynaecologists reported significantly higher rates of both Major Depressive Disorder (versus, p = 0.023) and Generalised Anxiety Disorder (versus, p = 0.044) as compared to the UK-wide estimates. Sub-group analysis showed that anxiety was more common amongst female doctors as compared to males (versus, p = 0.047). Although the prevalence of GAD was higher amongst registrars compared to their Consultant and/or Senior House Officer counterparts, this was not statistically significant. Respondents felt that the most significant factor for work-related changes to mental health was keeping up to date with frequently changing guidelines and protocols related to COVID-19. Only of respondents felt able to talk to colleagues about their mental health. Key findings include the high prevalence of mental health conditions amongst doctors, demonstration of the persistent taboo that mental health carries within the speciality and the key contributory factors to poor mental health. Further work should be done to assess if changes to the way new and updating guidelines, protocols and pathways are disseminated reduces the impact on the mental health of doctors. With the threat of a second COVID-19 peak looming, now more than ever, it is vital that steps are taken to break the stigmatisation of mental health amongst doctors, encouraging doctors to seek help when required.","Shah, Raheem, Sideris, Velauthar, Saeed",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejogrb.2020.07.060,20200929.0,"Education and training; Gynaecology; Mental health; Obstetrics; Adult; Anxiety Disorders; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depressive Disorder, Major; Female; Gynecology; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Middle Aged; Obstetrics; Occupational Diseases; Pandemics; Physicians; Pneumonia, Viral; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires; United Kingdom",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
203,"Public Behavior Change, Perceptions, Depression, and Anxiety in Relation to the COVID-19 Outbreak","COVID-19 has spread rapidly and internationally, which has elicited public panic and psychological problems. Public protective behaviors and perception play crucial roles in controlling the spread of illness and psychological status. We conducted a cross-sectional online survey in the hardest-hit Hubei province and other areas in China affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. Questions about their basic information, the perception of the COVID-19 outbreak, recent preventive or avoidance behaviors, and self-reported mental health scales including the Patient Health Questionnaire and Self-Rating Anxiety Scale were included. Binary logistic regressions were used to investigate the association between personal variables/perceptions and psychological distress. A total of 6261 people were included in the analysis, with 3613 (57.7%) in Hubei province (1743 in Wuhan). The majority of people have adopted preventive and avoidance behaviors. People from Hubei, with contact history, and people who were infected or whose family members were infected had a much higher prevalence of depression and anxiety. Providing truthful and sufficient information, informing the public about the severity of the disease, and perceptions that the outbreak can be controlled by protective behaviors were associated with lower prevalence of depression and anxiety. Assessing the public response, perception, and psychological burden during the outbreak may help improve public health recommendations and deliver timely psychological intervention. Further research may focus on the psychological status of a specialized group to identify methods of delivery of better support based on public response and psychological demand.","Huang, Liu, Teng, Chen, Zhao, Wang, Wu, Xiao, Wang, Wu",https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa273,20200928.0,COVID-19; anxiety; depression; perceptions; public behavior change,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
204,The social underpinnings of mental distress in the time of COVID-19 - time for urgent action,"We argue that predictions of a 'tsunami' of mental health problems as a consequence of the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the lockdown are overstated; feelings of anxiety and sadness are entirely normal reactions to difficult circumstances, not symptoms of poor mental health.Â Some people will need specialised mental health support, especially those already leading tough lives; we need immediate reversal of years of underfunding of community mental health services.Â However, the disproportionate effects of COVID-19 on the most disadvantaged, especially BAME people placed at risk by their social and economic conditions, were entirely predictable. Mental health is best ensured by urgently rebuilding the social and economic supports stripped away over the last decade. Governments must pump funds into local authorities to rebuild community services, peer support, mutual aid and local community and voluntary sector organisations.Â Health care organisations must tackle racism and discrimination to ensure genuine equal access to universal health care.Â Government must replace highly conditional benefit systems by something like a universal basic income. All economic and social policies must be subjected to a legally binding mental health audit.Â This may sound unfeasibly expensive, but the social and economic costs, not to mention the costs in personal and community suffering, though often invisible, are far greater.","Rose, Manning, Bentall, Bhui, Burgess, Carr, Cornish, Devakumar, Dowd, Ecks, Faulkner, Ruck Keene, Kirkbride, Knapp, Lovell, Martin, Moncrieff, Parr, Pickersgill, Richardson, Sheard",https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16123.1,20200928.0,BAME; Mental distress; benefit system reform; social disadvantage; universal basic income,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
205,Effect of Common Medications on the Expression of SARS-CoV-2 Entry Receptors in Kidney Tissue,"Besides the respiratory system, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was shown to affect other essential organs such as the kidneys. Early kidney involvement during the course of infection was associated with worse outcomes, which could be attributed to the direct SARS-CoV-2 infection of kidney cells. In this study, the effect of commonly used medications on the expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)2, and TMPRSS2 protein in kidney tissues was evaluated. This was done by in silico analyses of publicly available transcriptomic databases of kidney tissues of rats treated with multiple doses of commonly used medications. Of 59 tested medications, 56% modified ACE2 expression, whereas 24% modified TMPRSS2 expression. ACE2 was increased with only a few of the tested medication groups, namely the renin-angiotensin inhibitors, such as enalapril, antibacterial agents, such as nitrofurantoin, and the proton pump inhibitor, omeprazole. The majority of the other medications decreased ACE2 expression to variable degrees with allopurinol and cisplatin causing the most noticeable downregulation. The expression level of TMPRSS2 was increased with a number of medications, such as diclofenac, furosemide, and dexamethasone, whereas other medications, such as allopurinol, suppressed the expression of this gene. The prolonged exposure to combinations of these medications could regulate the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in a way that may affect kidney susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data presented here suggest that we should be vigilant about the potential effects of commonly used medications on kidney tissue expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2.","Saheb Sharif-Askari, Saheb Sharif-Askari, Alabed, Tayoun, Loney, Uddin, Senok, Al Heialy, Hamoudi, Kashour, Alsheikh-Ali, Hamid, Halwani",https://doi.org/10.1111/cts.12862,20201222.0,"Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2; Animals; COVID-19; Gene Expression Regulation; Kidney; Rats; Receptors, Coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2; Serine Endopeptidases",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

To better understand and to document these impacts, we contacted anaesthesia trainees and trainers across six continents and collated their experiences during the pandemic. All aspects of training programmes have been affected. Trainees report that reduced caseload, sub-specialty experience, and supervised procedures are impairing learning. Cancelled educational activities, postponed examinations, and altered rotations threaten progression through training. Job prospects and international opportunities are downgraded. Work-related anxieties about provision of personal protective equipment, and risks to self and to colleagues are superimposed on concerns for family and friends and domestic disruption. These seismic changes have had consequences for well-being and mental health. In response, anaesthetists have developed innovations in teaching and trainee support. New technologies support trainer-trainee interactions, with a focus on e-learning. National training bodies and medical regulators that specify training and oversee assessment of trainees and their progression have provided flexibility in their requirements. Within anaesthesia departments, support transcends grades and job titles with lessons for the future. Attention to wellness, awareness of mental health issues and multimodal support can attenuate but not eliminate trainee distress.","Sneyd, Mathoulin, O'Sullivan, So, Roberts, Paul, Cortinez, Ampofo, Miller, Balkisson",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bja.2020.07.011,20201001.0,"COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; anaesthesia; medical education; mental health; postgraduate medical education; training; well-being; Anesthesiology; Anesthetists; Attitude of Health Personnel; COVID-19; Coronavirus Infections; Curriculum; Diagnosis-Related Groups; Education, Medical, Graduate; Humans; Mental Health; Pandemics; Personal Protective Equipment; Pneumonia, Viral; Students, Medical; Teaching",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
207,Prevalence and associated factors of poor sleep quality among Chinese returning workers during the COVID-19 pandemic,"The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is a severe global crisis which has resulted in many public health problems. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of poor sleep quality and its related factors among employees who returned to work during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our online cross-sectional study included 2,410 participants aged â‰¥17 years in Deqing and Taizhou, Zhejiang Province, China from 5th to 14th March 2020. The questionnaire covered information on demographic characteristics, health status, workplace, lifestyle, attitude towards COVID-19, assessment of anxiety, depression and sleep quality. The Chinese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (CPSQI) was administered to measure the poor sleep quality. Poor sleep quality was defined as a global PSQI score&gt;5. Factors associated with sleep quality were analyzed by logistic regression models. In sum near half (49.2%) of 2,410 returning workers were females and the average year of subjects was 36.3Â Â±Â 9.1 years. The overall prevalence of poor sleep quality was 14.9% (95%CI: 13.5%-16.3%). The average score of PSQI was 3.0Â Â±Â 2.5 and average sleep duration was 7.6Â Â±Â 1.2Â h. Independent related factors of poor sleep quality included age older than 24 years, higher education level, negative attitude towards COVID-19 control measures, anxiety and depression. Poor sleep quality was common and there was a shorter sleep duration among returning workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Possible risk factors identified from this study may be of great importance in developing proper intervention for the targeted population to improve the sleep health during the COVID-19 public health emergency.","Yang, Zhu, Yang, Lin, Chen, Zhao, Fu",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2020.06.034,20200925.0,"COVID-19; China; Occupational population; Pittsburgh sleep quality index; Poor sleep quality; Adolescent; Adult; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; China; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prevalence; SARS-CoV-2; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders; Surveys and Questionnaires; Workplace; Young Adult",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
208,COVID-19 lockdown in people with severe mental disorders in Spain: Do they have a specific psychological reaction compared with other mental disorders and healthy controls?,"The COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown restrictions could have adverse consequences for patients with severe mental disorders (SMD). Here, we aim to compare the early psychological impact (depression, anxiety, and stress responses, intrusive and avoidant thoughts, and coping strategies) on people with SMD (nâ€¯=â€¯125) compared with two control groups: common mental disorders (CMD, nâ€¯=â€¯250) and healthy controls (HC, nâ€¯=â€¯250). An anonymous online questionnaire using a snowball sampling method was conducted from March 19-26, 2020 and included sociodemographic and clinical data along with the DASS-21 and IES scales. We performed descriptive and bivariate analyses and multinomial and linear regression models. People with SMD had higher anxiety, stress, and depression responses than HC, but lower scores than CMD in all domains. Most people with SMD (87.2%) were able to enjoy free time, although control groups had higher percentages. After controlling for confounding factors, anxiety was the only significant psychological domain with lower scores in HC than people with SMD (ORâ€¯=â€¯0.721; 95% CI: 0.579-0.898). In the SMD group, higher anxiety was associated with being single (betaâ€¯=â€¯0.144), having COVID-19 symptoms (betaâ€¯=â€¯0.146), and a higher score on the stress subscale of DASS-21 (betaâ€¯=â€¯0.538); whereas being able to enjoy free time was a protective factor (betaâ€¯=â€¯-0.244). Our results showed that patients with SMD reacted to the pandemic and the lockdown restrictions with higher anxiety levels than the general public, and suggesting this domain could be a criterion for early intervention strategies and closer follow-up.","GonzÃ¡lez-Blanco, Dal Santo, GarcÃ­a-Ãlvarez, de la Fuente-TomÃ¡s, Moya Lacasa, Paniagua, SÃ¡iz, GarcÃ­a-Portilla, Bobes",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.schres.2020.07.018,20201211.0,"Anxiety; Bipolar disorder; COVID-19; Pandemics; Psychological distress; Psychosis; Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Anxiety; Anxiety Disorders; Avoidance Learning; Bipolar Disorder; COVID-19; Case-Control Studies; Communicable Disease Control; Depression; Depressive Disorder; Employment; Family; Female; Humans; Income; Linear Models; Male; Marital Status; Mental Disorders; Middle Aged; Protective Factors; Psychological Distress; Psychotic Disorders; Risk Factors; Spain; Stress, Psychological",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
209,Surgical Education in the Time of COVID: Understanding the Early Response of Surgical Training Programs to the Novel Coronavirus Pandemic,"Describe the early impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on general surgery residency training nationwide. A 31-question electronic survey was distributed to general surgery program directors. Qualitative data underwent iterative coding analysis. Quantitative data were evaluated with summary statistics and bivariate analyses. Eighty-four residency programs (33.6% response rate) with representation across US geographic regions, program affiliations, and sizes. Widespread changes were observed in the surgical training environment. One hundred percent of programs reduced the number of residents on rounds and 95.2% reduced the size of their in-hospital resident workforce; on average, daytime staffing decreased by nearly half. With telehealth clinics (90.5%) and remote inpatient consults (26.2%), both clinical care and resident didactics (86.9%) were increasingly virtual, with similar impact across all program demographics. Conversely, availability of some wellness initiatives was significantly higher among university programs than independent programs, including childcare (51.2% vs 6.7%), housing (41.9% vs 13.3%), and virtual mental health services (83.7% vs 53.3%). Changes in clinical care delivery dramatically reduced in face-to-face learning opportunities for surgical trainees during the COVID-19 pandemic. While this effect had equal impact across all program types, sizes, and geographies, the same cannot be said for wellness initiatives. Though all programs initiated some strategies to protect resident health, the disparity between university programs and independent programs may be cause for action.","White, Shaughnessy, Esposito, Slade, Korah, Yoo",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsurg.2020.07.036,20201201.0,COVID-19; coronavirus; general surgery; graduate medical education; resident wellness; virtual education,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
210,COVID-19 and Parent-Child Psychological Well-being,"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 has changed American society in ways that are difficult to capture in a timely manner. With this study, we take advantage of daily survey data collected before and after the crisis started to investigate the hypothesis that the crisis has worsened parents' and children's psychological well-being. We also examine the extent of crisis-related hardships and evaluate the hypothesis that the accumulation of hardships will be associated with parent and child psychological well-being. Daily survey data were collected between February 20 and April 27, 2020, from hourly service workers with a young child (aged 2-7) in a large US city (<i>N</i> = 8222 person-days from 645 individuals). A subsample completed a one-time survey about the effects of the crisis fielded between March 23 and April 26 (subsample <i>n</i> = 561). Ordered probit models revealed that the frequency of parent-reported daily negative mood increased significantly since the start of the crisis. Many families have experienced hardships during the crisis, including job loss, income loss, caregiving burden, and illness. Both parents' and children's well-being in the postcrisis period was strongly associated with the number of crisis-related hardships that the family experienced. Consistent with our hypotheses, in families that have experienced multiple hardships related to the coronavirus disease 2019 crisis, both parents' and children's mental health is worse. As the crisis continues to unfold, pediatricians should screen for mental health, with particular attention to children whose families are especially vulnerable to economic and disease aspects of the crisis.","Gassman-Pines, Ananat, Fitz-Henley",https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2020-007294,20201013.0,"Affect; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; Child; Child Care; Child Health; Child, Preschool; Coronavirus Infections; Cost of Illness; Health Surveys; Humans; Income; Mental Health; Pandemics; Parent-Child Relations; Parents; Pneumonia, Viral; SARS-CoV-2; Unemployment; Vulnerable Populations",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
211,Work-Related and Personal Factors Associated With Mental Well-Being During the COVID-19 Response: Survey of Health Care and Other Workers,"The response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has created an unprecedented disruption in work conditions. This study describes the mental health and well-being of workers both with and without clinical exposure to patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The aim of this study is to measure the prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression, work exhaustion, burnout, and decreased well-being among faculty and staff at a university and academic medical center during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and describe work-related and personal factors associated with their mental health and well-being. All faculty, staff, and postdoctoral fellows of a university, including its medical school, were invited in April 2020 to complete an online questionnaire measuring stress, anxiety, depression, work exhaustion, burnout, and decreased well-being. We examined associations between these outcomes and factors including work in high-risk clinical settings and family/home stressors. There were 5550 respondents (overall response rate of 34.3%). Overall, 34% of faculty and 14% of staff (n=915) were providing clinical care, while 61% of faculty and 77% of staff were working from home. Among all workers, anxiety (prevalence ratio 1.37, 95% CI 1.09-1.73), depression (prevalence ratio 1.28, 95% CI 1.03-1.59), and high work exhaustion (prevalence ratio 1.24, 95% CI 1.13-1.36) were independently associated with community or clinical exposure to COVID-19. Poor family-supportive behaviors by supervisors were also associated with these outcomes (prevalence ratio 1.40, 95% CI 1.21-1.62; prevalence ratio 1.69, 95% CI 1.48-1.92; and prevalence ratio 1.54, 95% CI 1.44-1.64, respectively). Age &lt;40 years and a greater number of family/home stressors were also associated with these poorer outcomes. Among the subset of clinicians, caring for patients with COVID-19 and working in high-risk clinical settings were additional risk factors. Our findings suggest that the pandemic has had negative effects on the mental health and well-being of both clinical and nonclinical employees. Mitigating exposure to COVID-19 and increasing supervisor support are modifiable risk factors that may protect mental health and well-being for all workers.","Evanoff, Strickland, Dale, Hayibor, Page, Duncan, Kannampallil, Gray",https://doi.org/10.2196/21366,20200904.0,"COVID-19; coronavirus; health care workers; mental health; occupational health; pandemic; remote work; worker well-being; Adult; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Occupational Diseases; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prevalence; Risk Factors; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

SARS-CoV-2 cases and deaths in children are minimal compared to adults, but the pandemic impacts other 'essential' aspects of children's health including child development and the associated areas of paediatric behaviour, mental health, and maltreatment. Alongside the management of severe SARS-CoV-2 cases in emergency rooms and intensive care units, continuing to care for children with developmental disabilities must also be concurrently championed as 'essential' during this crisis. The potentially devastating lifelong effects of the pandemic and isolation on an already vulnerable population demand that action be taken now. Video conferences and phone calls are 'essential' instruments we can use to continue to provide quality care for our patients.","Fung, Ricci",https://doi.org/10.1093/pch/pxaa077,20200928.0, Child behaviour; COVID-19; Child development; Coronavirus; Pandemics,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
214,Psychological Distress and Its Correlates Among COVID-19 Survivors During Early Convalescence Across Age Groups,"To examine the psychological distress and the associated predictor factors of the 2019 corona-virus disease (COVID-19) on survivors in the early convalescence in Shenzhen. A survey questionnaire consisting of post-traumatic stress disorder self-rating scale (PTSD-SS), self-rating depression scale (SDS), and self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) was presented to COVID-19 survivors still in quarantine. Scores of each scale and subscale were dependent variables in the Mann-Whitney test and stepwise regression analysis. A total of 126 subjects were included in the study, the mean scores of PTSD-SS, SDS, and SAS were 45.5 Â± 18.9, 47.3 Â± 13.1, and 43.2 Â± 10.2, respectively, meanwhile, 9 (31.0%), 28 (22.2%), and 48 (38.1%) of the survivors met the cut-score for clinical significant symptoms of stress response, anxiety, and depression, respectively. Infected family members, and postinfection physical discomforts were significantly associated with scores on all three scales. Social support, retirement, and being female had significant associations with the PTSD-SS score. The survivors aged 60 or above experienced less severe stress response symptoms, fewer emotional symptoms of depression, and fewer anxiety symptoms than younger survivors. The occurrence rate of psychological distress among the COVID-19 survivors in early convalescence was high, highlighting the need for all COVID-19 survivors to be screened for psychological distress regularly for timely intervention. The predictors indicated by the current study may help to identify those at high-risk. Besides, the results indicated the older survivors suffered less emotional reactivity and fewer stress response symptoms from infectious diseases than the younger ones.","Cai, Hu, Ekumi, Wang, An, Li, Yuan",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.07.003,20200924.0,"COVID-19; anxiety; depression; older age; psychological distress; stress response; survivors; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; China; Convalescence; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Employment; Family; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Protective Factors; Psychological Distress; Retirement; Risk Factors; SARS-CoV-2; Severity of Illness Index; Sex Factors; Social Support; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Stress, Psychological; Survivors",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

216,Emotional &quot;inflection point&quot; in public health emergencies with the 2019 new coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) in China,"The outbreak of the new coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) in Wuhan, Hubei, has caused very serious consequences and severely affected people's lives and mental health. The outbreak will cause bad emotions such as tension, anxiety, fear, and so on. College students who have returned home from school face infection, isolation, and delay in starting school, and thus, their emotional stress should be observed. This study used self-designed questionnaires and artificial intelligence (AI) to assess and analyze the emotional state of over 30,000 college students during the outbreak period in January (T1) and home quarantine in February (T2). This survey used online questionnaire (www.wjx.cn) to investigate the emotion information of college students. In the T1 survey, the &quot;Typhoon Eye Effect&quot; appeared. College students in Hubei are calmer than those outside Hubei in T1. However, in T2, an emotional &quot;infection point&quot; appeared, there was an &quot;Exposure Effect&quot;, the negative emotions of students in Hubei largely increased and became higher than students outside Hubei. This survey found that there is an emotional &quot;infection point&quot; in February among college students, especially in the Hubei area. College students in Hubei are calmer than those outside Hubei in T1. In contrast, college students in Hubei were more nervous and scared than those outside Hubei in T2. This epidemic has caused the students to experience significant pressure and negative emotions. Therefore, universities and society should pay attention to their emotional adjustment, there are some suggestions such as establish the mental health organizations, test students' emotion status regularly.","Zhang, Cao, Wang, Wang, Lei, Shou, Xie, Huang, Luo, Luo, Bian, Zhang, Xiao",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.07.097,20200909.0,"College students; Emotional â€œinflection pointâ€; New coronavirus pneumonia (NCP); Self-regulation; Adolescent; Anxiety; Artificial Intelligence; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; China; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; Emergencies; Emotions; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Public Health; SARS-CoV-2; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
217,HIV and COVID-19: Intersecting Epidemics With Many Unknowns,"As of July 2020, approximately 6 months into the pandemic of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), whether people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; PLWH) are disproportionately affected remains an unanswered question. Thus far, risk of COVID-19 in people with and without HIV appears similar, but data are sometimes contradictory. Some uncertainty is due to the recency of the emergence of COVID-19 and sparsity of data; some is due to imprecision about what it means for HIV to be a &quot;risk factor&quot; for COVID-19. Forthcoming studies on the risk of COVID-19 to PLWH should differentiate between 1) the unadjusted, excess burden of disease among PLWH to inform surveillance efforts and 2) any excess risk of COVID-19 among PLWH due to biological effects of HIV, independent of comorbidities that confound rather than mediate this effect. PLWH bear a disproportionate burden of alcohol, other drug use, and mental health disorders, as well as other structural vulnerabilities, which might increase their risk of COVID-19. In addition to any direct effects of COVID-19 on the health of PLWH, we need to understand how physical distancing restrictions affect secondary health outcomes and the need for, accessibility of, and impact of alternative modalities of providing ongoing medical, mental health, and substance use treatment that comply with physical distancing restrictions (e.g., telemedicine).","Lesko, Bengtson",https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwaa158,20210106.0,COVID-19; HIV; engagement in care; mental health; substance use; telemedicine,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

Participants were 73 community-living older adults with pre-existing MDD (mean age 69 [SD 6]) in Los Angeles, New York, Pittsburgh, and St Louis. During the first 2 months of the pandemic, the authors interviewed participants with a semistructured qualitative interview evaluating access to care, mental health, quality of life, and coping. The authors also assessed depression, anxiety, and suicidality with validated scales and compared scores before and during the pandemic. Five themes from the interviews highlight the experience of older adults with MDD: 1) They are more concerned about the risk of contracting the virus than the risks of isolation. 2) They exhibit resilience to the stress and isolation of physical distancing. 3) Most are not isolated socially, with virtual contact with friends and family. 4) Their quality of life is lower, and they worry their mental health will suffer with continued physical distancing. 5) They are outraged by an inadequate governmental response to the pandemic. Depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation symptom scores did not differ from scores before the pandemic. Most older adults with pre-existing MDD show resilience in the first 2 months of the COVID-19 pandemic but have concerns about the future. Policies and interventions to provide access to medical services and opportunities for social interaction are needed to help to maintain mental health and quality of life as the pandemic continues.","Hamm, Brown, Karp, Lenard, Cameron, Dawdani, Lavretsky, Miller, Mulsant, Pham, Reynolds, Roose, Lenze",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.06.013,20200907.0,"Covid-19 Pandemic; anxiety; depression; resilience; Aged; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; Comorbidity; Coronavirus Infections; Depressive Disorder, Major; Female; Humans; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Qualitative Research; Quality of Life; SARS-CoV-2; Suicidal Ideation; United States",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
220,Adapting Neurosurgery Practice During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the Indian Subcontinent,"The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has changed the practice of neurosurgery. Significant resources have been dedicated to the disease. The pandemic in the Indian subcontinent, compared with the rest of the world, is relatively delayed. The neurosurgical practice cannot remain unaffected by hugely disruptive measures such as a lockdown. The inevitable increase in COVID infections with the gradual relaxation of lockdown continues to pose a risk for health care providers. Therefore, it is imperative to evaluate whether the pandemic has had a discernible effect on health care providers, especially in terms of practice modifications in private establishments and publicly funded hospitals, the emotional impact on the surgeon, and the influence of social media on the psyche of the surgeon. An online questionnaire-based survey was prepared, with questions related to the COVID-specific themes of precautions taken in outpatient services and operating theaters, the influence of social media, the economic loss incurred, and the perceptible impact of telemedicine and webinars. The links to the survey were mailed to neurosurgeons in private and public practice countrywide. The responses were anonymized to ensure free and unbiased answers to the survey questions. A total of 176 responses were received from across the Indian subcontinent. The median age of respondents was 39 years (range, 32-70 years) and the postresidency experience was 7 years (range, 0-34 years). Respondents were an equitable mix of public and private practitioners. Of respondents, 46% were practicing restricted outpatient services, more in public institutions (PÂ = 0.22) which also had a higher incidence of tele-outpatient services (26% vs. 17%). Wearing surgical masks, N95 masks, and gloves were the most commonly practiced precautionary measures in outpatient services (&gt;60%). Although private practitioners were continuing elective cases (40%), public institutes were more cautious, with only emergency patients being operated on (29%). The greatest fear among all practitioners was passing the infection to their family (75%). Social media were helpful for brainstorming queries and updating practice modifications, but some surgeons admitted to receiving threats on social media platforms (37.5%). Depression and economic losses were palpable for approximately 30% neurosurgeons. The survey highlights the perception of neurosurgeons toward the pandemic and the difference in public-private practice. Suspension of elective procedures, severe curtailment of regular outpatient appointments, drastic modifications of the normal outpatient department/operating room practices, and apprehensions related to inadequacy of safety provided by personal protective equipment use and financial losses of private establishments were some of the visible themes in our survey results. Although telemedicine has not been as widely adopted as expected, online education has been favorably received.","Deora, Mishra, Tripathi, Garg, Tandon, Borkar, Varshney, Raut, Chaurasia, Chandra, Kale",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2020.07.038,20201009.0,"COVID-19; Coronavirus; Neurosurgery; Social media; Academic Medical Centers; Adult; Aged; Ambulatory Care; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Economics; Elective Surgical Procedures; Hospitals, Private; Hospitals, Public; Humans; India; Middle Aged; Neurosurgeons; Neurosurgery; Neurosurgical Procedures; Pandemics; Personal Protective Equipment; Pneumonia, Viral; Professional Practice; SARS-CoV-2; Social Media; Surveys and Questionnaires; Telemedicine",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
221,Mapping population mental health concerns related to COVID-19 and the consequences of physical distancing: a Google trends analysis,"<b>Background:</b> The 2020 Coronavirus pandemic is a major international public health challenge. Â Governments have taken public health protection measures to reduce the spread of the virus through non-pharmalogical measures. The impact of the pandemic and the public health response on individual and population mental health is unknown.Â <b>Methods:</b> We used Google Trends data (1 Jan 2020 - Â 30 Mar 2020) to investigate the impact of the pandemic and government measures to curb it on people's concerns, as indexed by changes in search frequency for topics indicating mental distress, social and economic stressors and mental health treatment-seeking. We explored the changes of key topics in Google trends in Italy, Spain, USA, UK, and Worldwide in relation to sentinel events during the pandemic. <b>Results:</b> Globally there appears to be significant concerns over the financial and work-related consequences of the pandemic, with some evidence that levels of fear are rising. Conversely relative searching for topics related to depression and suicide fell after the pandemic was announced, with some evidence that searches for the latter have risen recently. Concerns over education and access to medication appear to be particular social stressors. Whilst searches for face-to-face treatments have declined, those for self-care have risen. <b>Conclusions:</b> Monitoring Google trends shows promise as a means of tracking changing public concerns. In weeks to come it may enable policy makers to assess the impact of their interventions including those aiming to limit negative consequences, such as government funded financial safety nets.","Knipe, Evans, Marchant, Gunnell, John",https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15870.2,20200928.0,Anxiety; COVID-19; Coronavirus; Depression; Economic; Mental health; Pandemic; Suicide,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

223,COVID-19 and Telepsychiatry: Development of Evidence-Based Guidance for Clinicians,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) presents unique challenges in health care, including mental health care provision. Telepsychiatry can provide an alternative to face-to-face assessment and can also be used creatively with other technologies to enhance care, but clinicians and patients may feel underconfident about embracing this new way of working. The aim of this paper is to produce an open-access, easy-to-consult, and reliable source of information and guidance about telepsychiatry and COVID-19 using an evidence-based approach. We systematically searched existing English language guidelines and websites for information on telepsychiatry in the context of COVID-19 up to and including May 2020. We used broad search criteria and included pre-COVID-19 guidelines and other digital mental health topics where relevant. We summarized the data we extracted as answers to specific clinical questions. Findings from this study are presented as both a short practical checklist for clinicians and detailed textboxes with a full summary of all the guidelines. The summary textboxes are also available on an open-access webpage, which is regularly updated. These findings reflected the strong evidence base for the use of telepsychiatry and included guidelines for many of the common concerns expressed by clinicians about practical implementation, technology, information governance, and safety. Guidelines across countries differ significantly, with UK guidelines more conservative and focused on practical implementation and US guidelines more expansive and detailed. Guidelines on possible combinations with other digital technologies such as apps (eg, from the US Food and Drug Administration, the National Health Service Apps Library, and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) are less detailed. Several key areas were not represented. Although some special populations such as child and adolescent, and older adult, and cultural issues are specifically included, important populations such as learning disabilities, psychosis, personality disorder, and eating disorders, which may present particular challenges for telepsychiatry, are not. In addition, the initial consultation and follow-up sessions are not clearly distinguished. Finally, a hybrid model of care (combining telepsychiatry with other technologies and in-person care) is not explicitly covered by the existing guidelines. We produced a comprehensive synthesis of guidance answering a wide range of clinical questions in telepsychiatry. This meets the urgent need for practical information for both clinicians and health care organizations who are rapidly adapting to the pandemic and implementing remote consultation. It reflects variations across countries and can be used as a basis for organizational change in the short- and long-term. Providing easily accessible guidance is a first step but will need cultural change to implement as clinicians start to view telepsychiatry not just as a replacement but as a parallel and complementary form of delivering therapy with its own advantages and benefits as well as restrictions. A combination or hybrid approach can be the most successful approach in the new world of mental health post-COVID-19, and guidance will need to expand to encompass the use of telepsychiatry in conjunction with other in-person and digital technologies, and its use across all psychiatric disorders, not just those who are the first to access and engage with remote treatment.","Smith, Ostinelli, Macdonald, Cipriani",https://doi.org/10.2196/21108,20200928.0,COVID-19; digital mental health; evidence-based guidance; mental health; systematic review; telepsychiatry,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
224,Mental health in chronic disease patients during the COVID-19 quarantine in Greece,"To investigate the effect of the time spent on quarantine on distress, anxiety, depression, and somatization of chronic disease patients during the COVID-19 quarantine in Greece and the differences in these parameters between healthy individuals and chronic disease patients. The sample consisted of 943 healthy individuals and 163 patients (respiratory, autoimmune, cardiovascular, endocrine, patients with other diseases, and patients with more than one disease) completing sociodemographic assessments as well as the 4-Dimensional Symptom Questionnaire (4DSQ) during March 30, 2020 to May 3, 2020. Pearson's correlation was used to search for the association between time spent on quarantine and the 4DSQ subscales (distress, anxiety, depression, and somatization). Independent sample T-test and Glass's Î” were used for differences between healthy individuals and chronic disease patients in these subscales, an analysis also carried out between healthy individuals and all patient subgroups. No statistically significant correlations were noted between the 4DSQ subscales and the quarantine duration, both for the patient and the healthy individuals' group. Chronic disease patients had significantly higher levels of distress (p = 0.001, Î” = 0.28) and somatization (p = 0.000, Î” = 0.47), but not there were no significant differences in anxiety (p = 0.098, Î” = 0.14) and depression (p = 0.052, Î” = 0.19). Concerning head-to-head comparisons between the healthy individuals' group and each patient group, significantly higher scores in distress were found only for patients with respiratory diseases (p = 0.028, Î” = 0.42). Regarding somatization, significantly higher scores were noted for the healthy individuals' group compared with patients with autoimmune diseases (p = 0.010, Î” = 0.62), respiratory diseases (p = 0.027, Î” = 0.42), other diseases (p = 0.003, Î” = 0.55), and more than one disease (p = 0.012, Î” = 0.60). No statistically significant differences were found in anxiety and depression. The results of this study indicate that interventional programs for chronic disease patients during quarantine should focus on distress and somatization, not on anxiety and depression. Respiratory patients might have more supportive care needs compared with patients with other diseases.","Louvardi, Pelekasis, Chrousos, Darviri",https://doi.org/10.1017/S1478951520000528,20201123.0,"Asthma; Autoimmune; Cardiovascular; Mental health; Pandemic; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; Chronic Disease; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Greece; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Quarantine; SARS-CoV-2; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

We describe the evolution of a COVID-19 outbreak in our own facility, and the design, and staffing of a forensic isolation unit. We found a range of useful guidance but no published experience of implementing these approaches. We experienced outbreaks of COVID-19 on two secure forensic units with 13 patients and 10 staff becoming positive. One patient died. The outbreaks lasted for 41 days on each unit from declaration to resolution. We describe the approaches taken to reduction of infection risk, social distancing and changes to the care delivery model. Forensic secure settings present major challenges as some proposals for pandemic management such as decarceration or early release are not possible, and facilities may present challenges to achieve sustained social distancing.

227,COVID 19-Depression and Neurosurgeons,"The goal of this survey was to determine factors associated with anxiety/depression among neurosurgeons during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. An online survey was performed of neurosurgeons worldwide, conducted over 3 weeks. Depression in neurosurgeons was assessed by Self-Reporting Questionnaire-20. A total of 375 responses were received from 52 countries. Among all neurosurgeons, 34% felt tense, 32.5% were unhappy, 25% experienced insomnia, almost 20% had headaches, and 5% had suicidal ideation during the pandemic. Of participants, 14% had a score on Self-Reporting Questionnaire-20 consistent with depression. The likelihood of depression was significantly higher among those who did not receive guidance about self-protection from their institutions (odds ratio [OR], 2.47), those who did not feel safe with provided personal protective equipments (OR, 3.13), and those whose families considered their workplace unsafe (OR, 2.29). Depression was less likely in neurosurgeons who had minor concerns, compared with those with significant health concerns for their families (OR, 0.36). In multivariate analysis after controlling for effects of other covariates, odds of depression were significantly higher among neurosurgeons who did not feel safe with the provided personal protective equipment (OR, 2.43) and who were exposed to a COVID-19-positive colleague (OR, 2.54). Participants who had moderate concerns for their families had lesser odds of anxiety/depression than did those with significant concerns (OR,Â 0.28). Based on the modifiable risk factors of depression in this study, it is recommended that the safety of neurosurgeons be ensured by providing appropriate safety measures for them to regain their confidence and hence reduce the incidence of depression.","Sharif, Amin, Hafiz, Benzel, Peev, Dahlan, Enchev, Pereira, Vaishya",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2020.06.007,20200827.0,"COVID-19; Depression in neurosurgeons; Depression in surgeons; Depression scale; Depression/anxiety; Global neurosurgery; Health care workers; PPE; Pandemic; Safety; Social media; Adult; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Humans; Mental Health; Neurosurgeons; Pandemics; Personal Protective Equipment; Pneumonia, Viral; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

To date, the number of patients in China has risen to 31,000. We collected patient data from 4 Chinese cities (Hefei, Hangzhou, Wenzhou, and Shenzhen) and described epidemiologic characteristics. As of February 6, 2020, we have extracted data from 950 patients from the 4 cities, including 477 (50.21%) men and 473 (49.79%) women. The age (mean Â± standard deviation) was 45.64 Â±15.59 years. Before contracting COVID-19, 299 (31.47%) patients had come in contact with Wuhan residents or patients diagnosed with COVID-19, while 138 (14.53%) patients had severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection from an unknown source. Most COVID-19 patients in the 4 cities were from Wuhan originally and had spread the infection locally. Therefore, the initial stage of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in cities outside of Wuhan were mainly input. Cutting off the input and controlling the community communication could reduce local incidence.","Hu, Rao, Hu",https://doi.org/10.7883/yoken.JJID.2020.067,20201208.0,COVID-19; China; SARS-CoV-2; pneumonia; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; COVID-19; China; Cities; Female; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; SARS-CoV-2; Young Adult,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

232,Perinatal depressive and anxiety symptoms of pregnant women during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in China,"On January 20, 2020, a new coronavirus epidemic with human-to-human transmission was officially declared by the Chinese government, which caused significant public panic in China. In light of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, pregnant women may be particularly vulnerable and in special need for preventive mental health strategies. Thus far, no reports exist to investigate the mental health response of pregnant women to the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. This study aimed to examine the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak on the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms and the corresponding risk factors among pregnant women across China. A multicenter, cross-sectional study was initiated in early December 2019 to identify mental health concerns in pregnancy using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. This study provided a unique opportunity to compare the mental status of pregnant women before and after the declaration of the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic. A total of 4124 pregnant women during their third trimester from 25 hospitals in 10 provinces across China were examined in this cross-sectional study from January 1, 2020, to February 9, 2020. Of these women, 1285 were assessed after January 20, 2020, when the coronavirus epidemic was publicly declared and 2839 were assessed before this pivotal time point. The internationally recommended Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale was used to assess maternal depression and anxiety symptoms. Prevalence rates and risk factors were compared between the pre- and poststudy groups. Pregnant women assessed after the declaration of coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic had significantly higher rates of depressive symptoms (26.0% vs 29.6%, P=.02) than women assessed before the epidemic declaration. These women were also more likely to have thoughts of self-harm (P=.005). The depressive rates were positively associated with the number of newly confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (P=.003), suspected infections (P=.004), and deaths per day (P=.001). Pregnant women who were underweight before pregnancy, primiparous, younger than 35 years, employed full time, in middle income category, and had appropriate living space were at increased risk for developing depressive and anxiety symptoms during the outbreak. Major life-threatening public health events such as the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak may increase the risk for mental illness among pregnant women, including thoughts of self-harm. Strategies targeting maternal stress and isolation such as effective risk communication and the provision of psychological first aid may be particularly useful to prevent negative outcomes for women and their fetuses.","Wu, Zhang, Liu, Duan, Li, Fan, Li, Chen, Xu, Li, Guo, Wang, Li, Li, Zhang, You, Li, Yang, Tao, Xu, Lao, Wen, Zhou, Wang, Chen, Meng, Zhai, Ye, Zhong, Yang, Zhang, Zhang, Wu, Chen, Dennis, Huang",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.05.009,20200810.0,"COVID-19; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; perinatal anxiety; perinatal depression; Adult; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; China; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Pregnancy; Pregnant Women; SARS-CoV-2",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

This article considers the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the provision of mental health services for young people with ADHD with specific reference to the difficulties that have been experienced in ADMiRE, a specialist ADHD service in Dublin, since the outbreak of Covid-19 in Ireland. Current guidelines and alternative ways of ensuring adequate service provision are discussed. Restrictions to mitigate the spread of Covid-19 are likely to continue for many months, and child and adolescent mental health services need to find new ways to provide a sustainable service to young people in Ireland.

234,Principles of mental health care during the COVID-19 pandemic,"We describe the basic principles of mental health care during the COVID-19 pandemic that should be endorsed by the mental health professional associations and incorporated in the health strategies for the management of the COVID-19 pandemic. The main principle is that there should be no substantial differences in the provision of health care for COVID-19 between persons with pre-existing mental health disorders and the ones without previous disorders. Subsequently, the organization of the health care should reflect that as well. These principles should (a) prevent the possible effects of stigmatizing attitudes toward mental health issues, possibly leading to potentially deleterious situations, such as psychiatric patients being treated (even temporarily) separately from other patients, in psychiatric facilities, where the staff is not equipped and trained adequately for the management of COVID-19; (b) highlight the fact that patients with mental health disorders are at greater risk for developing serious complications of COVID-19 infection due to other factors-they often smoke and have comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, all associated with higher morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 infection; (c) highlight that measures should be taken to minimize the risk of the spread of infection in psychiatric wards/institutions; (d) provide a general framework for the reorganization of mental health services toward the provision of services for persons in need, including frontline medical workers and patients with COVID-19 without previous mental health problems as well as for persons with pre-existing mental health problems under new circumstances of pandemic.","Kuzman, Curkovic, Wasserman",https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2020.54,20200608.0,"COVID-19; mental health; organization; public health; stigma; COVID-19; Coronavirus Infections; Health Personnel; Humans; Mental Disorders; Mental Health Services; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Stereotyping",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

236,The COVID-19 Pandemic and Rapid Implementation of Adolescent and Young Adult Telemedicine: Challenges and Opportunities for Innovation,"This study describes the rapid implementation of telemedicine within an adolescent and young adult (AYA) medicine clinic in response to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. While there are no practice guidelines specific to AYA telemedicine, observations made during this implementation can highlight challenges encountered and suggest solutions to some of these challenges. Over the course of several weeks in March, 2020, the Adolescent and Young Adult Medicine Clinic at the University of California San Francisco rapidly replaced most in-person visits with telemedicine visits. This required logistical problem-solving, collaboration of all clinic staff members, and continuous reassessment of clinical practices. This article describes observations made during these processes. Telemedicine visits increased from zero to 97% of patient encounters in one month. The number of visits per month was comparable with that one year prior. While there were limitations to the clinic's ability to carry out health supervision visits, many general health, mental health, reproductive health, eating disorders, and addiction treatment services were implemented via telemedicine. Providers identified creative solutions for challenges that arose to managing general confidentiality issues as well as specific challenges related to mental health, reproductive health, eating disorders, and addiction care. Opportunities to implement and expand high-quality AYA telemedicine were also identified. The COVID-19 pandemic is leading to widespread telemedicine implementation. While telemedicine seems to be feasible and acceptable for our clinic patients, unanswered questions remain regarding confidentiality, quality of care, and health disparities. Clinical guidelines are also needed to guide best practices for telemedicine in this patient population.","Barney, Buckelew, Mesheriakova, Raymond-Flesch",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.05.006,20200805.0,"Addiction medicine; Adolescent; Adolescent health services; Adolescent medicine; Feeding and eating disorders; Reproductive health services; Telemedicine; Adolescent; Adolescent Health Services; Adult; COVID-19; Child; Coronavirus Infections; Diffusion of Innovation; Female; Humans; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Telemedicine; United States; Young Adult",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
237,Culture counts: the diverse effects of culture and society on mental health amidst COVID-19 outbreak in Australia,"Since COVID-19 first emerged internationally, Australia has applied a number of public health measures to counter the disease' epidemiology. The public heath response has been effective in virus testing, diagnosing and treating patients with COVID-19. The imposed strict border restrictions and social distancing played a vital role in reducing positive cases via community transmission resulting in 'flattening of the curve'. Now is too soon to assess the impact of COVID-19 on people's mental health, as it will be determined by both short- and long-term consequences of exposure to stress, uncertainty, loss of control, loneliness and isolation. The authors explored cultural and societal influences on mental health during the current pandemic utilising Geert Hofstede's multidimensional construct of culture and determined psychological and cultural factors that foster resilience. We also reflected on the psychological impact of the pandemic on the individual and the group at large by utilising Michel Foucault' and Jacques Lacan' psychoanalytic theories. Remote Aboriginal Australian communities have been identified as a high-risk subpopulation in view of their unique vulnerabilities owing to their compromised health status, in addition to historical, systemic and cultural factors. Historically, Australia has prided itself in its multiculturalism; however, there has been evidence of an increase in racial microaggressions and xenophobia during this pandemic. Australia's model of cultural awareness will need to evolve, from reactionary to more reflective, post COVID-19 pandemic to best serve our multicultural, inclusive and integrated society.","Furlong, Finnie",https://doi.org/10.1017/ipm.2020.37,20201029.0,"Australia; COVID-19; cultural competency; mental health; psychoanalysis; Australia; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; Coronavirus Infections; Culture; Disease Outbreaks; Humans; Indigenous Peoples; Mental Disorders; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Quarantine; SARS-CoV-2",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

This pandemic has proven to be a challenge given that there is no immediate cure, no vaccine is currently available and medications or treatments being used are still undergoing clinical trials. There have already been examples of self-medication and overdose. Clearly, there is a need to further define the efficacy of treatments used in the management of COVID-19. This evidence needs to be backed by large randomised-controlled clinical trials. In the meantime, there will no doubt be further off-label use of these medications by patients and practitioners and possibly related toxicity.",Wong,https://doi.org/10.1111/1742-6723.13537,20200805.0,"COVID; coronavirus; overdose; toxicology; Antiviral Agents; Azithromycin; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; Chloroquine; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Hydroxychloroquine; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; SARS-CoV-2; Treatment Outcome",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
240,Coronavirus Disease 2019 Hangover: A Rising Tide of Alcohol Use Disorder and Alcohol-Associated Liver Disease,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a tremendous global impact since it began in November of 2019. However, there are concerns that the COVID-19 pandemic will not affect all equally and that some populations will be particularly vulnerable. Relevant to liver disease, patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) may be among the populations that are the most severely impacted. The reasons for this include being at a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection due to a depressed immune system and high-risk underlying comorbidities, the injurious effect of COVID-19 on the liver, the inability to attend regular visits with providers, diversion of hospital resources, and social isolation leading to psychological decompensation and increased drinking or relapse. As a result, we fear that there will be a dramatic rising tide of alcohol relapse, admissions for decompensated ALD, and an increase in newly diagnosed patients with AUD/ALD post-COVID-19 pandemic. Providers and their institutions should implement preemptive strategies such as telehealth and aggressive patient outreach programs now to curb this anticipated problem. Liver transplantation (LT) centers should adapt to the pandemic by considering leniency to some LT candidates with ALD who cannot access appropriate alcohol treatment due to the current situation. In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic will likely be especially detrimental to patients with AUD/ALD, and actions need to be taken now to limit the scope of this anticipated problem.","Da, Im, Schiano",https://doi.org/10.1002/hep.31307,20201229.0,"Alcohol Drinking; Alcoholism; COVID-19; Humans; Liver Diseases, Alcoholic; Liver Transplantation; Physical Distancing; SARS-CoV-2; Telemedicine",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

Doctors experience high levels of work stress even under normal circumstances, but many would be reluctant to disclose mental health difficulties or seek help for them, with stigma an often-cited reason. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis places additional pressure on doctors and on the healthcare system in general and research shows that such pressure brings a greater risk of psychological distress for doctors. For this reason, we argue that the authorities and healthcare executives must show strong leadership and support for doctors and their families during the COVID-19 outbreak and call for efforts to reduce mental health stigma in clinical workplaces. This can be facilitated by deliberately adding â€˜healthcare staff mental health support processâ€™ as an ongoing agenda item to high-level management planning meetings.","Galbraith, Boyda, McFeeters, Hassan",https://doi.org/10.1192/bjb.2020.44,20200928.0,COVID-19; coronavirus; doctors; healthcare professionals; mental health,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

One such underrecognized and unaddressed area is the mental health issues medical staff develop during the pandemic. This review aimed to review the literature about mental health problems faced by health care workers (HCW) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Literature search was conducted in the following databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, Embase. All types of articles published in the last 4 months (January 2020-April 2020) which were relevant to the subject of the review were searched. A total of 23 articles were selected by initial screening and 6 articles were included in the final review. Review of all the 6 articles showed that current research focused on assessing several aspects of mental health affected in HCW due to COVID-19. Several sociodemographic variables like gender, profession, age, place of work, department of work and psychological variables like poor social support, self-efficacy were associated with increased stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, insomnia in HCW. There is increasing evidence that suggests that COVID-19 can be an independent risk factor for stress in HCW. Regular screening of medical personnel involved in treating, diagnosing patients with COVID-19 should be done for evaluating stress, depression and anxiety by using multidisciplinary Psychiatry teams.","Spoorthy, Pratapa, Mahant",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102119,20200825.0,"COVID-19; Health care workers; Psychological; Stress; Behavioral Symptoms; COVID-19; Coronavirus Infections; Health Personnel; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

However, there is debate regarding whether self-reports overestimate or underestimate actual screen time. We used advances in iPhone software to address this question and to investigate the influence of individual difference factors, and COVID-19 lockdown restrictions, on screen time. Participants (N = 267, 18–25 years) completed scales measuring depression, anxiety, smartphone attachment, and estimated their screen time. Thereafter, they shared screenshots of their battery use (BUS) and iPhone screen time (iOS STT) data. Some (n = 24) shared their BUS data again during the COVID-19 lockdown. Whereas the BUS data (10-day average, including two weekends) indicated that self-reports underestimated actual use, the iOS STT data (7-day average) indicated that self-reports overestimated actual use (ps < .007). Smartphone use was heavier over weekends and screen time increased significantly during the lockdown (p = .001). Finally, smartphone attachment mediated the relationship between objective screen time and depression, but not anxiety. We conclude that iPhone tracking features can reliably collect objective screen time data, and that screen time is significantly influenced by both individual difference factors and environmental context.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2020.106616,20210201.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

We also examined the role of different sources of information in these relations. The convenience sample was used (N = 412) and it consisted of individuals from Serbia (N = 292) and Latin-America (N = 120). Following instruments were used: The Life Orientation Test (Scheier, Carver, & Bridges, 1994), Trust in people scale (Arbor, 1964), questions regarding fear, source of information, preventive behaviors and conspiracy constructed for the purposes of this research. The results suggest that fear of food shortage was the most pronounces one in both samples, followed by fear for oneself and finally by the fear for beloved others.

255,Anxiety among young adults and the elderly during the lockdown for SARS-CoV2,"Chez le sujet âgé, certains troubles tels que la dépression sont difficiles à diagnostiquer et ont un aspect différent de la pathologie qui survient chez le jeune adulte. Nous nous sommes consacrés dans cette étude à évaluer le niveau de l’anxiété à travers la somatisation chez les participants afin de mettre en évidence la différence entre l’anxiété chez le jeune adulte et l’anxiété chez le sujet âgé. Cette étude est une suite à la publication concernant une nouvelle échelle de somatisation. Les analyses statistiques ont été faites sur la même population. Ce travail a été réalisé à l’aide de l’échelle de somatisation sur un échantillon de 235 participants ayant plus de 18 ans. Ces participants étaient des hommes et femmes qui ont été confinés au Maroc lors de la pandémie du SARS-CoV2. Nous avons constaté que les jeunes adultes présentaient une anxiété plus intense que les sujets âgés au cours de cette période de confinement et que les sujets âgés étaient plus nombreux à ressentir de l’anxiété dite « normale » suite à la pandémie du COVID-19. Among the elderly, certain disorders such as depression are difficult to diagnose and have a different aspect from the pathology occurring in young adults. In this study, we set out to assess levels of anxiety via somatization among the participants in order to highlight any differences between anxiety among young adults and anxiety among the elderly. This study is a follow-up to a previously published report on a newly established somatization scale. The statistical analyses were carried out on the same population. This work used the somatization scale on a sample of 235 participants over the age of 18. The participants were men and women who were subjected to lockdown in Morocco during the SARS-CoV2 pandemic. We found that young adults exhibited more intense anxiety than the elderly during this period of confinement and that the elderly subjects were more likely to experience so-called “normal” anxiety following the COVID-19 pandemic.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.npg.2020.08.005,20201201.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

Esto les ha podido causar dificultades emocionales y problemas de salud mental. El objetivo del presente estudio fue analizar el estado emocional de los trabajadores del Hospital de Igualada (Barcelona), mientras se enfrentaban a uno de los focos de contagio más importantes de Europa. Pacientes y métodos Se incluyó a un total de 395 trabajadores. Se realizó una evaluación transversal entre los meses de marzo y abril. Se recogió información sobre síntomas de ansiedad, depresión, estrés. También se recogieron datos demográficos y sobre factores potencialmente estresantes. Resultados Un porcentaje significativo de profesionales reportó síntomas de ansiedad (71,6%) y depresión (60,3%). El 14,5% informó de síntomas de estrés agudo. Se realizó un análisis de regresión que explicó el 30% de la variancia asociada al nivel de malestar emocional (Ry=0,30). Los factores de riesgo asociados a mayor malestar psicológico fueron el hecho de ser mujer (o hombre joven), trabajar como auxiliar de enfermería, celador o técnico de radiología, estar en contacto directo con pacientes Covid-19, no haber realizado la PCR, tener la sensación de no contar con los elementos de protección personales y haber experimentado la muerte de una persona cercana por Covid-19. Conclusiones El afrontamiento inicial de la situación de crisis asociada a la pandemia de Covid-19 tuvo un importante impacto emocional en los profesionales sanitarios analizados. Background and objectives The Covid-19 pandemic has put healthcare professionals around the world in an unprecedented challenge. This may cause some emotional difficulties and mental health problems. The aim of the present study was to analyze the emotional status among the health care workers form the Hospital of Igualada (Barcelona), while they were facing with Covid-19 in one of the most affected regions in all of Europe. Patients and methods A total of 395 participants were included in the study. A cross-sectional assessment was carried out between the months of March and April. Information about anxiety, depression, and stress was gathered. We also collected demographic data and concerning potentially stressful factors. Results A significant proportion of professionals reported symptoms of anxiety (31.4%) and depression (12.2%) from moderate to severe intensity. Symptoms of acute stress were reported by 14.5% of participants. We performed a regression analysis, which explained the 30% of the variance associated with the degree of emotional distress (Ry=0.30). The final model reveals that females (or young males), who are working in the frontline as nursing assistants, caretakers or radiology technicians, with the uncertainty of a possible infection, the perception of inadequate protection measures and having experienced the death of a close person by Covid-19, showed a heightened risk of experiencing psychological distress.

Este es el caso del Perú, uno de los países latinoamericanos más afectados por la pandemia. En este sentido, el objetivo del estudio fue traducir y validar la Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) al español. Material y método Los participantes fueron 704 estudiantes universitarios de ciencias de la salud (Medad = 23.39 años, DE = 3.45) a quienes se les administró el CAS en español, el Mental Health Inventory-5 y el Patient Health Questionnaire-2 item. El CAS se tradujo al español mediante el método hacia adelante y hacia atrás. Se examinaron la fiabilidad y las evidencias de validez basada en la estructura interna y relación con otras variables. Resultados El análisis factorial confirmó la estructura factorial unidimensional del CAS (<U+03C7>2 = 7.62, gl = 5, p = .18, <U+03C7>2/df = 1.52, CFI = .99, RMSEA = .03 [CI90% .00, .06]; SRMR = .02, WRMR = .52); además las cargas factoriales fueron grandes y significativas (de .68 a .87). Los cinco ítems del CAS mostraron correlaciones ítems test total corregido aceptables (de .64 a .74). La confiabilidad por consistencia interna fue buena (<U+03C9> = .89; aordinal = .89). La evidencia de validez con base en la relación con otras variables del CAS fue respaldada por la correlación positiva con la depresión (r = .52, p < .01) y negativa con el bienestar subjetivo (r = -.50, p < .01). Además, la depresión media la relación entre la ansiedad por la COVID-19 y el bienestar subjetivo (valor bootstrap = - .24, IC 95% = - .28, - .20). Conclusión La versión en español del CAS posee evidencias de validez y confiabilidad para medir la ansiedad por la COVID-19 en una muestra de universitarios peruanos. Introduction and objectives COVID-19 has generated negative consequences for people's mental health. This is the case of Peru, one of the Latin American countries most affected by the pandemic. In this sense, the objective of the study was to translate and validate the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) into Spanish. Material and method The participants were 704 university students of health sciences (Mage = 23.39 years, SD = 3.45) who were administered the CAS in Spanish, the Mental Health Inventory-5 and the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 item. The CAS was translated into Spanish using the forward and backward method. Reliability and evidence of validity based on internal structure and relationship with other variables were examined. Results The factor analysis confirmed the one-dimensional factor structure of the CAS (<U+03C7> 2 = 7.62, df = 5, p = .18, <U+03C7> 2 / gl = 1.52, CFI = .99, RMSEA = .03 [90% CI .00, .06]; SRMR = .02, WRMR = .52); In addition, the factor loadings were large and significant (from .68 to .87). The five CAS items showed acceptable corrected total test item correlations (from .64 to .74). Reliability due to internal consistency was good (<U+03C9> = .89; aordinal = .89). The validity evidence based on the relationship with other CAS variables was supported by the positive correlation with depression (r = .52, p < .01) and negative with subjective well-being (r = -.50, p < . 01). Furthermore, depression mediates the relationship between COVID-19 anxiety and subjective well-being (bootstrap value = - .24, 95% CI = - .28, - .20).

266,Suicidal behavior in light of COVID-19 outbreak: Clinical challenges and treatment perspectives,"Objectifs La pandémie de COVID-19 touche à ce jour plus de 3 000 000 de personnes à travers le monde et les mesures de prévention ont conduit au confinement de plus de la moitié de l’humanité. La communauté scientifique et les autorités politiques redoutent une épidémie de suicides secondaires à cette crise. L’objectif de cette revue de la littérature est d’analyser l’impact de la pandémie de COVID-19 sur les dimensions du processus suicidaire, son interaction avec les différents facteurs de risque. Nous proposons également des solutions innovantes pour y remédier. Méthodes Nous avons réalisé une revue narrative des articles internationaux traitant des grandes pandémies (COVID-19, SRAS) et de leur influence sur la vulnérabilité suicidaire. Résultats De nombreux facteurs sont susceptibles de majorer l’émergence d’idées de suicide et le passage à l’acte suicidaire au cours de cette crise. La distanciation et le confinement pourraient favoriser un sentiment de déconnexion et la perception d’une douleur sociale chez les individus vulnérables. Certaines populations déjà « à risque suicidaire élevé » pourraient être encore fragilisées par la pandémie actuelle : personnes âgées, personnel médical et individus exposés à une forte précarité économique. Plusieurs solutions innovantes adaptées aux contraintes de la distanciation et du confinement permettront de prévenir le risque suicidaire : outils de santé connectée, protocole VigilanS, thérapie comportementale et cognitive de troisième vague et pratique artistique. Conclusions Il est possible que cette crise inédite exacerbe certaines dimensions du processus suicidaire. Cependant, à l’heure de l’innovation, plusieurs outils de prévention du suicide ont toute leur place dans les nouveaux modes de soins et devront être expérimentés à grande échelle. Objective The COVID-19 pandemic affected today more than 3,000,000 worldwide, and more than half of humanity has been placed in quarantine. The scientific community and the political authorities fear an epidemic of suicide secondary to this crisis. The aim of this review is to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the dimensions of the suicidal process and its interaction with the various risk factors. We also propose innovative strategies to manage suicidal behavior in the context of pandemic. Methods We carried out a narrative review of international publications dealing with major pandemics (COVID-19, SARS) and their influence on suicidal vulnerability. Results Many factors are likely to increase the emergence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts during this crisis. Social distancing and quarantine could increase the feeling of disconnection and the perception of social pain in vulnerable individuals. Some populations at high suicidal risk could be further impacted by the current pandemic: the elderly, medical staff and individuals exposed to economic insecurity. Several innovative tools adapted to the constraints of social distancing and quarantine may prevent suicide risk: e-health, VigilanS, buddhist-derived practices and art engagement. Conclusions This unprecedented crisis may interact with certain dimensions of the suicidal process. However, it is time to innovate. Several suicide prevention tools all have their place in new modes of care and should be tested on a large scale.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.05.001,20200601.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
267,Psychopathological consequences of confinement,"Les effets psychologiques de l’isolement ont déjà été décrits dans la littérature (expéditions polaires, sous-marins, prison). Néanmoins, l’échelle du confinement mis en œuvre à l’occasion de la pandémie à COVID-19 est inédite. Il nous faut non seulement relire les études publiées, mais aussi anticiper les problèmes psychologiques qui pourraient survenir pendant ou à distance du confinement. Nous avons fait le choix d’aller au-delà de la littérature COVID-19 pour examiner les implications des conséquences connues du confinement : l’ennui, l’isolement social, le stress, le manque de sommeil. L’anxiété, le trouble de stress post-traumatique, la dépression et les conduites suicidaires, les conduites addictives, les violences domestiques sont des effets décrits du confinement, mais les mécanismes d’émergence de ces troubles et leurs interrelations restent à étudier. Par exemple, quels sont les mécanismes d’émergence du trouble de stress post-traumatique dans le cadre du confinement ? Nous rappelons aussi les points de vigilance à garder sur des conséquences telles que les troubles des conduites alimentaires, les hallucinations, curieusement ignorées dans la littérature sur le confinement, alors qu’une vaste littérature fait le lien entre isolement social et hallucinations. Du fait de conséquences psychopathologiques larges, il nous faut partir à la recherche des différents symptômes pour permettre leur prise en charge. Nous résumons rapidement les approches diagnostiques et thérapeutiques déjà mises en place, comme la télémédecine, qui connaît un développement rapide à l’occasion de la crise du COVID-19. The psychological effects of isolation have already been described in the literature (polar expeditions, submarines, prison). Nevertheless, the scale of confinement implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented. In addition to reviewing the published studies, we need to anticipate the psychological problems that could arise during or at a distance from confinement. We have gone beyond the COVID-19 literature in order to examine the implications of the known consequences of confinement, like boredom, social isolation, stress, or sleep deprivation. Anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, suicidal or addictive behaviours, domestic violence are described effects of confinement, but the mechanisms of emergence of these disorders and their interrelationships remain to be studied. For example, what are the mechanisms of emergence of post-traumatic stress disorders in the context of confinement? We also remind the reader of points of vigilance to be kept in mind with regard to eating disorders and hallucinations. Hallucinations are curiously ignored in the literature on confinement, whereas a vast literature links social isolation and hallucinations. Due to the broad psychopathological consequences, we have to look for these various symptoms to manage them. We quickly summarize the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches already in place, such as telemedicine, which is undergoing rapid development during the COVID-19 crisis.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.007,20200601.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
268,Mental health care in French correctional facilities during the Covid-19 pandemic,"Objectif En France, les mesures de confinement ont été accompagnées de dispositions spécifiques pour les prisons : suspension des activités, parloirs et interventions extérieures. Plus de dix mille personnes détenues ont en outre été libérées pour diminuer le taux d’occupation des établissements et limiter la propagation du virus. L’objectif de cet article est de décrire la réorganisation des soins psychiatriques en milieu pénitentiaire en contexte de pandémie de Covid-19 et d’interroger les conséquences du confinement et des libérations anticipées sur la santé mentale des personnes détenues. Méthode Ce travail s’appuie sur une enquête menée en avril 2020 auprès des soignants de 42 unités sanitaires en milieu pénitentiaire et des 9 unités hospitalières spécialement aménagées en France. Une synthèse de la littérature internationale sur la question des soins psychiatriques en milieu pénitentiaire durant l’épidémie de Covid-19 a également été réalisée. Résultats L’épidémie de Covid-19 semble avoir été plutôt contenue dans les prisons françaises au cours de la période de confinement mais le poids des mesures mises en place sur la population carcérale est important. Les 3 niveaux de soins psychiatriques en milieu pénitentiaire ont instauré des mesures spécifiques pour assurer la continuité des soins, accompagner les personnes incarcérées et contenir l’épidémie. Parmi les plus importantes, on note la restriction des consultations, la création de « secteurs Covid », la déprogrammation des hospitalisations non urgentes, le renforcement des mesures d’hygiène et le remaniement des effectifs. Actuellement, les soignants sont principalement confrontés à des sevrages forcés, des symptomatologies anxieuses et des décompensations de troubles psychiatriques chroniques. Certaines libérations anticipées sont aussi très préoccupantes, pouvant entraîner des ruptures de soins, par manque de préparation des relais de prise en charge. Discussion Les remaniements en lien avec le confinement donnent une visibilité accrue au fossé qui sépare la psychiatrie en milieu libre de la psychiatrie en milieu pénitentiaire. Il nous apparaît important de rappeler la vulnérabilité des personnes incarcérées qui doivent impérativement être considérées dans les politiques de santé publique. Objective The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the 11 million people currently incarcerated worldwide is the subject of many concerns. Prisons and jails are filled with people suffering from many preexisting medical conditions increasing the risk of complications. Detainees’ access to medical services is already limited and overcrowding poses a threat of massive contagion. Beyond the health impact of the crisis, the tightening of prison conditions worries. On March 16, 2020, in France, the lockdown measures have been accompanied by specific provisions for prisons: all facilities have suspended visitations, group activities and external interventions. Over 10,000 prisoners have been released to reduce the prison population and the risk of virus propagation. These adjustments had major consequences on the healthcare system in French prisons. The objectives of this article are to describe the reorganization of the three levels of psychiatric care for inmates in France in the context of Covid-19 pandemic and to have a look at the impact of lockdown measures and early releases on mental health of prisoners. Methods This work is based on a survey conducted in April 2020 in France among psychiatric healthcare providers working in 42 ambulatory units for inmates and in the 9 full-time inpatient psychiatric wards exclusively for inmates called “UHSAs” (which stands for “unités hospitalières spécialement aménagées”, and can be translated as “specially equipped hospital units”). A review of the international literature on mental healthcare system for inmates during the Covid-19 epidemic has also been performed. Results The Covid-19 epidemic has been rather contained during the period of confinement in French prisons but the impact of confinement measures on the prison population is significant. The three levels of psychiatric care for inmates have implemented specific measures to ensure continuity of care, to support detainees during Coronavirus lockdown and to prevent an infection's spread. Among the most important are: limitation of medical consultations to serious and urgent cases, creation of “Covid units”, cancellation of voluntary psychiatric hospitalizations, reinforcement of preventive hygiene measures and reshuffling of medical staff. Prolonged confinement has consequences on mental health of detainees. Currently, mental health workers are facing multiple clinical situations such as forced drug and substance withdrawal (linked to difficulties in supplying psychoactive substances), symptoms of anxiety (due to concerns for their own and their relatives’ well-being) and decompensation among patients with severe psychiatric conditions. Early releases from prison may also raise some issues. People recently released from prison are identified as at high risk of death by suicide and drug overdose. The lack of time to provide the necessary link between health services within prisons and health structures outside could have serious consequences, emphasizing the well-known “revolving prison doors” effect. Discussion The current lockdown measures applied in French jails and prisons point out the disparities between psychiatric care for inmates and psychiatric care for general population. Giving the high vulnerability of prison population, public health authorities should pay more attention to health care in prisons.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.05.002,20200601.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

L’objectif de cet article est de proposer des éléments de guidance pour réorganiser les soins psychiatriques dans le contexte de pandémie Covid-19. Méthode Les auteurs ont réalisé une synthèse de la littérature internationale combinée au partage des expériences locales françaises. Résultats Les patients souffrant de troubles psychiques semblent particulièrement vulnérables à ce virus et à la pandémie : vulnérabilités liées aux comorbidités médicales, à l’âge, aux troubles cognitifs qui peuvent entraver le respect des consignes de confinement et aux complications psychosociales. Plusieurs initiatives ont été prises pour assurer la continuité des soins et contenir l’épidémie : création en psychiatrie d’unité Covid+ co-supervisée par des médecins généralistes ou internistes, restriction des consultations aux cas sévères et redéploiement des soins en téléconsultation, accompagnement de type case-management pour les sorties précoces ou l’impossibilité d’hospitaliser, accompagnements spécifiques pour les complications psychiques du confinement. Les populations suivies en pédopsychiatrie, en psychiatrie du sujet âgé, en addictologie ou détenues en prison doivent bénéficier d’une attention particulière. Plusieurs questions restent en suspend : la question de l’interaction négative ou positive des traitements sur l’infection SARS-CoV-2, l’épidémiologie de l’infection chez les personnes souffrant de troubles psychiques, leur adaptation à un confinement long. Discussion Une prise de conscience par les décideurs politiques de la grande vulnérabilité de ces populations et des institutions psychiatriques dans cette situation de catastrophe sanitaire est urgente. Objective The lack of ressources and coordination to face the epidemic of coronavirus raises concerns for the health of patients with mental disorders in a country where we keep in memory the dramatic experience of famine in psychiatric hospitals during the Second World War. This article aims at proposing guidance to ensure mental health care during the SARS-CoV epidemy in France. Methods Authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature and local initiatives in France. Results We identified four types of major vulnerabilities in patients suffering from mental disorders during this pandemic: (1) medical comorbidities that are more frequently found in patients suffering from mental disorders (cardiovascular and pulmonary pathologies, diabetes, obesity, etc.) which represent risk factors for severe infections with Covid-19; (2) age (the elderly constituting the population most vulnerable to coronavirus); (3) cognitive and behavioral troubles which can hamper compliance with confinement and hygiene measures and finally and (4) psychosocial vulnerability due to stigmatization and/or socio-economic difficulties. Furthermore, the mental health healthcare system is more vulnerable than other healthcare systems. Current government plans are poorly adapted to psychiatric establishments in a context of major shortage of organizational, material and human resources. In addition, a certain number of structural aspects make the psychiatric institution particularly vulnerable: many beds are closed, wards have a high density of patients, mental health community facilities are closed, medical teams are understaffed and poorly trained to face infectious diseases. We could also face major issues in referring patients with acute mental disorders to intensive care units. To maintain continuity of psychiatric care in this pandemic situation, several directions can be considered, in particular with the creation of Covid+ units. These units are under the dual supervision of a psychiatrist and of an internist/infectious disease specialist; all new entrants should be placed in quarantine for 14 days; the nurse staff should benefit from specific training, from daily medical check-ups and from close psychological support. Family visits would be prohibited and replaced by videoconference. At the end of hospitalization, in particular for the population of patients in compulsory ambulatory care situations, specific case-management should be organized with the possibility of home visits, in order to support them when they get back home and to help them to cope with the experience of confinement, which is at risk to induce recurrences of mental disorders. The total or partial closure of mental health community facilities is particularly disturbing for patients but a regular follow-up is possible with telemedicine and should include the monitoring of the suicide risk and psychoeducation strategies; developing support platforms could also be very helpful in this context. Private psychiatrists have also a crucial role of information with their patients on confinement and barrier measures, but also on measures to prevent the psychological risks inherent to confinement: maintenance of sleep regularity, physical exercise, social interactions, stress management and coping strategies, prevention of addictions, etc. They should also be trained to prevent, detect and treat early warning symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, because their prevalence was high in the regions of China most affected by the pandemic.

275,Immunopsychiatry and SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: Links and possible consequences,"Objectif La pandémie de SARS-CoV-2 (ou COVID-19) se propage depuis décembre 2019, et a été, comme attendu, accompagnée d’une augmentation drastique de la prévalence des troubles anxieux et dépressifs dans la population générale. Les traumatismes psychologiques peuvent bien sûr, expliquer une partie de ces troubles. Cependant, dans la mesure où les troubles psychiatriques sont également associés à une composante immuno-inflammatoire, les effets directs du virus sur le système immunitaire de l’hôte, avec une réponse inflammatoire marquée, mais également l’inflammation secondaire à ces facteurs de stress psychosociaux, peuvent entraîner l’apparition ou l’aggravation de pathologies psychiatriques. Cet article vise donc à identifier les possibles conséquences immuno-psychiatriques de la pandémie de SARS-CoV-2 qui pourraient être utiles en termes de dépistage et/ou de prise en charge. Méthode Nous nous sommes appuyés sur les données issues des précédentes pandémies et les données existantes à ce jour sur les conséquences psychopathologiques de la pandémie de SARS-CoV-2, pour réaliser une revue de la littérature narrative sur les possibles conséquences immuno-psychiatriques de la pandémie de SARS-CoV-2. Nous avons ciblé l’environnement gestationnel en raison des risques de troubles neuro-développementaux pour le fœtus, d’une part, et les enfants et adultes directement infectés avec les risques de développer des troubles psychiatriques, d’autre part. Résultats Comme durant les précédentes pandémies, l’activation du système immunitaire due au stress et/ou à l’infection pendant la grossesse pourrait conduire à un risque accru de troubles du neuro-développement chez le fœtus (schizophrénie et troubles du spectre de l’autisme). De plus, chez les individus exposés à des traumatismes psychologiques et/ou infectés par le virus, le risque de troubles psychiatriques, notamment de troubles de l’humeur, est probable. Conclusion Dans ce contexte, des mesures de dépistage et de prise en charge dédiées sont indispensables. Il est, de fait, important de proposer aux individus ayant été infectés par le virus, un suivi rapproché afin de mettre en place une prise en charge la plus précoce possible. De même chez les femmes enceintes, le dépistage de troubles de l’humeur pendant la grossesse ou en post-partum doit être facilité. Le suivi des bébés nés pendant la période pandémique doit être renforcé afin de dépister et de prendre en charge d’éventuels troubles du neuro-développement. Objective The SARS-CoV-2 (or COVID-19) pandemic has been propagating since December 2019, inducing a drastic increase in the prevalence of anxious and depressive disorders in the general population. Psychological trauma can partly explain these disorders. However, since psychiatric disorders also have an immuno-inflammatory component, the direct effects of the virus on the host's immune system, with a marked inflammatory response, but also the secondary inflammation to these psychosocial stressors, may cause the apparition or the worsening of psychiatric disorders. We describe here the probable immunopsychiatric consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, to delineate possible screening actions and care that could be planned. Method Data from previous pandemics, and existing data on the psychopathological consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, allowed us to review the possible immunopsychiatric consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, on the gestational environment, with the risk of consecutive neurodevelopmental disorders for the fetus on one hand, on the children and adults directly infected being at increased risks of psychiatric disorders on the other hand. Results As in previous pandemics, the activation of the immune system due to psychological stress and/or to infection during pregnancy, might lead to an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders for the fetus (schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders). Furthermore, in individuals exposed to psychological trauma and/or infected by the virus, the risk of psychiatric disorders, especially mood disorders, is probably increased. Conclusion In this context, preventive measures and specialized care are necessary. Thus, it is important to propose a close follow-up to the individuals who have been infected by the virus, in order to set up the earliest care possible. Likewise, in pregnant women, screening of mood disorders during the pregnancy or the postpartum period must be facilitated. The follow-up of the babies born during the pandemic must be strengthened to screen and care for possible neurodevelopmental disorders.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.07.002,20200101.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

278,Prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in the pediatric population from the family and community perspective,"Partiendo del informe sobre la situación de la COVID-19 en España, del 3 de abril del 2020, los casos confirmados ascienden a 117.710, de los que 343 tienen una edad inferior a 14 años (< 1%). Es fundamental conocer la especificidad de este proceso en la población infantil, así como las recomendaciones específicas para una adecuada prevención y cuidado de los niños durante la pandemia por la COVID-19. Este artículo tiene como objetivo analizar la evidencia científica sobre las recomendaciones específicas para la atención pediátrica en casos de COVID-19 desde el ámbito familiar y comunitario. Se han seleccionado y analizado las principales recomendaciones y medidas preventivas en los entornos de Atención Primaria de salud y el domicilio desde un enfoque integrador dónde se incluyen los aspectos biopsicosociales del niño durante el confinamiento. La importancia de los cuidados de la infancia frente a la enfermedad radican sobre todo en asegurar las correctas medidas de prevención del contagio por la condición de actuar como posibles portadores durante un período de incubación de hasta 21 días. La recomendación es que los niños participen activamente en las acciones preventivas habituales para la contención de la expansión de la enfermedad. A nivel domiciliario, el aislamiento supone un importante reto para las familias donde se presentan manifestaciones de incertidumbre, miedo e indefensión ante los cambios y entre las recomendaciones se encuentran establecer rutinas orden mediante horarios de actividades y ocio unido a las medidas de higiene. Dada la rapidez con la que se ha producido la pandemia por SARS-CoV-2, existen pocas evidencias del impacto en niños en España por el momento. Es necesario desarrollar estudios específicos sobre prevención y tratamiento en la edad pediátrica para mejorar las recomendaciones disponibles. Based on the report on the situation of COVID-19 in Spain, dated April 3, 2020, the confirmed cases amount to 117,710, of which 343 are under 14 years of age (< 1%). It is essential to know the specificity of this process in the child population, as well the specific recommendations for proper prevention and care of children during the COVID-19 pandemic. The paper aim is to analyze the scientific evidence on the specific recommendations for pediatric care in cases of COVID-19 from the family and community settings. The main recommendations and preventive measures in primary health care settings and at home have been selected and analyzed from an integrative approach that includes the biopsychosocial aspects of the child during confinement. The importance of caring for children in the face of the disease lies above all in ensuring the correct measures for the prevention of contagion due to the condition of acting as possible carriers during an incubation period of up to 21 days. The recommendation is that children actively participate in routine preventive actions to contain the spread of the disease. At the household level, isolation is an important challenge for families where there are manifestations of uncertainty, fear and helplessness in the face of changes and among the recommendations are establishing routines and order through schedules of activities and leisure together with hygiene measures. Given the rapidity with which the COVID-19 pandemic has occurred, there is little evidence at the moment. Research on prevention and treatment in the pediatric age needs to be developed to improve the available recommendations.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enfcli.2020.05.005,20200101.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

Además, se recogieron otras variables descriptivas de la muestra que podrían estar relacionadas con estos niveles de sintomatología psicológica. Resultados Los resultados muestran que la pandemia de la COVID-19ha generado entre el personal sanitario síntomas de estrés, ansiedad, depresión e insomnio, con mayores niveles entre las mujeres y profesionales de más edad. Variables como haber estado en contacto con el virus o el miedo en el trabajo desencadenaron una mayor sintomatología. Conclusiones En esta situación crítica, el colectivo de profesionales se sitúa en primera línea, por lo que está expuesto directamente determinados riesgos y estresores.

Consecuentemente, se recomienda ofrecerles ayuda psicológica para reducir el impacto emocional del COVID-19 y asegurar así no solo su salud mental, sino también el adecuado cuidado que dispensan. Introduction After the outbreak of the COVID-19 was considered a global pandemic in March 2020, the state of alarm was declared in Spain. In this situation, health professionals are experiencing high levels of stress due to the overload of work the pandemic is generating and the conditions in which they are working. The aim of this study was to evaluate the factors that can destabilize the mental health of these professionals in our context. Materials and methods The sample was composed of 421 health professionals. The data were gathered by an online questionnaire sent to them by e-mail. The DASS-21 was used to assess anxiety, stress and depression, and the EAI to measure sleep difficulties. In addition, other descriptive variables that could be related to psychological symptomatology were collected from the sample. Results The results show that the COVID-19 pandemic has generated symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression and insomnia among health workers, with higher levels among women and older professionals. Some factors such as having been in contact with the virus or fear at work, triggered greater symptomatology. Conclusions In this critical situation, professionals are in the front line and therefore, are directly exposed to certain risks and stressors. This contributes to the development of diverse psychological symptoms. Consequently, it is recommended to offer them psychological help in order to reduce the emotional impact of the COVID-19, and thus, to ensure not only the mental health of our health professionals, but also the adequate care they provide.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rpsm.2020.05.004,20200101.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

286,"48th SME North American manufacturing research conference, NAMRC 48 (Cancelled due to COVID-19) influence of 3D topography on tribological behavior of grinding wheel","Grinding is extensively used as surface generation process in finishing operations, which makes it imperative that the generated surface adheres closely to strict quality check norms failing which the component will be rejected incurring a loss to the industry. To ensure the intended surface quality falls within tolerances, the grinding wheel plays an important role as an abrasive tool. The finished surface is a direct outcome of grinding wheel topography and its various microscopic interactions with the surface creating a compelling need for in-depth understanding. Study and characterization of grinding wheel topography in the present paper aim to understand the behavior of forces in the contact area. Due to stochastic abrasive grain distribution and quasi-static surface wear, 3-dimensional parameters hold a better physical significance in explaining the nature of microscopic interactions and their impact on the behavior of forces. Experiments are performed in a manner to wear out grinding wheels of the same specification with varying number of passes in an attempt to highlight the influence of varying topography on tribological interactions in the grind zone. The variation in topography at a specific interval of time is captured using a confocal laser scanning microscope and further processed for surface characterization whereas forces are captured using a dynamometer. SEM micrographs are presented to understand the type of wear on the wheel surface. The outcome of present paper enables to understand and report the surface interactions quantified in terms of cutting, ploughing and rubbing whereas surface parameters are characterized as per ISO 25178. The reasoning behind variations during surface interactions was discussed and interpretations were reported.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.080,20200101.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

Aims: We investigated the impact of suicidal ideation on COVID-19 preventive behaviors to augment literature focused on suicide risk factors and COVID-19 preventive health measures. Significant findings may reveal factors that explain dangerous behavior and inspire policy to mitigate negative health outcomes. Method: This study used a prospective observational longitudinal design (n = 6683). A baseline survey (January 24, 2020 = before COVID-19 pandemic, T1) and a follow-up survey (between April 27 and April 30, 2020 = during COVID-19 pandemic, T2) were conducted among the general adult population in Japan. Results: Adjusted for demographic and socioeconomic factors, high suicidal ideation at T1 was associated with significantly low levels of engagement in COVID-19 preventive behaviors at T2. Limitations: As this was an Internet survey and contained selection bias, the sample may not be representative of the general population in Japan. Pandemic severity may impact results in other geographies, reducing the applicability of study findings.

The purpose of this study was to examine the rates of mental health problems and substance use, and to assess which COVID-19 related stressors were predictors of mental health and substance use in a large Canadian sample of adolescents, with comparisons across genders. Method: Participants (N = 809, Mage = 15.67, SD = 1.37) identified as a girl (56.2%), boy (38.7%), or trans/non-binary individual (TNBI; 5.1%) and were recruited via social media to complete an online survey. Results: A high proportion of adolescents met clinical cut-offs for depression (51%), anxiety (39%), and post-traumatic stress disorder (45%). Other mental health problems ranged from 9%-20%. Adolescents were mainly concerned with the health of family members and vulnerable populations, as well as the increased family stress at home during COVID-19. Rates of substance use were higher than expected, with over 50% of youth engaging in some form of substance use in the past 90 days, and almost 20% engaging in substance use at least once a week. TNBI and girls reported higher rates of mental health problems compared to boys. Family stress due to confinement and violence at home predicted higher rates of mental health, but not substance use problems.

Adapted from Ho, Kwong-Lo, Mak, and Wong’s (2005) SARS-related fear scale, the Contagion Fear and Threat Scale (CFTS) was rapidly adapted to capture the experience of COVID-19 pandemic-related fear. The factor structure and validity of the 6-item scale were established among Australian (n=155), Indian (n=111), and Nepali (n=148) university students studying in Australia in May-June 2020. Factor analysis revealed two 3-item factors in the Australian student sample: Fear of Infection and Existential Threat. These factors were confirmed in the Indian and Nepali student samples and mirror those found by the Ho et al. (2005) in their original instrument. The convergent and discriminant validity of the full CFTS, Fear of Infection, and Existential Threat scales are indicated via correlations with established measures of depression, anxiety, stress, subjective wellbeing, and religiosity.

Our survey (n = 1599) included questions about concerns, social behaviour, perceived change in relationship quality, social media use, frequency of exercise, physical health, and mental health during COVID-19 lockdown. When estimating their mental health for the previous year 13% of participants reported more negative than positive emotion, whereas this increased to 41% when participants reflected on their time during COVID-19 lockdown. A substantial proportion (39-54%) of participants reported deterioration in mental health, physical health, financial situation, and work productivity. However, most of these participants reported 'somewhat' rather than 'a lot' of deterioration, and many others reported 'no change' (40-50%) or even 'improvement' (6-17%). Therefore, the psychological toll on Australians may not have been as large as other parts of the world with greater COVID-19 infection rates. Even less impact was apparent for social relationships (~68% reported 'no change') as participants compensated for decreased face-to-face interaction via increased technology-mediated interaction.

291,ANXIETY INCREASES THE WILLINGNESS TO BE EXPOSED TO COVID-19 RISK AMONG YOUNG ADULTS IN FRANCE,"The COVID-19 outbreak has generated significant uncertainty about the future, especially for young adults. Health and economic threats, as well as more diffuse concerns about the consequences of COVID-19, can trigger feelings of anxiety, leading individuals to adopt uncertainty-reducing behaviours. We tested whether anxiety was associated with an increase in willingness to be exposed to the risk of COVID-19 infection (WiRE) using an online survey administered to 3,110 French individuals aged between 18 and 35 years old during the lockdown period (April 2020). Overall, 56.5% of the sample declared a positive WiRE. Unemployment was associated with a higher WiRE (+8.2 percentage points (pp); 95% CI +0.9-15.4 pp). One standard deviation increases in income (+1160€) and psychological state anxiety raised the WiRE by +2.7 pp (95% CI: +1.1-4.4 pp) and +3.9 pp (95% CI: +1.6-6.2 pp), respectively. A one standard deviation increase in perceived hospitalisation risk was associated with a -4.1 pp (95% CI: -6.2-2.1 pp) decrease in the WiRE. Overall, our results suggest that both the prospect of economic losses and psychological anxiety can undermine young adults’ adherence to physical distancing recommendations. Public policies targeting young adults must consider both their economic situation and their mental health, and they must use uncertainty-reducing communication strategies.",Fabrice Etilé et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46097-1C5-45A,20201110.0,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Biases, Framing, and Heuristics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Judgment and Decision Making; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; self-protection effort; social values; risk exposure; covid-19; anxiety; contamination",PsyArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
292,"Resilience of Adolescents, Though Weakened DuringPandemic-Related Quarantine, Serves as a Protective Process Against Depression and Sleep Problems","Adolescents facing adversities are susceptible to depression and sleep problems. Resilience is an important protective mechanism for coping with difficulties. During the COVID-19 pandemic, adolescents faced multiple hardships including being pulled from their schools and being unable to socialize with friends. Yet, it is unclear whether adolescents’ resiliency weakened during the global crisis or if the protective power of resilience is maintained under such circumstances. Here, in a partially longitudinal study, we demonstrate that Chinese adolescents’ resilience weakened during the pandemic-related quarantine compared to before the pandemic. However, resilience protected against depression and sleep problems for adolescents. A mediation model showed that higher resilience was associated with fewer depressive symptoms, which in turn reduced sleep problems. Moreover, social support moderated this mediation. Our findings suggest that, though the resilience of adolescents weakened during the pandemic-related quarantine, it still serves as a protective process helping adolescents cope with adversities such as depression and sleep problems. Implications for clinical practice and future research are discussed.",Huangqi Jiang et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4616E-62D-4FE,20201109.0,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Educational Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; depression; adolescents; sleep problems; quarantine; social support; resilience,PsyArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
293,Mental health considerations in children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic: a literature review,"Introduction: The global pandemic of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has had a significant impact on the mental health of populations across the world. However, the scope of this impact on children and adolescents has not yet been fully assessed. Methods: A literature search of the PubMed database was conducted using the terms “COVID-19”, “nCoV-2”, “children”, “adolescents”, “anxiety”, “depression”, “attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder”, “ADHD”, “autism”, “autism spectrum disorder”, “mental health” and “psychiatry” in various permutations and combinations. A total of 23 articles of direct relevance were retrieved, including four observational studies. Results: Emotional disturbances were noted in substantial numbers of children. In younger children (aged 3-6 years), these were mainly non-specific, such as clinginess, fearfulness and irritability. In older children, symptoms of anxiety and depression were noted in 19-22%. Children with pre-existing disorders, such as ADHD, were at risk of symptom exacerbation. Other concerns flagged in the literature included an elevated risk of unhealthy lifestyle behaviours, an increased risk of child abuse or neglect, and the need for special care in children with neurodevelopmental disorders. The challenges of delivering mental health services in the context of social distancing measures were highlighted. Conclusion: Emotional and behavioural symptoms are a common reaction in children and adolescents, perhaps more so in children with additional risk factors. The management of these problems requires concerted cooperation between mental health professionals, families, and local authorities.",Ravi Philip Rajkumar,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461BC-DF3-14C,20200624.0,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; anxiety; covid-19; adolescents; attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder; depression; autism; children,PsyArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
294,Traumatic Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic in an International Sample: Contribution of Fatalism to Psychological Distress and Behavior Change,"This study aimed to assess the traumatic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and to explore the contribution of fatalism to a) psychological distress and b) pandemic-related behavior change. Data for the study were collected via an anonymous online survey. The survey included questions about demographic characteristics, health status, pandemic-related stress, impact of COVID-19 on health and behavior, posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), and fatalism. The sample included 465 participants from 30 countries (mean age = 36.87, SD = 13.39, age range = 18 – 76; 80% female). While none of the study participants have been diagnosed with COVID-19, almost 25% knew someone who had received the diagnosis. The overwhelming majority (79%) had to make changes to their daily routine, and 48.82% of the sample reported moderate to severe PTSS. Fatalism was found to be a statistically significant predictor of PTSS in a multiple regression model and was also associated with lack of behavior changes in response to the pandemic. Our findings indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic is a traumatic event with a potential to affect mental health and well-being of individuals and communities. Fatalism may contribute to severity of psychological distress and diminish individuals’ ability to engage in health-protective behaviors.",Olga Bogolyubova et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4615A-020-15D,20200818.0,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; coronavirus; covid-19; traumatic stress; mental health; ptss; health behavior; posttraumatic stress symptoms; fatalism,PsyArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

Two participants with major depressive disorders were included in an 30-day observational ecological momentary assessment study just before the lockdown in Montreal, Canada. In both cases, the self-reported depressive symptoms and core affects fluctuated during the lowckdown. However, all depressive symptoms were not systematically exacerbated. Among them, significant linear and no-linear temporal patterns have been identified. For case-1, the poor sleep quality and deteriorated sleep parameters were not worsen during the lockdown. The psychomotor retardation and level of arousal played a prominent role in the idiographic dynamic symptom networks. These case studies allow a granular understanding of the lockdown effects on depressive symptoms and affective experiences dynamics, and highlight the need of person-centered mental health care to help people with major depressive disorder.",Paquito Bernard et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46114-B73-F26,20200714.0,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; depressive symptoms; insomnia; covid-19; sleep; idiographic,PsyArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
296,The Psychological Impact of Threat & Lockdown During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Objectives This study aimed to investigate the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health, particularly the effects of perceived threat and lockdown measures, and to elucidate individual and social factors exacerbating or mitigating its negative effects, particularly sense of control. Design An online survey was designed including questions about psychological wellbeing, lockdown behaviours, and perceived COVID-19 threat, risk, and knowledge. Methods Individuals (N=8,229; 39.4% male, 59.4% female, 1.1% other, Mage=38.3, SD=13.5, range = 18-88) were recruited in 79 countries via the snowballing method and social media, and completed the survey in March-April 2020. Results Participant showed elevated levels of anxiety and depression during early stages of lockdown, predicted by perceived threat. Feelings of social isolation moderated the effect of threat on depression symptoms, and increased with the duration of quarantine, but was mitigated by frequent communication with close others. Sense of control was predicted negatively by maladaptive coping, but positively by adaptive coping and the perception that the government is dealing with the outbreak. Individual actions to avoid contracting the virus were associated with higher anxiety, except when done professionally by essential workers. Conclusions We suggest that the psychological detrimental effects of the pandemic – following perceived threat and lockdown measures – can be alleviated by individual actions such as maintaining frequent social contact and adaptive coping, and by governmental actions which demonstrate support in a public health crisis. Citizens and governments can work together to adapt better to restrictive but necessary measures during the current and future pandemics.",Valerie Van Mulukom et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4617A-B65-F7C,20200722.0,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; coronavirus; government; sense of control; psychological well-being; lockdown; quarantine; anxiety; covid-19; survey; psychology; social isolation; depression; mental health,PsyArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
297,“My Husband Thinks I’m Crazy”: COVID-19-Related Conflict in Couples with Young Children,"Objective: We examine how disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic are creating conflicts for couples with young children. Background: National polls suggest that COVID-19 has led to increased conflict for couples in the U.S. Although scholars have not examined the source of these new conflicts, pre-pandemic research suggests that pandemic-related disruptions may create conflicts around paid work and parenting, economic security, politics, and health decision-making. Method: This study uses the Pandemic Parenting Study, a mixed-methods study of Southern Indiana mothers, conducted April-May 2020, and involving surveys (N=139), diary entries (N=104), and in-depth interviews (N=65). We examine mothers’ reports of pandemic-related changes in their frustrations with their partners and how those changes vary with the disruptions couples have experienced during the pandemic. We then use qualitative data to understand how pandemic-related disruptions are generating conflicts for couples and what consequences those conflicts have. Results: A substantial minority of mothers (39%) report pandemic-related increases in their frustrations with their partners. These frustrations are particularly common among mothers whose partners are (reportedly) providing insufficient support with pandemic parenting or dismissing mothers’ concerns about COVID-19. Mothers blame themselves for these conflicts and feel responsible for reducing them, including by leaving the workforce, beginning use of antidepressants, or ignoring their own concerns about COVID-19. Conclusion: The pandemic has exacerbated longstanding sources of conflict (related to partners’ insufficient support with parenting) and created new sources of conflict (related to partners’ dismissals of mothers’ concerns about COVID-19), with serious implications for mothers, families, and public health.",Jessica Mccrory Calarco et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46176-680-C96,20201009.0,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family; relationships; work-family; family; conflict; health; decision-making; covid-19; parenthood,SocArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
298,How Does COVID-19 impact Students with Disabilities/Health Concerns?,"The impact of COVID-19 on students has been enormous, with an increase in worries about fiscal and physical health, a rapid shift to online learning, and increased isolation. In addition to these changes, students with disabilities/health concerns may face accessibility problems with online learning or communication tools, and their stress may be compounded by additional risks such as financial stress or pre-existing conditions. To our knowledge, no one has looked specifically at the impact of COVID-19 on students with disabilities/health concerns. In this paper, we present data from a survey of 147 students with and without disabilities collected in late March to early April of 2020 to assess the impact of COVID-19 on these students' education and mental health. Our findings show that students with disabilities/health concerns were more concerned about classes going online than their peers without disabilities. In addition, students with disabilities/health concerns also reported that they have experienced more COVID-19 related adversities compared to their peers without disabilities/health concerns. We argue that students with disabilities/health concerns in higher education need confidence in the accessibility of the online learning tools that are becoming increasingly prevalent in higher education not only because of COVID-19 but also more generally. In addition, educational technologies will be more accessible if they consider the learning context, and are designed to provide a supportive, calm, and connecting learning environment.","Zhang, Han; Nurius, Paula; Sefidgar, Yasaman; Morris, Margaret; Balasubramanian, Sreenithi; Brown, Jennifer; Dey, Anind K.; Kuehn, Kevin; Riskin, Eve; Xu, Xuhai; Mankoff, Jen",https://doi.org/nan,20200511.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
299,"Robot art, in the eye of the beholder?: Personalization through self-disclosure facilitates visual communication of emotions in representational art","Socially assistive robots could help to support people's well-being in contexts such as art therapy where human therapists are scarce, by making art such as paintings together with people in a way that is emotionally contingent and creative. However, current art-making robots are typically either contingent, controlled as a tool by a human artist, or creative, programmed to paint independently, possibly because some complex and idiosyncratic concepts related to art, such as emotion and creativity, are not yet well understood. For example, the role of personalized taste in forming beauty evaluations has been studied in empirical aesthetics, but how to generate art that appears to an individual to express certain emotions such as happiness or sadness is less clear. In the current article, a collaborative prototyping/Wizard of Oz approach was used to explore generic robot art-making strategies and personalization of art via an open-ended emotion profile intended to identify tricky concepts. As a result of conducting an exploratory user study, participants indicated some preference for a robot art-making strategy involving""visual metaphors""to balance exogenous and endogenous components, and personalized representational sketches were reported to convey emotion more clearly than generic sketches. The article closes by discussing personalized abstract art as well as suggestions for richer art-making strategies and user models. Thus, the main conceptual advance of the current work lies in suggesting how an interactive robot can visually express emotions through personalized art; the general aim is that this could help to inform next steps in this promising area and facilitate technological acceptance of robots in everyday human environments.","Cooney, Martin",https://doi.org/nan,20200508.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

While lockdowns may help to contain the spread of the virus, it is possible that substantial damage to population well-being will result. This study relies on Google Trends data and tests whether the lockdowns implemented in Europe and America led to changes in well-being related topic search terms. Using different methods to evaluate the causal effects of lockdown, we find a substantial increase in the search intensity for boredom in Europe and the US. We also found a significant increase in searches for loneliness, worry and sadness, while searches for stress, suicide and divorce on the contrary fell. Our results suggest that people's mental health may have been severely affected by the lockdown.","Brodeur, Abel; Clark, Andrew E.; Fleche, Sarah; Powdthavee, Nattavudh",https://doi.org/nan,20200425.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
301,A chatbot architecture for promoting youth resilience,"E-health technologies have the potential to provide scalable and accessible interventions for youth mental health. As part of a developing an ecosystem of e-screening and e-therapy tools for New Zealand young people, a dialog agent, Headstrong, has been designed to promote resilience with methods grounded in cognitive behavioral therapy and positive psychology. This paper describes the architecture underlying the chatbot. The architecture supports a range of over 20 activities delivered in a 4-week program by relatable personas. The architecture provides a visual authoring interface to its content management system. In addition to supporting the original adolescent resilience chatbot, the architecture has been reused to create a 3-week 'stress-detox' intervention for undergraduates, and subsequently for a chatbot to support young people with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, with all three systems having been used in field trials. The Headstrong architecture illustrates the feasibility of creating a domain-focused authoring environment in the context of e-therapy that supports non-technical expert input and rapid deployment.","Holt-Quick, Chester; Warren, Jim; Stasiak, Karolina; Williams, Ruth; Christie, Grant; Hetrick, Sarah; Hopkins, Sarah; Cargo, Tania; Merry, Sally",https://doi.org/nan,20200515.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
302,Visualising COVID-19 Research,"The world has seen in 2020 an unprecedented global outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, a new strain of coronavirus, causing the COVID-19 pandemic, and radically changing our lives and work conditions. Many scientists are working tirelessly to find a treatment and a possible vaccine. Furthermore, governments, scientific institutions and companies are acting quickly to make resources available, including funds and the opening of large-volume data repositories, to accelerate innovation and discovery aimed at solving this pandemic. In this paper, we develop a novel automated theme-based visualisation method, combining advanced data modelling of large corpora, information mapping and trend analysis, to provide a top-down and bottom-up browsing and search interface for quick discovery of topics and research resources. We apply this method on two recently released publications datasets (Dimensions' COVID-19 dataset and the Allen Institute for AI's CORD-19). The results reveal intriguing information including increased efforts in topics such as social distancing; cross-domain initiatives (e.g. mental health and education); evolving research in medical topics; and the unfolding trajectory of the virus in different territories through publications. The results also demonstrate the need to quickly and automatically enable search and browsing of large corpora. We believe our methodology will improve future large volume visualisation and discovery systems but also hope our visualisation interfaces will currently aid scientists, researchers, and the general public to tackle the numerous issues in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bras, Pierre Le; Gharavi, Azimeh; Robb, David A.; Vidal, Ana F.; Padilla, Stefano; Chantler, Mike J.",https://doi.org/nan,20200513.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

305,"Universal Masking is Urgent in the COVID-19 Pandemic: SEIR and Agent Based Models, Empirical Validation, Policy Recommendations","We present two models for the COVID-19 pandemic predicting the impact of universal face mask wearing upon the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus--one employing a stochastic dynamic network based compartmental SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) approach, and the other employing individual ABM (agent-based modelling) Monte Carlo simulation--indicating (1) significant impact under (near) universal masking when at least 80% of a population is wearing masks, versus minimal impact when only 50% or less of the population is wearing masks, and (2) significant impact when universal masking is adopted early, by Day 50 of a regional outbreak, versus minimal impact when universal masking is adopted late. These effects hold even at the lower filtering rates of homemade masks. To validate these theoretical models, we compare their predictions against a new empirical data set we have collected that includes whether regions have universal masking cultures or policies, their daily case growth rates, and their percentage reduction from peak daily case growth rates. Results show a near perfect correlation between early universal masking and successful suppression of daily case growth rates and/or reduction from peak daily case growth rates, as predicted by our theoretical simulations. Our theoretical and empirical results argue for urgent implementation of universal masking. As governments plan how to exit societal lockdowns, it is emerging as a key NPI; a""mouth-and-nose lockdown""is far more sustainable than a""full body lockdown"", on economic, social, and mental health axes. An interactive visualization of the ABM simulation is at http://dek.ai/masks4all. We recommend immediate mask wearing recommendations, official guidelines for correct use, and awareness campaigns to shift masking mindsets away from pure self-protection, towards aspirational goals of responsibly protecting one's community.","Kai, De; Goldstein, Guy-Philippe; Morgunov, Alexey; Nangalia, Vishal; Rotkirch, Anna",https://doi.org/nan,20200422.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

In particular, when individuals self-report their experiences over the course of the virus on social media, it can allow for identification of the emotions each stage of symptoms engenders in the patient. Posts to the Reddit forum r/COVID19Positive contain first-hand accounts from COVID-19 positive patients, giving insight into personal struggles with the virus. These posts often feature a temporal structure indicating the number of days after developing symptoms the text refers to. Using topic modelling and sentiment analysis, we quantify the change in discussion of COVID-19 throughout individuals' experiences for the first 14 days since symptom onset. Discourse on early symptoms such as fever, cough, and sore throat was concentrated towards the beginning of the posts, while language indicating breathing issues peaked around ten days. Some conversation around critical cases was also identified and appeared at a roughly constant rate. We identified two clear clusters of positive and negative emotions associated with the evolution of these symptoms and mapped their relationships. Our results provide a perspective on the patient experience of COVID-19 that complements other medical data streams and can potentially reveal when mental health issues might appear.","Murray, Curtis; Mitchell, Lewis; Tuke, Jonathan; Mackay, Mark",https://doi.org/nan,20200521.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08

311,What does social distancing mean for patients in forensic mental health settings?,"Governments across the globe have called for social distancing measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Secure settings will not be able to comply with these strictly, nor will they have the same recourse to the novel and creative solutions the general population does. Activities have been restricted in quality, quantity and scope; transfers and discharges have been halted and patient progress put on pause. Understanding how and what ways these restrictions will affect patients is crucial. This is especially salient given that large numbers of the general population have reported heightened mental health burden in recent surveys. However, it is not yet clear how and in what ways the COVID-19 restrictions will affect the mental health of patients in secure care. Past research investigating patients experiences of restrictions on autonomy in secure care that were present before the pandemic can be helpful here. Studies suggest that patient experience restrictions in care in myriad subjective ways. These include limitations on family contact, outside leave, and making hot drinks but also more profoundly on their autonomy, sense of self, and personhood. Quantitative studies have found correlations between experiences of restrictiveness and ward atmosphere, quality of life, suicidal ideation, depression and general psychological state in this patient group. This paper suggests how we can use past research exploring patient expereinces of restrictive interventions to guide the implementation of social distancing measures in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Tomlin, Dr Jack",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsiml.2020.100018,20200428.0,,Elsevier; PMC; WHO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
312,"Enfermement carcéral, confinement socio-sanitaire et moyens d’évasionDanser sa peine et au-delà…","Abstract Jail incarceration and social confinement due to a sanitary stay-at-home law against the ongoing covid-19 pandemic are compared through the introduction of dance workshops for imprisoned women charged with long sentences, then followed by an outside performance Soul Kitchen. The whole experience, organized by a famous contemporary choreographer Angelin Preljocaj, is filmed by Valérie Müller, producing Danser sa peine (To dance her sentence / her sorrow), nominated for an award. The sessions are planned: two hours and a half, 2 times a week, for four months, no technique required. A group of five women starts with ordinary easy functional movements, gaining in innovative and expressive qualities, spatial perceptions, feelings and interpersonal interactions, leaded by A. Preljocaj in a helpful and empathic mood. At the same time, he discovers the cooking authorization in their jail cell. The relevant results shift into a dynamic successful piece Soul Kitchen (2019) performed in town (Dance Festival in Montpellier, south of France) with dancing and cooking occurrences on stage. It makes sense, specially about self-esteem, body image and positive opinion from the audience. The women’s physical and psychological states linked with a long lack of space and sensitivity… move to a better self-balance and feelings of well-being. In a similar state of mind, the French confined population – youth to elderly–try to find different and imaginative strategies at home as moving in a restrictive area, enjoying family cooking… through trainings provided by Internet, looking for reducing anxiety, depressive disorders and other social problems. A panel of situations goes from deleterious conflictual relationships, dramatic isolation, to funny and positive ones using creativeness to escape, facing the disruption of daily life.","Vaysse, Jocelyne; Poli, Antonella",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2020.05.002,20200519.0,,Elsevier; PMC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
313,Panique et pandémie: revue de la littérature sur les liens entre le trouble panique et l'épidémie à SARS-CoV-2,"Résumé L’état de panique associé à la pandémie liée au SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) incite à s’interroger sur les troubles anxieux que cette situation pourrait générer ou aggraver. Si la littérature a déjà fourni des projections généralistes en la matière, les données concrètes concernent à ce stage davantage le trouble de stress post-traumatique et le trouble obsessionnel compulsif, tandis que quelques évaluations s’intéressent au cadre nosographie du trouble anxieux généralisé. Le trouble panique ne se voit que peu ou pas cité et l’évocation de la « panique », au sens social, la supplante largement. Bien que d’une légitimité clinique encore débattue, le trouble panique qualifié de « respiratoire » pourrait se voir augmenter en nombre et/ou être intensifié chez les patients qui en présentent déjà. D’éventuelles situations co-morbides entre un tel trouble et la COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) doivent inciter à certaines précautions en matière de prescriptions médicamenteuses, notamment en lien avec les traitements, ou situations, sources d’hypokaliémie : (i) le salbutamol, source potentielle de surconsommation, notamment chez les patients anxieux, (ii) l’infection par le SARS-CoV-2 et plus encore en cas de diarrhées et/ou vomissements. L’hypokaliémie est associée à un risque accru de torsade de pointe, il convient donc également d’être prudent en matière de prescription de psychotropes à risque : comme avec le citalopram et l’escitalopram, des antidépresseurs indiqués dans le trouble panique, ou encore l’hydroxyzine, à visée anxiolytique. Ces données sont de nature à resituer l’importance de la prise en considération du trouble panique dans le cadre de la pandémie en cours. Abstract Although the ‘panic’ word has been abundantly linked to the SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) pandemic in the press, in the scientific literature very few studies have considered whether the current epidemic could predispose to the onset or the aggravation of panic attacks or panic disorder. Indeed, most studies thus far have focused on the risk of increase and aggravation of other psychiatric disorders as a consequence of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Yet, risk of onset or aggravation of panic disorder, especially the subtype with prominent respiratory symptoms, which is characterized by a fear response conditioning to interoceptive sensations (e.g., respiratory), and hypervigilance to these interoceptive signals, could be expected in the current situation. Indeed, respiratory symptoms, such as coughs and dyspnea, are among the most commonly associated with the SARS-CoV-2 (59-82 % and 31-55 %, respectively), and respiratory symptoms are associated with a poor illness prognosis. Hence given that some etiological and maintenance factors associated with panic disorder – i.e., fear conditioning to abnormal breathing patterns attributable or not to the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), as well as hypervigilance towards breathing abnormalities – are supposedly more prevalent, one could expect an increased risk of panic disorder onset or aggravation following the COVID-19 epidemic in people who were affected by the virus, but also those who were not. In people with the comorbidity (i.e., panic disorder or panic attacks and the COVID-19), it is particularly important to be aware of the risk of hypokalemia in specific at-risk situations or prescriptions. For instance, in the case of salbutamol prescription, which might be overly used in patients with anxiety disorders and COVID-19, or in patients presenting with diarrhea and vomiting. Hypokalemia is associated with an increased risk of torsade de pointe, thus caution is required when prescribing specific psychotropic drugs, such as the antidepressants citalopram and escitalopram, which are first-line treatments for panic disorder, but also hydroxyzine, aiming at anxiety reduction. The results reviewed here highlight the importance of considering and further investigating the impact of the current pandemic on the diagnosis and treatment of panic disorder (alone or comorbid with the COVID-19).","Javelot, H; Weiner, L",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.05.010,20200521.0,,Elsevier; PMC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-01-08
