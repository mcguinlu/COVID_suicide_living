60,Mapping population mental health concerns related to COVID-19 and the consequences of physical distancing: A Google trends analysis,"Background: The 2020 Coronavirus pandemic is a major international public health challenge. Governments have taken public health protection measures to reduce the spread of the virus through non-pharmalogical measures. The impact of the pandemic and the public health response on individual and population mental health is unknown. Methods: We used Google Trends data (1 Jan 2020 - 30 Mar 2020) to investigate the impact of the pandemic and government measures to curb it on people's concerns, as indexed by changes in search frequency for topics indicating mental distress, social and economic stressors and mental health treatment-seeking. We explored the changes of key topics in Google trends in Italy, Spain, USA, UK, and Worldwide in relation to sentinel events during the pandemic. Results: Globally there appears to be significant concerns over the financial and work-related consequences of the pandemic, with some evidence that levels of fear are rising. Conversely relative searching for topics related to depression and suicide fell after the pandemic was announced, with some evidence that searches for the latter have risen recently. Concerns over education and access to medication appear to be particular social stressors. Whilst searches for face-to-face treatments have declined, those for self-care have risen. Conclusions: Monitoring Google trends shows promise as a means of tracking changing public concerns. In weeks to come it may enable policy makers to assess the impact of their interventions including those aiming to limit negative consequences, such as government funded financial safety nets.","Knipe, Duleeka; Evans, Hannah; Marchant, Amanda; Gunnell, David; John, Ann",https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15870.2,,Database: ELSEVIER; Publication details: Wellcome Open Res.;(5)2020.; Publication details: Wellcome Open Res.;(5)2020.; Publication type: article,WHO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-31

The interview focuses on the impact of remote working during the coronavirus epidemic, starting with the question of whether an effective therapeutic process can occur without physical co-presence. Isaacs Russell shares her immediate thoughts about the virtually overnight changes to our practice that came with the epidemic, and the work of the American Psychoanalytic Association's Covid-19 Advisory Team, on which she sits. Her responses are informed by recent cross-disciplinary and neuropsychological research on the digital age. She considers what happens to free association, evenly suspended attention and reverie when working by phone or online; the loss of the consulting room as a containing physical space for both clinician and patient; the relationship between place and time; and whether (and how) we can maintain a focus on transference and countertransference in the presence of the threat of death. The interview ends with her thoughts on whether we should assume that the landscape of analytic therapy will be permanently altered by Covid-19, and with her hope that general awareness of the impact of trauma on our mental health has been raised.","Isaacs Russell, Gillian",https://doi.org/10.1111/bjp.12581,,Database: ELSEVIER; Publication details: Br.

62,Perinatal depressive and anxiety symptoms of pregnant women during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in China,"BACKGROUND: On January 20, 2020, a new coronavirus epidemic with human-to-human transmission was officially declared by the Chinese government, which caused significant public panic in China. In light of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, pregnant women may be particularly vulnerable and in special need for preventive mental health strategies. Thus far, no reports exist to investigate the mental health response of pregnant women to the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak on the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms and the corresponding risk factors among pregnant women across China. STUDY DESIGN: A multicenter, cross-sectional study was initiated in early December 2019 to identify mental health concerns in pregnancy using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. This study provided a unique opportunity to compare the mental status of pregnant women before and after the declaration of the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic. A total of 4124 pregnant women during their third trimester from 25 hospitals in 10 provinces across China were examined in this cross-sectional study from January 1, 2020, to February 9, 2020. Of these women, 1285 were assessed after January 20, 2020, when the coronavirus epidemic was publicly declared and 2839 were assessed before this pivotal time point. The internationally recommended Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale was used to assess maternal depression and anxiety symptoms. Prevalence rates and risk factors were compared between the pre- and poststudy groups. RESULTS: Pregnant women assessed after the declaration of coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic had significantly higher rates of depressive symptoms (26.0% vs 29.6%, P=.02) than women assessed before the epidemic declaration. These women were also more likely to have thoughts of self-harm (P=.005). The depressive rates were positively associated with the number of newly confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (P=.003), suspected infections (P=.004), and deaths per day (P=.001). Pregnant women who were underweight before pregnancy, primiparous, younger than 35 years, employed full time, in middle income category, and had appropriate living space were at increased risk for developing depressive and anxiety symptoms during the outbreak. CONCLUSION: Major life-threatening public health events such as the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak may increase the risk for mental illness among pregnant women, including thoughts of self-harm. Strategies targeting maternal stress and isolation such as effective risk communication and the provision of psychological first aid may be particularly useful to prevent negative outcomes for women and their fetuses.","Wu, Yanting; Zhang, Chen; Liu, Han; Duan, Chenchi; Li, Cheng; Fan, Jianxia; Li, Hong; Chen, Lei; Xu, Hualin; Li, Xiangjuan; Guo, Yi; Wang, Yeping; Li, Xiufeng; Li, Jing; Zhang, Ting; You, Yiping; Li, Hongmei; Yang, Shuangqi; Tao, Xiaoling; Xu, Yajuan; Lao, Haihong; Wen, Ming; Zhou, Yan; Wang, Junying; Chen, Yuhua; Meng, Diyun; Zhai, Jingli; Ye, Youchun; Zhong, Qinwen; Yang, Xiuping; Zhang, Dan; Zhang, Jing; Wu, Xifeng; Chen, Wei; Dennis, Cindy-Lee; Huang, He-Feng",https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.05.009,,Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Am J Obstet Gynecol;2020 May 11.; Publication details: Am J Obstet Gynecol;2020 May 11.; Publication type: article,WHO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-31

64,Management of Agitation During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has radically altered delivery of care in emergency settings. Unprecedented hardship due to ongoing fears of exposure and threats to personal safety, along with societal measures enacted to curb disease transmission, have had broad psychosocial impact on patients and healthcare workers alike. These changes can significantly affect diagnosing and managing behavioral emergencies such as agitation in the emergency department. On behalf of the American Association for Emergency Psychiatry, we highlight unique considerations for patients with severe behavioral symptoms and staff members managing symptoms of agitation during COVID-19. Early detection and treatment of agitation, precautions to minimize staff hazards, coordination with security personnel and psychiatric services, and avoidance of coercive strategies that cause respiratory depression will help mitigate heightened risks to safety caused by this outbreak.","Wong, Roppolo, Chang, Yonkers, Wilson, Powsner, Rozel",https://doi.org/10.5811/westjem.2020.5.47789,20200729.0,,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-31

67,CoViD-19 and psychiatry: can mental illness justify further exceptions to the obligation to stay at home?,"To face the CoViD-19 pandemic, the italian government has approved regulations which state, with no exceptions, that it is considered offence for people tested positive to the virus to leave their house, whereas other people are allowed to leave their house for proven needs such as work, health or emergencies. The authors contextualize these regulations with European and international sets of principles, in the light of the characteristics that some psychiatric disorders can present. Evaluate if such European principles need to be implemented with further specific exceptions to the obligation to stay at home for some people with mental disorders. Prohibition to leave the house can aggravate mental disorders, resulting in the concrete risk of harmful actions, in particular in psychotic and bipolar patients, even with mild excitement, depressed patients, or in cases of delusional patients, resulting from uninterrupted cohabitation with emotionally significant family members. Even the health of subjects with anxiety pathologies, or with different forms of mental retardation can be prejudiced by forced permanence at home. From numerous provisions of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union there emerges that collective health must be balanced with individual health and with the dignity of the human person. As the European and international provisions are hierarchically above the national provisions, the latter should be interpreted so that the non-compliance to the obligation to stay at home: a) does not constitute offence for a person tested positive to the virus, if therapeutic treatments resulting in hospitalization are deemed necessary; b) it does not constitute administrative offence if the subject proves, based on clinical and factual documented evidence, that leaving the house is necessary to avoid recrudescence of mental disorder. In addition, for evaluation purposes, particular attention should be paid to the severity of psychiatric illness in the specific case. In order to distinguish suitable subjects from those not suitable for home isolation, the reference criterion cannot be the only diagnostic element, but it will be necessary to take into account above all the severity of the condition. In the absence of such a qualitative assessment, there would be a risk of unfounded infringements of the obligation to stay at home.","Montanari Vergallo, Bersani, Rinaldi",https://doi.org/10.1708/3417.34002,20200729.0,,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-31

However, epidemiological data on outbreak-associated depressive morbidity of female adolescents are not available. This study determines the incidence and correlates of depression among female adolescents aged 11-18â€‰years during the COVID-19 outbreak in mainland China. A large cross-sectional sample, nationwide online survey was conducted during the COVID-19 outbreak. Depression was assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), and the correlative factors of depression were analyzed. In this study, 4805 female adolescents were enrolled with a median (range) age of 15 (11-18) years. Of them, 1899 (39.5%) suffered from depression with a CES-D score of &gt;â€‰15. The onset of depression was significantly related to age, grade, distant learning, attitude toward COVID-19, sleep duration, and physical exercise duration. Furthermore, participants aged 15-18â€‰years (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.755, 95% CI: 1.550-1.987, pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.001), participating in distant learning (ORâ€‰=â€‰0.710, 95% CI: 0.564-0.894, pâ€‰=â€‰0.004), concerned about COVID-19 (ORâ€‰=â€‰0.414, 95% CI: 0.212-0.811, pâ€‰=â€‰0.010), with sleep duration/day of &lt;â€‰6â€‰h (ORâ€‰=â€‰2.603, 95% CI: 1.946-3.483, pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.001),and with physical exercise duration/day &lt;â€‰30â€‰min (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.641, 95% CI: 1.455-1.850, pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.001) represented to be independent factors for suffering from depression.

77,Potential Digital Tools for Psychological Symptoms associated with COVID-19,"Introduction In the four months since the discovery of the index case, there has been several studies highlighting the psychological impact of COVID-19 on frontline healthcare workers and on members of the general public. It is evident from these studies that individuals have elevated levels of anxiety and depression both in the acute phase when first becoming aware of the pandemic and that the psychological distress persists into subsequent weeks. It is becoming apparent that technological tools, such as text-messages, web-based interventions, mobile-based interventions, and conversational agents, could help ameliorate the psychological distress in the workplace and society. From our knowledge, there are limited publications that describes how digital tools (except for that of Zhou XY et al., 2020) (6) have been used to ameliorate psychological symptoms amongst individuals. It is thus the aim of this article to identify existing text, web, mobile and conversational agents that the general public could access to ameliorate the psychological symptoms that they face amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods In order to identify any digital tools that have been published specifically for COVID-19, a search was ran through PubMed and MEDLINE from inception of the databases through to the 17th of June 2020. The following keywords were used, that of &quot;NCOV OR 2019-nCoV OR SARS-CoV-2 or Coronavirus or COVID19 OR COVID&quot; and &quot;mHealth OR eHealth OR text&quot;. Another search was conducted on PubMed and MEDLINE to identify existing digital tools for depression and anxiety disorders. A web-based search engine (Google.com) was used to identify if the web-based intervention cited could be assessed. A mobile application search application, that of App Annie was used to determine if identified mobile applications could be assessed commercially. Results A total of 6 studies were identified. Of the identified web-based interventions, 5 websites were accessible. Of the identified mobile-based interventions, 7 applications were accessible. Of the identified conversational agents, only 2 were accessible. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant psychological distress. Digital tools that are commercially available could potentially be of use for at-risk individuals, or individuals with pre-existing psychiatric symptoms.","Zhang, Smith",https://doi.org/10.2196/19706,20200729.0,,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-31
78,"Experiences of American Older Adults with Pre-existing Depression During the Beginnings of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Multicity, Mixed-Methods Study","To determine the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of older adults with pre-existing major depressive disorder (MDD). Participants were 73 community-living older adults with pre-existing MDD (mean age 69 [SD 6]) in Los Angeles, New York, Pittsburgh, and St Louis. During the first 2 months of the pandemic, the authors interviewed participants with a semistructured qualitative interview evaluating access to care, mental health, quality of life, and coping. The authors also assessed depression, anxiety, and suicidality with validated scales and compared scores before and during the pandemic. Five themes from the interviews highlight the experience of older adults with MDD: 1) They are more concerned about the risk of contracting the virus than the risks of isolation. 2) They exhibit resilience to the stress and isolation of physical distancing. 3) Most are not isolated socially, with virtual contact with friends and family. 4) Their quality of life is lower, and they worry their mental health will suffer with continued physical distancing. 5) They are outraged by an inadequate governmental response to the pandemic. Depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation symptom scores did not differ from scores before the pandemic. Most older adults with pre-existing MDD show resilience in the first 2 months of the COVID-19 pandemic but have concerns about the future. Policies and interventions to provide access to medical services and opportunities for social interaction are needed to help to maintain mental health and quality of life as the pandemic continues.","Hamm, Brown, Karp, Lenard, Cameron, Dawdani, Lavretsky, Miller, Mulsant, Pham, Reynolds, Roose, Lenze",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.06.013,20200722.0,Covid-19 Pandemic; anxiety; depression; resilience,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-31
79,Strategies to Increase Peer Support Specialists' Capacity to Use Digital Technology in the Era of COVID-19: Pre-Post Study,"Prior to the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), telemental health to support mental health services was primarily designed for individuals with professional clinical degrees, such as psychologists, psychiatrists, registered nurses, and licensed clinical social workers. For the first the time in history, peer support specialists are offering Medicaid-reimbursable telemental health services during the COVID-19 crisis; however, little effort has been made to train peer support specialists on telehealth practice and delivery. The aim of this study was to explore the impact of the Digital Peer Support Certification on peer support specialists' capacity to use digital peer support technology. The Digital Peer Support Certification was co-produced with peer support specialists and included an education and simulation training session, synchronous and asynchronous support services, and audit and feedback. Participants included 9 certified peer support specialists between the ages of 25 and 54 years (mean 39 years) who were employed as peer support specialists for 1 to 11 years (mean 4.25 years) and had access to a work-funded smartphone device and data plan. A pre-post design was implemented to examine the impact of the Digital Peer Support Certification on peer support specialists' capacity to use technology over a 3-month timeframe. Data were collected at baseline, 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months. Overall, an upward trend in peer support specialists' capacity to offer digital peer support occurred during the 3-month certification period. The Digital Peer Support Certification shows promising evidence of increasing the capacity of peer support specialists to use specific digital peer support technology features. Our findings also highlighted that this capacity was less likely to increase with training alone and that a combinational knowledge translation approach that includes both training and management will be more successful.","Fortuna, Myers, Walsh, Walker, Mois, Brooks",https://doi.org/10.2196/20429,20200727.0,COVID-19; mental health; peer support; telemental health; training,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-31
80,Mental health in chronic disease patients during the COVID-19 quarantine in Greece,"To investigate the effect of the time spent on quarantine on distress, anxiety, depression, and somatization of chronic disease patients during the COVID-19 quarantine in Greece and the differences in these parameters between healthy individuals and chronic disease patients. The sample consisted of 943 healthy individuals and 163 patients (respiratory, autoimmune, cardiovascular, endocrine, patients with other diseases, and patients with more than one disease) completing sociodemographic assessments as well as the 4-Dimensional Symptom Questionnaire (4DSQ) during March 30, 2020 to May 3, 2020. Pearson's correlation was used to search for the association between time spent on quarantine and the 4DSQ subscales (distress, anxiety, depression, and somatization). Independent sample T-test and Glass's Î” were used for differences between healthy individuals and chronic disease patients in these subscales, an analysis also carried out between healthy individuals and all patient subgroups. No statistically significant correlations were noted between the 4DSQ subscales and the quarantine duration, both for the patient and the healthy individuals' group. Chronic disease patients had significantly higher levels of distress (p = 0.001, Î” = 0.28) and somatization (p = 0.000, Î” = 0.47), but not there were no significant differences in anxiety (p = 0.098, Î” = 0.14) and depression (p = 0.052, Î” = 0.19). Concerning head-to-head comparisons between the healthy individuals' group and each patient group, significantly higher scores in distress were found only for patients with respiratory diseases (p = 0.028, Î” = 0.42). Regarding somatization, significantly higher scores were noted for the healthy individuals' group compared with patients with autoimmune diseases (p = 0.010, Î” = 0.62), respiratory diseases (p = 0.027, Î” = 0.42), other diseases (p = 0.003, Î” = 0.55), and more than one disease (p = 0.012, Î” = 0.60). No statistically significant differences were found in anxiety and depression.

Respiratory patients might have more supportive care needs compared with patients with other diseases.","Louvardi, Pelekasis, Chrousos, Darviri",https://doi.org/10.1017/S1478951520000528,20200717.0,Asthma; Autoimmune; Cardiovascular; Mental health; Pandemic,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-31
81,COVID 19-Depression and Neurosurgeons,"The goal of this survey was to determine factors associated with anxiety/depression among neurosurgeons during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. An online survey was performed of neurosurgeons worldwide, conducted over 3 weeks. Depression in neurosurgeons was assessed by Self-Reporting Questionnaire-20. A total of 375 responses were received from 52 countries. Among all neurosurgeons, 34% felt tense, 32.5% were unhappy, 25% experienced insomnia, almost 20% had headaches, and 5% had suicidal ideation during the pandemic. Of participants, 14% had a score on Self-Reporting Questionnaire-20 consistent with depression. The likelihood of depression was significantly higher among those who did not receive guidance about self-protection from their institutions (odds ratio [OR], 2.47), those who did not feel safe with provided personal protective equipments (OR, 3.13), and those whose families considered their workplace unsafe (OR, 2.29). Depression was less likely in neurosurgeons who had minor concerns, compared with those with significant health concerns for their families (OR, 0.36). In multivariate analysis after controlling for effects of other covariates, odds of depression were significantly higher among neurosurgeons who did not feel safe with the provided personal protective equipment (OR, 2.43) and who were exposed to a COVID-19-positive colleague (OR, 2.54). Participants who had moderate concerns for their families had lesser odds of anxiety/depression than did those with significant concerns (OR,Â 0.28). Based on the modifiable risk factors of depression in this study, it is recommended that the safety of neurosurgeons be ensured by providing appropriate safety measures for them to regain their confidence and hence reduce the incidence of depression.","Sharif, Amin, Hafiz, Benzel, Peev, Dahlan, Enchev, Pereira, Vaishya",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2020.06.007,20200621.0,COVID-19; Depression in neurosurgeons; Depression in surgeons; Depression scale; Depression/anxiety; Global neurosurgery; Health care workers; PPE; Pandemic; Safety; Social media,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-31

83,"Digital Health Management During and Beyond the COVID-19 Pandemic: Opportunities, Barriers, and Recommendations","During the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) crisis, digital technologies have become a major route for accessing remote care. Therefore, the need to ensure that these tools are safe and effective has never been greater. We raise five calls to action to ensure the safety, availability, and long-term sustainability of these technologies: (1) due diligence: remove harmful health apps from app stores; (2) data insights: use relevant health data insights from high-quality digital tools to inform the greater response to COVID-19; (3) freely available resources: make high-quality digital health tools available without charge, where possible, and for as long as possible, especially to those who are most vulnerable; (4) digital transitioning: transform conventional offline mental health services to make them digitally available; and (5) population self-management: encourage governments and insurers to work with developers to look at how digital health management could be subsidized or funded. We believe this should be carried out at the population level, rather than at a prescription level.","Inkster, O'Brien, Selby, Joshi, Subramanian, Kadaba, Schroeder, Godson, Comley, Vollmer, Mateen",https://doi.org/10.2196/19246,20200715.0,COVID-19; call to action; data insights; digital mental health; due diligence,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-31

85,Principles of mental health care during the COVID-19 pandemic,"We describe the basic principles of mental health care during the COVID-19 pandemic that should be endorsed by the mental health professional associations and incorporated in the health strategies for the management of the COVID-19 pandemic. The main principle is that there should be no substantial differences in the provision of health care for COVID-19 between persons with pre-existing mental health disorders and the ones without previous disorders. Subsequently, the organization of the health care should reflect that as well. These principles should (a) prevent the possible effects of stigmatizing attitudes toward mental health issues, possibly leading to potentially deleterious situations, such as psychiatric patients being treated (even temporarily) separately from other patients, in psychiatric facilities, where the staff is not equipped and trained adequately for the management of COVID-19; (b) highlight the fact that patients with mental health disorders are at greater risk for developing serious complications of COVID-19 infection due to other factors-they often smoke and have comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, all associated with higher morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 infection; (c) highlight that measures should be taken to minimize the risk of the spread of infection in psychiatric wards/institutions; (d) provide a general framework for the reorganization of mental health services toward the provision of services for persons in need, including frontline medical workers and patients with COVID-19 without previous mental health problems as well as for persons with pre-existing mental health problems under new circumstances of pandemic.","Kuzman, Curkovic, Wasserman",https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2020.54,20200608.0,"COVID-19; mental health; organization; public health; stigma; Coronavirus Infections; Health Personnel; Humans; Mental Disorders; Mental Health Services; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Stereotyping",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-31

87,Culture counts: the diverse effects of culture and society on mental health amidst COVID-19 outbreak in Australia,"Since COVID-19 first emerged internationally, Australia has applied a number of public health measures to counter the disease' epidemiology. The public heath response has been effective in virus testing, diagnosing and treating patients with COVID-19. The imposed strict border restrictions and social distancing played a vital role in reducing positive cases via community transmission resulting in 'flattening of the curve'. Now is too soon to assess the impact of COVID-19 on people's mental health, as it will be determined by both short- and long-term consequences of exposure to stress, uncertainty, loss of control, loneliness and isolation. The authors explored cultural and societal influences on mental health during the current pandemic utilising Geert Hofstede's multidimensional construct of culture and determined psychological and cultural factors that foster resilience. We also reflected on the psychological impact of the pandemic on the individual and the group at large by utilising Michel Foucault' and Jacques Lacan' psychoanalytic theories. Remote Aboriginal Australian communities have been identified as a high-risk subpopulation in view of their unique vulnerabilities owing to their compromised health status, in addition to historical, systemic and cultural factors. Historically, Australia has prided itself in its multiculturalism; however, there has been evidence of an increase in racial microaggressions and xenophobia during this pandemic. Australia's model of cultural awareness will need to evolve, from reactionary to more reflective, post COVID-19 pandemic to best serve our multicultural, inclusive and integrated society.","Furlong, Finnie",https://doi.org/10.1017/ipm.2020.37,20200724.0,Australia; COVID-19; cultural competency; mental health; psychoanalysis,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-31

Doctors experience high levels of work stress even under normal circumstances, but many would be reluctant to disclose mental health difficulties or seek help for them, with stigma an often-cited reason. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis places additional pressure on doctors and on the healthcare system in general and research shows that such pressure brings a greater risk of psychological distress for doctors. For this reason, we argue that the authorities and healthcare executives must show strong leadership and support for doctors and their families during the COVID-19 outbreak and call for efforts to reduce mental health stigma in clinical workplaces. This can be facilitated by deliberately adding â€˜healthcare staff mental health support processâ€™ as an ongoing agenda item to high-level management planning meetings.","Galbraith, Boyda, McFeeters, Hassan",https://doi.org/10.1192/bjb.2020.44,20200701.0,COVID-19; coronavirus; doctors; healthcare professionals; mental health,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-31

This review aimed to review the literature about mental health problems faced by health care workers (HCW) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Literature search was conducted in the following databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, Embase. All types of articles published in the last 4 months (January 2020-April 2020) which were relevant to the subject of the review were searched. A total of 23 articles were selected by initial screening and 6 articles were included in the final review. Review of all the 6 articles showed that current research focused on assessing several aspects of mental health affected in HCW due to COVID-19. Several sociodemographic variables like gender, profession, age, place of work, department of work and psychological variables like poor social support, self-efficacy were associated with increased stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, insomnia in HCW. There is increasing evidence that suggests that COVID-19 can be an independent risk factor for stress in HCW.

L’objectif de cet article est de proposer des éléments de guidance pour réorganiser les soins psychiatriques dans le contexte de pandémie Covid-19. Méthode Les auteurs ont réalisé une synthèse de la littérature internationale combinée au partage des expériences locales françaises. Résultats Les patients souffrant de troubles psychiques semblent particulièrement vulnérables à ce virus et à la pandémie : vulnérabilités liées aux comorbidités médicales, à l’âge, aux troubles cognitifs qui peuvent entraver le respect des consignes de confinement et aux complications psychosociales. Plusieurs initiatives ont été prises pour assurer la continuité des soins et contenir l’épidémie : création en psychiatrie d’unité Covid+ co-supervisée par des médecins généralistes ou internistes, restriction des consultations aux cas sévères et redéploiement des soins en téléconsultation, accompagnement de type case-management pour les sorties précoces ou l’impossibilité d’hospitaliser, accompagnements spécifiques pour les complications psychiques du confinement. Les populations suivies en pédopsychiatrie, en psychiatrie du sujet âgé, en addictologie ou détenues en prison doivent bénéficier d’une attention particulière. Plusieurs questions restent en suspend : la question de l’interaction négative ou positive des traitements sur l’infection SARS-CoV-2, l’épidémiologie de l’infection chez les personnes souffrant de troubles psychiques, leur adaptation à un confinement long. Discussion Une prise de conscience par les décideurs politiques de la grande vulnérabilité de ces populations et des institutions psychiatriques dans cette situation de catastrophe sanitaire est urgente. Abstract Objective The lack of ressources and coordination to face the epidemic of coronavirus raises concerns for the health of patients with mental disorders in a country where we keep in memory the dramatic experience of famine in psychiatric hospitals during the Second World War. This article aims at proposing guidance to ensure mental health care during the SARS-CoV epidemy in France. Methods Authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature and local initiatives in France. Results We identified four types of major vulnerabilities in patients suffering from mental disorders during this pandemic: (1) medical comorbidities that are more frequently found in patients suffering from mental disorders (cardiovascular and pulmonary pathologies, diabetes, obesity, etc.) which represent risk factors for severe infections with Covid-19; (2) age (the elderly constituting the population most vulnerable to coronavirus); (3) cognitive and behavioral troubles which can hamper compliance with confinement and hygiene measures and finally and (4) psychosocial vulnerability due to stigmatization and/or socio-economic difficulties. Furthermore, the mental health healthcare system is more vulnerable than other healthcare systems. Current government plans are poorly adapted to psychiatric establishments in a context of major shortage of organizational, material and human resources. In addition, a certain number of structural aspects make the psychiatric institution particularly vulnerable: many beds are closed, wards have a high density of patients, mental health community facilities are closed, medical teams are understaffed and poorly trained to face infectious diseases. We could also face major issues in referring patients with acute mental disorders to intensive care units. To maintain continuity of psychiatric care in this pandemic situation, several directions can be considered, in particular with the creation of Covid+ units. These units are under the dual supervision of a psychiatrist and of an internist/infectious disease specialist; all new entrants should be placed in quarantine for 14 days; the nurse staff should benefit from specific training, from daily medical check-ups and from close psychological support. Family visits would be prohibited and replaced by videoconference. At the end of hospitalization, in particular for the population of patients in compulsory ambulatory care situations, specific case-management should be organized with the possibility of home visits, in order to support them when they get back home and to help them to cope with the experience of confinement, which is at risk to induce recurrences of mental disorders. The total or partial closure of mental health community facilities is particularly disturbing for patients but a regular follow-up is possible with telemedicine and should include the monitoring of the suicide risk and psychoeducation strategies; developing support platforms could also be very helpful in this context. Private psychiatrists have also a crucial role of information with their patients on confinement and barrier measures, but also on measures to prevent the psychological risks inherent to confinement: maintenance of sleep regularity, physical exercise, social interactions, stress management and coping strategies, prevention of addictions, etc. They should also be trained to prevent, detect and treat early warning symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, because their prevalence was high in the regions of China most affected by the pandemic. Discussion French mental healthcare is now in a great and urgent need for reorganization and must also prepare in the coming days and weeks to face an epidemic of emotional disorders due to the containment of the general population.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.03.001,20200101.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-31
96,Psychopathological consequences of confinement,"Résumé Les effets psychologiques de l’isolement ont déjà été décrits dans la littérature (expéditions polaires, sous-marins, prison). Néanmoins, l’échelle du confinement mis en œuvre à l’occasion de la pandémie à COVID-19 est inédite. Il nous faut non seulement relire les études publiées, mais aussi anticiper les problèmes psychologiques qui pourraient survenir pendant ou à distance du confinement. Nous avons fait le choix d’aller au-delà de la littérature COVID-19 pour examiner les implications des conséquences connues du confinement : l’ennui, l’isolement social, le stress, le manque de sommeil. L’anxiété, le trouble de stress post-traumatique, la dépression et les conduites suicidaires, les conduites addictives, les violences domestiques sont des effets décrits du confinement, mais les mécanismes d’émergence de ces troubles et leurs interrelations restent à étudier. Par exemple, quels sont les mécanismes d’émergence du trouble de stress post-traumatique dans le cadre du confinement ? Nous rappelons aussi les points de vigilance à garder sur des conséquences telles que les troubles des conduites alimentaires, les hallucinations, curieusement ignorées dans la littérature sur le confinement, alors qu’une vaste littérature fait le lien entre isolement social et hallucinations. Du fait de conséquences psychopathologiques larges, il nous faut partir à la recherche des différents symptômes pour permettre leur prise en charge. Nous résumons rapidement les approches diagnostiques et thérapeutiques déjà mises en place, comme la télémédecine, qui connaît un développement rapide à l’occasion de la crise du COVID-19. Abstract The psychological effects of isolation have already been described in the literature (polar expeditions, submarines, prison). Nevertheless, the scale of confinement implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented. In addition to reviewing the published studies, we need to anticipate the psychological problems that could arise during or at a distance from confinement. We have gone beyond the COVID-19 literature in order to examine the implications of the known consequences of confinement, like boredom, social isolation, stress, or sleep deprivation. Anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, suicidal or addictive behaviours, domestic violence are described effects of confinement, but the mechanisms of emergence of these disorders and their interrelationships remain to be studied. For example, what are the mechanisms of emergence of post-traumatic stress disorders in the context of confinement? We also remind the reader of points of vigilance to be kept in mind with regard to eating disorders and hallucinations. Hallucinations are curiously ignored in the literature on confinement, whereas a vast literature links social isolation and hallucinations. Due to the broad psychopathological consequences, we have to look for these various symptoms to manage them. We quickly summarize the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches already in place, such as telemedicine, which is undergoing rapid development during the COVID-19 crisis.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.007,20200101.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-31

El objetivo del presente estudio fue evaluar los factores que pueden desestabilizar la salud mental de dichos profesionales en nuestro contexto. Materiales y métodos La muestra estuvo compuesta por 421 profesionales de la salud. Los datos se recogieron mediante un cuestionario online que se les envió a través del correo electrónico. Se empleó el DASS-21 para evaluar las variables de ansiedad, estrés y depresión, y la EAI para medir las dificultades con el sueño. Además, se recogieron otras variables descriptivas de la muestra que podrían estar relacionadas con estos niveles de sintomatología psicológica. Resultados Los resultados muestran que la pandemia de la COVID-19ha generado entre el personal sanitario síntomas de estrés, ansiedad, depresión e insomnio, con mayores niveles entre las mujeres y profesionales de más edad. Variables como haber estado en contacto con el virus o el miedo en el trabajo desencadenaron una mayor sintomatología. Conclusiones En esta situación crítica, el colectivo de profesionales se sitúa en primera línea, por lo que está expuesto directamente determinados riesgos y estresores. Esto contribuye a que desarrollen sintomatología psicológica diversa. Consecuentemente, se recomienda ofrecerles ayuda psicológica para reducir el impacto emocional del COVID-19 y asegurar así no solo su salud mental, sino también el adecuado cuidado que dispensan. Abstract Introduction After the outbreak of the COVID-19 was considered a global pandemic in March 2020, the state of alarm was declared in Spain. In this situation, health professionals are experiencing high levels of stress due to the overload of work the pandemic is generating and the conditions in which they are working. The aim of this study was to evaluate the factors that can destabilize the mental health of these professionals in our context. Materials and methods The sample was composed of 421 health professionals. The data were gathered by an online questionnaire sent to them by e-mail. The DASS-21 was used to assess anxiety, stress and depression, and the EAI to measure sleep difficulties. In addition, other descriptive variables that could be related to psychological symptomatology were collected from the sample. Results The results show that the COVID-19 pandemic has generated symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression and insomnia among health workers, with higher levels among women and older professionals. Some factors such as having been in contact with the virus or fear at work, triggered greater symptomatology. Conclusions In this critical situation, professionals are in the front line and therefore, are directly exposed to certain risks and stressors. This contributes to the development of diverse psychological symptoms. Consequently, it is recommended to offer them psychological help in order to reduce the emotional impact of the COVID-19, and thus, to ensure not only the mental health of our health professionals, but also the adequate care they provide.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rpsm.2020.05.004,20200101.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-31
99,Depression symptoms mediate mismatch between perceived severity of the COVID-19 and diminished compliance with prevention measures,"Without any known vaccine or cure, sustaining individuals’ cooperation in following prevention measures is crucial to prevent spreading of the coronavirus (COVID-19). Here, we monitored national representative samples with changes in beliefs about the pandemic, depressive symptoms, and motivation to comply with prevention measures between the end of the first wave (Time1) and beginning of the second wave (Time2) of the COVID-19 in South Korea. Participants’ beliefs about the pandemic closely reflected the change of the COVID-19 situations. Strikingly, inconsistent with the accurate belief update, individuals regarded social distancing less important and externalized their motives to comply with preventive measures more at Time2 than Time1. This mismatch was mediated by depressive symptoms, such that increased depressive symptoms followed by negative belief change were associated with decreased perceived importance of social distancing and voluntary motivation. Our data highlights the importance of considering psychological reactions in promoting individuals’ compliance with prevention measures.",Jiwon Park et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/460BE-CD1-974,20200729.0,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; depression; covid-19; belief; social distancing,PsyArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-31
100,Factors Mediating the Psychological Well-Being of Healthcare Workers Responding to Global Pandemics: A Systematic Review,"The worldwide outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and the likelihood of future pandemics has raised the attention to the effects of pandemics on the psychological well-being of individuals. Given their indispensable role in such situations, healthcare workers are at greater risk of mental health issues. This paper aimed to review the mediators of psychological well-being among healthcare workers responding to global pandemics. After registration on PROSPERO, a systematic review was performed in four databases. Following study selection (PRISMA guidelines), inclusion criteria and analysis methods were assessed. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the EPHPP criteria. Out of 1467 references, 39 studies were included in this review. In most studies, worse well-being outcomes, such as stress, depressive symptoms, anxiety, and burnout were related to demographic characteristics, direct contact with infected patients, and poor perceived support. In turn, self-efficacy, coping ability, altruism, and support from employers and organisations were found to be protective factors. Despite some limitations in the quality of the available evidence, this review highlights the prevalence of poor mental health outcomes in healthcare workers responding to global pandemics. Future interventions should target the identified mediators to promote psychological well-being among this population, particularly social and organisational support, which may improve workers’ mental health and reduce burnout and turnover.",Jekaterina Schneider et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46164-DBE-BD0,20200730.0,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; healthcare professionals; mediation; pandemic; covid-19; mental health,PsyArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-31
101,How communication technology helps mitigating the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on individual and social wellbeing: Preliminary support for a compensatory social interaction model,"The present study preliminary tested the compensatory social interaction model for individuals experiencing the Covid-19 pandemic. This original model comprises two distinct processes: expression of online emotions leads to post-traumatic growth, which can favor positive mental health and prosocial behaviors; and receiving online social support leads to increases in positive mental health, which can also favor prosocial behaviors. Adults living in Italy (n=1412) completed an online survey during the lockdown period in March 2020.

102,"Relationships between Nutrition and Physical Activity, and the Symptoms of Insomnia, Depression and Anxiety among Adolescents in South China During COVID-19 Pandemic","COVID-19 has caused mental health issues among adolescents. This study aimed to explore the related factors of nutrition, physical activity (PA), and symptoms of insomnia, depression and anxiety, and to investigate associations between the two lifestyle behaviors (insolated or combined) with symptoms of insomnia, depression and anxiety. Cross-sectional data of 1,756 middle school students from a survey conducted in May 2020 was used. The t-tests or c2 tests were used to determine the related factors of nutrition, PA, and symptoms of insomnia, depression and anxiety across the subgroups when appropriate. Logistic regression analysis was used to explore the relationships between nutrition and PA, and symptoms of insomnia, depression and anxiety. Girls, rural students, left-behind, sibling, students with low family income or excessive fear had worse lifestyle or mental status. Both poor nutrition and inactive PA were related to higher odds of reporting symptoms of insomnia, depression and anxiety. Students with both poor nutrition and inactive PA tended to report insomnia symptoms (OR = 2.16) and depressive symptoms (OR = 2.57) than those with only one behavior or neither of them after controlling for confounding factors. The present study indicates the importance of helping adolescents to pursue a healthier lifestyle.",Xinli Chi et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461D0-373-450,20200730.0,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology,PsyArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-31
103,Helplessness Among University Students: An Empirical Study Based on a Modified Framework of Implicit Personality Theories,"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and within a very short period of time, teaching in the 2020 summer term changed from predominantly on-site to online instruction. Students suddenly faced having to adapt their learning process to new demands for which they may have had both insufficient digital skills and a lack of learning resources. Such a situation carries the risk that a substantial number of students become helpless. The aim of our empirical study was to test a hybrid framework of helplessness that includes both objective causes of helplessness and students' subjective interpretations of them. Before lectures or courses began, students of a full-scale university were invited to participate in an online survey. The final sample consists of 1,690 students.

104,Natural language processing reveals vulnerable mental health support groups and heightened health anxiety on Reddit during COVID-19: an observational study,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is exerting a devastating impact on mental health, but it is not clear how people with different types of mental health problems were differentially impacted as the initial wave of cases hit. Objective: We leverage natural language processing (NLP) with the goal of characterizing changes in fifteen of the world's largest mental health support groups (e.g., r/schizophrenia, r/SuicideWatch, r/Depression) found on the website Reddit, along with eleven non-mental health groups (e.g., r/PersonalFinance, r/conspiracy) during the initial stage of the pandemic. Methods: We create and release the Reddit Mental Health Dataset including posts from 826,961 unique users from 2018 to 2020. Using regression, we analyze trends from 90 text-derived features such as sentiment analysis, personal pronouns, and a “guns” semantic category. Using supervised machine learning, we classify posts into their respective support group and interpret important features to understand how different problems manifest in language. We apply unsupervised methods such as topic modeling and unsupervised clustering to uncover concerns throughout Reddit before and during the pandemic. Results: We find that the r/HealthAnxiety forum showed spikes in posts about COVID-19 early on in January, approximately two months before other support groups started posting about the pandemic. There were many features that significantly increased during COVID-19 for specific groups including the categories “economic stress”, “isolation”, and “home” while others such as “motion” significantly decreased. We find that support groups related to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), eating disorders (ED), and anxiety showed the most negative semantic change during the pandemic out of all mental health groups. Health anxiety emerged as a general theme across Reddit through independent supervised and unsupervised machine learning analyses. For instance, we provide evidence that the concerns of a diverse set of individuals are converging in this unique moment of history; we discover that the more users posted about COVID-19, the more linguistically similar (less distant) the mental health support groups became to r/HealthAnxiety (<U+03C1> = -0.96, P<.001). Using unsupervised clustering, we find the Suicidality and Loneliness clusters more than doubled in amount of posts during the pandemic. Specifically, the support groups for borderline personality disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder became significantly associated with the Suicidality cluster. Furthermore, clusters surrounding Self-Harm and Entertainment emerged. Conclusions: By using a broad set of NLP techniques and analyzing a baseline of pre-pandemic posts, we uncover patterns of how specific mental health problems manifest in language, identify at-risk users, and reveal the distribution of concerns across Reddit which could help provide better resources to its millions of users. We then demonstrate that textual analysis is sensitive to uncover mental health complaints as they arise in real time, identifying vulnerable groups and alarming themes during COVID-19, and thus may have utility during the ongoing pandemic and other world-changing events such as elections and protests from the present or the past.",Daniel Mark Low et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461EF-7EF-7C1,20200713.0,"PsyArXiv|Engineering Psychology; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Bipolar and Related Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Psychotic Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics|Computational Linguistics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods|Computational Modeling; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods|Statistical Methods; suicidality; nlp; psychiatry; covid-19; health anxiety; natural language processing; adhd; mental health; reddit; machine learning; eating disorders",PsyArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-31

Adapted from Ho, Kwong-Lo, Mak, and Wong’s (2005) SARS fear scale, the Contagion Fear and Threat Scale (CFTS) was rapidly adapted to capture the experience of COVID-19 pandemic-related fear. The factor structure and validity of the 6-item scale were established among Australian (n=155), Indian (n=111), and Nepali (n=148) university students studying in Australia in May-June 2020. Factor analysis revealed two 3-item factors in the Australian student sample: Fear of Infection and Existential Threat. These factors were confirmed in the Indian and Nepali student samples and mirror those found by the Hoe eta al. (2005) in the original instrument. The convergent and discriminant validity of the full CFTS, Fear, and Threat scales are indicated via correlations with established measures of depression, anxiety, stress and subjective wellbeing.

106,Mechanisms of COVID-19 Mental Health Burden,"New Zealand's COVID-19 lockdown in March and April 2020 was among the world's most stringent. Similar to other countries, New Zealand's lockdown occurred amidst pervasive health and economic uncertainties. However, New Zealanders experienced comparatively less psychological distress. To test theories of pandemic distress mitigation, we use national longitudinal responses with pre-COVID-19 baselines and systematically quantify psychological distress trajectories within the same individuals during the lockdown (pre-COVID-19 = 2018/2019; stringent-lockdown = March/April 2020; N = 940). Most distress indicators were minimally elevated. However, there was a three-fold increase in feelings of worthlessness. Neither satisfaction with the government, nor business-satisfaction, nor a sense of neighbourhood community were effective distress defences. Perceived social-belonging and health-satisfaction mitigated feelings of worthlessness. A silver lining was a relief from feelings of effort, which social-belonging fostered. That social-belonging and health satisfaction could quell serious distress among those low in government confidence, low in business satisfaction, and low neighbourhood community proves that distress mitigation is possible without shifting a population's general political, economic, and civic attitudes. Protection of income and containment of infectious disease threat reduces mental health burdens. Though feelings of worthlessness surge during lockdown, such feelings attenuate from interpersonal belonging with people one already knows.",Joseph Bulbulia et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46163-B20-33A,20200623.0,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods|Statistical Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Individual Differences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; brms; kessler-6; glmm; bayesian; ordinal; stan; anxiety; longitudinal; covid-19; mental health; employment,PsyArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-31

The survey was conducted online March 26–28, involving 8,475 employees — including nonregular workers — aged 20 to 64. Of the 21% of respondents who said they work from home, one-half of them did so in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Among the telecommuters, 50.7% said it had no impact on their mental health, and 14.3% said their mental health had improved. Of the respondents who said doing telework had worsened their mental state, 41.3% said it was difficult to separate their work and personal lives, followed by 39.9% who said they weren't able to exercise enough and 39.7% who said they had difficulty communicating with co-workers. Professor Isamu Yamamoto of the Keio University Faculty of Business and Commerce, who conducted the survey, said: “There is a risk that working hours will get longer if the boundaries between work and personal life become blurred.

109,"Le confinement généralisé pendant l’épidémie de Coronavirus: Conséquences médico-psychologiques en populations générales, soignantes, et de sujets souffrant antérieurement de troubles psychiques","Background. – The situation we are currently experiencing is unprecedented. Declaring a state of health emergency in order to curb a frightening epidemic, the authorities have decreed the home confinement of the majority of the population of our country for several weeks. In a few days, innumerable questions arise for very diverse spaces: epidemiological, immunological, sociological, information scientists, medical, administrative, political, etc. Objective. – We propose a reflection intended to describe the psychological risks, to clarify the disorders found and, to discuss the means to take care of them in the duration. Material and methods. – We base our thinking on a review of the literature confronted with our current clinical experience, including concerning the possibilities of dematerialized medico-psychological monitoring. Results. – We recall the collective repercussions of emerging lethal mass risks, and in particular viral infectious agents, before approaching the existing scientific models of collective confinement according to military operations in hostile zones, polar wintering missions and aerospace conquest. It appears that for the study of a global containment, somewhat studied during previous pandemics, the conceptions of stress reaction and psychodynamic adaptation prove to be relevant. We detail the psychological consequences of confinement on individual mental health and their countermeasures according to three population typologies: general population, population of caregivers on the front line against the epidemic, and population of subjects already suffering from mental illness or seeing their disorders reappear. We also refer to works in social cognitive psychology explaining how, in an anxiety-provoking situation, reasoning can be biased and lead to choices that ultimately prove to be not very rational, in the opinion of those who made them. The current situation in the health sector is favorable in this, as evidenced by the ""debate on chloroquine"" widely reported in the media and on social networks, opposing conclusions most often decided on the basis of beliefs on contrary to evidence based medicine. Discussion. – The psychological repercussions of confinement appear conditioned by the multiple forms that it can take: voluntary or suffered, more or less prolonged, spent at home or in another place, lived in individual isolation or in a small community, associated other stressors and/or traumatic factors, etc. The home confinement of a population across a country has never been assessed. This experience seems to us to confront our society as a whole with the taboo of death which is imposed, death more and more evaded as the ""Western man"" tries to move away from his terrestrial origins. In this sense, psychotraumatic type repercussions are to be prevented. In order to face multiple challenges, the healthcare system has adapted with, in particular, the development of the use of the Internet for the provision of information intended to better experience confinement, or even the generalization of psychotherapy remotely asking as many questions as it provides answers. These intricacies of computer techniques in the area of psychotherapy, techniques with which we had some mistrust, became established as quickly as the virus: the task of clinicians and researchers to measure the issues and the consequences. Conclusion. – Public health programs could emerge on the model of those already existing in order to manage well-known chronic endemic disorders: protection against the effects of an unbalanced diet associated with a sedentary lifestyle, fight against smoking and alcoholism, prevention of self-aggressive behavior, etc. We will also need to support the caregivers who have been on the front line and who will emerge tested from this pandemic: will depend on the sustainability of the action capacities of our healthcare system to return to its nominal state and also perhaps, so that it can face other crises, especially social ones.","Auxéméry, Yann; Tarquinio, Cyril",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2020.06.001,20200605.0,,PMC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-31

However, only a quarter received a prescription for naloxone, which reverses opioid overdoses.

113,"A Key, Not a Straitjacket: The Case for Interim Mental Health Legislation Pending Complete Prohibition of Psychiatric Coercion in Accordance with the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities","The practice of coercion on the basis of psychosocial disability is plainly discriminatory. This has resulted in a demand from the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (the CRPD Committee) for a paradigm shift away from the traditional biomedical model and a global ban on compulsion in the psychiatric context. However, that has not occurred. This paper considers conflicting pronouncements of the CRPD Committee and other United Nations bodies. Assuming the former’s interpretations of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disability (CRPD) are accurate, involuntary psychiatric detention and enforced treatment on the basis of psychosocial disability are prima facie discriminatory and unlawful practices. However, dedicated mental health legislation both permits discrimination and protects and enhances rights. This paper proposes a practical way out of the present impasse: the global introduction of interim “holding” legislation lacking full compliance with the CRPD. While imperfect, such a framework would facilitate a move toward a complete ban on psychiatric coercion. The paper outlines four essential ingredients that any interim legislation ought to contain, including clear timebound targets for full CRPD implementation. It concludes by urging the CRPD Committee to take the unprecedented step of issuing a general comment providing reluctant “permission” for the progressive realization of respect for articles 12 and 14 of the CRPD.","Davidson, Laura",https://doi.org/nan,20200621.0,,PMC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-31

115,Depression Detection with Multi-Modalities Using a Hybrid Deep Learning Model on Social Media,"Social networks enable people to interact with one another by sharing information, sending messages, making friends, and having discussions, which generates massive amounts of data every day, popularly called as the user-generated content. This data is present in various forms such as images, text, videos, links, and others and reflects user behaviours including their mental states. It is challenging yet promising to automatically detect mental health problems from such data which is short, sparse and sometimes poorly phrased. However, there are efforts to automatically learn patterns using computational models on such user-generated content. While many previous works have largely studied the problem on a small-scale by assuming uni-modality of data which may not give us faithful results, we propose a novel scalable hybrid model that combines Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (BiGRUs) and Convolutional Neural Networks to detect depressed users on social media such as Twitter-based on multi-modal features. Specifically, we encode words in user posts using pre-trained word embeddings and BiGRUs to capture latent behavioural patterns, long-term dependencies, and correlation across the modalities, including semantic sequence features from the user timelines (posts). The CNN model then helps learn useful features. Our experiments show that our model outperforms several popular and strong baseline methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining deep learning with multi-modal features. We also show that our model helps improve predictive performance when detecting depression in users who are posting messages publicly on social media.","Zogan, Hamad; Wang, Xianzhi; Jameel, Shoaib; Xu, Guandong",https://doi.org/nan,20200703.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-31
116,How Does COVID-19 impact Students with Disabilities/Health Concerns?,"The impact of COVID-19 on students has been enormous, with an increase in worries about fiscal and physical health, a rapid shift to online learning, and increased isolation. In addition to these changes, students with disabilities/health concerns may face accessibility problems with online learning or communication tools, and their stress may be compounded by additional risks such as financial stress or pre-existing conditions. To our knowledge, no one has looked specifically at the impact of COVID-19 on students with disabilities/health concerns. In this paper, we present data from a survey of 147 students with and without disabilities collected in late March to early April of 2020 to assess the impact of COVID-19 on these students' education and mental health. Our findings show that students with disabilities/health concerns were more concerned about classes going online than their peers without disabilities. In addition, students with disabilities/health concerns also reported that they have experienced more COVID-19 related adversities compared to their peers without disabilities/health concerns. We argue that students with disabilities/health concerns in higher education need confidence in the accessibility of the online learning tools that are becoming increasingly prevalent in higher education not only because of COVID-19 but also more generally. In addition, educational technologies will be more accessible if they consider the learning context, and are designed to provide a supportive, calm, and connecting learning environment.","Zhang, Han; Nurius, Paula; Sefidgar, Yasaman; Morris, Margaret; Balasubramanian, Sreenithi; Brown, Jennifer; Dey, Anind K.; Kuehn, Kevin; Riskin, Eve; Xu, Xuhai; Mankoff, Jen",https://doi.org/nan,20200511.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-31

However, its influence on people's mental health conditions has not received as much attention. To study this subject, we choose social media as our main data resource and create by far the largest English Twitter depression dataset containing 2,575 distinct identified depression users with their past tweets. To examine the effect of depression on people's Twitter language, we train three transformer-based depression classification models on the dataset, evaluate their performance with progressively increased training sizes, and compare the model's""tweet chunk""-level and user-level performances. Furthermore, inspired by psychological studies, we create a fusion classifier that combines deep learning model scores with psychological text features and users' demographic information and investigate these features' relations to depression signals. Finally, we demonstrate our model's capability of monitoring both group-level and population-level depression trends by presenting two of its applications during the COVID-19 pandemic. We hope this study can raise awareness among researchers and the general public of COVID-19's impact on people's mental health.","Zhang, Yipeng; Lyu, Hanjia; Liu, Yubao; Zhang, Xiyang; Wang, Yu; Luo, Jiebo",https://doi.org/nan,20200701.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-31
118,Examination of community sentiment dynamics due to covid-19 pandemic: a case study from Australia,"The outbreak of the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused unprecedented impacts to people's daily life around the world. Various measures and policies such as lock-down and social-distancing are implemented by governments to combat the disease during the pandemic period. These measures and policies as well as virus itself may cause different mental health issues to people such as depression, anxiety, sadness, etc. In this paper, we exploit the massive text data posted by Twitter users to analyse the sentiment dynamics of people living in the state of New South Wales (NSW) in Australia during the pandemic period. Different from the existing work that mostly focuses the country-level and static sentiment analysis, we analyse the sentiment dynamics at the fine-grained local government areas (LGAs). Based on the analysis of around 94 million tweets that posted by around 183 thousand users located at different LGAs in NSW in five months, we found that people in NSW showed an overall positive sentimental polarity and the COVID-19 pandemic decreased the overall positive sentimental polarity during the pandemic period. The fine-grained analysis of sentiment in LGAs found that despite the dominant positive sentiment most of days during the study period, some LGAs experienced significant sentiment changes from positive to negative. This study also analysed the sentimental dynamics delivered by the hot topics in Twitter such as government policies (e.g. the Australia's JobKeeper program, lock-down, social-distancing) as well as the focused social events (e.g. the Ruby Princess Cruise). The results showed that the policies and events did affect people's overall sentiment, and they affected people's overall sentiment differently at different stages.","Zhou, Jianlong; Yang, Shuiqiao; Xiao, Chun; Chen, Fang",https://doi.org/nan,20200622.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-31

Establish a""Scrapy-Redis-Bloomfilter""distributed crawler framework to collect data.

120,Detecting Community Depression Dynamics Due to COVID-19 Pandemic in Australia,"The recent COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented impact across the globe. We have also witnessed millions of people with increased mental health issues, such as depression, stress, worry, fear, disgust, sadness, and anxiety, which have become one of the major public health concerns during this severe health crisis. For instance, depression is one of the most common mental health issues according to the findings made by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Depression can cause serious emotional, behavioural and physical health problems with significant consequences, both personal and social costs included. This paper studies community depression dynamics due to COVID-19 pandemic through user-generated content on Twitter. A new approach based on multi-modal features from tweets and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is proposed to build depression classification models. Multi-modal features capture depression cues from emotion, topic and domain-specific perspectives. We study the problem using recently scraped tweets from Twitter users emanating from the state of New South Wales in Australia. Our novel classification model is capable of extracting depression polarities which may be affected by COVID-19 and related events during the COVID-19 period. The results found that people became more depressed after the outbreak of COVID-19. The measures implemented by the government such as the state lockdown also increased depression levels. Further analysis in the Local Government Area (LGA) level found that the community depression level was different across different LGAs.

However, current art-making robots are typically either contingent, controlled as a tool by a human artist, or creative, programmed to paint independently, possibly because some complex and idiosyncratic concepts related to art, such as emotion and creativity, are not yet well understood. For example, the role of personalized taste in forming beauty evaluations has been studied in empirical aesthetics, but how to generate art that appears to an individual to express certain emotions such as happiness or sadness is less clear. In the current article, a collaborative prototyping/Wizard of Oz approach was used to explore generic robot art-making strategies and personalization of art via an open-ended emotion profile intended to identify tricky concepts. As a result of conducting an exploratory user study, participants indicated some preference for a robot art-making strategy involving""visual metaphors""to balance exogenous and endogenous components, and personalized representational sketches were reported to convey emotion more clearly than generic sketches. The article closes by discussing personalized abstract art as well as suggestions for richer art-making strategies and user models. Thus, the main conceptual advance of the current work lies in suggesting how an interactive robot can visually express emotions through personalized art; the general aim is that this could help to inform next steps in this promising area and facilitate technological acceptance of robots in everyday human environments.","Cooney, Martin",https://doi.org/nan,20200508.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-31
122,What are We Depressed about When We Talk about COVID19: Mental Health Analysis on Tweets Using Natural Language Processing,"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) recently has affected human life to a great extent. Besides direct physical and economic threats, the pandemic also indirectly impact people's mental health conditions, which can be overwhelming but difficult to measure. The problem may come from various reasons such as unemployment status, stay-at-home policy, fear for the virus, and so forth. In this work, we focus on applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze tweets in terms of mental health. We trained deep models that classify each tweet into the following emotions: anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise and trust. We build the EmoCT (Emotion-Covid19-Tweet) dataset for the training purpose by manually labeling 1,000 English tweets. Furthermore, we propose and compare two methods to find out the reasons that are causing sadness and fear.","Li, Irene; Li, Yixin; Li, Tianxiao; Alvarez-Napagao, Sergio; Garcia-Gasulla, Dario; Suzumura, Toyotaro",https://doi.org/nan,20200422.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-31

We analyze 4 million Twitter messages related to the COVID-19 pandemic using a list of 25 hashtags such as""coronavirus,""""COVID-19,""""quarantine""from March 1 to April 21 in 2020. We use a machine learning approach, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to identify popular unigram, bigrams, salient topics and themes, and sentiments in the collected Tweets. Popular unigrams include""virus,""""lockdown,""and""quarantine.""Popular bigrams include""COVID-19,""""stay home,""""corona virus,""""social distancing,""and""new cases.""We identify 13 discussion topics and categorize them into five different themes, such as""public health measures to slow the spread of COVID-19,""""social stigma associated with COVID-19,""""coronavirus news cases and deaths,""""COVID-19 in the United States,""and""coronavirus cases in the rest of the world"". Across all identified topics, the dominant sentiments for the spread of coronavirus are anticipation that measures that can be taken, followed by a mixed feeling of trust, anger, and fear for different topics. The public reveals a significant feeling of fear when they discuss the coronavirus new cases and deaths than other topics. The study shows that Twitter data and machine learning approaches can be leveraged for infodemiology study by studying the evolving public discussions and sentiments during the COVID-19. Real-time monitoring and assessment of the Twitter discussion and concerns can be promising for public health emergency responses and planning. Already emerged pandemic fear, stigma, and mental health concerns may continue to influence public trust when there occurs a second wave of COVID-19 or a new surge of the imminent pandemic.","Xue, Jia; Chen, Junxiang; Hu, Ran; Chen, Chen; Zheng, ChengDa; Liu, Xiaoqian; Zhu, Tingshao",https://doi.org/nan,20200526.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-31
124,Detecting Topic and Sentiment Dynamics Due to COVID-19 Pandemic Using Social Media,"The outbreak of the novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) has greatly influenced people's daily lives across the globe. Emergent measures and policies (e.g., lockdown, social distancing) have been taken by governments to combat this highly infectious disease. However, people's mental health is also at risk due to the long-time strict social isolation rules. Hence, monitoring people's mental health across various events and topics will be extremely necessary for policy makers to make the appropriate decisions. On the other hand, social media have been widely used as an outlet for people to publish and share their personal opinions and feelings. The large scale social media posts (e.g., tweets) provide an ideal data source to infer the mental health for people during this pandemic period. In this work, we propose a novel framework to analyze the topic and sentiment dynamics due to COVID-19 from the massive social media posts. Based on a collection of 13 million tweets related to COVID-19 over two weeks, we found that the positive sentiment shows higher ratio than the negative sentiment during the study period. When zooming into the topic-level analysis, we find that different aspects of COVID-19 have been constantly discussed and show comparable sentiment polarities. Some topics like ``stay safe home""are dominated with positive sentiment. The others such as ``people death""are consistently showing negative sentiment. Overall, the proposed framework shows insightful findings based on the analysis of the topic-level sentiment dynamics.","Yin, Hui; Yang, Shuiqiao; Li, Jianxin",https://doi.org/nan,20200705.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-31
125,Keynesian models of depression Supply shocks and the COVID-19 Crisis,"The objective of this work is twofold: to expand the depression models proposed by Tobin and analyse a supply shock, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, in this Keynesian conceptual environment. The expansion allows us to propose the evolution of all endogenous macroeconomic variables. The result obtained is relevant due to its theoretical and practical implications. A quantity or Keynesian adjustment to the shock produces a depression through the effect on aggregate demand. This depression worsens in the medium/long-term. It is accompanied by increases in inflation, inflation expectations and the real interest rate. A stimulus tax policy is also recommended, as well as an active monetary policy to reduce real interest rates. On the other hand, the pricing or Marshallian adjustment foresees a more severe and rapid depression in the short-term. There would be a reduction in inflation and inflation expectations, and an increase in the real interest rates. The tax or monetary stimulus measures would only impact inflation. This result makes it possible to clarify and assess the resulting depression, as well as propose policies. Finally, it offers conflicting predictions that allow one of the two models to be falsified.","Romana, Ignacio Escanuela",https://doi.org/nan,20200711.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-31

In the UK and Ireland, online community support initiatives (OCSIs) have emerged to help people manage their lives. Yet, little is known about how people engaged with these or whether they influenced subsequent mood. We conducted surveys to explore how people in the UK and Ireland engaged with OCSIs, and found that 70% did so to offer support (e.g. to provide company). Those who did so reported feeling significantly calmer afterwards, those who engaged for general concerns (e.g. in response to anti-social behaviour) reported feeling significantly more anxious afterwards, but there was no difference in reported mood for those who engaged for other reasons (e.g. to share experiences or views). Thus, engaging with an OCSI for altruistic purposes might help to make people feel calmer.","Elphick, Camilla; Stuart, Avelie; Philpot, Richard; Walkington, Zoe; Frumkin, Lara; Zhang, Min; Levine, Mark; Price, Blaine; Pike, Graham; Nuseibeh, Bashar; Bandara, Arosha",https://doi.org/nan,20200612.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-31

This study relies on Google Trends data and tests whether the lockdowns implemented in Europe and America led to changes in well-being related topic search terms. Using different methods to evaluate the causal effects of lockdown, we find a substantial increase in the search intensity for boredom in Europe and the US. We also found a significant increase in searches for loneliness, worry and sadness, while searches for stress, suicide and divorce on the contrary fell.

As part of a developing an ecosystem of e-screening and e-therapy tools for New Zealand young people, a dialog agent, Headstrong, has been designed to promote resilience with methods grounded in cognitive behavioral therapy and positive psychology. This paper describes the architecture underlying the chatbot. The architecture supports a range of over 20 activities delivered in a 4-week program by relatable personas. The architecture provides a visual authoring interface to its content management system. In addition to supporting the original adolescent resilience chatbot, the architecture has been reused to create a 3-week 'stress-detox' intervention for undergraduates, and subsequently for a chatbot to support young people with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, with all three systems having been used in field trials. The Headstrong architecture illustrates the feasibility of creating a domain-focused authoring environment in the context of e-therapy that supports non-technical expert input and rapid deployment.","Holt-Quick, Chester; Warren, Jim; Stasiak, Karolina; Williams, Ruth; Christie, Grant; Hetrick, Sarah; Hopkins, Sarah; Cargo, Tania; Merry, Sally",https://doi.org/nan,20200515.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-31

We found that those surveys are basically studying the blockchain-based applications, such as blockchain-assisted Internet of Things (IoT), business applications, security-enabled solutions, and many other applications in diverse fields. However, we think that a comprehensive survey towards the essentials of blockchains by exploiting the state-of-the-art theoretical modelings, analytic models, and useful experiment tools is still missing. To fill this gap, we perform a thorough survey by identifying and classifying the most recent high-quality research outputs that are closely related to the theoretical findings and essential mechanisms of blockchain systems and networks. Several promising open issues are also summarized finally for future research directions. We wish this survey can serve as a useful guideline for researchers, engineers, and educators about the cutting-edge development of blockchains in the perspectives of theories, modelings, and tools.","Huang, Huawei; Kong, Wei; Zhou, Sicong; Zheng, Zibin; Guo, Song",https://doi.org/nan,20200707.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-31
130,Visualising COVID-19 Research,"The world has seen in 2020 an unprecedented global outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, a new strain of coronavirus, causing the COVID-19 pandemic, and radically changing our lives and work conditions. Many scientists are working tirelessly to find a treatment and a possible vaccine. Furthermore, governments, scientific institutions and companies are acting quickly to make resources available, including funds and the opening of large-volume data repositories, to accelerate innovation and discovery aimed at solving this pandemic. In this paper, we develop a novel automated theme-based visualisation method, combining advanced data modelling of large corpora, information mapping and trend analysis, to provide a top-down and bottom-up browsing and search interface for quick discovery of topics and research resources. We apply this method on two recently released publications datasets (Dimensions' COVID-19 dataset and the Allen Institute for AI's CORD-19). The results reveal intriguing information including increased efforts in topics such as social distancing; cross-domain initiatives (e.g. mental health and education); evolving research in medical topics; and the unfolding trajectory of the virus in different territories through publications. The results also demonstrate the need to quickly and automatically enable search and browsing of large corpora. We believe our methodology will improve future large volume visualisation and discovery systems but also hope our visualisation interfaces will currently aid scientists, researchers, and the general public to tackle the numerous issues in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bras, Pierre Le; Gharavi, Azimeh; Robb, David A.; Vidal, Ana F.; Padilla, Stefano; Chantler, Mike J.",https://doi.org/nan,20200513.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-31

133,"Universal Masking is Urgent in the COVID-19 Pandemic: SEIR and Agent Based Models, Empirical Validation, Policy Recommendations","We present two models for the COVID-19 pandemic predicting the impact of universal face mask wearing upon the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus--one employing a stochastic dynamic network based compartmental SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) approach, and the other employing individual ABM (agent-based modelling) Monte Carlo simulation--indicating (1) significant impact under (near) universal masking when at least 80% of a population is wearing masks, versus minimal impact when only 50% or less of the population is wearing masks, and (2) significant impact when universal masking is adopted early, by Day 50 of a regional outbreak, versus minimal impact when universal masking is adopted late. These effects hold even at the lower filtering rates of homemade masks. To validate these theoretical models, we compare their predictions against a new empirical data set we have collected that includes whether regions have universal masking cultures or policies, their daily case growth rates, and their percentage reduction from peak daily case growth rates. Results show a near perfect correlation between early universal masking and successful suppression of daily case growth rates and/or reduction from peak daily case growth rates, as predicted by our theoretical simulations. Our theoretical and empirical results argue for urgent implementation of universal masking. As governments plan how to exit societal lockdowns, it is emerging as a key NPI; a""mouth-and-nose lockdown""is far more sustainable than a""full body lockdown"", on economic, social, and mental health axes. An interactive visualization of the ABM simulation is at http://dek.ai/masks4all. We recommend immediate mask wearing recommendations, official guidelines for correct use, and awareness campaigns to shift masking mindsets away from pure self-protection, towards aspirational goals of responsibly protecting one's community.","Kai, De; Goldstein, Guy-Philippe; Morgunov, Alexey; Nangalia, Vishal; Rotkirch, Anna",https://doi.org/nan,20200422.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-31

135,Inf-Net: Automatic COVID-19 Lung Infection Segmentation from CT Images,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread globally in early 2020, causing the world to face an existential health crisis. Automated detection of lung infections from computed tomography (CT) images offers a great potential to augment the traditional healthcare strategy for tackling COVID-19. However, segmenting infected regions from CT slices faces several challenges, including high variation in infection characteristics, and low intensity contrast between infections and normal tissues. Further, collecting a large amount of data is impractical within a short time period, inhibiting the training of a deep model. To address these challenges, a novel COVID-19 Lung Infection Segmentation Deep Network (Inf-Net) is proposed to automatically identify infected regions from chest CT slices. In our Inf-Net, a parallel partial decoder is used to aggregate the high-level features and generate a global map. Then, the implicit reverse attention and explicit edge-attention are utilized to model the boundaries and enhance the representations. Moreover, to alleviate the shortage of labeled data, we present a semi-supervised segmentation framework based on a randomly selected propagation strategy, which only requires a few labeled images and leverages primarily unlabeled data. Our semi-supervised framework can improve the learning ability and achieve a higher performance. Extensive experiments on our COVID-SemiSeg and real CT volumes demonstrate that the proposed Inf-Net outperforms most cutting-edge segmentation models and advances the state-of-the-art performance.","Fan, Deng-Ping; Zhou, Tao; Ji, Ge-Peng; Zhou, Yi; Chen, Geng; Fu, Huazhu; Shen, Jianbing; Shao, Ling",https://doi.org/nan,20200422.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-31

COVID-19 has largely impacted on our societies through both direct and indirect effects transmitted by the policy measures to counter the spread of viruses. We quantitatively analysed the multifaceted impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our societies including people's mobility, health, and social behaviour changes. People's mobility has changed significantly due to the implementation of travel restriction and quarantine measurements. Indeed, the physical distance has widened at international (cross-border), national and regional level. At international level, due to the travel restrictions, the number of international flights has plunged overall at around 88 percent during March. In particular, the number of flights connecting Europe dropped drastically in mid of March after the United States announced travel restrictions to Europe and the EU and participating countries agreed to close borders, at 84 percent decline compared to March 10th. Similarly, we examined the impacts of quarantine measures in the major city: Tokyo (Japan), New York City (the United States), and Barcelona (Spain). Within all three cities, we found the significant decline in traffic volume. We also identified the increased concern for mental health through the analysis of posts on social networking services such as Twitter and Instagram. Notably, in the beginning of April 2020, the number of post with #depression on Instagram doubled, which might reflect the rise in mental health awareness among Instagram users.

The expansive growth of cutting-edge technology in the blockchain industry outlines the need and opportunity for addressing oracle consensus in a manner both technologically and economically efficient as well as futureproof. Blockchain-agnosticism is inherently limited if proposing a technological solution involves adding one more architectural layer. As such, Gravity protocol is designed to be a truly blockchain-agnostic protocol. By ensuring parity through direct integration and by leveraging the stability and security of the respective interconnected ecosystems, Gravity circumvents the need for a dedicated, public blockchain and a native token. Ultimately, Gravity protocol intends to address scalability challenges by providing a solid infrastructure for the creation of gateways, cross-chain applications, and sidechains. This paper introduces and defines the concept of Oracle Consensus and its implementation in the Gravity protocol named the Pulse Consensus algorithm.

Impact from COVID-19 will likely affect treatment arms equally, so analyses of adverse events from controlled data can, to a large extent, remain unchanged. However, interpretation of summaries from uncontrolled data (summaries that include open-label extension data) will require even more caution than usual. Special consideration will be needed for safety topics of interest, especially events expected to have a higher incidence due to a COVID-19 infection or due to quarantine or travel restrictions (e.g., depression).

In particular, when individuals self-report their experiences over the course of the virus on social media, it can allow for identification of the emotions each stage of symptoms engenders in the patient. Posts to the Reddit forum r/COVID19Positive contain first-hand accounts from COVID-19 positive patients, giving insight into personal struggles with the virus. These posts often feature a temporal structure indicating the number of days after developing symptoms the text refers to. Using topic modelling and sentiment analysis, we quantify the change in discussion of COVID-19 throughout individuals' experiences for the first 14 days since symptom onset. Discourse on early symptoms such as fever, cough, and sore throat was concentrated towards the beginning of the posts, while language indicating breathing issues peaked around ten days. Some conversation around critical cases was also identified and appeared at a roughly constant rate. We identified two clear clusters of positive and negative emotions associated with the evolution of these symptoms and mapped their relationships. Our results provide a perspective on the patient experience of COVID-19 that complements other medical data streams and can potentially reveal when mental health issues might appear.","Murray, Curtis; Mitchell, Lewis; Tuke, Jonathan; Mackay, Mark",https://doi.org/nan,20200521.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-31

We examine gender differences and the effect of document length on worries about the ongoing COVID-19 situation. Our findings suggest that i) shorter texts do not offer an as adequate insight into psychological processes as longer texts. We further find ii) marked gender differences in topics concerning emotional responses. Women worried more about their loved ones and severe health concerns while men were more occupied with effects on the economy and society.

However, there are few researches on how the people who pay attention to anxiety and depression coping with negative psychological during the epidemic or major disaster. This study aimed to identify what behaviors can effectively reduce negative emotions during the epidemic. METHODS: From February 1, to March 8 in 2020, we conducted a web-based survey and collected information on general demographic data. The probable depression, anxiety symptoms and coping behaviors was assessed by Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalized anxiety disorder-7 and the self-made Coping Behaviors Questionnaires. RESULT: Among 17249 responders, 7923 and 9326 completed the assessment of depression and anxiety respectively, and all responders finished the assessment of the coping behaviors questionnaires. Our survey population had a high prevalence rate of possible depression disorders and anxiety disorders were34.66% and 56.93%, respectively. Those who are old, female, low education, low income, and cohabiting were more likely to suffer depression and/or anxiety. Students are a high-risk group suffering from depression and/or anxiety. After adjusting for social-demographic factors (e.g. age, sex), depression and anxiety were positively associated with self-injury, doing housework, and having sex or masturbating and negatively associated with singing, drawing, or writing, dating friends online, singing, attending lectures, and doing yoga. CONCLUSION: During the epidemic, our findings identify some spontaneous coping behaviors that can probably relieve the psychological impact of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.","Ge, Fenfen; Wan, Mentong; Zheng, Anni; Luo, Guan; Zhang, Jun",https://doi.org/10.1093/pcmedi/pbaa023,20200623.0,,PMC; WHO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-31
145,“I feel like death on legs”: COVID-19 isolation and mental health,"Abstract This study investigates the personal and collective responses to COVID-19, as it is described in personal stories and newspaper reports and examines the social and economic impact of the pandemic on different societies. Although some studies have been done on the impact of COVID-19, these studies focus on epidemiology, the importance of language diversity and reflections on the pandemic. None of the studies so far have focused specifically on the impact the coronavirus has had on different societies because of the global lockdown and restrictions on people’s movements. This study attempts to address this gap in the literature by focusing on how the language used in personal stories and newspaper reports reveal the impact of COVID-19 on different societies by investigating how self-isolation and lockdown measures is leading to mental health breakdown in individuals and affecting wider social and economic collapse. Prior literature (Gortner and Pennebaker, 2003) suggests that the media generally parallel society’s psychological response to traumatic events making newspapers an important collective resource similar to personal stories. The scale of the pandemic is such that it has been likened to a situation of war. In this climate, where the response to the pandemic is analogous to fighting a war, it was interesting to see what effect the enforced lockdown has on people’s mental health well-being and what priorities the media focus on. Smith, Anderson-Hanley, Langrock, and Compas (2005) have shown that language use in descriptions of traumatic experiences can shed insight into successful and unsuccessful coping strategies. I have therefore chosen to look at two different countries, Sri Lanka and Britain in order to investigate the following research questions: (1) Is self-isolation due to COVID-19 having an effect on mental health in Britain? And (2) What are the priorities of different countries during the crisis as evident in newspaper reports? To answer these two research questions, I have collected a small corpus of personal stories from Britain and two small corpora of newspaper reports from Britain and Sri Lanka over a span of one month. The data was analysed using corpus linguistics methodology such as keyword analysis of the two newspaper reports using AntConc (Anthony, 2019) and the personal stories were analysed using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) (Pennebaker, 2015). The findings from LIWC shows that the enforced self-isolation is leading to mental health breakdown but that there are also positive emotions of the desire to help and solidarity with others. The analysis of the news reports show that Britain’s priorities are centered on the government’s handling of the crisis and the economy whereas Sri Lankan newspapers focus on educating people about the dangers of COVID-19.","Herat, Manel",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssaho.2020.100042,20200707.0,,Elsevier; PMC; WHO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-31
146,What does social distancing mean for patients in forensic mental health settings?,"Governments across the globe have called for social distancing measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Secure settings will not be able to comply with these strictly, nor will they have the same recourse to the novel and creative solutions the general population does. Activities have been restricted in quality, quantity and scope; transfers and discharges have been halted and patient progress put on pause. Understanding how and what ways these restrictions will affect patients is crucial. This is especially salient given that large numbers of the general population have reported heightened mental health burden in recent surveys. However, it is not yet clear how and in what ways the COVID-19 restrictions will affect the mental health of patients in secure care. Past research investigating patients experiences of restrictions on autonomy in secure care that were present before the pandemic can be helpful here. Studies suggest that patient experience restrictions in care in myriad subjective ways. These include limitations on family contact, outside leave, and making hot drinks but also more profoundly on their autonomy, sense of self, and personhood. Quantitative studies have found correlations between experiences of restrictiveness and ward atmosphere, quality of life, suicidal ideation, depression and general psychological state in this patient group. This paper suggests how we can use past research exploring patient expereinces of restrictive interventions to guide the implementation of social distancing measures in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Tomlin, Dr Jack",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsiml.2020.100018,20200428.0,,Elsevier; PMC; WHO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-31
147,"Enfermement carcéral, confinement socio-sanitaire et moyens d’évasionDanser sa peine et au-delà…","Abstract Jail incarceration and social confinement due to a sanitary stay-at-home law against the ongoing covid-19 pandemic are compared through the introduction of dance workshops for imprisoned women charged with long sentences, then followed by an outside performance Soul Kitchen. The whole experience, organized by a famous contemporary choreographer Angelin Preljocaj, is filmed by Valérie Müller, producing Danser sa peine (To dance her sentence / her sorrow), nominated for an award. The sessions are planned: two hours and a half, 2 times a week, for four months, no technique required. A group of five women starts with ordinary easy functional movements, gaining in innovative and expressive qualities, spatial perceptions, feelings and interpersonal interactions, leaded by A. Preljocaj in a helpful and empathic mood. At the same time, he discovers the cooking authorization in their jail cell. The relevant results shift into a dynamic successful piece Soul Kitchen (2019) performed in town (Dance Festival in Montpellier, south of France) with dancing and cooking occurrences on stage. It makes sense, specially about self-esteem, body image and positive opinion from the audience. The women’s physical and psychological states linked with a long lack of space and sensitivity… move to a better self-balance and feelings of well-being. In a similar state of mind, the French confined population – youth to elderly–try to find different and imaginative strategies at home as moving in a restrictive area, enjoying family cooking… through trainings provided by Internet, looking for reducing anxiety, depressive disorders and other social problems. A panel of situations goes from deleterious conflictual relationships, dramatic isolation, to funny and positive ones using creativeness to escape, facing the disruption of daily life.","Vaysse, Jocelyne; Poli, Antonella",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2020.05.002,20200519.0,,Elsevier; PMC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-31

149,Rethinking ‘essential’ and ‘nonessential’: the developmental paediatrician’s COVID-19 response,"While terms such as ‘essential’ and ‘nonessential’ used amidst the COVID-19 pandemic may serve a practical purpose, they also pose a risk of obstructing our view of the harmful indirect health consequences of this crisis. SARS-CoV-2 cases and deaths in children are minimal compared to adults, but the pandemic impacts other ‘essential’ aspects of children’s health including child development and the associated areas of paediatric behaviour, mental health, and maltreatment. Alongside the management of severe SARS-CoV-2 cases in emergency rooms and intensive care units, continuing to care for children with developmental disabilities must also be concurrently championed as ‘essential’ during this crisis. The potentially devastating lifelong effects of the pandemic and isolation on an already vulnerable population demand that action be taken now. Video conferences and phone calls are ‘essential’ instruments we can use to continue to provide quality care for our patients.","Fung, Alastair; Ricci, M Florencia",https://doi.org/10.1093/pch/pxaa077,20200620.0,,PMC; WHO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-31
150,Introduction: changing cultures of speed,"This chapter outlines the widespread acceptance of speed as a positive aspect of urban transport during the 20th century, along with a growing recognition in recent decades that speed may not provide the advantages that have long been assumed. In 21st century urban planning, no longer are higher speeds always seen as the main objective. New goals are increasingly recognised as being more important: accessibility, liveability, economic vitality, child-friendliness, sustainability and health. The concept of ‘health’ in this book applies to human health, as well as economic health and environmental health. We explain how all of these types of health can be enhanced using the simple strategy of slowing city transport. A brief history of increases in transport speed is followed by a discussion of the evolution of the culture of speed in modern societies, to a level that can be compared to an addiction. An important aspect of the culture of speed is the story of motordom, the grouping of automobile clubs, car dealers and car manufacturers that began in the United States in the 1920s. A concerted campaign by motordom comprehensively dismissed the public’s negative views on speed. We then outline how, from the 1980s onwards, new thinking began to emerge about motorised city transport, in which the value of slowing it down became more widely discussed. We provide examples of various slow movements that have emerged since the 1980s. While some citizens and policy-makers may question (or even ridicule) the idea of slow movements, we reflect on where the ‘fast movement’ has taken us over the last 100 years. This chapter concludes with a preview of the chapters and parts of the book.","Tranter, Paul; Tolley, Rodney",https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-815316-1.00001-0,20200626.0,,Elsevier; PMC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-31
151,El impacto de la Gran Recesión en la salud mental en España,"The objective of this article is to identify the effects of the Great Recession on the mental health of people residing in Spain. After presenting a conceptual framework on the mechanisms through which economic crises affect mental health, we describe the main results of 45 papers identified in our search. Studies indicate a worsening of mental health in Spain in the years of economic crisis, especially in men. Working conditions (unemployment, low wages, instability, precariousness) emerge as one of the main channels through which mental health is put at risk or deteriorates. This deterioration occurs with intensity in particularly vulnerable groups, such as immigrant population and families with economic burdens. In the case of suicides, the results were inconclusive. Regarding the use of health care services, an increase in the consumption of certain drugs seems to be identified, although the conclusions of all the studies are not coincidental. Social inequalities in mental health do not seem to have remitted. We conclude that Spain needs to improve information systems to a better understanding of the health effects of economic crises. In terms of public policies, together with the reinforcement of health services aimed at addressing mental health problems, an income guarantee network for people in vulnerable situations should be promoted, as well as the development of policies aimed at the labour market.","Oliva, Juan; López-Varcárcel, Beatriz González; Pérez, Patricia Barber; Peña-Longobardo, Luz María; Garrido, Rosa M.

152,Covid-19 et remaniement des défenses contre la dépression chez les soignants en Ehpad,"Résumé Les réponses des Ehpad à la pandémie et au confinement actuel révèlent et amplifient les défenses habituelles des soignants contre la dépression. Le fait que le danger de mort et l’obligation d’enfermer les résidents viennent de l’extérieur, et le maniement permanent des mesures de protection physique ne suppriment pas le sentiment d’inutilité et l’angoisse de mort qu’ils tolèrent ou évitent d’ordinaire. L’auteur montre qu’ils ajoutent au contraire à leur inquiétude et par conséquent à leur besoin de parole et d’écoute. Summary The responses of nursing homes to the present pandemic and lock-down reveal and amplify the usual defensive mechanisms deployed by professional caregivers against depression. The danger of death and the need to confine the residents, both coming from the outside world, and the permanent management of physical protective measures do not remove the feeling of uselessness and the anxiety of death that the nursing staff habitually tolerates or avoids. On the contrary, these aspects add to caregivers’ need to talk and be listened to.","Charazac, P.

153,"Optimism-pessimism, conspiracy theories and general trust as factors contributing to COVID-19 related behavior – A cross-cultural study","The main aim of this research was to examine the role of optimism-pessimism, general trust and belief in conspiracy theories, in COVID-19 related fears, preventive and hoarding behaviors. We also examined the role of different sources of information in these relations. The convenience sample was used (N = 412) and it consisted of individuals from Serbia (N = 292) and Latin-America (N = 120). Following instruments were used: The Life Orientation Test (Scheier, Carver, & Bridges, 1994), Trust in people scale (Arbor, 1964), questions regarding fear, source of information, preventive behaviors and conspiracy constructed for the purposes of this research. The results suggest that fear of food shortage was the most pronounces one in both samples, followed by fear for oneself and finally by the fear for beloved others. Results suggest that optimists, those with high level of general trust and those who do not believe in conspiracy theories show lower level of fear and higher level of preventive behaviors. Pessimists on the other hand, show higher level of fear. Fear was related to all information sources suggesting that more information leads to higher intensity of fear – except information from the president which did not show any effect.","Jovancevic, Ana; Milicevic, Nebojša",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2020.110216,20200625.0,,Elsevier; PMC; WHO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-31
154,"Public behavior change, perceptions, depression, and anxiety in relation to the COVID-19 outbreak","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 has spread rapidly and world-widely, which elicits public panic and psychological problems. Public protective behaviors and perception play crucial roles in controlling the spread of illness and psychological status. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey in the hardest-hit Hubei province and other areas in China affected by COVID-19 outbreak. Questions about their basic information, the perception of the COVID-19 outbreak, recent preventive or avoidance behaviors, and self-reported mental health scales including the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) were included. Binary logistic regressions were used to investigate the association between personal variables/perceptions and psychological distress. RESULTS: 6,261 people were included for analysis, with 3,613 (57.7%) in Hubei province (1,743 in Wuhan). A majority of people have adopted preventive and avoidance behaviors. People from Hubei, with contact history, and people who or whose family members were infected had much higher depression or anxiety prevalence. Providing truthful and sufficient information, informing the public about the severity of the disease, and perceptions that the outbreak will be control by protective behaviors were associated with lower depression and anxiety prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: Assessing the public response, perception, and psychological burden during the outbreak may help improve public health recommendations and deliver timely psychological intervention. Further researches can focus on the psychological status of a specialized group to identify ways for better support based on public response and psychological demand.","Huang, Jing; Liu, Fangkun; Teng, Ziwei; Chen, Jindong; Zhao, Jingping; Wang, Xiaoping; Wu, Ying; Xiao, Jingmei; Wang, Ying; Wu, Renrong",https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa273,20200703.0,,PMC; WHO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-31
