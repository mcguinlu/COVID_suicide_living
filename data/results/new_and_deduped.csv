8,A French point of view on COVID-19 and obesity,"Beyond age, which remain the main risk factor, there is a wide range of comorbidity associated with severe forms of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)  Obesity is the only one that generated such a strong, almost discriminatory reaction in society or in the medical field  Is this hammering a relevant and efficient way of addressing the issue of the aggravating relationship between COVID-19 and obesity? Pointing out the topic of obesity has an immediate impact on patients’ mental health, adding up to increased difficulties they already experience, mental distress being directly associated to the perception of the discrimination they face  The massive and obsessing reiteration (so much that it ends up inducing culpability) of the vulnerability of obese patients is likely to generate or increase mental disorders that will, in turn, aggravate binge eating and reinforce the medical distancing already observed in this population  Behaviors initiated by the unprecedented situation of the lock down and the alarmist discussions about food and health are so contradictory that their impact of cognitive restraint may induce or worsen eating disorders in patients  © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS","Tubiana, A.; Morvan, R.; Garcia, S.; Lecerf, J.

19,Psychological outcome of COVID-19 pandemic How can we prepare for a psychodemic crisis?; A COVID-19-pandémia mentálhigiénés következményei Hogyan tudunk felkészülni a pszichodémiás krízisre?,"Összefoglaló. Az elmúlt hónapokban életünket alapvetoen megváltoztatta a COVID-19-pandémia, melynek egészségügyi, gazdasági és társadalmi hatásai egyelore szinte felbecsülhetetlenek. A vírusfertozés akut következményei mellett egyre több adat bizonyítja a teljes népességre kifejtett hatásait: a pszichológiai distressz, a depressziós és szorongásos tünetek, valamint az addiktív viselkedésformák gyakoriságának növekedését. Az is nagyon fontos kérdés, hogy a globális válsághelyzet hogyan befolyásolja az öngyilkossági arányszámokat. Írásomban az elmúlt idoszak legjelentosebb pszichiátriai szakirodalma alapján foglalom össze a vírusfertozés akut és krónikus hatásait, valamint a járványhelyzet általános és specifikus pszichológiai-pszichopatológiai következményeit, kiemelt figyelmet fordítva a suicidiumrizikóra és a leginkább veszélyeztetett csoportokra. A vizsgálatok arra utalnak, hogy a pandémia következtében kialakuló mentális gondok és a suicid viselkedés egyre fontosabb népegészségügyi problémává válnak. Bár napjainkban még a vírusfertozöttek gyógyítása és a fertozés terjedésének lassítása a legfontosabb cél, mindannyiunknak fel kell készülnünk a járvány hosszú távú következményeire. A pandémia várható negatív mentálhigiénés hatásainak megelozésére és enyhítésére általános és specifikus módszerek kidolgozása és alkalmazása szükséges. Ebben az egészségügyi, mentálhigiénés és közösségi ellátórendszerek mellett szerepet kell vállalniuk a politikai és gazdasági döntéshozóknak, a társadalmi szervezeteknek és a média munkatársainak is. Hatékony együttmuködésük kulcsfontosságú az egyéni, közösségi és társadalmi szinten is alkalmazható prevenciós stratégiák megvalósításában, hiszen csak így válik lehetové a súlyosabb mentálhigiénés problémák járványszeru elterjedésének, a ""pszichodémiának"" a megelozése. Orv Hetil. 2021; 162(10): 366-374. Summary. In recent months, our lives have been fundamentally changed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the health, economic, and social impacts of which are almost invaluable for the time being. In addition to the acute consequences of viral infection, more and more data are proving its effects on the entire population: an increase in the incidence of psychological distress, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and addictive behaviours. It is also a very important question, how the global crisis is affecting suicide rates. In my paper, I summarize the acute and chronic effects of viral infection and the general and specific psychological-psychopathological consequences of the epidemic based on the most significant psychiatric literature of the recent period, paying special attention to suicidal risk and the most vulnerable groups. Studies suggest that mental troubles and suicidal behaviour resulting from a pandemic are becoming an increasingly important public health problem. Although the treatment of viral infections and slowing the spread of the infection are still the most important goals today, we all need to be prepared for the long-term consequences of the epidemic. In order to prevent and mitigate the expected negative mental health effects of a pandemic, it is necessary to develop and apply general and specific methods. In addition to health care, mental health and community care systems, political and economic decision-makers, civil society organizations and the media must also play a role. Their effective cooperation is key to the implementation of prevention strategies that can be applied at the individual, community and social levels, as this is the only way to prevent the epidemic spread of more serious mental health problems, the ""psychodemia"".

20,Dysfunctional coping mediates the relationship between stress and mental health in health care staff working amid COVID-19 pandemic,"The cross-sectional study aimed to assess the stress outcomes in health care staff working during the Covid-19 pandemic and to explore the role of coping in the relationship between stress outcomes and mental health dimensions with Preacher &amp; Hayes's mediation analysis. 170 participants including physicians (n=41; 24.1%), nurses (n=114, 67.1%) and paramedics (n = 15, 8.8%) with a mean age of 37.69 Â± 12,23 years and an average seniority of 14.40 Â±12.32 years. were administered The Toronto Alexithymia Scale- 20 (TAS - 20), Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), the Emotional Processing Scale (EPS) and Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). The data were analyzed by estimation of simple correlation coefficients and a Preacher and Hayes's mediation procedure. Participants reported elevated levels of stress (7-8 sten on the sten scale developed for the PSS-10 questionnaire). Statistically significant differences in the stress levels between nurses, paramedics and physicians could not determined. In contrast, significant association between mental health outcomes and occupational category could not be found. Coping mediated the relationship between coping strategies and mental health outcomes. A positive and significant relationship was observed between stress, dysfunctional coping strategies and mental health. Our observations support the assumption about a controlling role of coping in the relationship between work-related stress and mental health outcomes in the medical staff working amid pandemic.","WarchoÅ‚-Biedermann, Daroszewski, BÄ…czyk, Greberski, Bugajski, KaroÅ„, Mojs, Ziarko, Jasielska, Samborski",https://doi.org/10.1159/000516181,20210329.0,,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
21,Has the COVID-19 Pandemic Changed the Daily Practices and Psychological State of Orthopaedic Residents?,"The coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has been an unprecedented time for healthcare and has substantially changed resource availability in surgeons' work practices and routines. Many orthopaedic departments suspended elective surgery, and some re-deployed orthopaedic residents to stressful nonorthopaedic tasks; long hours were commonplace. Stress-reaction symptoms such as anxiety and depression have been reported in about 10% of healthcare workers during previous infectious-diseases outbreaks (including the Ebola virus), but little is known about the psychological needs of residents faced with this global disaster. (1) Have anxiety and depression symptoms among orthopaedic residents worsened from the period before to the period after the lockdown in Italy? (2) Are there differences in anxiety and depression symptoms between residents who worked in a COVID-19 department and those who did not? The Italian Association of Orthopaedic and Traumatology Residents is comprised of 365 members who were recruited through the organization's mailing list; they were asked to respond to a survey about their health and well-being at the beginning and end of the first COVID-19 Italian lockdown (March 9, 2020 to May 3, 2020). For the survey's development, 10 orthopaedic surgery residents at the Magna Graecia University of Catanzaro were preliminarily asked to answer the surveys, and both face validity and content validity were tested. The test-retest reliability was 0.9. Impact on and future concerns about family life and daily work practice, as well as sleep disorders, were investigated. Anxiety and depression were assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), which includes 14 questions (seven for anxiety, HADS-A; and seven for depression, HADS-D) on a Likert scale (0-3); thus, a patient can have a score between 0 and 21 for either the HADS-A or HADS-D, with higher scores indicating a greater likelihood of anxiety or depression. Previously reported minimum clinically important differences ranged from 1.5 to 1.7. For each scale, total scores of â‰¤ 7 , 8 to 10, and â‰¥ 11 were taken to represent normal, borderline, or abnormal level of anxiety or depression, respectively. Overall, 75% (272 of 365) of residents completed the survey at both the beginning and end of the lockdown; 72% (196 of 272) were men, the mean Â± SD age was 30 Â± 3 years, 72% (197 of 272) worked in a hospital setting with patients who were COVID-19-positive, 20% (55 of 272) served in a COVID-19 department, and 5% (7 of 139) tested positive for COVID-19 by nasal-pharyngeal swab. Overall, 9% (24 of 272) of residents had family members who contracted COVID-19, and 3% (8 of 272) had a relative who died. Because of the risk of possible COVID-19 exposure, 18% (48 of 272) of residents needed to temporarily change their household given that social distancing was considered the best way to slow the spread of COVID-19. At the end of the lockdown, orthopaedic residents exhibited signs of worsening anxiety and depression as measured by the overall HADS score (median 9 [IQR 5 to 14] versus median 11 [IQR 6 to 17.8], respectively; median difference -1 [95% CI -1.5 to -0.5]; effect size [r] = -0.24; p &lt; 0.001) as well as in the depression subscale (median 4 [IQR 2 to 7] versus median 5.5 [IQR 3 to 8], respectively; median difference -1 [95% CI -1.5 to -0.5]; r = -0.36; p &lt; 0.001). We found no difference in the development of anxiety or depression between residents who worked in a COVID-19 department and those who did not, as demonstrated by comparing the change in HADS scores between these groups (median 1 [IQR -3 to 4] versus median 1 [IQR -2 to 4] in HADS change score over time; median difference 0 [95% CI -1 to 2]; r = -0.03; p = 0.61). The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the daily practice of orthopaedic residents and has had important, far-reaching consequences on their health and well-being, including social implications. Residents showed higher anxiety and depression symptoms at the end of the lockdown. No differences were found in changes of anxiety and depression, over time, for residents who worked in a COVID-19 department compared with those who did not. The evaluation of anxiety and depression through standardized questionnaires could help to identify residents at risk of higher psychological distress who could be referred to regular psychological counseling as a possible prevention strategy during stressful times. Future studies should confirm the long-term effects of these findings.

22,Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Quality of Life of Patients with Parkinson's Disease and Their Caregivers: A Single-Center Survey in Tochigi Prefecture,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has negatively affected the mental health of the general population. We investigated the determinants of quality of life (QOL) in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Impacts of lifestyle changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic on 100 patients with PD and their caregivers/spouses were assessed. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was used to assess anxiety and depression. The physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scores of the short form (SF)-8 were used to evaluate health-related QOL. Regarding health-related QOL, physical function, role physical, general health, vitality and the PCS score were significantly worse in PD patients than in caregivers. Worsening of PD-related symptoms, increased stress, and decreased physical activity were observed in 29.0%, 37.0% and 44.0% of PD patients, respectively. Sixteen patients (16.0%) experienced problems with hospital access, but none reported medication shortages. Strong concerns about COVID-19 were reported by 47.0% of caregivers and 50.0% of PD patients. In PD patients, increased gait disturbance and rigidity, disease severity, smoking, the levodopa equivalent dose and decreased body weight predicted a worse PCS score; anxiety, depression, female sex, stress and long disease duration predicted a worse MCS score. In caregivers, age and smoking contributed to a worse PCS score; depression, stress and worsening patient mood contributed to a worse MCS score. We report the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on health-related QOL and its determinants in PD patients and their caregivers.","Suzuki, Numao, Komagamine, Haruyama, Kawasaki, Funakoshi, Fujita, Suzuki, Okamura, Shiina, Hirata",https://doi.org/10.3233/JPD-212560,20210329.0,COVID-19; Caregivers; Parkinsonâ€™s disease; SARS-CoV-2; quality of life,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
23,Impact of COVID-19 on Individuals With Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Comorbid Anxiety and/or Depression,"The goal of this study was to describe the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on ability to engage in activities and the influence on psychological distress and gastrointestinal symptoms among individuals with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and comorbid anxiety and/or depression. Individuals with IBS and comorbid anxiety and/or depression report increased symptoms and decreased quality of life compared with individuals with IBS alone. The current COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to further influence symptoms among individuals with IBS and comorbid anxiety and/or depression. Individuals who met the Rome-IV IBS criteria and reported mild to severe anxiety and/or depression were included. Participants completed an online survey with questions about anxiety, depression, impact of COVID on activities and symptoms, and demographics. Fifty-five individuals participated in the study. The COVID-19 pandemic most commonly influenced their ability to spend time with friends and family, shop for certain types of food, and access health care. Participants also reported increased stress (92%), anxiety (81%), and depressive symptoms (67%). Finally, around half the sample reported increases in abdominal pain (48%), diarrhea (45%), or constipation (44%). The COVID-19 pandemic is related to self-reported increases in psychological distress and gastrointestinal symptoms among individuals with IBS and comorbid anxiety and/or depression. Additional research is needed to intervene on these symptoms.","Kamp, Levy, Munson, Heitkemper",https://doi.org/10.1097/MCG.0000000000001515,20210329.0,,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
24,The impact of Covid-19 healthcare emergency on the psychological well-being of health professionals: a review of literature,"The Coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19) was first identified in December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, China, and later caused a severe health crisis, causing massive disruptions to most healthcare systems worldwide. The Covid-19 health emergency has seen healthcare workers in the front line facing all the difficulties related to the care burden. One of the most significant and probably underinvestigated aspects is the psychological stress of the healthcare staff managing the emergency. The aim of the paper is to analyze the literature on the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on the psychological well-being of health professionals. We conducted a systematic review of articles published on this topic during the months from January 2020 to December 2020, searching on Pub Med, Scopus and Web of Science databases. Most of the issues can be summarized into five conceptual categories: Stress, Depression and Infection Anxiety, Anguish, Insomnia, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and Suicide. The literature identifies many factors contributing to the onset of anxiety, depression, and stress, like the fear of contracting the disease and transmitting it to family members and friends, stressful shifts, and little rest among several others. The literature highlights the needs for adequate measures, including proper psychological support. The conducted review suggests that the behaviours of healthcare professionals during the emergency phase of the Covid-19 pandemic show psychological disorders that can compromise mental health. Therefore, there is a call for those in chief like hospital managers and policymakers to take action, promoting measures like surveillance, monitoring, and psychological support among others, to increase the resilience of healthcare workers, limiting stress and anxiety and allowing them to keep their performance at work.","Della Monica, Ferrara, Dal Mas, Cobianchi, Scannapieco, F Ruta",https://doi.org/10.7416/ai.2021.2445,20210329.0,emergency management; Covid 19; Psychological stress; healthcare workers; pandemic; psychological assistance; resilience; well-being,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
25,Digital Mental Health Challenges and the Horizon Ahead for Solutions,"The demand outstripping supply of mental health resources during the COVID-19 pandemic presents opportunities for digital technology tools to fill this new gap and, in the process, demonstrate capabilities to increase their effectiveness and efficiency. However, technology-enabled services have faced challenges in being sustainably implemented despite showing promising outcomes in efficacy trials since the early 2000s. The ongoing failure of these implementations has been addressed in reconceptualized models and frameworks, along with various efforts to branch out among disparate developers and clinical researchers to provide them with a key for furthering evaluative research. However, the limitations of traditional research methods in dealing with the complexities of mental health care warrant a diversified approach. The crux of the challenges of digital mental health implementation is the efficacy and evaluation of existing studies. Web-based interventions are increasingly used during the pandemic, allowing for affordable access to psychological therapies. However, a lagging infrastructure and skill base has limited the application of digital solutions in mental health care. Methodologies need to be converged owing to the rapid development of digital technologies that have outpaced the evaluation of rigorous digital mental health interventions and strategies to prevent mental illness. The functions and implications of human-computer interaction require a better understanding to overcome engagement barriers, especially with predictive technologies. Explainable artificial intelligence is being incorporated into digital mental health implementation to obtain positive and responsible outcomes. Investment in digital platforms and associated apps for real-time screening, tracking, and treatment offer the promise of cost-effectiveness in vulnerable populations. Although machine learning has been limited by study conduct and reporting methods, the increasing use of unstructured data has strengthened its potential. Early evidence suggests that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages of incrementing such technology. The limitations of an evidence-based approach require better integration of decision support tools to guide policymakers with digital mental health implementation. There is a complex range of issues with effectiveness, equity, access, and ethics (eg, privacy, confidentiality, fairness, transparency, reproducibility, and accountability), which warrant resolution. Evidence-informed policies, development of eminent digital products and services, and skills to use and maintain these solutions are required. Studies need to focus on developing digital platforms with explainable artificial intelligence-based apps to enhance resilience and guide the treatment decisions of mental health practitioners. Investments in digital mental health should ensure their safety and workability. End users should encourage the use of innovative methods to encourage developers to effectively evaluate their products and services and to render them a worthwhile investment. Technology-enabled services in a hybrid model of care are most likely to be effective (eg, specialists using these services among vulnerable, at-risk populations but not severe cases of mental ill health).","Balcombe, De Leo",https://doi.org/10.2196/26811,20210329.0,COVID-19; challenges; digital mental health implementation; explainable artificial intelligence; human-computer interaction; hybrid model of care; resilience; technology,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30

Nurses who were actively and daily involved in the care of COVID-19 patients on selected intensive care units (ICU) and non-ICU wards were included. Depression, somatization, anxiety and distress scores were calculated using the Four-Dimensional Symptom Questionnaire (4DSQ). The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and Brief-COPE questionnaires were used to assess respectively the psychological impact and coping strategies. Participants were asked to fill in the questionnaire at the start of inclusion, 4Â weeks later and 8Â weeks later.<b>Results</b>: In total, 39/42 included nurses participated in the study. 4DSQ results showed low rates of depression, anxiety and somatization with a declining trend over time. Distress scores however were high throughout the study period. A past history of stress symptoms was significantly associated with higher distress scores at the inclusion and one month follow-up. As major psychological impact, more participants experienced 'intrusion' compared to 'avoidance' specifically among nurses working on ICU. In 10% of participants, IES-R-scores were predictive for post-traumatic stress disorder.<b>Conclusion</b>: Healthcare workers dealing with COVID-19 patients during the pandemic reported high and enduring distress scores and experienced a major impact on mental health, especially when employed at ICU.

27,"Resilience, coping style, and COVID-19 stress: effects on the quality of life in frontline health care workers","The aims of the study were to assess the contribution of resilience, coping style, and COVID-19 stress on the quality of life (QOL) in frontline health care workers (HCWs). The study was a cross-sectional surveyperformed among 309 HCWs in a tertiaryhospital during the outbreak of COVID-19 in China. Data were collected through an anonymous, self-rated questionnaire, including demographic data, a 10-item COVID-19 stress questionnaire, Generic QOL Inventory-74, Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, and the Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire. Hierarchical regression was used to analyse the relationship between the study variables and the QOL. Among the 309 participants, resilience and active coping were positively correlated with the QOL (P&lt;0.001), whereas, working in confirmed case wards, COVID-19 stress, and passive coping were negatively correlated with the QOL (P&lt;0.001). Resilience and the active coping were negatively correlated with COVID-19 stress (P&lt;0.001). Resilience, coping style,and COVID-19 stressaccounted for 32%, 13%, and 8% of the variance in predicting the Global QOL, respectively.

28,Psychological well-being and coping strategies of elderly people during the COVID-19 pandemic in Hungary,"During COVID-19 lockdown the enforced social isolation and other pandemic-related changes highly increased the risk of mental health problems. We aimed to discover how elderly people coped with the psychological burdens of pandemic and the social isolation in Hungary. This study included 589 (441 females) Hungarian individuals, aged 60-83 (<i>M</i>â€‰=â€‰68.1, SD = 4.46). We collected online survey data to reach a wide population of elderly. Results of hierarchical linear modelling and structural equation modelling (SEM) analyses established how the current life-changing circumstances, the intolerance of uncertainty, loneliness and social support influence the mental health (e.g. depression, anxiety, well-being) of the elderly. The model was used to explore how adaptive and maladaptive emotion regulation strategies mediated the effects. Findings showed that perceived change in mood, social connectedness, and quality of life was negatively affected by catastrophizing and loneliness; whereas positive refocusing and contamination fear had a positive effect. According to the SEM analysis, intolerance of uncertainty and loneliness directly affected mental health. Further, maladaptive emotion regulation strategies mediated the connection between intolerance of uncertainty, contamination fear, loneliness and mental health. Whereas adaptive emotion regulation strategy mediated the connection between social support from friends, contamination fear, loneliness and mental health. Overall, our research might help the understanding of how external and internal factors contributed to the well-being of elderly people during the COVID-19. The model can also be translated into professional interventions to develop coping strategies among elderly for the challenges of COVID-19 pandemic in their lives.","LÃ¡badi, AratÃ³, Budai, InhÃ³f, Stecina, SÃ­k, ZsidÃ³",https://doi.org/10.1080/13607863.2021.1902469,20210329.0,Aging; coronavirus; mental health; social isolation; structural equation modelling,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30

31,Gender Differences in Psychological and Behavioral Responses of Infected and Uninfected Health-Care Workers During the Early COVID-19 Outbreak,"<b>Objective:</b> Understanding gender differences in responses of health-care workers (HCWs) to COVID-19 outbreak is an effective way to promote customized supports. <b>Methods:</b> During February 2020, 103 HCWs infected with COVID-19 (64 females and 39 males) and 535 uninfected HCWs (383 females and 152 males) were recruited in a cross-sectional study. Level of attention, six emotional status, and self-evaluation of eight protective measures were recorded. Multivariable Firth's logistic regressions were applied to explored independent effect of gender. <b>Results:</b> During early outbreak, female HCWs were more likely to give greater attention, adjusted OR:1.92 (95%CI 1.14-3.23) in total HCWs. Higher proportion of anxiety was observed in female HCWs, adjusted OR:3.14 (95%CI 1.98-4.99) for total HCWs, 4.32(95%CI 1.32-14.15) for infected HCWs and 2.97 (1.78, 4.95) for uninfected HCWs. Proportion of pessimism, fear, full of fighting spirit, and optimism were low, and no gender differences were observed. During a later outbreak, a majority of HCWs reported being very familiar with eight protective measures. After training, a proportion of high self-evaluation in hand hygiene, wearing gloves, and surgical masks increased independently in female HCWs, and adjusted ORs were 3.07 (95% CI 1.57-5.99), 2.37 (95% CI 1.26-4.49), and 1.92 (95% CI 1.02-3.62), respectively. Infection status amplified gender difference in anxiety, hand hygiene, and glove wearing. <b>Conclusion:</b> Female HCWs perceived the outbreak seriously, effective emotional and psychological well-ness should be targeted at female HCWs preferentially, and male HCWs should be encouraged to express their feelings and be further trained.","Huang, Luo, Wang, Jin, Zeng",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.638975,20210329.0,coronavirus disease 2019; gender difference; healthcare worker; protective measures; psychological status,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
32,"Media consumption and mental health during COVID-19 lockdown: a UK cross-sectional study across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland","As individuals adjust to new 'norms' and ways of living during the COVID-19 lockdown, there is a continuing need for up-to-date information and guidance. Evidence suggests that frequent media exposure is related to a higher prevalence of mental health problems, especially anxiety and depression. The aim of this study was to determine whether COVID-19 related media consumption is associated with changes in mental health outcomes. This paper presents baseline data from the COVID-19 Psychological Wellbeing Study. The cross-sectional study data was collected using an online survey following the Generalised Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), with some other basic information collected. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the influence of socio-demographic and media specific factors on anxiety and depression. The study suggested that media usage is statistically significantly associated with anxiety and depression on the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scales with excessive media exposure related to higher anxiety and depression scores. This study indicated that higher media consumption was associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression. Worldwide it should be acknowledged that excessive media consumption, particularly social media relating to COVID-19, can have an effect on mental health. However, as this was a cross-sectional study we cannot infer any directionality as we cannot infer cause and effect; therefore, future research involving longitudinal data collection and analyses of variables over time is warranted.","Neill, Blair, Best, McGlinchey, Armour",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10389-021-01506-0,20210329.0,Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Media consumption; Mental health,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
33,Meditating in Virtual Reality 3: 360Â° Video of Perceptual Presence of Instructor,"The need for remote delivery of mental health interventions including instruction in meditation has become paramount in the wake of the current global pandemic. However, the support one may usually feel within the physical presence of an instructor may be weakened when interventions are delivered remotely, potentially impacting one's meditative experiences. Use of head-mounted displays (HMD) to display video-recorded instruction may increase one's sense of psychological presence with the instructor as compared to presentation via regular flatscreen (e.g., laptop) monitor. This research therefore evaluated a didactic, trauma-informed care approach to instruction in mindfulness meditation by comparing meditative responses to an instructor-guided meditation when delivered face-to-face vs. by pre-recorded 360Â° videos viewed either on a standard flatscreen monitor (2D format) or via HMD (i.e., virtual reality [VR] headset; 3D format). Young adults (<i>n</i> = 82) were recruited from a university introductory course and experienced a 360Â° video-guided meditation via HMD (VR condition, 3D format). They were also randomly assigned to practice the same meditation either via scripted face-to-face instruction (in vivo [IV] format) or when viewed on a standard laptop display (non-VR condition, 2D format). Positive and negative affect and meditative experience ratings were self-reported and participants' maintenance of focused attention to breathing (i.e., meditation breath attention scores [MBAS]) were recorded during each meditation. Meditating in VR (3D format) was associated with a heightened experience of awe overall. When compared to face-to-face instruction (IV format), VR meditation was rated as less embarrassing but also less enjoyable and more tiring. When compared to 2D format, VR meditations were associated with greater experiences of relaxation, less distractibility from the process of breathing, and less fatigue. No differences were found between VR and non-VR meditation in concentration (MBAS). Baseline posttraumatic stress symptoms were risk factors for experiencing distress while meditating in either (VR and non-VR) instructional format. Of those who reported a preference for one format, approximately half preferred the VR format and approximately half preferred the IV format. Recorded 360Â° video instruction in meditation viewed with a HMD (i.e., VR/3D format) appears to offer some experiential advantage over instructions given in 2D format and may offer a safe-and for some even preferred-alternative to teaching meditation face-to-face.

34,Is COVID-19 Immune to Misinformation? A Brief Overview,"During the current COVID-19 pandemic, misinformation is a major challenge, raising several social and psychological concerns. This article highlights the prevailing misinformation as an outbreak containing hoaxes, myths, and rumours. In comparison to traditional media, online media platforms facilitate misinformation even more widely. To further affirm this ethical concern, the researchers cite relevant studies demonstrating the role of new media in misinformation and its potential consequences. Besides other significant psychosocial impacts, such as xenophobia, psychological distress, LGBT rights violation, gender-based violence, misinformation is undermining healthcare workers' psychological health and their efforts to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. In view of the adverse consequences of misinformation, this article addresses it as a massive ethical challenge during the current outbreak. Thus, the researchers make relevant suggestions to evaluate misinformation sources and mitigate the psychosocial impacts attributed to misinformation during crises. They include forming mental health teams comprising of psychologists, psychiatrists, and trained paramedical staff; rapid dissemination of authentic and updated COVID-19 situation reports regularly; establishing helpline services; and recognizing a broader range of personal needs. All health authorities should make clear that they are listening and responding to public concerns. Much effort is needed to counteract COVID-19 misinformation.","Ali, Khalid, Zahid",https://doi.org/10.1007/s41649-020-00155-x,20210329.0,COVID-19; Healthcare; Mass media; Misinformation; Pandemic; Social media,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
35,A Longitudinal Study on Generalized Anxiety Among University Students During the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Switzerland,"The COVID-19 pandemic and government measures implemented to counter the spread of the infection may be a major stressor affecting the psychological health of university students. This study aimed to explore how anxiety symptoms changed during the pandemic. 676 students (76% females) at Zurich University of Applied Sciences participated in the first (T0) and second (T1) survey waves. Anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-Scale-7 (GAD-7). Risk and protective factors (e.g., COVID-19-related variables) were examined. GAD-7 scores decreased significantly from T0 to T1 (mean change: -0.446, SE = 0.132, 95% CI: -0.706, -0.186, <i>t</i> = -3.371, <i>df</i> = 659, <i>p</i> = 0.001). Participants with moderate-to-severe anxiety score were 20.2 and 15.6% at T0 and T1, respectively. The following positively predicted anxiety: older age, female gender, non-Swiss nationality, loneliness, participants' concern about their own health, and interaction between time and participants' concern about their own health. Resilience and social support negatively predicted anxiety. Our findings provide information for public health measures and psychological interventions supporting the mental health of university students during the COVID-19 emergency.","Amendola, von Wyl, Volken, Zysset, Huber, Dratva",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.643171,20210329.0,COVID-19 pandemic; anxiety; coronavirus; linear mixed model; lockdown; longitudinal,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
36,Don't Think That Kids Aren't Noticing: Indirect Pathways to Children's Fear of COVID-19,"The present study is couched within Rachman's three-pathway theory of fear acquisition (Rachman, 1977, 1991). Besides the direct contact with the objects of fear, this model also includes two indirect pathways to fear acquisition: negative information transmission and modeling. The study aims to explore the contribution of these three factors to the level of children's fear of COVID-19. The sample consisted of 376 children (59.6% girls), aged 7-19 (<i>M</i><sub>age</sub> = 12.77, SD<sub>age</sub> = 3.57), and one of their parents (<i>M</i><sub>age</sub> = 42.88, SD<sub>age</sub> = 6.00). The survey was conducted online during the COVID-19 national state of emergency in the Republic of Serbia. The children assessed their fear of COVID-19, general fearfulness, negative information transmission, and modeling by their parents, as well as the level of exposure to negative information outside their home. The parents assessed their own fear of COVID-19 and trait anxiety. Parents' anxiety, children's age, and children's general fearfulness were used as covariates. The results of our path analysis provide support for Rachman's notion of indirect pathways. The more the parents were afraid of COVID-19, the more they expressed this (either verbally or through their behavior), which in turn led to an increase in the children's fear of COVID-19. Furthermore, children's exposure to negative information related to COVID-19, provided by their teachers and peers or stemming from the media, directly contributed to the level of children's fear. The results of the study emphasize the importance of caregivers' behavior during global health crises and provide some clues as to what caregivers may do to protect their children's mental health in such circumstances.","RadanoviÄ‡, MiciÄ‡, PavloviÄ‡, KrstiÄ‡",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.635952,20210329.0,COVID-19; children; fear; indirect pathways; parents,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
37,Longitudinal Trajectories of Study Characteristics and Mental Health Before and During the COVID-19 Lockdown,"The <i>COVID-19 lockdown</i> has significantly disrupted the higher education environment within the Netherlands and led to changes in available study-related resources and study demands of students. These changes in <i>study resources</i> and <i>study demands</i>, the uncertainty and confusion about educational activities, the developing fear and anxiety about the disease, and the implementation of the COVID-19 lockdown measures may have a significant impact on the <i>mental health</i> of students. As such, this study aimed to investigate the trajectory patterns, rate of change, and longitudinal associations between study resources-demands and mental health of 141 university students from the Netherlands before and during the COVID-19 lockdown. The present study employed a longitudinal design and a piecewise latent growth modeling strategy to investigate the changes in study resources and mental health over a 3 month period. The results showed that moderate levels of student resources significantly decreased before, followed by a substantial rate of increase during, lockdown. In contrast, study demands and mental health were reported to be moderate and stable throughout the study. Finally, the growth trajectories of study resources-demands and mental health were only associated before the lockdown procedures were implemented. Despite growing concerns relating to the negative psychological impact of COVID-19 on students, our study shows that the mental health during the initial COVID-19 lockdown remained relatively unchanged.","van Zyl, Rothmann, Zondervan-Zwijnenburg",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.633533,20210329.0,COVID-19; coronavirus; mental health; piecewise latent growth modeling; study resources; university students,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
38,The Effect of Religion on Psychological Resilience in Healthcare Workers During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic,"<b>Background:</b> Healthcare workers in the front line of diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are at great risk of both infection and developing mental health symptoms. This study aimed to investigate the following: (1) whether healthcare workers in general hospitals experience higher mental distress than those in psychiatric hospitals; (2) the role played by religion and alexithymic trait in influencing the mental health condition and perceived level of happiness of healthcare workers amidst the stress of the COVID-19 pandemic; and (3) factors that influence the resilience of healthcare workers at 6 weeks' follow-up. <b>Methods:</b> Four-hundred and fifty-eight healthcare workers were recruited from general and psychiatric hospitals, and 419 were followed-up after 6 weeks. All participants filled out the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale, five-item Brief-Symptom Rating Scale, and the Chinese Oxford Happiness Questionnaire. <b>Results:</b> Under the stress of the COVID-19 pandemic, 12.3% of frontline healthcare workers in general hospitals reported having mental distress and perceived lower social adaptation status compared with those working in psychiatric hospitals. Christians/Catholics perceived better psychological well-being, and Buddhists/Taoists were less likely to experience mental distress. The results at 6 weeks of follow-up showed that the perceived lower social adaptation status of general hospital healthcare workers was temporary and improved with time. Christian/Catholic religion and time had independent positive effects on psychological well-being; however, the interaction of Christian/Catholic religion and time had a negative effect. <b>Conclusions:</b> Collectivism and individualism in the cultural context are discussed with regard to alexithymic trait and Buddhist/Taoist and Christian/Catholic religious faiths. Early identification of mental distress and interventions should be implemented to ensure a healthy and robust clinical workforce for the treatment and control of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Chang, Chen, Lee, Lin, Chiang, Tsai, Kuo, Lung",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.628894,20210329.0,COVID-19; health care workers; mental distress; religion; resilience,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
39,Social Support and Hope Mediate the Relationship Between Gratitude and Depression Among Front-Line Medical Staff During the Pandemic of COVID-19,"The pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has burdened an unprecedented psychological stress on the front-line medical staff, who are at high risk of depression. While existing studies and theories suggest that factors such as gratitude, social support, and hope play a role in the risk of depression, few studies have combined these factors to explore the relationship between them. This study examined the mediating roles of social support and hope in the relationship between gratitude and depression among front-line medical staff during the pandemic of COVID-19. This study used the Gratitude Questionnaire, the Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS), the State Hope Scale (SHS), and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale to examine the gratitude, social support, hope, and depression among 344 front-line medical workers in Wuhan, which was the hardest-hit area of COVID-19 in China. The results showed that the prevalence of mild depressive disorder was 40.12% and the prevalence of major depressive disorder was 9.59% among front-line medical staff during the pandemic of COVID-19; gratitude has a direct and negative effect on depression. Gratitude was negative predictors of depression through the mediating variables of social support and hope [Î² <sub> <i>gratitude</i> </sub><sub>-</sub><sub> <i>social support</i> </sub><sub>-</sub><sub> <i>depression</i> </sub> = -0.096, 95%CI(-0.129 to -0.064); Î² <sub> <i>gratitude</i> </sub><sub>-</sub><sub> <i>hope</i> </sub><sub>-</sub><sub> <i>depression</i> </sub> = -0.034, 95%CI(-0.055 to -0.013)], as well as via an indirect path from social support to hope [Î² <sub> <i>gratitude</i> </sub><sub>-</sub><sub> <i>social support</i> </sub><sub>-</sub><sub> <i>hope</i> </sub><sub>-</sub><sub> <i>depression</i> </sub> = -0.089, 95%CI (-0.108 to -0.070)]. The study findings indicate that gratitude as a positive emotion can reduce depression in medical staff by promoting social support and hope, respectively. Gratitude also reduced depression in health care workers through a chain mediating effect of social support and hope. Overall, gratitude can directly foster social support and hope, and protect people from stress and depression, which has implications for clinical interventions among front-line medical staff during the pandemic of COVID-19.","Feng, Yin",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.623873,20210329.0,COVID-19; depression; gratitude; hope; social support,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
40,&quot;What If We Get Sick?&quot;: Spanish Adaptation and Validation of the Fear of Illness and Virus Evaluation Scale in a Non-clinical Sample Exposed to the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Distinct sources of stress have emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic. Particularly, fear is expected to generate significant psychological burden on individuals and influence on either unsafe behavior that may hinder recovery efforts or virus-mitigating behaviors. However, little is known about the properties of measures to capture them in research and clinical settings. To resolve this gap, we evaluated the psychometric properties of a novel measure of fear of illness and viruses and tested its predictive value for future development of distress. We extracted a random sample of 450 Chilean adult participants from a large cross-sectional survey panel and invited to participate in this intensive longitudinal study for 35 days. Of these, 163 ended up enrolling in the study after the demanding nature of the measurement schedule was clearly explained to them. For this final sample, we calculated different Confirmatory Factor Analyses (CFA) to evaluate the preliminary proposed structure for the instrument. Complementarily, we conducted a content analysis of the items to qualitatively extract its latent structure, which was also subject to empirical test via CFA. Results indicated that the original structure did not fit the data well; however, the new proposed structure based on the content analysis did. Overall, the modified instrument showed good reliability through all subscales both by its internal consistency with Cronbach's alphas ranging from 0.814 to 0.913, and with test-retest correlations ranging from 0.715 to 0.804. Regarding its convergent validity, individuals who scored higher in fears tended to also score higher in depressive and posttraumatic stress symptoms at baseline. Furthermore, higher fears at baseline predicted a higher score in posttraumatic stress symptomatology 7 days later. These results provide evidence for the validity, reliability, and predictive performance of the scale. As the scale is free and multidimensional potentially not circumscribed to COVID-19, it might work as a step toward understanding the psychological impact of current and future pandemics, or further life-threatening health situations of similar characteristics. Limitations, practical implications, and future directions for research are discussed.","Cottin, HernÃ¡ndez, NÃºÃ±ez, LabbÃ©, Quevedo, Davanzo, Behn",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.590283,20210329.0,COVID-19; FIVE; SARS-CoV-2; Spanish adaptation and validation; fear; pandemic; psychological impact; virus,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
41,Side by Side: Reflections on Two Lifetimes of Dance,"Telling stories about our experiences in dance brings to light unconscious knowledge and memories of the past and helps us understand our own decisions and practices. Reflexivity and story telling is central in the process of remembering and embodies some of the key aspects of autoethnography as a research tool. We are directed to examine and reflect on our experiences, analyzing goals and intentions, making connections between happenings and recounting each single experience. Dance has the potential for positive impact on both physical and mental health among professional dancers as well as among dance students and has the power to connect them to culture and community in unique and important ways. Research has provided evidence that arts engagement provides positive forms of social inclusion, opportunities to share arts, culture, language, and values and points to the value of the arts in the prevention and amelioration of health problems. Together with those benefits of a dance experience there is clear evidence of what can be learned in, through and about dance. In this time of the Covid-19 pandemic it seemed more relevant and poignant to examine our own experiences in dance as well as those experiences of others that have influenced our lives.","Kipling Brown, Penniston Gray",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.587379,20210329.0,access; dance; education; embodiment; participation; self-care,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
42,Physical Activity Protects Against the Negative Impact of Coronavirus Fear on Adolescent Mental Health and Well-Being During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"<b>Background:</b> The severity of the Coronavirus pandemic has led to lockdowns in different countries to reduce the spread of the infection. These lockdown restrictions are likely to be detrimental to mental health and well-being in adolescents. Physical activity can be beneficial for mental health and well-being; however, research has yet to examine associations between adolescent physical activity and mental health and well-being during lockdown. <b>Purpose:</b> Examine the effects of adolescent perceived Coronavirus prevalence and fear on mental health and well-being and investigate the extent to which physical activity can be a protective factor against these concerns. <b>Methods:</b> During United Kingdom lockdown restrictions, 165 participants (100 female, aged 13-19) completed an online questionnaire assessing perceived Coronavirus prevalence and fear, physical activity, and indicators of mental health and well-being (stress, anxiety, depression, fatigue, vitality, and perceived health). Separate hierarchical multiple linear regression analyses (with age, gender, perceived Coronavirus prevalence, and fear entered in step 1, and physical activity in step 2) were run to predict each well-being outcome. <b>Results:</b> Regression analyses indicated that in general, while Coronavirus fear was a negative predictor, physical activity was a positive and stronger predictor of enhanced mental health and well-being outcomes. <b>Conclusion:</b> Findings suggest that physical activity during the Coronavirus pandemic can counteract the negative effects of Coronavirus fear on adolescent mental health and well-being. Therefore, physical activity should be promoted during lockdown to support good mental health and well-being.","Wright, Williams, Veldhuijzen van Zanten",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.580511,20210329.0,COVID-19; anxiety; exercise; fatigue; stress; youth,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
43,"Coping Styles, Mental Health, and the COVID-19 Quarantine: A Nationwide Survey in Poland","<b>Background:</b> The outbreak of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 that began from March 2020 is yet to be contained. Consequences of the ongoing pandemic may have a negative impact on the mental health of affected individuals. This particularly refers to those quarantined. Since the COVID-19 pandemic is currently one of the biggest health issues worldwide, a higher demand emerges for research concentrating on the worsening of psychological well-being among the general and the quarantined population, as well as on individual coping strategies that may moderate the occurrence of psychopathologies. <b>Method:</b> Data were collected within the first weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland. Participants represented quarantine (+) and quarantine (-) groups. Quarantine (+) group, different from quarantine (-), consisted of people who experienced it themselves or someone close to them did after contacting an infected individual. To measure psychopathological symptoms a General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) was used. For measuring PTSD symptoms, the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) was used. This study followed the coping strategies manifested among the participants using the MiniCope questionnaire. <b>Results:</b> A total of 2,036 individuals participated in this study. Quarantine (+) individuals had significantly higher total and subscales GHQ-28 scores (anxiety, insomnia, and somatic symptoms) as well as a higher IES-R arousal score. The quarantine (+) individuals were more likely to use self-distraction as a coping strategy. This research identified positive and negative correlations between presented coping styles and manifested psychopathology. <b>Conclusion:</b> This nationwide study suggests occurrence of negative effects on mental health due to the COVID-19 pandemic and quarantine. It is observed on most of the measured psychopathological symptoms. The present research provides a line of action that should be followed in the future in case of another epidemic and in the event restrictions like quarantine have to be introduced again.","KoÅ‚odziejczyk, Misiak, SzczeÅ›niak, Maciaszek, CiuÅ‚kowicz, Åuc, Wieczorek, Fila-Witecka, Chladzinska-Kiejna, Rymaszewska",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.625355,20210329.0,COVID-19; coping styles; mental health; quarantine; stress,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
44,Effectiveness of a Virtual Exercise Program During COVID-19 Confinement on Blood Pressure Control in Healthy Pregnant Women,"The situation caused by COVID-19 has led to movement restrictions for the majority of the population due to the confinement established by the health authorities. This new situation has changed people's habits and significantly affected the pregnant population. Decreased exercise and increased psychophysical stress are associated with excessive weight gain, diabetes, and gestational cardiovascular complications that affect the mother, fetus, and newborn. Recent research shows that the dynamics of maternal blood pressure is one of the most important control factors during pregnancy. Thus, prevention of these type of pathologies through interventions without maternal-fetal risks is important. To examine the influence of a virtual exercise program on maternal blood pressure during pregnancy. A randomized clinical trial design was used (NCT04563065). Data from 72 pregnant women without obstetric contraindications under confinement conditions in the Madrid area were collected. Women were randomly assigned to the intervention (IG) or control group (CG). They previously signed informed consent forms. A moderate exercise program was performed as an intervention from 8-10 to 38-39 weeks of pregnancy. Systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) maternal blood pressure were measured during the first, second and third trimesters of pregnancy, as well as before and immediately after delivery in both study groups. No differences in systolic and diastolic blood pressure during the first, second and third trimesters were found between groups. Significant differences in SBP were found immediately before delivery (IG = 119.83 Â± 10.16 vs. CG = 125.6 Â± 10.91; <i>p</i> = 0.047) and immediately after delivery (IG = 115.00 Â± 11.18 vs. CG = 122.24 Â± 15.71; <i>p</i> = 0.045).

45,"Validation of the FCV-19 Scale and Assessment of Fear of COVID-19 in the Population of Mozambique, East Africa","This study aimed to validate the Portuguese version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) and investigate its association with sociodemographic and pandemic-related variables in the population of Mozambique. A cross-sectional online survey recruited 387 Mozambicans aged 18 to 70 years. The psychometric properties of the Portuguese version of the FCV-19S were evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis and Rash analysis. Additionally, the association of the FCV-19S with sociodemographic and pandemic-related variables was investigated using the two-sample <i>t</i>-test, one-way analysis of variance, and logistic regression. The unidimensional factor structure of the Portuguese version of the FCV-19S was confirmed, and the scale showed good internal consistency reliability. The FCV-19S properties tested from the Rasch analysis were satisfactory. Women and those with lower education levels had higher scores of fear. Moreover, significantly higher levels of fear were observed among those being in an at-risk group for COVID-19, having family members or friends diagnosed or with death confirmed by COVID-19, and not being confident that they would receive adequate care from the public health services in case of COVID-19 infection. The Portuguese version of FCV-19S has strong psychometric properties and can be used to assess the fear of COVID-19 in the Portuguese-speaking population of Mozambique. As the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health represents a challenge to clinical psychiatry, and information on mental health in African countries is still scarce, our findings may assist in the planning of public mental health policies, aimed mainly at specific segments of the population, such as women and people in extreme poverty.","Giordani, Giolo, Muhl, Estavela, Mabuie Gove",https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S298948,20210329.0,fear scale; infection; mental health; pandemic; psychometrics,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
46,Adaptations of an Integrated Behavioral Health Program During COVID-19,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has consistently been described as an &quot;unprecedented&quot; global health crisis. While the focus has been primarily on the medical and economic impact of the pandemic, psychological sequelae are anticipated. Primary care is the main point of access for mental health care in the United States, making it the ideal locale to provide psychological services for a larger proportion of the population than traditional mental health care settings. The aim of this paper is to describe how our multi-state, multi-site integrated primary care program adapted and applied cognitive behavioral therapy in the context of COVID-19. Access to mental health care was disrupted despite burgeoning mental health concerns, necessitating novel approaches to providing care. A stepped-care approach was implemented within our primary care practice, which consisted of a combination of low-intensity, high-yield stress management and resiliency building resources and cognitive behavioral therapy that were delivered flexibly based on patient preference, technological capabilities, state ordinances, insurance coverage, and institutional policies. The lessons learned from this experience can inform other integrated primary care clinics in responding to the current and future pandemics.","Bogucki, Mattson, Leasure, Berg, Mulholland, Sawchuk",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpra.2021.01.006,20210329.0,COVID-19; cognitive behavioral therapy; integrated care,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
47,&quot;Staying Home - Feeling Positive&quot;: Effectiveness of an on-line positive psychology group intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic,"The current study investigated the effectiveness of a group on-line positive psychology intervention (OPPI) designed to mitigate the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent measures to control it. Study participants (<i>N</i>â€‰=â€‰82, <i>M</i><sub> <i>age</i> </sub> â€‰=â€‰33.07, <i>SD</i>â€‰=â€‰9.55) were all Greek adults divided into an intervention (<i>n</i>â€‰=â€‰44) and a control group (<i>n</i>â€‰=â€‰38). The intervention group attended a voluntary, online, two-week, six-session (each 50Â min), group intervention. The intervention aimed at enhancing participants' personal strengths and resilience in order to cope more effectively with the psychological impact of social distancing (e.g., feelings of anxiety, sadness, fear, and/or loneliness). All participants completed an online questionnaire one week before the intervention's implementation, which included scales measuring their: demographic characteristics, empathy, resilience, affectivity, feelings of loneliness, depression and anxiety levels, and feelings of fear regarding the outbreak. Participants in both the intervention and control group completed the same measures the week following the intervention's termination to examine its effects, and two weeks later to examine its long-term effectiveness. The intervention was found to be effective in alleviating the impact of the pandemic and in strengthening participants' resilience. More specifically, the results showed significant decreases for the intervention group in all measures of psychosocial distress (anxiety, depression, loneliness and fear) and significant increases in empathy, resilience, and experience of positive emotions. The study's implications for the development and implementation of online psychological interventions during a crisis are discussed.","Brouzos, Vassilopoulos, Baourda, Tassi, Stavrou, Moschou, Brouzou",https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-01613-x,20210329.0,COVID-19; Group intervention; Resilience; Social distancing; Telemental health,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
48,"COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath: Knowledge, attitude, behavior, and mental health-care needs of medical undergraduates","The undeniable impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the educational sector has left the students perplexed and uncertain. Infection-related fears, inevitable loneliness, disturbed routine making way for adverse lifestyle habits, stressors such as financial crisis faced by their families, and many more further accentuate their vulnerability to mental health issues. The aim was to assess the knowledge, attitude, and behavior of medical undergraduate students about the COVID-19 outbreak, and to assess their stress, anxiety, depression, and quality of life (QOL). The study also explored the correlation between the knowledge, attitude, and behavior of the medical undergraduate students about the pandemic and their mental health issues. An online questionnaire-based survey was carried out on medical undergraduate students. The survey tool comprised a semi-structured proforma; General Health Questionnaire-12 items; Depression, Anxiety, and Stress scale-21 items; and European Health Interview Survey-Quality of Life-8 items. Nearly 61.8% of the students seemed well read and had good knowledge about the medical aspects of the pressing issue of COVID-19, and majority of the students had adaptive attitudes and behaviors toward the pandemic. Almost 23.2% of the students had depression, 20.7% had anxiety, and 13.0% had stress ranging from mild to extremely severe. Nearly 75.1% of the students experienced changes in appetite and 53.6% had changes in appetite. Nearly half of the students expressed excessive worries regarding studies. The mean score of QOL of students was 3.9 Â± 0.6. Students with adaptive attitudes and behavior experienced relatively less severe depression, anxiety, and stress compared to their counterparts. A significant portion of the medical undergraduates are experiencing mental health issues and study related concerns due to the adversity brought by the pandemic. The concerned educational bodies and institutes must take up necessary steps to mitigate the adverse effects of the pandemic on students.","Shailaja, Singh, Chaudhury, Thyloth",https://doi.org/10.4103/ipj.ipj_117_20,20210329.0,Anxiety; COVID-19; attitude; behavior; depression; knowledge; medical students; pandemic; psychiatric morbidity; psychological impact; quality of life; stress,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
49,Psychological management of mental health concerns related to COVID-19: A review of guidelines and recommendations,"Many publications have delineated strategies for mental health care to respond to psychological concerns and ramifications related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The current review aims to encapsulate existing guidelines and recommendations of psychological management for mental health care for the general population, health-care professionals, children, and elderly populations, applied to a pandemic in particular reference to COVID-19. The literature on psychological care of such repercussions of COVID-19 was retrieved via a search in PubMed and Google database. Of 91 retrieved initial articles, only 18 were selected for final analysis, which was divided into two categories: (a) guidelines by government/public health bodies (<i>n</i> = 11) and (b) publications in peer-reviewed journals (<i>n</i> = 7). The recommendations can be summed but not limited to psychoeducation from a reliable source, normalization of stress, behavioral activation, scheduling of activities with a bespoke blending of recreational and daily chores, supportive care, staying digitally connected, relaxation techniques, ensuring rest, rotating shifts and short breaks during working hours, curtailing media consumption, fostering community resilience, seeking and sharing support from colleagues/supervisors, avoidance of abusing psychoactive substances, online consultation of mental health professionals on need, and participatory communication in a developmentally appropriate way with children. In the absence of observational and controlled studies on psychological management during pandemic times, we recommend such research soon.","Samantaray, Pattanaik, Srivastava, Singh",https://doi.org/10.4103/ipj.ipj_81_20,20210329.0,Children; coronavirus disease 2019; elderly; general populations; health-care professionals; mental health; pandemic; psychological management,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30

52,[Indirect and direct psychosocial consequences of the corona pandemic-partÂ 1 of aÂ (preliminary) review],"The pandemic triggered by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has, apart from aÂ few positive effects, led to massive and manifold impairments of human living conditions for which this article suggests aÂ taxonomy. According to the severity, these impairments have resulted in a deterioration of the psychological well-being for many people and an increased vulnerability for psychological disorders. This has been confirmed by numerous studies and review articles, which also dealt with the question of factors that positively as well as negatively influencing mental health. This review shows that, e.g. suffering from COVID-19 disease, younger age and female gender as well as aÂ pre-existing psychiatric or somatic disease must be considered as special risk factors. Psychotherapists are confronted with the pandemic in different ways. In view of the societal impact psychotherapists have aÂ special role. In addition, the pandemic raises questions on specific issues and specific groups which must be addressed.","StrauÃŸ, Berger, Rosendahl",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00278-021-00504-7,20210329.0,Living conditions; Psychosocial deprivation; Psychotherapy; Risk factors; Well being,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
53,Contact Tracing for COVID-19: The Use of Motivational Interviewing and the Role of Social Work,"One method in mitigating the impact of COVID-19 is that of contact tracing. It is estimated that in the US, 35,000-100,000 contact tracers will be hired (and trained) to talk to recently-infected individuals, understand who they have exposed to the virus, and encourage those exposed to self-quarantine. The Center for Disease Control recommends the use of motivational interviewing (MI) by contact tracers to encourage compliance with contact tracing/quarantine. Contact tracers need to sensitively communicate with COVID-19-exposed individuals who may also be experiencing other issues caused by the pandemic, such as anxiety, depression, grief, anger, intimate partner violence, health problems, food insecurity, and/or unemployment. Social workers are particularly prepared to address the mental health and other psychosocial problems that may be encountered in the tracing process. This article describes contact tracing, its use in other diseases, the role of MI, psychosocial issues that contact tracers may encounter, and how social work can respond to these needs. A sample dialogue of contact tracing using MI is presented with a discussion of the content and skills used in the process.","Hohman, McMaster, Woodruff",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10615-021-00802-2,20210329.0,COVID-19; Contact tracing; Motivational interviewing,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
54,Burnout in nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic in China: New challenges for public health,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, frontline nurses have faced extraordinary personal and professional challenges. These challenges have had mental health consequences, and concerning reports of burnout have emerged globally. We conducted a cross-sectional survey at a designated COVID-19 hospital in Shanghai at the peak of the pandemic, i.e. about 2 months after the onset of the outbreak from February to April 2020. Findings revealed burnout in 6.85% of nurses. Of 336 respondents, 87 (25.89%) had a high level of emotional exhaustion, 61 (18.15%) had a high level of depersonalization, and 100 (29.76%) had a low level of personal accomplishment. Burnout can be prevented by offering more support from families and supervisors, paying attention to health monitoring and personal protection, and creating a rational human resource allocation and shift management system. Specific training on infection control and self-protection, mental health guidance, and stress coping techniques must be implemented. As the current health crisis ultimately abates, moving the focus from mental health issues to public health issues, more attention and support at the national and organizational levels are needed to reduce occupational discrimination, nurse autonomy and status need to be promoted, and public health emergency teams need to be created. A positive and fair working environment is essential to effective healthcare delivery.","Zhang, Chai, Zhao, Wang, Sun, Lu, Lu, Zhang",https://doi.org/10.5582/bst.2021.01099,20210329.0,COVID-19; Chinese nurses; Shanghai; burnout; workload,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
55,Mental Health and Physical Activity among Children and Adolescents during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is causing disruptions in the global social system. Japanese children and adolescents have had their schools closed, government-mandated activity restrictions imposed, and interactions outside the home reduced. These restrictions can have a considerable psychological impact on children and adolescents. This review aims to describe the impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on physical activity and psychological status of this population. The review was conducted by searching PubMed for information on the impact of COVID-19-related activity restrictions on children and adolescents. The search identified 11 articles, three of which contained data on anxiety and psychological problems due to physical inactivity. Next, a PubMed search was conducted about physical activity and psychological status in children and adolescents under psychological stress. The search identified 368 articles, 28 of which were included in the review. For children, data that revealed a correlation between physical activity and psychological health and sedentary time leading to mood disorders were included. For adolescents, there were nine studies that reported a correlation between physical activity and psychological health and four studies that reported no correlation between physical activity and psychological health. Of the studies that reported a correlation, seven reported that physical activity improves psychological health. The impact of psychologically stressful situations such as COVID-19 on children and adolescents has been experienced worldwide. Physical activity has been correlated with psychological health, and it may improve psychological status; physical activity should be recommended to better support the psychological health of children and adolescents under the influence of COVID-19.","Okuyama, Seto, Fukuda, Funakoshi, Amae, Onobe, Izumi, Ito, Imamura",https://doi.org/10.1620/tjem.253.203,20210329.0,coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic; disaster medicine; mental health; physical activity; school restriction,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
56,Longitudinal evidence on mental health changes of college students with and without mental disorder background during the Argentina's lengthy mandatory quarantine,"This study examined the changes in the mental health state of college students with and without mental disorder background, during successive time cuts of the Argentina's lengthy mandatory quarantine, while adjusting for quarantine duration, sex, age, suicidal behavior history, loneliness, and region of residence. We used a longitudinal design (Nâ€¯=â€¯1615, 26% with mental disorder history). Successive samplings were performed from three days before quarantine start and across quarantine phases of up to 103-days duration. Follow-up was one month later. Sex (woman) and age (younger) were significant predictors of worse mental health only in college students without mental disorder background. Having any suicidal behavior background significantly predicted worse mental health in college students both with and without mental disorder history. Loneliness and region of residence were not statistically significant. In the between-groups comparisons, college students having mental disorder background had worse mental health than those without such a background. However, in the within-subject comparisons, no statistically significant changes occurred across time in the mental health of college students having mental disorder history. Conversely, significant changes occurred in those without such a background, but only when the interaction between time and quarantine duration was considered. Worsening mental health occurred during the most heavily restrictive quarantine phases, while some of the remissions occurred during the longest, but less restrictive ones.","Steinmetz, Fong, Godoy",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2021.110308,20210329.0,Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Mental illness; Quarantine,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
57,The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Children's Health in Portugal: The Parental Perspective,"The COVID-19 pandemic poses unprecedented challenges for healthcare services and has led to changes in the usageÂ pattern of the pediatric population. We aimed to describe the impact of COVID-19 on children's health, wellbeing, and access to medical care in Portugal. We conducted a cross-sectional study through an anonymous online survey via social media. The collected data refers to a period between the 16th of March and the 17th of May 2020. We obtained responses to the survey on 19 745 children. Of the previously scheduled outpatient consultations, 54.2% wereÂ postponed by healthcare institutions and 21.6% of planned vaccinations were missed. Parents expressed concerns regarding psychological, social, and physical consequences for their children due to the pandemic. The observed reduction of pediatric emergency department visits and the postponement of outpatient consultations andÂ vaccine administrations are potentially harmful for non-COVID patients. The current pandemic and the imposed social distance mightÂ have an important negative impact on the mental health of children. Further studies are necessary to fully comprehend the outcomes of the decreased access to medical care, as well as theÂ collateral damage for children beyond the clinical aspects of the pandemic. Defining strategies regarding the urge to vaccinate children and not postpone urgent evaluations should be a public health priority.

58,Psychological distress experienced by self-quarantined undergraduate university students in Lebanon during the COVID-19 outbreak,"Quarantine, although essential during contagious outbreaks, has been correlated with poor psychological outcomes in the general population. Such outcomes include low mood, suicide, and post-traumatic stress symptoms. Studies have mostly looked at the mental health of general citizens, healthcare workers, or infected survivors, with limited research targeting university students. This study aimed to understand the psychological distress experienced by self-quarantined undergraduate university students in Lebanon during the COVID-19 outbreak. Undergraduate students enrolled at the American University of Beirut were invited to participate in a 47-item online questionnaire. 73 participants completed the questionnaire. Demographic data, data about COVID-19 exposure, stressors during quarantine, understanding the rationale, compliance, and difficulties associated with quarantine, and levels of psychological distress were analysed. 75.3% of the participants were considered as having a high risk of developing acute stress. Undergoing quarantine for more than 14â€‰days, having a chronic medical illness, inadequate access to supplies, and fear of infection were all significantly associated with an increased risk of acute stress. Despite being a necessary preventive measure during infectious disease outbreaks, quarantine can be associated with negative psychological effects, particularly in undergraduate students. Providing preventive and effective interventions is of utmost necessity.KEY POINTSDuring COVID-19, three-quarter of students had high risk for acute stress.Females had higher odds of high-risk acute stress compared to males.Having a chronic medical condition was associated with high risk acute stress.Long quarantine and lack of supplies were associated with high risk acute stress.Providing interventions to protect the mental health of students is necessary.","Kassir, El Hayek, Zalzale, Orsolini, Bizri",https://doi.org/10.1080/13651501.2021.1900872,20210329.0,COVID-19; Lebanon; quarantine; students,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30

Case studies and global lessons learned from the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The current COVID-19 pandemic has exposed missing links between health promotion and national/global health emergency policies. In response, health promotion initiatives were urgently developed and applied around the world. A selection of case studies from five countries, based on the Socio-Ecological Model of Health Promotion, exemplify 'real-world' action and challenges for health promotion intervention, research, and policy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interventions range from a focus on individuals/families, organizations, communities and in healthcare, public health, education and media systems, health-promoting settings, and policy. Lessons learned highlight the need for emphasizing equity, trust, systems approach, and sustained action in future health promotion preparedness strategies.

60,[The impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on the elderly mental health and psychosocial support],"The spread of the COVID-19 epidemic is accompanied by psychosocial problems that have negative consequences for the mental health (MH) and quality of life (QoL) of the majority of the population. The elderly (65+ individuals) with chronic somatic diseases and reduced adaptation reserves are particularly at risk. In General, the epidemic highlighted the growing problems of psychosocial work with the 65+ cohort in the conditions of progressive aging of the population of many developed and developing countries. These problems are directly related to the preservation of MH and QoL of elderly people, people with disabilities, and others. Additional reserves should be sought to support these categories of individuals. In particular, the use of remote tele-consulting and assistive information technologies that enhance the communication capabilities of older persons is relevant. The article analyzes publications that offer practical recommendations for reducing the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on MH and QoL in a cohort of 65+ individuals. As a starting point of the discussion, the article by A.G.Golubev et al., in which the issues of public support for 65+ persons are considered to be the most relevant in the field of gerontology in the context of emergency response to the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic, is considered.

61,The impact of COVID-19 on prenatal care in the United States: Qualitative analysis from a survey of 2519 pregnant women,"To explore if and how women perceived their prenatal care to have changed as a result of COVID-19 and the impact of those changes on pregnant women. Qualitative analysis of open-ended prompts included as part of an anonymous, online, cross-sectional survey of pregnant women in the United States. Online survey with participants from 47 states within the U.S. Self-identified pregnant women recruited through Facebook, Twitter, and other online sources. An anonymous, online survey of pregnant women (distributed April 3 - 24, 2020) included an open-ended prompt asking women to tell us how COVID-19 had affected their prenatal care. Open-ended narrative responses were downloaded into Excel and coded using the Attride-Sterling Framework. 2519 pregnant women from 47 states responded to the survey, 88.4% of whom had at least one previous birth. Mean age was 32.7 years, mean weeks pregnant was 24.3 weeks, and mean number of prenatal visits at the point of the survey was 6.5. Predominant themes of the open narratives included COVID-19's role in creating structural changes within the healthcare system (reported spontaneously by 2075 respondents), behavioral changes among both pregnant women and their providers (reported by 429 respondents), and emotional consequences for women who were pregnant (reported by 503 respondents) during the pandemic. Changes resulting from COVID-19 varied widely by provider, and women's perceptions of the impact on quality of care ranged from perceiving care as extremely compromised to perceiving it to be improved as a result of the pandemic. Women who are pregnant during the COVID-19 pandemic have faced enormous upheaval as hospitals and healthcare providers have struggled to meet the simultaneous and often competing demands of infection prevention, pandemic preparedness, high patient volumes of extremely sick patients, and the needs of 'non-urgent' pregnant patients. In some settings, women described very few changes, whereas others reported radical changes implemented seemingly overnight. While infection rates may drive variable responses, these inconsistencies raise important questions regarding the need for local, state, national, or even global recommendations for the care of pregnant women during a global pandemic such as COVID-19.","Javaid, Barringer, Compton, Kaselitz, Muzik, Moyer",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.midw.2021.102991,20210328.0,COVID-19; Pregnancy; perinatal mental health; prenatal care; reproductive health care,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
62,"Urbanization level and neighborhood deprivation, not COVID-19 case numbers by residence area, are associated with severe psychological distress and new-onset suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic","Recent studies indicate an urgent need to take action against mental health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the association between larger-scale environmental factors such as living conditions and mental health problems during the pandemic is currently unknown. A nationwide, cross-sectional internet survey was conducted in Japan between August and September 2020 to examine the association between urbanization level and neighborhood deprivation as living conditions and COVID-19 case numbers by prefecture. Prevalence ratios (PRs) for severe psychological distress, suicidal ideation, and new-onset suicidal ideation during the pandemic were adjusted for potential confounders. Among 24,819 responses analyzed, the prevalence of mental health problems was 9.2% for severe psychological distress and 3.6% for new-onset suicidal ideation. PRs for severe psychological distress were significantly associated with higher urbanization level (highest PRÂ =Â 1.30, 95% CIÂ =Â 1.08-1.56). PRs for new-onset suicidal ideation were significantly associated with higher urbanization level (highest PRÂ =Â 1.83, 95% CIÂ =Â 1.37-2.45) and greater neighborhood deprivation (highest PRÂ =Â 1.35, 95% CIÂ =Â 1.06-1.72). Severe psychological distress and new-onset suicidal ideation were significantly more prevalent when there was higher urbanization plus lower neighborhood deprivation (PRÂ =Â 1.34 [1.15-1.56], and 1.57 [1.22-2.03], respectively). These findings suggest that it is not the number of COVID-19 cases by residence area but higher urbanization level and greater neighborhood deprivation (lower neighborhood-level socioeconomic status) that are associated with severe psychological distress and new-onset suicidal ideation during the pandemic. These findings differ in part from evidence obtained before the pandemic.","Okubo, Yoshioka, Nakaya, Hanibuchi, Okano, Ikezawa, Tsuno, Murayama, Tabuchi",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.03.028,20210328.0,COVID-19; Deprivation; Psychological distress; Suicidal ideation; Urbanization level,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30

Quality of care is related to the mental status of healthcare workers. This PRISMA systematic review and meta-analysis, on Pubmed/Psycinfo up to October 8, 2020, estimates the prevalence of mental health problems among healthcare workers during this pandemic. The systematic review included 70 studies (101 017 participants) and only high-quality studies were included in the meta-analysis. The following pooled prevalences were estimated: 30,0 % of anxiety (95%CI, 24.2 - 37.05); 31,1 % of depression (95%CI, 25.7 -36.8); 56,5% of acute stress (95%CI - 30.6 - 80.5); 20,2% of post-traumatic stress (95%CI, 9.9 - 33.0); 44.0 % of sleep disorders (95%CI, 24.6 - 64.5).

66,[Acute psychotic episodes related to the COVID-19 pandemic],"The world is currently going through an extremely stressful time due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This exceptional and alarming situation could increase the incidence of mental health problems, including acute psychotic disorders. Our observation reports two cases of patients with an acute psychotic episode, with a delusional theme related to the coronavirus pandemic. The two patients, who did not have a previous history of psychiatric disorders, were hospitalized in our psychiatry department, after the start of mandatory sanitary confinement in our country. The clinical symptoms found were mainly a hallucinatory syndrome and a delusional syndrome with a religious theme, and delusional ideas centered on COVID-19. This case report suggests that intense psychosocial stress, caused by the current global crisis and confinement measures, may be a trigger for new-onset psychotic episodes, and impact the clinical and delusional expression of acute psychosis.","Doufik, Ouhmou, Bouraoua, Laaraj, Mouhadi, Rammouz",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2021.03.008,20210324.0,Acute psychosis; COVID-19; Coronavirus; Delusion; Pandemic; Stress,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
67,Experiences of nursing students under the unprecedented abrupt online learning format forced by the national curfew due to COVID-19: A qualitative research study,"The unprecedented abrupt shift to remote online learning (OL) within the context of the national lockdown due to the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) highlights the importance of addressing students' preparedness in managing their first experiences with OL. To investigate the experiences of undergraduate nursing students during their first uses of OL to increase the understanding of their encountered opportunities and challenges. A descriptive qualitative design guided by a phenomenological approach was used. The study used a purposive sampling technique to recruit 18 undergraduate nursing students from two universities. Data were collected using two focus group discussions, and the discussions with participants were audio/video recorded through the online platform Zoom due to the national imposed curfew. Content analysis employed Colaizzi's steps to derive the themes/categories. The study revealed four themes: experience of helplessness, burdens, and burnout; the need for social and technical support to manage OL; the propensity to consider OL as a positive opportunity; and the deficiency of OL in fulfilling the educational outcomes of clinical courses. Abrupt remote OL was a challenge to clinical encounters. This format was very stressful; however, it was also useful. The current study highlighted the need for further research on the effectiveness of remote OL platforms in regard to the achievement of the intended learning outcomes of clinical courses.","Suliman, Abu-Moghli, Khalaf, Zumot, Nabolsi",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nedt.2021.104829,20210325.0,Abrupt online learning; COVID-19; Experience; Jordan; Nursing students,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
68,Proposal for a Model of Suicidal Ideation in Medical Students in Colombia: A Simulation Study,"Suicidal behaviour is a global public health problem, and one population group with high prevalence rates is medical students, especially in the ideation component. Various models have tried to explain it, but there are few inferential studies in the Colombian population. The structural equation models used in controlled social sciences to explain this problem and their analytical power allow generalisations to be made with a certain degree of precision. These analyses require a large amount of data for robust estimation, which limits their usability when there are restrictions to access the data, as is the case today due to Covid-19, and a question that stands out in these models is the evaluation of the fit.

69,Factors Associated With Psychiatric Adverse Effects in Healthcare Personnel During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Ecuador,"Since the emergence of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the world has faced a pandemic with consequences at all levels. In many countries, the health systems collapsed and healthcare professionals had to be on the front line of this crisis. The adverse effects on the mental health of healthcare professionals have been widely reported. This research focuses on identifying the main factors associated with adverse psychological outcomes. Descriptive, cross-sectional study based on surveys, applying the PHQ-9, GAD-7, ISI and EIE-R tests to healthcare professionals from Ecuador during the COVID-19 pandemic. 1,028 participants, distributed in: 557 physicians (54.18%), 349 nurses (33.94%), 29 laboratory workers (2.82%), 27 paramedics (2.62%), 52 psychologists (5.05%) and 14 respiratory therapists (1.36%), from 16 of the 24 provinces of Ecuador. Of these, 27.3% presented symptoms of depression, 39.2% anxiety symptoms, 16.3% insomnia and 43.8% symptoms of PTSD, with the 4 types of symptoms ranging from moderate to severe. The most relevant associated factors were: working in Guayas (the most affected province) (OR = 2.18 for depressive symptoms and OR = 2.59 for PTSD symptoms); being a postgraduate doctor (OR = 1.52 for depressive symptoms and OR = 1.57 for insomnia), perception of not having the proper protective equipment (OR = 1.71 for symptoms of depression and OR = 1.57 for symptoms of anxiety) and being a woman (OR = 1.39 for anxiety). Healthcare professionals can suffer a significant mental condition that may require psychiatric and psychological intervention. The main associated factors are primarily related to living and working in cities with a higher number of cases and the characteristics of the job, such as being a postgraduate doctor, as well as the perception of security. The main risk factors are primarily related to geographical distribution and job characteristics, such as being a resident physician and self-perception of safety. Further studies are required as the pandemic evolves.","PazmiÃ±o Erazo, Alvear VelÃ¡squez, Saltos ChÃ¡vez, PazmiÃ±o Pullas",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rcp.2020.12.007,20210321.0,COVID-19; DepresiÃ³n; Depression; Health personnel; Mental health; Pandemia; Pandemic; Personal de salud; Salud mental,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
70,[Did child-psychiatry patients really experience the dreaded clinical degradation during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown?],"The general lockdown period during the COVID-19 pandemic which covered mid-March to mid-May 2020 in France raised important questions about the direct and indirect psychological effects on children and adolescents. Perceived intuitively as harmful and even traumatic in the media's discourse, we tried to better qualify its effects from two complementary approaches. We carried out a review of the literature on the subject to which we associated a regular assessment of the children's global clinical state in the entire active file of the child-psychiatry department of the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Brest throughout the lockdown period.The findings of the literature review on the psychological effects of lockdowns or quarantines during past or current epidemics, in particular in China, report many deleterious and variable effects such as symptoms of anxiety, depression, as well as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, at a significant rate. However, the definition of the situations experienced and the contexts in which those studies took place appear to be not truly comparable to the French situation. Moreover, the effects of the fear of contamination are not differentiated from those linked to confinement itself. Among children and adolescents under the care of the above department, 354 underwent an assessment of the impact of lockdown on their global clinical condition using the Clinical Global Impression Improvement (CGI-I) performed by their usual practitioner during the period from March 16 to May 11, 2020. Our results highlight that 50% of children remained in stable condition, 25 to 30% improved and 20 to 25% experienced a slight degradation. The evolution of the clinical status appeared stable over time during the eight weeks. The initial age or severity of mental disorder had no significant influence, although there was a slightly more frequent improvement in adolescents. These results are quite inconsistent with general discourse and common expectations. Several psychopathological hypotheses are discussed to support this absence of psychological degradation which might even be extended to children and adolescents in the general population.","Lavenne-Collot, Ailliot, Badic, FavÃ©, FranÃ§ois, Saint-AndrÃ©, Thierry, Bronsard",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neurenf.2021.02.006,20210318.0,Adolescent; COVID-19; Child psychiatry; Children; Lockdown,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
71,Health Impacts of the Stay-at-Home Order on Community-Dwelling Older Adults and How Technologies May Help: Focus Group Study,"As of March 2021, in the USA, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in over 500,000 deaths, with a majority being people over 65 years of age. Since the start of the pandemic in March 2020, preventive measures, including lockdowns, social isolation, quarantine, and social distancing, have been implemented to reduce viral spread. These measures, while effective for risk prevention, may contribute to increased social isolation and loneliness among older adults and negatively impact their mental and physical health. This study aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting &quot;Stay-at-Home&quot; order on the mental and physical health of older adults and to explore ways to safely increase social connectedness among them. This qualitative study involved older adults living in a Continued Care Senior Housing Community (CCSHC) in southern California, USA. Four 90-minute focus groups were convened using the Zoom Video Communications platform during May 2020, involving 21 CCSHC residents. Participants were asked to describe how they were managing during the &quot;stay-at-home&quot; mandate that was implemented in March 2020, including its impact on their physical and mental health. Transcripts of each focus group were analyzed using qualitative methods. Four themes emerged from the qualitative data: (1) impact of the quarantine on health and well-being, (2) communication innovation and technology use, (3) effective ways of coping with the quarantine, and (4) improving access to technology and training.

72,Echo Chamber Effect in Rumor Rebuttal Discussions About COVID-19 in China: Social Media Content and Network Analysis Study,"The dissemination of rumor rebuttal content on social media is vital for rumor control and disease containment during public health crises. Previous research on the effectiveness of rumor rebuttal, to a certain extent, ignored or simplified the structure of dissemination networks and users' cognition as well as decision-making and interaction behaviors. This study aimed to roughly evaluate the effectiveness of rumor rebuttal; dig deeply into the attitude-based echo chamber effect on users' responses to rumor rebuttal under multiple topics on Weibo, a Chinese social media platform, in the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic; and evaluate the echo chamber's impact on the information characteristics of user interaction content. We used Sina Weibo's application programming interface to crawl rumor rebuttal content related to COVID-19 from 10 AM on January 23, 2020, to midnight on April 8, 2020. Using content analysis, sentiment analysis, social network analysis, and statistical analysis, we first analyzed whether and to what extent there was an echo chamber effect on the shaping of individuals' attitudes when retweeting or commenting on others' tweets. Then, we tested the heterogeneity of attitude distribution within communities and the homophily of interactions between communities. Based on the results at user and community levels, we made comprehensive judgments. Finally, we examined users' interaction content from three dimensions-sentiment expression, information seeking and sharing, and civility-to test the impact of the echo chamber effect. Our results indicated that the retweeting mechanism played an essential role in promoting polarization, and the commenting mechanism played a role in consensus building. Our results showed that there might not be a significant echo chamber effect on community interactions and verified that, compared to like-minded interactions, cross-cutting interactions contained significantly more negative sentiment, information seeking and sharing, and incivility. We found that online users' information-seeking behavior was accompanied by incivility, and information-sharing behavior was accompanied by more negative sentiment, which was often accompanied by incivility. Our findings revealed the existence and degree of an echo chamber effect from multiple dimensions, such as topic, interaction mechanism, and interaction level, and its impact on interaction content. Based on these findings, we provide several suggestions for preventing or alleviating group polarization to achieve better rumor rebuttal.","Wang, Qian",https://doi.org/10.2196/27009,20210326.0,COVID-19; Weibo; attitude; echo chamber effect; infodemic; infodemiology; rumor rebuttal,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30

Orv Hetil. 2021; 162(10): 366-374. Summary. In recent months, our lives have been fundamentally changed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the health, economic, and social impacts of which are almost invaluable for the time being. In addition to the acute consequences of viral infection, more and more data are proving its effects on the entire population: an increase in the incidence of psychological distress, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and addictive behaviours. It is also a very important question, how the global crisis is affecting suicide rates. In my paper, I summarize the acute and chronic effects of viral infection and the general and specific psychological-psychopathological consequences of the epidemic based on the most significant psychiatric literature of the recent period, paying special attention to suicidal risk and the most vulnerable groups. Studies suggest that mental troubles and suicidal behaviour resulting from a pandemic are becoming an increasingly important public health problem. Although the treatment of viral infections and slowing the spread of the infection are still the most important goals today, we all need to be prepared for the long-term consequences of the epidemic. In order to prevent and mitigate the expected negative mental health effects of a pandemic, it is necessary to develop and apply general and specific methods. In addition to health care, mental health and community care systems, political and economic decision-makers, civil society organizations and the media must also play a role. Their effective cooperation is key to the implementation of prevention strategies that can be applied at the individual, community and social levels, as this is the only way to prevent the epidemic spread of more serious mental health problems, the &quot;psychodemia&quot;.

74,PULMONARY FUNCTION AND RADIOLOGICAL FEATURES IN SURVIVORS OF CRITICAL COVID-19: A 3-MONTH PROSPECTIVE COHORT,"More than 20% of hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. The long-term respiratory sequelae in ICU survivors remain unclear. what are the major long-term pulmonary sequelae in critical COVID-19 survivors? Consecutive patients with COVID-19 requiring ICU admission were recruited and evaluated 3 months after hospitalization discharge. The follow-up comprised symptom and quality of life, anxiety and depression questionnaires, pulmonary function tests, exercise test (6-minute walking test (6MWT)) and chest computed tomography (CT). 125 ICU patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19 were recruited between March and June 2020. At the 3-month follow-up, 62 patients were available for pulmonary evaluation. The most frequent symptoms were dyspnea (46.7%), and cough (34.4%). Eighty-two percent of patients showed a lung diffusing capacity of less than 80%. The median (IQR) distance in the 6MWT was 400 (362;440) meters. CT scans were abnormal in 70.2% of patients, showing reticular lesions in 49.1% and fibrotic patterns in 21.1%. Patients with more severe alterations on chest CT had worse pulmonary function and presented more degrees of desaturation in the 6MWT. Factors associated with the severity of lung damage on chest CT were age and length of invasive mechanical ventilation during the ICU stay. Pulmonary structural abnormalities and functional impairment are highly prevalent in surviving ICU patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19 3 months after hospital discharge. Pulmonary evaluation should be considered for all critical COVID-19 survivors 3 months post discharge.","GonzÃ¡lez, BenÃ­tez, Carmona, Santisteve, Monge, MoncusÃ­-Moix, Gort-Paniello, Pinilla, CarratalÃ¡, Zuil, Ferrer, Ceccato, FernÃ¡ndez, Motos, Riera, MenÃ©ndez, Garcia-Gasulla, PeÃ±uelas, Bermejo-Martin, Labarca, Caballero, Torres, de Gonzalo-Calvo, Torres, BarbÃ©",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2021.02.062,20210310.0,COVID-19; CT abnormalities; ICU; SARS; SARS-CoV-2; Sequelae; lung function,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30

At the moment, there are no defined drugs, while few vaccines are available in the market to combat SARS-CoV-2. Several organic molecules were designed and tested against the virus but they did not show promising activity. In this work we designed two copper complexes from the ligands analogues with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. Both the ligands and complexes were well characterized by using various spectroscopic, thermal and X-ray diffraction techniques. Both the complexes as well as ligands were screened through in silico method with the chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine which essentially proved pivotal for successful understanding towards the target protein and their mechanism of action. The results indicated that the balanced hydrophobic and polar groups in the complexes favor their binding in the active site of the viral ADP-ribose-1 monophosphatase enzyme over the parent organic molecules.","Ali, Sepay, Afzal, Sepay, Alarifi, Shahid, Ahmad",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bioorg.2021.104772,20210329.0,ADP-ribose-1 monophosphatase enzyme; COVID-19; Chloroquine; Copper complex; Hydroxychloroquine,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
76,"<i>&quot;Everything Is Gonna Be Alright with Me&quot;</i>: The Role of Self-Compassion, Affect, and Coping in Negative Emotional Symptoms during Coronavirus Quarantine","Self-compassion has been associated with less distress, particularly when people face stressful and negative events. This study analyzed the mediation role of coping and affect in the relation between self-compassion and negative emotional symptoms during the quarantine decreed by Portuguese Health Authorities in the first phase of the coronavirus outbreak. A total of 428 Portuguese adults (75% women; <i>M</i><sub>age</sub> = 40.8, <i>SD</i> = 11.6) completed an online survey comprised by the Self-Compassion Scale (predictor); Short Version of Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (outcomes); The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule; and Brief-COPE. These instruments were adapted to COVID 19's epidemic. Parallel mediation analyses demonstrated that self-compassionate participants were at less risk of suffering from symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress during the quarantine. Plus, the relation between self-compassion and depressive, anxious, and stress symptoms were mediated by negative affect and dysfunctional coping style, but only for symptoms of depression. The findings support coping strategies and affect as links between self-compassion and distress but also the importance of separately analyzing the role of self-compassion, negative affect, and coping on symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress. Low self-compassion might increase negative affect, maintaining stress responses to face demanding events during the COVID-19 epidemic. Results were discussed in the context of the pandemic outbreak.","Beato, da Costa, Nogueira",https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18042017,20210312.0,"affect; coping; coronavirus; negative symptoms; self-compassion; Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; COVID-19; Depression; Empathy; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Portugal; Quarantine; Stress, Psychological",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
77,Understanding different trajectories of mental health across the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic and nationally mandated restrictions to control the virus have been associated with increased mental health issues. However, the differential impact of the pandemic and lockdown on groups of individuals, and the personal characteristics associated with poorer outcomes are unknown. Data from 21 938 adults in England who participated in a stratified cohort study were analysed. Trajectories of depression and anxiety symptoms were identified using growth mixture modelling. Multinomial and logistic regression models were constructed to identify sociodemographic and personality-related risk factors associated with trajectory class membership. Four trajectories of depression and five for anxiety were identified. The most common group presented with low symptom severity throughout, other classes were identified that showed: severe levels of symptoms which increased; moderate symptoms throughout; worsening mental health during lockdown but improvements after lockdown ended; and for anxiety only, severe initial anxiety that decreased quickly during lockdown. Age, gender, ethnicity, income, previous diagnoses, living situation, personality factors and sociability were associated with different trajectories. Nearly 30% of participants experienced trajectories with symptoms in the clinical range during lockdown, and did not follow the average curve or majority group, highlighting the importance of differential trajectories. Young, female, outgoing and sociable people and essential workers experienced severe anxiety around the announcement of lockdown which rapidly decreased. Younger individuals with lower incomes and previous mental health diagnoses experienced higher and increasing levels of symptoms. Recognising the likely symptom trajectories for such groups may allow for targeted care or interventions.","Saunders, Buckman, Fonagy, Fancourt",https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291721000957,20210324.0,COVID-19; Cohort study; lockdown; mental health outcomes; trajectories,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
78,The impact of COVID-19 lockdown and of the following &quot;re-opening&quot; period on specific and general psychopathology in people with Eating Disorders: the emergent role of internalizing symptoms,"We assessed the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on specific Eating Disorder (ED) and general psychopathology in people with an ED diagnosis during the lockdown period and after the end of the related containment measures. People with clinically defined diagnosis and undergoing treatment for an ED completed an online survey, which included adapted questions from standardized psychometric scales. Data relative to three different time periods (before, during and after the end of lockdown) were collected. Psychopathological changes over these periods were investigated and compared through one-way analysis of variance or covariance with repeated measures. Three hundred twelve people completed the survey (57.4% diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa (AN) or atypical AN, 20.2% with Bulimia Nervosa, 15.4% with Binge Eating Disorder, 7.05% with Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorders). The severity of both specific and general psychopathology increased during the lockdown and the rise of general symptoms persisted in the following re-opening phase, except for suicide ideation. Almost all of these findings were not affected by ED diagnosis, participants' age and illness duration. The retrospective nature of data collection is the main limitation of the study. People with EDs showed a COVID-19 emergency-induced worsening of both general and specific psychopathology. The effect on general psychopathology persisted in the re-opening period. These findings suggest a high stress vulnerability of ED individuals with important effects on internalizing symptoms, which are worth of attention by clinicians.","Monteleone, Marciello, Cascino, Abbate-Daga, Anselmetti, Baiano, Balestrieri, Barone, Bertelli, Carpiniello, Castellini, Corrivetti, DE Giorgi, Favaro, Gramaglia, Marzola, Meneguzzo, Monaco, Oriani, Pinna, Rania, Renna, Ricca, Salvo, Segura-Garcia, Scarabel, Todisco, Volpe, Zeppegno, Monteleone",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.02.037,20210319.0,COVID-19; Confinement; Eating disorders; Psychopathology; Social exposure; Stress; COVID-19; Communicable Disease Control; Feeding and Eating Disorders; Humans; Psychopathology; Retrospective Studies; SARS-CoV-2,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30

Few targeted digital tools exist to support the mental health of hospital-based health care workers, and none of them appear to have been led and co-designed by health care workers. RMHive is being led and developed by health care workers using experience-based co-design (EBCD) processes as a mobile app to support the mental health challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic to health care workers. We present a protocol for the impact evaluation for the rapid design and delivery of the RMHive mobile app. The impact evaluation will adopt a mixed methods design. Qualitative data from photo interviews undertaken with up to 30 health care workers and semistructured interviews conducted with up to 30 governance stakeholders will be integrated with qualitative and quantitative user analytics data and user-generated demographic and mental health data entered into the app. Analyses will address three evaluation questions related to engagement with the mobile app, implementation and integration of the app, and the impact of the app on individual mental health outcomes. The design and development will be described using the Mobile Health Evidence Reporting and Assessment guidelines. Implementation of the app will be evaluated using normalization process theory to analyze qualitative data from interviews combined with text and video analysis from the semistructured interviews. Mental health impacts will be assessed using the total score of the 4-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ4) and subscale scores for the 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire for depression and the 2-item Generalized Anxiety Scale for anxiety. The PHQ4 will be completed at baseline and at 14 and 28 days. The anticipated average use period of the app is 30 days. The rapid design will occur over four months using EBCD to collect qualitative data and develop app content. The impact evaluation will monitor outcome data for up to 12 weeks following hospital-wide release of the minimal viable product release. The study received funding and ethics approvals in June 2020. Outcome data is expected to be available in March 2021, and the impact evaluation is expected to be published mid-2021. The impact evaluation will examine the rapid design, development, and implementation of the RMHive app and its impact on mental health outcomes for health care workers. Findings from the impact evaluation will provide guidance for the integration of EBCD in rapid design and implementation processes. The evaluation will also inform future development and rollout of the app to support the mental health needs of hospital-based health care workers more widely.

80,Time out of cell and time in purposeful activity and adverse mental health outcomes amongst people in prison: a literature review,"The purpose of this study is to synthesise the available peer-reviewed literature on the impact of time out of cell (TOOC) and time in purposeful activity (TIPA) on adverse mental outcomes amongst people in prison. The outcomes of interest of this literature review were mental health, suicide, deliberate self-harm (DSH) and violence. Exposures of interest were TOOC, TIPA or a partial or indirect measure of either. In total, 14 studies were included. An abbreviated review methodology was used because of time constraints. There was consistent evidence of an association between lower TOOC and TIPA and worse mental health and higher suicide risk. Limited evidence suggests a link between TOOC and DSH. No evidence was identified regarding the relationship between TOOC/TIPA and violence. A lack of longitudinal studies prevents conclusions regarding causality. Significant heterogeneity of mental health outcomes limits the comparability of studies. These findings highlight the importance of considering the impact of TOOC and TIPA on adverse mental outcomes for prisoners when designing prison regimes, including during urgent adaptation of such regimes in response to Covid-19. They are likely to be of interest to practitioners and policymakers concerned with prison regime design.

Initial advice for parents stressed topics such as how to talk about the pandemic with children or cope with illness-related distress. They now focus on youth adjustment to a heavily disrupted school year and on strategies for building long-term resilience. Although these conversations often center on youth adjustment, they have-at last-started to consider the well-being of parents (and other caregivers) as well. This shift in focus is crucial given the enormous challenges that parents face right now and the direct links between their well-being and that of their children. What continues to lag, even well into the pandemic, however, is the provision of workable solutions for addressing parents' mental health. While we applaud the renewed focus on parenting stress and well-being, we remain deeply concerned by the absence of a plan for intervening.","Peris, Ehrenreich-May",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaac.2021.02.007,20210327.0,,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
82,"Sex Differences in the Association Between Stress, Loneliness, and COVID-19 Burden Among People with HIV in the United States","Little is known about the psychological implications of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on people with HIV. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of COVID-19 among men and women with HIV in Miami, Florida. We hypothesized that the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic will be higher for women, and psychological factors will increase COVID-19 burden among them. People with (<i>n</i>â€‰=â€‰231) and without HIV (<i>n</i>â€‰=â€‰42) residing in Miami, Florida completed a survey assessing psychological outcomes such as loneliness, depression, and stress, as well as the burden of COVID-19, on their daily lives. <i>t</i>-Tests and chi-square analyses were used to assess sex differences in study variables. Logistic regression was used to compare the interaction effects predicting stress and loneliness by COVID-19 burden and sex. A total of 273 completed the survey; the outcomes of the study, loneliness, and stress did not differ by HIV status (<i>p</i>â€‰=â€‰.458 and <i>p</i>â€‰=â€‰.922). Overall, men and women reported similar prevalence of COVID-19 burden. However, a greater proportion of women reported losing childcare than men (18% vs. 9%, <i>p</i>â€‰=â€‰.029, respectively), as well as losing mental health care (15% vs. 7%, <i>p</i>â€‰=â€‰.049, respectively). There was a significant interaction between COVID-19 burden and sex for loneliness and stress such that the association between COVID-19 burden and loneliness was greater for women (<i>p</i>â€‰&lt;â€‰.001) than for men (<i>p</i>â€‰=â€‰.353) and the association between COVID-19 burden and stress was greater for women (<i>p</i>â€‰=â€‰.013) than men (<i>p</i>â€‰=â€‰.628). Both men and women with HIV are impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, but women may experience higher levels of stress and loneliness than men.

83,"Understanding Concerns, Sentiments, and Disparities Among Population Groups During the COVID-19 Pandemic Via Twitter Data Mining: Large-scale Cross-sectional Study","Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in late 2019, its far-reaching impacts have been witnessed globally across all aspects of human life, such as health, economy, politics, and education. Such widely penetrating impacts cast significant and profound burdens on all population groups, incurring varied concerns and sentiments among them. This study aims to identify the concerns, sentiments, and disparities of various population groups during the COVID-19 pandemic through a cross-sectional study conducted via large-scale Twitter data mining infoveillance. This study consisted of three steps: first, tweets posted during the pandemic were collected and preprocessed on a large scale; second, the key population attributes, concerns, sentiments, and emotions were extracted via a collection of natural language processing procedures; third, multiple analyses were conducted to reveal concerns, sentiments, and disparities among population groups during the pandemic. Overall, this study implemented a quick, effective, and economical approach for analyzing population-level disparities during a public health event. The source code developed in this study was released for free public use at GitHub. A total of 1,015,655 original English tweets posted from August 7 to 12, 2020, were acquired and analyzed to obtain the following results. Organizations were significantly more concerned about COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] 3.48, 95% CI 3.39-3.58) and expressed more fear and depression emotions than individuals. Females were less concerned about COVID-19 (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.71-0.75) and expressed less fear and depression emotions than males. Among all age groups (ie, â‰¤18, 19-29, 30-39, and â‰¥40 years of age), the attention ORs of COVID-19 fear and depression increased significantly with age. It is worth noting that not all females paid less attention to COVID-19 than males. In the age group of 40 years or older, females were more concerned than males, especially regarding the economic and education topics. In addition, males 40 years or older and 18 years or younger were the least positive. Lastly, in all sentiment analyses, the sentiment polarities regarding political topics were always the lowest among the five topics of concern across all population groups. Through large-scale Twitter data mining, this study revealed that meaningful differences regarding concerns and sentiments about COVID-19-related topics existed among population groups during the study period. Therefore, specialized and varied attention and support are needed for different population groups.

84,,"COVID-19, a major 'Public Health Emergencies of International Concern,' had sought greater attention among researchers to study its pathogenesis, associated complications and management. However, there are only few studies that had studied its potential impact on mental health of general public, who are subjected to social distancing, community lockdown and restrictions in their routine activities. The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of psychological distress and mental health needs among general public in Tamil Nadu subjected to lockdown, social distancing amidst COVID-19 crisis. Tamil Nadu is one of the worst affected states of southern India. A self-administered, web-based application study using 'WHO-Self Reported Questionnaire-20', in bilingual version, both English and Tamil, is used to screen the public for the level of distress. The study is done while the state is under extended lockdown and restricted movement. A total of 918 respondents participated in the survey and it is found that about more than one third of the respondents (âˆ¼35%) are under psychological distress. A significant association between younger age group, female gender, unmarried, people with children are found to be under distress. The lockdown had increased the frequency of smoking and quantity of cigarettes among smokers, also has increased the frequency of drinking among alcohol consumers. Of the SRQ-20 items recorded, stress related neurotic symptoms (&gt;70%) was observed more than the depressive mood. About 33% of those scored &gt; 7, had suicidal tendency. The districts declared red zones had significantly reported a greater number of respondents under distress. Besides effectively mitigating the COVID-19 crisis, in terms of prevention, control and treatment strategies, it is prerogative to effectively manage fear, distress due to the COVID-19 and associated anxiety and depression among the public.","Rajendran, Govindarajulu, Adaikalam, Srinivasan, Seshayyan, Ramalingam, Elangovan",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2021.02.013,20210226.0,Anxiety; Depression; Factor analysis; Outbreaks; Pandemics; Stress,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
85,,"The current cross-sectional study aimed to explore the relationship between work stressors and mental health in frontline nurses exposed to COVID-19. Participants were recruited from 16 general hospitals in Anhui province from February 2020 to March 2020. The general sociodemographic questionnaire, Nurse Job Stressors Scale, Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire, NEO Five-Factor Inventory, Perceived Social Support Scale, and Kessler Psychological Distress Scale were used in this study. Based on 723 valid questionnaires retrieved (100%), the total mean scores of work stressors and mental health of frontline nurses were (94.38Â±23.42) and (22.81Â±7.16), respectively. The results of the structural equation model showed that work stressors had an indirect positive effect (Î²=0.484, P&lt;0.01), social support had a direct negative effect (Î²=-0.934, P&lt;0.01), personality traits had a direct positive effect (Î²=0.209, P&lt;0.01), and positive coping style had both direct positive (Î²=0.246, P&lt;0.01) and indirect negative effects (Î²=-0.873, P&lt;0.01) on frontline nurses' mental health.

86,Suicide in the context of COVID-19 diagnosis in India: Insights and implications from online print media reports,"Suicide reports during the COVID pandemic is an increasing cause for concern. However, there is a limited understanding of suicide among individuals with positive/suspected COVID diagnosis specifically. Hence, this study, using online newspaper reports, aimed to determine factors influencing suicide among individuals withCOVID-19 infection status. Information regarding positive/suspected COVID related suicide was obtained from online newspapers published in 4 languages between 30<sup>th</sup> Jan 2020 to 16<sup>th</sup> August 2020 using google news aggregator. Of 235 online identified, 93 were eligible for analysis after the exclusion and analysed using descriptive statistics. Median Age of COVID related suicide victims was 45 years (range 15 - 80) wherein 61.3% belonged to 30-59 year age group, and 75.3% were males. 50% of suicides occurred within the first week of COVID diagnosis confirmation, and 50% suicides occurred at COVID centres. Hanging (53.8%) was the commonest method of suicide, followed by jumping (12.9%). Higher risk for suicide was observed among male gender and those with positive/suspected COVID infection within the first week, while receiving treatment in COVID care centres. Hanging and jumping were the two commonest methods. The above highlight an urgent need to integrate suicide preventive strategies into standard care protocols of COVID-19 positive and suspected cases.","Sripad, Pantoji, Gowda, Ganjekar, Reddi, Math",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113799,20210329.0,COVID; Newspaper; Online; Print media; Suicide,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30

This work assessed the prevalence of self-medication with medicinal plants and the prevalence of the concomitant use of prescribed psychiatric drugs and medicinal plants for treating symptoms associated with anxiety and depression during the Covid-19 lockdown in Mexico. The suspected adverse reactions associated with drug-herb interactions were assessed. The factors associated with self-medication, the concomitant use of herb-drug combinations, and the presence of adverse reactions due their combined use is also reported. The study was descriptive and cross-sectional using an online questionnaire conducted among population with symptoms associated with anxiety and depression (nÂ =Â 2100) from seven states of central-western Mexico. The prevalence of the use of herbs (61.9%) and the concomitant use of drug-herb combinations (25.3%) were associated with being diagnosed with mental illness [OR:2.195 (1.655-2.912)] and the use of psychiatric medications [OR:307.994 (178.609-531.107)], respectively. The presence of adverse reactions (nÂ =Â 104) by the concomitant use of drug-herb combinations was associated with being unemployed [pÂ =Â 0.004, OR: 3.017 (1.404-6.486)].

88,The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on bariatric patients' self-management post-surgery,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had far reaching consequences on the health and well-being of the general public. Evidence from previous pandemics suggest that bariatric patients may experience increased emotional distress and difficulty adhering to healthy lifestyle changes post-surgery. We aimed to examine the impact of the novel COVID-19 public health crisis on bariatric patients' self-management post-surgery. In a nested-qualitative study, semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with 23 post-operative bariatric patients who had undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) at a Canadian Bariatric Surgery Program between 2014 and 2020. A constant comparative approach was used to systematically analyze the data and identify the overarching themes. Participants (nÂ =Â 23) had a mean age of (48.82Â Â±Â 10.03) years and most were female (nÂ =Â 19). The median time post-surgery was 2 years (range: 6 months-7 years). Themes describing the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on patients' post-bariatric surgery self-management included: coping with COVID-19; vulnerability factors and physical isolation; resiliency factors during pandemic; and valuing access to support by virtual care. The need for patients to access post-operative bariatric care during COVID-19 differed based on gender and socioeconomic status. This study showed that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted patients' ability to self-manage obesity and their mental health in a variety of ways. These findings suggest that patients may experience unique psychological distress and challenges requiring personalized care strategies to improve obesity self-care and overall well-being.","Youssef, Cassin, Wnuk, Leung, Jackson, Sockalingam",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2021.105166,20210329.0,,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
89,Food Insufficiency and Mental Health in the US During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, the rates of food insecurity and mental illness have been projected to increase in the U.S. owing to significant social and economic disruption. This study aims to estimate the prevalence of food insufficiency (often the most extreme form of food insecurity), the correlates of food insufficiency, and the associations between food insufficiency and symptoms of poor mental health in the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic. Cross-sectional data from 63,674 participants of the U.S. Census Household Pulse Survey were collected and analyzed in 2020. Multiple Poisson regression models were used to estimate associations with food insufficiency. Food insufficiency rose from 8.1% to 10.0% from March to June 2020. Factors associated with food insufficiency included lower age, Black/African American or Latinx race/ethnicity, being unmarried, larger household size, recent employment loss, income below the federal poverty line, and lower education (all p&lt;0.001). Food insufficiency was independently associated with all symptoms of poor mental health, adjusting for socioeconomic and demographic factors (adjusted RRs ranged from 1.16 to 1.42, all p&lt;0.001). The association between food insufficiency and poor mental health was attenuated among people who received free groceries or meals. Food insufficiency has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic and affects vulnerable populations, placing individuals at higher risk for symptoms of poor mental health. Particularly in the current crisis, clinicians should regularly screen patients for food insufficiency and mental health outcomes as well as provide support in accessing appropriate resources.","Nagata, Ganson, Whittle, Chu, Harris, Tsai, Weiser",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2020.12.004,20210329.0,Adult; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Food Insecurity; Food Supply; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Socioeconomic Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; United States,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
90,The effects of home confinement on physical activity level and mental status in professional football players during COVID-19 outbreak,"<b>Objectives</b>: The coronavirus outbreak caused significant changes in football around the world, such as the suspension of leagues and home isolation of players, etc. The main purpose of the present study was to assess the psychological impacts of lockdown and similar restrictions on professional football players during the coronavirus pandemic. <b>Materials and methods</b>: The players from 36 professional football teams (nÂ =Â 977) among Turkish Super League and First League teams were invited to complete a questionnaire including the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), Impact of Event Scale-Revised Scores (IES-R) and short form of International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). <b>Results</b>: The online survey was completed by 237 players (24.3%). The mean number of self-quarantine day of participants was 26.9Â Â±Â 6.2Â days. The median CES-D Scale and IES-R scores were 6.0 (min:0, max:42) and 23.0 (min:0, max:59), respectively. IPAQ scores of the players showed that four-fifths of the players still maintain high physical activity levels. There were negative, very weak and significant correlations between CES-D score and being married (rÂ =Â -0.146, p =Â 0.024), as well as between CES-D score and IPAQ-Walking (rÂ =Â -0.189, p =Â 0.004). A significant positive very weak correlation was observed between CES-D score and self-quarantine days (rÂ =Â 0.148, p =Â 0.024). IPAQ-Walking was an independent predictor of CES-D. <b>Conclusion</b>: These findings support that maintaining regular physical activity and routinely exercising in a safe home environment is one of the most important strategies to ensure healthy mental state.","DÃ¶nmez, Ã–zkan, Menderes, Torgutalp, KaraÃ§oban, Denerel, KudaÅŸ",https://doi.org/10.1080/00913847.2021.1888630,20210222.0,Coronavirus; depressive symptoms; pandemic; physical activity; soccer,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
91,Reducing the risks of endoscopic sinonasal surgery in the Covid-19 era,"Many routine sinonasal procedures utilising powered instruments are regarded as aerosol-generating. This study aimed to assess how different instrument settings affect detectable droplet spread and patterns of aerosolised droplet spread during simulated sinonasal surgery in order to identify mitigation strategies. Simulation series using three-dimensional (3-D) printed sinonasal model. Fluorescein droplet spread was assessed following microdebriding and drilling of fluorescein-soaked grapes and bones, respectively. University dry lab. 3-D printed sinonasal model. Patterns of aerosolised droplet spread. There were no observed fluorescein droplets or splatter in the measured surgical field after microdebridement of nasal polyps at aspecific irrigation rate and suction pressure. Activation of the microdebrider in the presence of excess fluid in the nasal cavity (reduced or blocked suction pressure, excessive irrigation fluid or bleeding) resulted in detectable droplet spread. Drilling with either coarse diamond or cutting burs resulted in detectable droplets and greater spread was observed when drilling within the anterior nasal cavity. High-speed drilling is a high-risk AGP but the addition of suction using a third hand technique reduces detectable droplet spread outside the nasal cavity. Using the instrument outside the nasal cavity inadvertently, or when unblocking, produces greater droplet spread and requires more caution.","Leong, Mogre, Andrews, Davies",https://doi.org/10.1111/coa.13743,20210322.0,COVID-19; aerosol-generating procedure; droplet; nasal endoscopy; sinus surgery; skull base surgery,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
92,College student mental health risks during the COVID-19 pandemic: Implications of campus relocation,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, many universities evacuated their campuses, requiring students to vacate on campus residences. The psychological outcomes of students who relocated during the pandemic remains unknown. We examined mandated relocation experiences related to self-reported worry, grief, loneliness, and depressive, generalized anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms among college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyzed cross-sectional survey data obtained from April 9 to August 4, 2020 on 791 young adults (ages 18-30 years) who were enrolled at a U.S. university. The CARES 2020 Project (COVID-19 Adult Resilience Experiences Study) is an online survey of young adults' mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recruitment relied on snowball sampling. Participants were asked if they were required to relocate from campus and among those who did, their experiences in moving. COVID-19-related worry and grief, loneliness, and depressive, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms were assessed. Approximately one-third of students reported being mandated to relocate. Students mandated to relocate reported more COVID-19-related grief, loneliness, and generalized anxiety symptoms compared to those who did not even after controlling for the severity level of local COVID-19 outbreaks. Students who had to leave behind valuable personal belongings reported more COVID-19-related worries, grief, and depressive, generalized anxiety, and PTSD symptoms. Students who were mandated to relocate reported worse psychological outcomes compared to students who were not mandated to relocate. Our findings have implications for addressing the psychological impact of evacuating college campuses during public health emergencies and other disasters.","Conrad, Hahm, Koire, Pinder-Amaker, Liu",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.01.054,20210329.0,Anxiety; Loneliness; Relocation; Stress; University; Young adults,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
93,Emergency department presentations in the Southern District of New Zealand during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic lockdown,"To assess changes in presentations to EDs during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in the Southern Region of New Zealand. We conducted a retrospective audit of patients attending EDs in the Southern District Health Board (SDHB), from 1 March to 13 May 2020. We made comparisons with attendances during the same period in 2019. The 2020 study period included 'pre-lockdown' (1 March-25 March), 'level 4 (strict) lockdown' (26 March-27 April) and 'level 3 (eased) lockdown' (28 April-13 May). Patient volumes reduced in all SDHB EDs during levels 4 and 3, mostly representing a loss of low acuity patients (Australasian Triage Scale 3, 4 and 5), although high-acuity presentations also declined. Average patient age increased by 5â€‰years; however, the proportions of sexes and ethnicities did not change. Presentations of cerebrovascular accidents and appendicitis did not change significantly. Trauma, mental health, acute coronary syndrome and infectious respiratory presentations decreased significantly during level 4, and infectious respiratory presentations decreased further in level 3. Within the SDHB, patient volumes reduced during levels 4 and 3 of our lockdown, with reduced low-acuity presentations. High-acuity patient numbers also declined.

94,The impact of COVID-19 on subthreshold depressive symptoms: a longitudinal study,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic represents an unprecedented threat to mental health. Herein, we assessed the impact of COVID-19 on subthreshold depressive symptoms and identified potential mitigating factors. Participants were from Depression Cohort in China (ChiCTR registry number 1900022145). Adults (n = 1722) with subthreshold depressive symptoms were enrolled between March and October 2019 in a 6-month, community-based interventional study that aimed to prevent clinical depression using psychoeducation. A total of 1506 participants completed the study in Shenzhen, China: 726 participants, who completed the study between March 2019 and January 2020 (i.e. before COVID-19), comprised the 'wave 1' group; 780 participants, who were enrolled before COVID-19 and completed the 6-month endpoint assessment during COVID-19, comprised 'wave 2'. Symptoms of depression, anxiety and insomnia were assessed at baseline and endpoint (i.e. 6-month follow-up) using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), respectively. Measures of resilience and regular exercise were assessed at baseline. We compared the mental health outcomes between wave 1 and wave 2 groups. We additionally investigated how mental health outcomes changed across disparate stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in China, i.e. peak (7-13 February), post-peak (14-27 February), remission plateau (28 February-present). COVID-19 increased the risk for three mental outcomes: (1) depression (odds ratio [OR] = 1.30, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04-1.62); (2) anxiety (OR = 1.47, 95% CI: 1.16-1.88) and (3) insomnia (OR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.07-1.77). The highest proportion of probable depression and anxiety was observed post-peak, with 52.9% and 41.4%, respectively. Greater baseline resilience scores had a protective effect on the three main outcomes (depression: OR = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.19-0.37; anxiety: OR = 1.22, 95% CI: 0.14-0.33 and insomnia: OR = 0.18, 95% CI: 0.11-0.28). Furthermore, regular physical activity mitigated the risk for depression (OR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.79-0.99). The COVID-19 pandemic exerted a highly significant and negative impact on symptoms of depression, anxiety and insomnia. Mental health outcomes fluctuated as a function of the duration of the pandemic and were alleviated to some extent with the observed decline in community-based transmission. Augmenting resiliency and regular exercise provide an opportunity to mitigate the risk for mental health symptoms during this severe public health crisis.","Liao, Fan, Zhang, Guo, Lee, Wang, Li, Gong, Lui, Li, Lu, McIntyre",https://doi.org/10.1017/S2045796021000044,20210325.0,COVID-19; subthreshold depressive symptoms; Adult; Anxiety; COVID-19; China; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Mental Health; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
95,"Ethnic Differences in Loneliness, Depression, and Malnutrition Among Older Adults During COVID-19 Quarantine","Depression in older adults may result from a variety of reasons such as loneliness feelings and malnutrition. To examine the direct and indirect effect of loneliness feelings on depressive symptoms, mediated by malnutrition, among older adults from different cultures during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic quarantine. A convenience sample of 101 Arabs and 100 Jewish older adults aged 65 and over was interviewed. Using bootstrapping, we tested the strength and significance of the conditional indirect effect of malnutrition (mediator) on the relationship between loneliness feelings and depressive symptoms. The relationship between loneliness feelings and depressive symptoms was mediated by malnutrition and Arab older adults reported a higher level than Jewish older adults of loneliness, depression, and malnutrition during the Covid-19 pandemic quarantine. To reduce loneliness feelings, depressive symptoms, and malnutrition in times of crisis like the Covid-19 pandemic, it is essential to develop new communication methods for and with older adults in general, with particular attention paid to ethnic differences, that will be effective in reducing loneliness and in promoting nutrition intervention. Possible solutions include new social network technologies for reducing loneliness, with continued reliance on phone communication for combined intervention that includes psychological support accompanied by instructions for a healthy lifestyle and malnutrition prevention.","Schorr, Yehuda, Tamir",https://doi.org/10.1007/s12603-020-1540-z,20210303.0,"Covid-19; Loneliness feelings; depressive symptoms; malnutrition; older adults; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; COVID-19; Depression; Female; Humans; Loneliness; Male; Malnutrition; Middle Aged; Quarantine; SARS-CoV-2",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30

Kendall's tau correlations and multivariate logistic regression procedures were performed with stress, anxiety and depression as outcome variables. Most nurses reported moderate/high stress (80.1%), while 43% and 26% reported moderate/severe anxiety and depression, respectively. COVID-19 patient care was positively associated with moderate/severe high stress (ORÂ =Â 2.25; pÂ =Â .012) and moderate/severe anxiety (ORÂ =Â 3.04; pÂ &lt;Â .001), whereas quarantine was associated with moderate/severe depression (ORÂ =Â 2.68; pÂ &lt;Â .001).

Building upon studies from various countries, we aimed to investigate (1) the prevalence of various work-related stressors among healthcare professionals in Germany specific to the COVID-19 pandemic, (2) the psychological effects of these stressors in terms of clinical symptoms, and (3) the healthcare professionals' help-seeking behaviour. To this end, N = 300 healthcare professionals completed an online survey including the ICD-10 Symptom Rating checklist (ISR), event-sampling questions on pandemic-related stressors and self-formulated questions on help-seeking behaviour. Participants were recruited between 22 May and 22 July 2020. Findings were analysed using t tests, regressions and comparisons to large clinical and non-clinical samples assessed before and during the pandemic. Results show that healthcare professionals were most affected by protective measures at their workplace and changes in work procedures. Psychological symptoms, particularly anxiety and depression, were significantly more severe than in a non-clinical pre-pandemic sample and in the general population during the pandemic. At the same time, most professionals indicated that they would not seek help for psychological concerns. These findings indicate that healthcare employers need to pay greater attention to the mental health of their staff.","Weibelzahl, Reiter, Duden",https://doi.org/10.1017/S0950268821000303,20210225.0,COVID-19; help-seeking behaviour; mental health; nursing staff; occupational stress; pandemics; Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Germany; Health Personnel; Incidence; Pandemics; Prevalence,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
98,Telemedicine in Pediatrics: Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials,"Telemedicine modalities, such as videoconferencing, are used by health care providers to remotely deliver health care to patients. Telemedicine use in pediatrics has increased in recent years. This has resulted in improved health care access, optimized disease management, progress in the monitoring of health conditions, and fewer exposures to patients with illnesses during pandemics (eg, the COVID-19 pandemic). We aimed to systematically evaluate the most recent evidence on the feasibility and accessibility of telemedicine services, patients' and care providers' satisfaction with these services, and treatment outcomes related to telemedicine service use among pediatric populations with different health conditions. Studies were obtained from the PubMed database on May 10, 2020. We followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. In this review, we included randomized controlled trials from the last 10 years that used a telemedicine approach as a study intervention or assessed telemedicine as a subspecialty of pediatric care. Titles and abstracts were independently screened based on the eligibility criteria. Afterward, full texts were retrieved and independently screened based on the eligibility criteria. A standardized form was used to extract the following data: publication title, first author's name, publication year, participants' characteristics, study design, the technology-based approach that was used, intervention characteristics, study goals, and study findings. In total, 11 articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in this review. All studies were categorized as randomized controlled trials (8/11, 73%) or cluster randomized trials (3/11, 27%). The number of participants in each study ranged from 22 to 400. The health conditions that were assessed included obesity (3/11, 27%), asthma (2/11, 18%), mental health conditions (1/11, 9%), otitis media (1/11, 9%), skin conditions (1/11, 9%), type 1 diabetes (1/11, 9%), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (1/11, 9%), and cystic fibrosis-related pancreatic insufficiency (1/11). The telemedicine approaches that were used included patient and doctor videoconferencing visits (5/11, 45%), smartphone-based interventions (3/11, 27%), telephone counseling (2/11, 18%), and telemedicine-based screening visits (1/11, 9%). The telemedicine interventions in all included studies resulted in outcomes that were comparable to or better than the outcomes of control groups. These outcomes were related to symptom management, quality of life, satisfaction, medication adherence, visit completion rates, and disease progression. Although more research is needed, the evidence from this review suggests that telemedicine services for the general public and pediatric care are comparable to or better than in-person services. Patients, health care professionals, and caregivers may benefit from using both telemedicine services and traditional, in-person health care services. To maximize the potential of telemedicine, future research should focus on improving patients' access to care, increasing the cost-effectiveness of telemedicine services, and eliminating barriers to telemedicine use.","Shah, Badawy",https://doi.org/10.2196/22696,20210225.0,COVID-19; coronavirus; digital; eHealth; mHealth; mobile health; pandemic; pediatrics; telehealth; telemedicine,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
99,Mental health interventions for healthcare workers during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in Spain,"In order to reduce distress associated with working with COVID-19 patients, several psychological intervention programmes for healthcare workers have been developed in Spain. We aimed to describe the main characteristics and components of these programmes for healthcare workers treating COVID-19 patients in Spanish hospitals. An online survey was designed to evaluate the main characteristics of psychological intervention programmes for healthcare workers during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic. Valid responses were received from 36 hospitals. Most of these programmes offered both in-person and online therapy. The most common aim of these interventions was emotional regulation, which was treated by psychoeducational and cognitive-behavioural techniques in individual interventions. Group interventions mainly used psychoeducation and mindfulness. Only half of the teams that offered in-person interventions received training in the proper use of personal protective equipment. Several hospitals in Spain have developed mental health interventions for healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, deploying a wide range of therapeutic modalities and techniques. The rapid implementation of these programmes during the pandemic suggests that safety may not have received sufficient attention. The planning and development of interventions for healthcare workers during pandemics merits greater attention by national and regional authorities and institutions.","Priede, LÃ³pez-Ãlvarez, Carracedo-SanchidriÃ¡n, GonzÃ¡lez-Blanch",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rpsm.2021.01.005,20210228.0,COVID-19; Distress; Healthcare workers; Malestar psicolÃ³gico; Mental health; Psychological treatment; Salud mental; Trabajadores sanitarios; Tratamiento psicolÃ³gico,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
100,<i>ACE2</i> and <i>FURIN</i> variants are potential predictors of SARS-CoV-2 outcome: A time to implement precision medicine against COVID-19,"The severity of the new COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is strikingly variable in different global populations. SARS-CoV-2 uses <i>ACE2</i> as a cell receptor, <i>TMPRSS2</i> protease, and <i>FURIN</i> peptidase to invade human cells. Here, we investigated 1,378 whole-exome sequences of individuals from the Middle Eastern populations (Kuwait, Qatar, and Iran) to explore natural variations in the <i>ACE2</i>, <i>TMPRSS2,</i> and <i>FURIN</i> genes. We identified two activating variants (K26R and N720D) in the <i>ACE2</i> gene that are more common in Europeans than in the Middle Eastern, East Asian, and African populations. We postulate that K26R can activate <i>ACE2</i> and facilitate binding to S-protein RBD while N720D enhances <i>TMPRSS2</i> cutting and, ultimately, viral entry. We also detected deleterious variants in <i>FURIN</i> that are frequent in the Middle Eastern but not in the European populations. This study highlights specific genetic variations in the <i>ACE2</i> and <i>FURIN</i> genes that may explain SARS-CoV-2 clinical disparity. We showed structural evidence of the functionality of these activating variants that increase the SARS-CoV-2 aggressiveness. Finally, our data illustrate a significant correlation between <i>ACE2</i> variants identified in people from Middle Eastern origins that can be further explored to explain the variation in COVID-19 infection and mortality rates globally.","Al-Mulla, Mohammad, Al Madhoun, Haddad, Ali, Eaaswarkhanth, John, Nizam, Channanath, Abu-Farha, Ahmad, Abubaker, Thanaraj",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06133,20210329.0,ACE2; COVID-19; FURIN; Genomic medicine; Middle Eastern populations; Precision medicine; SARS-CoV-2; TMPRSS2; Variants; eQTLs,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
101,Surveilling COVID-19 Emotional Contagion on Twitter by Sentiment Analysis,"The fight against the COVID-19 pandemic seems to encompass a social media debate, possibly resulting in emotional contagion and the need for novel surveillance approaches. In the current study, we aimed to examine the flow and content of tweets, exploring the role of COVID-19 key events on the popular Twitter platform. Using representative freely available data, we performed a focused, social media-based analysis to capture COVID-19 discussions on Twitter, considering sentiment and longitudinal trends between January 19 and March 3, 2020. Different populations of users were considered. Core discussions were explored measuring tweets' sentiment, by both computing a polarity compound score with 95% Confidence Interval and using a transformer-based model, pretrained on a large corpus of COVID-19-related Tweets. Context-dependent meaning and emotion-specific features were considered. We gathered 3,308,476 tweets written in English. Since the first World Health Organization report (January 21), negative sentiment proportion of tweets gradually increased as expected, with amplifications following key events. Sentiment scores were increasingly negative among most active users. Tweets content and flow revealed an ongoing scenario in which the global emergency seems difficult to be emotionally managed, as shown by sentiment trajectories. Integrating social media like Twitter as essential surveillance tools in the management of the pandemic and its waves might actually represent a novel preventive approach to hinder emotional contagion, disseminating reliable information and nurturing trust. There is the need to monitor and sustain healthy behaviors as well as community supports also via social media-based preventive interventions.","Crocamo, Viviani, Famiglini, Bartoli, Pasi, CarrÃ ",https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.3,20210315.0,Emotional contagion; mental health; sentiment analyses; social media; COVID-19; Emotions; Health Behavior; Health Education; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Social Media; Trust,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
102,&quot;I Couldn't Have Asked for a Better Quarantine Partner!&quot;: Experiences with Companion Dogs during Covid-19,"The Covid-19 pandemic has been found to negatively impact the psychological well-being of significant numbers of people globally. Many individuals have been challenged by social distancing mandates and the resultant social isolation. Humans, in our modern world, have rarely been as isolated and socially restricted. Social connectedness and support are critical protective factors for human survival and well-being. Social isolation can lead to loneliness, boredom, and can become a risk factor for physical and mental health issues such as anxiety and depression. The attachments formed with dogs, however, can be as strong or even stronger than human connections, and has been shown to relate to fewer physical health and mental health problems, as well as decrease isolation and loneliness. The purpose of this qualitative research was to examine the thoughts, experiences and concerns of 4105 adults regarding their companion dog during the initial months of Covid-19. Data were collected between March 31st-April 19th, 2020 via online survey and themes were coded by the researchers using directed content analysis. Results highlighted a strong human-animal appreciation, and that dog ownership during this pandemic diminished participants' sense of isolation and loneliness, as well as supported their mental/physical health.","Bussolari, Currin-McCulloch, Packman, Kogan, Erdman",https://doi.org/10.3390/ani11020330,20210316.0,Covid-19; companionâ€“animal relationships; dog ownership; humanâ€“dog bond; social isolation,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30

This study aimed to investigate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) -associated epidemiology and clinical outcomes in Bangladesh in order to understand the future course of the COVID-19 pandemic and develop approaches to prevention. A cross-sectional study based on retrospective interviews was conducted on 1021 individuals with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 admitted in six different hospitals in Bangladesh and who recovered 4 weeks before the interview date. Of the 1021 patients, 111 (10.9%) were asymptomatic and the other 910 (89.1%) were symptomatic. Higher prevalence of COVID-19 was found in the male population (75%), in cohorts with B-positive blood group (36.3%) and in the 31-40 years age group. Common symptoms observed in our study participants were fever (72.4%), cough (55.9%), loss of taste (40.7%) and body ache (40%); whereas among the biochemical parameters, neutrophil count (46.4%), D-dimer (46.1%) and ferritin (37.9%) levels were elevated. Among the recovered individuals, short-term outcomes including pains and aches (31.8%), weakened attention span (24.4%) and anxiety or depression (23.1%) were also significantly prevalent in the symptomatic cases with comorbidities. Our study showed that in Bangladesh, adult males aged between 31 and 40 years were more vulnerable to developing COVID-19. It also indicated a rising trend of asymptomatic cases as the pandemic progressed.

Cognitive biases have been related to depression degree in previous studies. Here, we used behavioral and brain imaging analysis, to determine if and how the COVID-19 pandemic affects the relationship between current cognitive biases and future depression degree and the underlying neural basis in a nonclinical depressed population. An out-expectation result showed that a more negative memory bias was associated with a greater decrease in future depressive indices in nonclinical depressed participants during the COVID-19 pandemic, which might be due to decreased social stress. These data enhance our understanding of how the depressive degree of nonclinical depressed populations will change during the COVID-19 pandemic and also provide support for social distancing policies from a psychological perspective.","Zhang, Piao, Chen, Ren, Zhang, Qiu, Wei, Zhang",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2021.102081,20210316.0,behavioral neuroscience; clinical neuroscience; cognitive neuroscience,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
107,Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Patient Preferences and Decision Making for Symptomatic Urolithiasis,"<b> <i>Background:</i> </b> Pandemic restrictions have changed how patients approach symptomatic kidney stones. We used a mixed-methods digital ethnographic approach to evaluate social media discussions about patient concerns and preferences for urolithiasis care during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b> <i>Materials and Methods:</i> </b> We retrospectively analyzed kidney stone-related discussions on a large social media platform using qualitative analysis and natural language processing-based sentiment analysis. Posts were mined for demographic details, treatments pursued, and health care encounters. Pre-COVID-19 (January 1, 2020-February 29, 2020) and COVID-19 (March 1, 2020-June 1, 2020) posts were extracted from the popular online Reddit discussion board, &quot;r/KidneyStones,&quot; which is dedicated to discussions related to urolithiasis. <b> <i>Results:</i> </b> We extracted <i>n</i>â€‰=â€‰649 posts (250 pre-COVID-19, 399 COVID-19); 150 from each cohort underwent thematic analysis and data extraction. Quantitative sentiment analysis was performed on 418 posts (179 pre-COVID-19, 239 COVID-19) that described stone-related decision making before intervention. Notable discussion themes during COVID-19 focused on barriers to care and concerns about stone management. Discussants exhibited more negative and anxious tones during COVID-19, based on sentiment analysis (<i>p</i>â€‰&lt;â€‰0.01). Patient preferences shifted away from in-person visits and procedures (<i>p</i>â€‰&lt;â€‰0.001). Mean reported stone size among those visiting emergency room (ER) increased from 5.1 to 10.5â€‰mm (<i>p</i>â€‰&lt;â€‰0.001). The proportion of discussants preferring conservative management with stones â‰¥10â€‰mm increased (12.5% pre-COVID-19 <i>vs</i> 26% during COVID-19, <i>p</i>â€‰=â€‰0.002). Opioid mentions increased from 9% to 27% of posts (<i>p</i>â€‰&lt;â€‰0.001) and were most associated with conservative management discussions. <b> <i>Conclusions:</i> </b> Online discussion forums provide contemporaneous insight into patients' experiences during a time when traditional patient-centered research methodologies are limited due to social distancing. During the pandemic, patients with symptomatic kidney stones expressed anxiety regarding outpatient encounters and reluctance toward procedural intervention. Patients opted instead for at-home conservative treatment beyond clinical guidelines and reserved ER visits for larger stones, potentially causing self-harm. Opioid discussions proliferated, an alarming consequence of the pandemic.","Jiang, Osadchiy, Weinberger, Zheng, Owen, Leonard, Mills, Kachroo, Eleswarapu",https://doi.org/10.1089/end.2020.1141,20210304.0,COVID-19; natural language processing; patient perspectives; urolithiasis,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30

We performed an internet-based cross-sectional survey of an age-, sex-, and race-stratified representative sample from the US general population. Degrees of anxiety, depression, and loneliness were assessed using the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale (GAD-7), the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, and the 8-item UCLA Loneliness Scale, respectively. Unadjusted and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to determine associations with baseline demographic characteristics. A total of 1,005 finished surveys were returned of the 1,020 started, yielding a completion rate of 98.5% in the survey panel. The mean (standard deviation) age of the respondents was 45 (16) years, and 494 (48.8%) were male. Overall, 264 subjects (26.8%) met the criteria for an anxiety disorder based on a GAD-7 cutoff of 10; a cutoff of 7 yielded 416 subjects (41.4%), meeting the clinical criteria for anxiety. On multivariable analysis, male sex (odds ratio [OR] = 0.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.49, 0.87]), identification as Black (OR = 0.49, 95% CI [0.31, 0.77]), and living in a larger home (OR = 0.46, 95% CI [0.24, 0.88]) were associated with a decreased odds of meeting the anxiety criteria. Rural location (OR 1.39, 95% CI [1.03, 1.89]), loneliness (OR 4.92, 95% CI [3.18, 7.62]), and history of hospitalization (OR = 2.04, 95% CI [1.38, 3.03]) were associated with increased odds of meeting the anxiety criteria. Two hundred thirty-two subjects (23.6%) met the criteria for clinical depression. On multivariable analysis, male sex (OR = 0.71, 95% CI [0.53, 0.95]), identifying as Black (OR = 0.62, 95% CI [0.40, 0.97]), increased time outdoors (OR = 0.51, 95% CI [0.29, 0.92]), and living in a larger home (OR = 0.35, 95% CI [0.18, 0.69]) were associated with decreased odds of meeting depression criteria. Having lost a job (OR = 1.64, 95% CI [1.05, 2.54]), loneliness (OR = 10.42, 95% CI [6.26, 17.36]), and history of hospitalization (OR = 2.42, 95% CI [1.62, 3.62]) were associated with an increased odds of meeting depression criteria.

About 30% of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease. Among them, approximately 25% require hospitalization. In medicine, cases are identified as those who become ill. During this pandemic, cases have been identified as those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test, including approximately 70% who were asymptomatic-this has caused unnecessary anxiety. Individuals more than 65 years old, those affected by obesity, diabetes, asthma, or are immune-depressed owing to cancer and other conditions, are at a higher risk of hospitalization and of dying of COVID-19. Healthy individuals younger than 40 years very rarely die of COVID-19. Estimates of the COVID-19 mortality rate vary because the definition of COVID-19-related deaths varies. Belgium has the highest death rate at 154.9 per 100,000 persons, because it includes anyone who died with symptoms compatible with COVID-19, even those never tested for SARS-CoV-2. The United States includes all patients who died with a positive test, whether they died because of, or with, SARS-CoV-2. Countries that include only patients in which COVID-19 was the main cause of death, rather than a cofactor, have lower death rates. Numerous therapies are being developed, and rapid improvements are anticipated. Because of disinformation, only approximately 50% of the U.S. population plans to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.

This study aims to identify the associated factors of willingness to adopt mHealth among Chinese parents during the COVID-19 outbreak and to explore the correlation between the frequency of adopting mHealth and parents' attitudes toward child health care at home. Chinese parents were asked to complete an online survey from January 25 to February 15, 2020. The questionnaire comprised of two parts with a total of 16 items, including parents' demographic variables and attitudes toward child health care at home. By multivariate logistic regression, we explored factors associated with parents' willingness to adopt mHealth during the COVID-19 outbreak. Pearson chi-square tests were used to reveal the correlation between the frequency of adopting mHealth and parents' attitudes toward child health care at home. A total of 254 parents enrolled, and 202 (79.5%) parents were willing to adopt mHealth during the COVID-19 outbreak. Parents' age (26-35 years: adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 8.114, 95% CI 1.471-44.764), parents' interest in the COVID-19 pandemic (moderate: AOR 8.753, 95% CI 2.009-38.127; high: AOR 22.194, 95% CI 5.509-89.411), the source that recommended mHealth (medical health providers: AOR 4.257, 95% CI 1.439-12.596), the presence of chronic disease in their children (yes: AOR 20.844, 95% CI 4.600-94.443), parents' duration of daily internet use (4-6 hours: AOR 6.487, 95% CI 1.870-22.495; &gt;6 hours: AOR 8.766, 95% CI 1.883-40.804), and adoption of mHealth before the COVID-19 outbreak (yes: AOR 3.413, 95% CI 1.234-9.444) were significantly correlated with the parents' willingness to adopt mHealth during the COVID-19 outbreak. The frequency of mHealth use among parents was correlated with their behaviors in regard to handwashing (Ï‡<sup>2</sup><sub>6</sub>=18.967, P=.004), mask wearing (Ï‡<sup>2</sup><sub>6</sub>=45.364, P&lt;.001), frequency of leaving the home (Ï‡<sup>2</sup><sub>6</sub>=16.767, P=.01), room disinfection and ventilation (Ï‡<sup>2</sup><sub>6</sub>=19.515, P=.003), temperature checking (Ï‡<sup>2</sup><sub>6</sub>=17.47, P=.007), and mental health care of children (Ï‡<sup>2</sup><sub>6</sub>=63.810, P&lt;.001) during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found various objective factors that were associated with parents' willingness to adopt mHealth during the COVID-19 outbreak. Overall, parents' willingness to adopt mHealth was high. The frequency of mHealth use among parents was correlated with their attitudes toward child health care at home. The option of mHealth to patients at home during the COVID-19 outbreak would be beneficial for education and improvement in self-management of child health care at home.","Yang, Chen, Zhou, Huang, Dai",https://doi.org/10.2196/23155,20210201.0,COVID-19; child health at home; mHealth; parents; Adult; COVID-19; China; Cross-Sectional Studies; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Humans; Male; Parents; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Surveys and Questionnaires; Telemedicine,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
115,Psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study of online help-seeking Canadian men,"<b>Purpose</b>: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the lives of men. The present study investigated psychosocial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on a help-seeking sample of Canadian men, focusing on diverse aspects of their psychosocial well-being. <b>Methods</b>: A cross-sectional, open survey study design was used. Canadian adult men who were visiting an eHealth depression resource (HeadsUpGuys.org) were recruited to complete an online survey. Descriptive statistics, including means and standard deviations for continuous variables and frequency and percentages for categorical variables, were used to summarize survey responses. Regression analysis was utilized to identify factors associated with various mental health indicators (anxiety, depression, fear of COVID-19, suicidality). The Patient Health Questionnaire-4, Fear of COVID-19 Scale, and item 9 (suicidality item) from the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 were used to assess the mental health indicators. <b>Results</b>: A total of 434 men completed the study. Most respondents (79.3%; N =Â 344) indicated that their mental health was negatively affected by COVID-19, and two-thirds (65.5%; N =Â 284) conveyed that government-imposed physical distancing measures had negatively affected their mental health. Half the sample (51.2%; N =Â 222) reported at least moderate financial stress due to COVID-19. Nearly a third of respondents (31.1%; N =Â 135) reported that their current living situation has had a considerable or severe negative impact on their mental health since COVID-19. About two-fifths (37.7%; N =Â 94) of men felt that COVID-19 has had a negative impact on their relationship with their intimate partner. Nearly a third of respondents who were in a relationship (30.9%; N =Â 77) reported that they engaged in some type of abuse (primarily verbal abuse, 22.9%; N =Â 57) toward their intimate partner during COVID-19, and more than a quarter (27.3%; N =Â 68) reported being abused by their intimate partner (also primarily verbal abuse, 22.5%; N =Â 56). Just under half (42.2%; N =Â 183) of the respondents indicated experiencing suicidal ideation. <b>Conclusion</b>: These findings can help inform providers of health services to Canadian men, as well as policies that will be implemented during subsequent waves of COVID-19 or during future infectious outbreaks.","Ogrodniczuk, Rice, Kealy, Seidler, Delara, Oliffe",https://doi.org/10.1080/00325481.2021.1873027,20210118.0,COVID-19; men; mental health; suicidal ideation,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
116,Medical Education During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"All aspects of medical education were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Several challenges were experienced by trainees and programs alike, including economic repercussions of the pandemic; social distancing affecting the delivery of medical education, testing, and interviewing; the surge of patients affecting redeployment of personnel and potential compromises in core training; and the overall impact on the wellness and mental health of trainees and educators. The ability of medical teams and researchers to peer review, conduct clinical research, and keep up with literature was similarly challenged by the rapid growth in peer-reviewed and preprint literature. This article reviews these challenges and shares strategies that institutions, educators, and learners adopted, adapted, and developed to provide quality education during these unprecedented times.","Kaul, Gallo de Moraes, Khateeb, Greenstein, Winter, Chae, Stewart, Qadir, Dangayach",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2020.12.026,20210323.0,COVID-19; MedEd; medical education; pandemic,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30

118,Right Heart Strain on Presenting 12-Lead Electrocardiogram Predicts Critical Illness in COVID-19,"This study aimed to assess the association of new right heart strain patterns on presenting 12-lead electrocardiogram (RHS-ECG) with outcomes in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Cardiovascular comorbidities and complications, including right ventricular dysfunction, are common and are associated with worse outcomes in patients with COVID-19. The data on the clinical usefulness of the 12-lead ECG to aid with prognosis are limited. This study retrospectively evaluated records from 480 patients who were consecutively admitted with COVID-19. ECGs obtained at presentation in the emergency department (ED) were considered index ECGs. RHS-ECG was defined by any new right-axis deviation, S<sub>1</sub>Q<sub>3</sub>T<sub>3</sub> pattern, or ST depressions with T-wave inversions in leads V<sub>1</sub> to V<sub>3</sub> or leads II, III, and aVF. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to assess whether RHS-ECGs were independently associated with primary outcomes. ECGs from the ED were available for 314 patients who were included in the analysis. Most patients were in sinus rhythm, with sinus tachycardia being the most frequent dysrhythmia. RHS-ECG findings were present in 40 (11%) patients. RHS-ECGs were significantly associated with the incidence of adverse outcomes and an independent predictor of mortality (adjusted odds ratio [adjOR]: 15.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.1 to 45.2; pÂ &lt;Â 0.001), the need for mechanical ventilation (adjOR: 8.8; 95%Â CI: 3.4 to 23.2; pÂ &lt;Â 0.001), and their composite (adjOR: 12.1; 95%Â CI: 4.3 to 33.9]; pÂ &lt;Â 0.001).

119,Suicidal Ideation Among Individuals Who Have Purchased Firearms During COVID-19,"Given the increase in firearm purchases during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study seeks to determine the extent to which COVID-19 firearm purchasers differ in terms of suicide risk from nonfirearm owners and firearm owners who did not make a purchase during COVID-19. Participants (N=3,500) were recruited through Qualtrics Panels to participate in an online survey examining methods for self-protection. ANCOVAs were utilized to assess suicidal ideation. Multivariate ANCOVAs were used to examine firearm storage practices and storage changes during COVID-19. Data were collected in late June and early July 2020, and analyses were conducted in July 2020. Individuals who purchased a firearm during COVID-19 more frequently reported lifetime, past-year, and past-month suicidal ideation than nonfirearm owners and firearm owners who did not make a purchase during COVID-19. COVID-19 purchasers with lifetime ideation were less likely to hide loaded firearms in a closet than those without lifetime ideation. COVID-19 purchasers with past-year or past-month ideation were more likely to use locking devices than COVID-19 purchasers without past-month ideation. In contrast to firearm owners more generally, COVID-19 firearm purchasers appear far more likely to have experienced suicidal ideation and appear less likely to use certain unsafe firearm storage methods but also report a greater number of storage changes during COVID-19 that made firearms less secure. Future research should seek to further understand those who purchased a firearm during COVID-19 and determine ways to increase secure storage among firearm owners.","Anestis, Bond, Daruwala, Bandel, Bryan",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2020.10.013,20210301.0,Adult; COVID-19; Consumer Behavior; Female; Firearms; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Ownership; Suicidal Ideation,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30

The questionnaire included measures of mental health symptoms, well-being, worry about the epidemic of COVID-19, likelihood of infection, coping efficacy, trust in the institutional response to the epidemic of COVID-19, financial loss, perceived house size, and media exposure to COVID-19 outbreak.<b>Results:</b> Gender (women), lower age, occupational status (employed), lower media exposure, higher worry, lower coping efficacy, lower trust in institutions, and negative attitudes toward quarantine measures predicted mental health symptoms. In addition, results showed that gender (men), higher age, socioeconomic status, occupational status (unemployed), higher coping efficacy and trust in institutions, and positive attitudes toward quarantine measures predicted well-being. The estimated prevalence of common mental disorders was 31.7% among men and 52.3% among women.

121,JAAM Nationwide Survey on the response to the first wave of COVID-19 in Japan Part I: How to set up a treatment system in each hospital,"To clarify how the medical institutions overcame the first wave of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Japan and to discuss its impact on the medical labor force. We analyzed questionnaire data from the end of May 2020 from 180 hospitals (102,578 beds) certified by the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine. Acute (emergency) medicine physicians treated severe COVID-19 patients in more than half of hospitals. Emergency medical teams consisted of acute medicine physicians and other specialists. Frontline acute care physicians were concerned about their risk of infection in 80% of hospitals, and experienced stress due to a lack of personal protective equipment. Twenty-six of the 143 hospitals that had a mental health check/consultation system in place indicated that there was a doctor who experienced mental health problems. Of the 37 hospitals without a system, only one hospital was aware of the presence of a doctor complaining of mental health problems. Acute care physicians and physicians in other departments experienced high levels of stress as they fought to arrange COVID-19 treatment teams and inpatient COVID-19 wards for infected patients. Medical materials and equipment may be sufficient for a second or third wave; however, active support is needed for the physical and mental care of medical staff. Mental health problems may be missed in facilities without mental check and consultation system.","Oda, Tanabe, Nishimura, Muguruma, Matsuyama, Sugawara, Ogura",https://doi.org/10.1002/ams2.614,20201219.0,COVIDâ€19; medical staff; mental care system; survey,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
122,Relationship of Physical Activity With Anxiety and Depression Symptoms in Chinese College Students During the COVID-19 Outbreak,"During the COVID-19 outbreak, many citizens were asked to stay at home in self-quarantine, which can pose a significant challenge with respect to remaining physically active and maintaining mental health. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of inadequate physical activity, anxiety, and depression and to explore the relationship of physical activity with anxiety and depression symptoms among Chinese college students during quarantine. Using a web-based cross-sectional survey, we collected data from 1,396 Chinese college students. Anxiety and depression were assessed with the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), respectively. The data on physical activity were collected by types of physical activity and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-SF). During the COVID-19 outbreak, about 52.3% of Chinese college students had inadequate physical activity. The rates of anxiety and depression symptoms were 31.0 and 41.8%, respectively. A high level of physical activity (Î² = -0.121, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) was significantly closely associated with low anxiety, while a moderate (Î² = -0.095, <i>P</i> = 0.001), or high (Î² = -0.179, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) level of physical activity was significantly closely associated with reduced depression after adjusting confounding demographic factors. Moreover, specific types of physical activity, such as stretching and resistance training, were negatively correlated with both anxiety and depression; doing household chores was negatively correlated with depression. Our findings highlight specific levels and types of home-based physical activities that need to be taken into consideration to protect the mental health of college students during the COVID-19 epidemic.","Xiang, Tan, Sun, Yang, Zhao, Liu, Hou, Hu",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.582436,20201218.0,COVID-19; anxiety; college students; depression; physical activity,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
123,Beneficial Effects of Exercise on Depression and Anxiety During the Covid-19 Pandemic: A Narrative Review,"First reported in Dec 2019, the on-going COVID-19 pandemic has become a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). The isolation and quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic limited the physical and social activities of the population, which contributed to the increased prevalence of mental disorder. Depression and anxiety are the most common mental illnesses conferring a serious impact on individuals' life quality. This review summarizes the mental health consequences of COVID-19, especially for depression and anxiety. Exercise as an intervention for anxiety and depression has been demonstrated in both of the animal studies and human clinical trials. The underlying mechanism including the regulation on the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), D-Î²-hydroxybutyrate, synaptic transmission, hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis, tryptophan hydroxylase, GSK3Î²/Î²-catenin pathway, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and PGC-1Î±1-PPAR axis. In addition, we summarized the exercise strategies to fight against anxiety and depression according to the information from American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), World Health Organization and recent literatures about physical exercise during COVID-19.","Hu, Tucker, Wu, Yang",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.587557,20201218.0,COVID-19; anxiety; depression; isolation; physical exercise; quarantine,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
124,Effect of Psychological-Behavioral Intervention on the Depression and Anxiety of COVID-19 Patients,"The COVID-19 epidemic has caused increasing public panic and mental health stress. In this study, we explore the prevalence and factors linked to anxiety and depression in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. A total of 144 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 underwent depression and anxiety assessment by using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Social support level was also evaluated by the Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS) at admission. Results showed that gender, age, oxygen saturation, and social support were associated with anxiety for COVID-19 patients. In addition, age, family infection with SARS-CoV-2, and social support were the risk factors associated with depression. Moreover, we designed a psychological-behavioral intervention (PBI) program that included psychological support and breathing exercises, and explored its effects on patients with COVID-19. Of the 144 participants, 26 patients with both anxiety and depression symptoms (cutoff score of â‰¥8 on HADS-A and HADS-D) were randomly assigned to the intervention group and the control group at a 1:1 ratio. After 10-day treatment, the HADS scores of depression and anxiety were significantly reduced in the intervention group, and PSSS scores were also significantly improved. However, no significant differences in HADS and PSSS scores between pre- and post-treatment were found in the control group. Our findings indicate that mental concern and appropriate intervention are essential parts of clinical care for COVID-19 patients.","Kong, Kong, Zheng, Tang, Chen, Zhou, Li, Diao, Wu, Jiao, Su, Dong",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.586355,20201218.0,COVID-19; anxiety; depression; psychological-behavioral intervention; social support,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
125,"Mental Health Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on International University Students, Related Stressors, and Coping Strategies","<b>Background:</b> The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted university teaching globally. The mental health impacts on international university students have been overlooked. <b>Aims:</b> This study examined the differences in COVID-19-related stressors and mental health impacts between international university students studying in the UK or USA who returned to their home country or region (returnees) and those who stayed in their institution country (stayers), and identified COVID-19-related stressors and coping strategies that were predictors of mental health. <b>Method:</b> An online questionnaire survey was conducted from April 28 through May 12, 2020 using an exponential, non-discriminative snowball sampling strategy (registered at the National Institutes of Health: NCT04365361). <b>Results:</b> A total of 124 full-time international university students (36.3% male) were included: 75.8% had returned to their home country or region for reasons related to COVID-19; 77.4% were pursuing a bachelor's program, and 53.2% were in programs with practicum component. 84.7% of all students had moderate-to-high perceived stress, 12.1% had moderate-to-severe symptoms of anxiety and depression, and 17.7% had moderate-to-severe symptoms of insomnia. Compared with returnees, stayers had significantly higher stress from COVID-19-related stressors such as personal health and lack of social support (Cohen's d: 0.57-1.11), higher perceived stress [10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10)] {22.6 Â± 6.2 vs. 19.1 Â± 6.1, Î² [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 4.039 (0.816, 7.261), Cohen's d: 0.52}, and more severe insomnia symptoms [Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)] [11.8 Â± 6.1 vs. 7.6 Â± 5.2, Î² (95% CI): 3.087 (0.262, 5.912), Cohen's d: 0.45], with moderate-to-large effect sizes. Compared with males, females reported significantly higher stress from uncertainties about academic program (Cohen's d: 0.45) with a small effect size. In the total sample, stress related to academics (e.g., personal attainment, uncertainties about academic program, and changes in teaching/learning format), health (including personal health and health of family and friends), availability of reliable COVID-19-related information, and lack of social support predicted more negative mental health impacts. Resilience, positive thinking, and exercise were predictors of less severe mental health impacts. <b>Conclusions:</b> Stayers experienced more adverse mental health impacts than returnees. We call on educators and mental health professionals to provide appropriate support for international students, particularly the stayers, during the pandemic.","Lai, Lee, Wang, Feng, Lai, Ho, Lam, Ip, Lam",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.584240,20201218.0,anxiety; coping; depression; insomnia; mental health; stress; students; university,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
126,A Systematic Review of the Impact of Viral Respiratory Epidemics on Mental Health: An Implication on the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic,"<b>Background:</b> The twenty-first century viral respiratory epidemics have taught us valuable lessons. Our systematic review examined the impact of these epidemics, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), on mental health among different population groups, drawing on their insights for recommendations for the current COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> Searches were performed on PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, and Cochrane on April 4, 2020. Studies that had undefined mental health outcomes or did not use a validated scale for measure were excluded. Quality assessment was carried out <i>via</i> the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. <b>Results:</b> We included 95 studies, most of which were conducted in Hong Kong (31.6%) and China (21.4%). A total of 30 (30.9%) studies are on the general public, 41 (42.2%) on healthcare workers, and 26 (26.6%) on patients and quarantined individuals. Furthermore, 36 (37.1%) of the studies are of high quality, 48 (49.5%) are of moderate quality, and 13 (13.4%) are of low quality. The most significant mental health outcomes reported include anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. The subgroups identified to have a higher risk of psychiatric symptoms among the general public include females, the elderly, individuals with chronic illness, migrant workers, and students. Long-term mental health impact was reported in some healthcare workers and epidemic patients, even up to 3 years in the former. Interestingly, when compared to non-quarantined groups, quarantine was not significantly associated with worse mental health outcomes. <b>Conclusion:</b> Important implications for the COVID-19 pandemic were highlighted. Respiratory epidemics pose a significant psychological morbidity onto many population groups. Psychological support for vulnerable groups, including healthcare workers and patients, should be implemented to prevent them from spiraling into clinical psychiatric conditions.","Luo, Chua, Xiong, Ho, Ho",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.565098,20201218.0,COVID-19; MERS; SARS; coronavirus; epidemics; influenza; mental health,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
127,Suicide Ideation and Attempts in a Pediatric Emergency Department Before and During COVID-19,"Elevated rates of mental health concerns have been identified during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In this study, we sought to evaluate whether youth reported a greater frequency of suicide-related behaviors during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic as compared with 2019. We hypothesized that rates of suicide-related behaviors would be elevated between the months of March and July 2020 as compared with 2019, corresponding to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Routine suicide-risk screening was completed with youth aged 11 to 21 in a pediatric emergency department. Electronic health records data for suicide-risk screens completed between January and July 2019 and January and July 2020 were evaluated. A total of 9092 completed screens were examined (mean age 14.72 years, 47.7% Hispanic and/or Latinx, 26.7% non-Hispanic white, 18.7% non-Hispanic Black). Rates of positive suicide-risk screen results from January to July 2020 were compared with corresponding rates from January to July 2019. Results indicated a significantly higher rate of suicide ideation in March and July 2020 and higher rates of suicide attempts in February, March, April, and July 2020 as compared with the same months in 2019. Rates of suicide ideation and attempts were higher during some months of 2020 as compared with 2019 but were not universally higher across this period. Months with significantly higher rates of suicide-related behaviors appear to correspond to times when COVID-19-related stressors and community responses were heightened, indicating that youth experienced elevated distress during these periods.","Hill, Rufino, Kurian, Saxena, Saxena, Williams",https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2020-029280,20210312.0,"Adolescent; COVID-19; Child; Emergency Service, Hospital; Female; Hospitals, Pediatric; Humans; Male; Pandemics; Prevalence; SARS-CoV-2; Stress, Psychological; Suicidal Ideation; Suicide, Attempted; United States; Young Adult",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
128,Mental health outcomes among patients from Fangcang shelter hospitals exposed to coronavirus disease 2019: An observational cross-sectional study,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not only attacking physical health, but it is also increasing psychological suffering. This study aimed to observe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health outcomes among patients with mild to moderate illness in Fangcang shelter hospitals. We conducted an observational, cross-sectional study of 129 patients with mild to moderate illness from Jiangxia Fangcang shelter hospitals in Wuhan, China. The participants were assessed by quantifying their symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and stressful life events and analyzing potential risk factors associated with these symptoms. Using correlation analysis, we examined associations between exposure to COVID-19 and subsequent psychological distress in response to the outbreak. In total, 49.6% of participants had depressive or anxiety symptoms. The depressive and anxiety symptoms were highly related to sleep disturbances and hypochondriasis (all <i>r</i>Â &gt;Â 0.50, <i>P</i>Â &lt;Â 0.01). The impact of the event was positively related to depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, sleep disturbances, hypochondriasis and life events (all <i>r</i>Â &gt;Â 0.35, <i>P</i>Â &lt;Â 0.01) but was negatively related to psychological resilience (<i>r</i>Â =Â -0.41, <i>P</i>Â &lt;Â 0.01). The presence of the COVID-19 infection in this setting was associated with increased anxiety, depression and stress levels, and decreased sleep quality, and seriously affected patients' quality of life as well as adversely affecting the course and prognosis of physical diseases. The sleep quality, anxiety, and depression of COVID-19 patients in Fangcang shelter hospitals were significantly related to the impact of the epidemic.","Zhang, Liu, Lin, Yan, Shen, Si",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cdtm.2020.12.001,20210319.0,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Psychological distress; Self assessment (Psychology),PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
129,[Anxiety and Depression Associated with the Management of COVID-19 Among Healthcare workers in Cameroon],"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact worldwide, at different levels. The literature consulted indicates that healthcare workers, who are the first to respond, are generally the ones who pay the highest price. The present study assesses the extent of anxious and depressive symptoms among these actors responding to COVID-19, in the context of Cameroon. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to assess anxious and depressive symptoms. Data collection involved the use of a web questionnaire for this purpose through the Google Forms virtual platform. The questionnaire link was sent to professional groups spread throughout Cameroon's ten regions. A total of 331 health professionals were interviewed over the period from April 5 to 19, 2020. The results show a high rate of anxiety (41.8%) and depression (42.8%). There is a higher susceptibility to depression in young people (30-39 years). Fear of contamination and fear of death are modulators of depression and anxiety. The anxiety-depression comorbidity in the sample is 14.73%. The prevalence rates of major depressive disorder and adjustment disorder in the sample were 8.2% and 3.3%, respectively. The data presented confirm the trends recorded in the literature regarding the impact of fatal epidemics on the mental health of healthcare workers. The results indicate, as is the case with most of the work consulted in the literature, that the Covid 19 pandemic is significantly affecting the mental health of healthcare workers. This underlines the urgency of setting up a specialized aid and/or support system, in the context of the current pandemic, such as that of similar health crises. Such a device does not exist in Cameroon, where the mental health response remains weak. These results suggest that the healthcare staff involved in the response to COVID-19 in Cameroon are significantly affected in their mental health. This underlines the need for specialized psychological help for nursing staff.","Mboua, Keubo, Fouaka",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.evopsy.2020.11.002,20210225.0,Adjustment disorder; Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Healthcare worker; Major depressive disorder; Mental health,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
130,Effects of COVID-19 Epidemic Lockdown on Postpartum Depressive Symptoms in a Sample of Italian Mothers,"The extraordinary health emergency of the COVID-19 pandemic represents a new challenge for mental health researchers and clinical practitioners. The related containment measures may be a risk factor for psychological distress and mood disorders, especially in at-risk populations. This study aims to explore the impact of COVID-19 on postpartum depressive symptoms in mothers with children below 1 year of age. An online questionnaire survey was therefore conducted in Italy between May and June 2020. The survey consisted of several self-administered questionnaires: besides some <i>ad-hoc</i> questionnaires, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), the Scale of Perceived Social Support (SPSS) and the Maternity Social Support Scale (MSSS) were used. Two hundred forty-three Italian women were included in the study. The prevalence of postpartum depression symptomatology among mothers was 44%, as measured through the EPDS (cut-off &gt;12). Women who spent the isolation in northern Italy adopted maladaptive coping strategies significantly more than women living in areas at lower risk. The analysis highlighted a significant difference between the group that was not directly affected by the virus and women who have had a direct or indirect contact with it. Besides situational factors specific to the pandemic, the results show that there are some risk factors tied to the personal history of the mother (e.g., having had a previous abortion). These data should inform and enlighten future protocols of intervention.","Spinola, Liotti, Speranza, Tambelli",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.589916,20201216.0,COVID- 19; lockdown; mental health; motherhood; postpartum depression (PPD),PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
131,Mental Health Status of Psychogeriatric Patients During the 2019 New Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic and Effects on Caregiver Burden,"<b>Introduction:</b> There is a growing awareness about the noxious effects of the 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic on the mental health of the elderly. However, there is limited information from clinically driven research. The objectives of the present study were to examine the magnitude of psychiatric symptoms and to determine their association with caregiver distress, in a cross-section of community-dwelling older adults and a subsample of aging adults with Down syndrome (DS) attending a psychogeriatric service in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. <b>Method:</b> Telephone-based interviews and electronically filled self-assessment questionnaires were used to collect information from patients and caregivers, addressing their impressions and concerns about the pandemic and related effects on the patient's emotional state and behavior. Clinical information was obtained from hospital charts, medical records, and psychometric tests administered through telephone interviews [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q)]. <b>Results:</b> We included 100 consecutive participants, comprising 71 older adults with psychogeriatric/neurocognitive disorders and 29 aging adults with DS. Higher HADS and NPI-Q scores were significantly associated with caregiver distress (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) in both groups. Correlation analyses indicated strong, positive associations between caregiver burden and scores in HADS anxiety (HADS-A) and HADS depression (HADS-D) scales in the subsamples of euploid and DS subjects. Higher NPI-Q scores in the former group were also correlated with caregiver distress, with stronger associations for neuropsychiatric symptoms. Similar findings were observed among DS subjects. ANOVA tests indicated significant associations between NPI-Q scores and caregiver distress among dementia patients, as well as with HADS scores. Similar results were found after multiple linear regressions; as such, among the elderly subsample, higher scores in HADS-A (<i>p</i> = 0.002) and HADS-D (<i>p</i> = 0.001) predict a significant impact on caregiver burden (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.00001, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> 0.46); taking into consideration caregiver burden as a dependent variable and NPI-Q total score as an independent variable, we obtained significant strong prediction values for either DS (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.00001, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> 0.95) or elderly adults (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.00001, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> 0.88). <b>Conclusion:</b> During the COVID-19 pandemic, patients with neurocognitive disorders present with clinically relevant neuropsychiatric symptoms, with significant impact on caregiver distress.

An online questionnaire was applied with questions to assess sociodemographic characteristics and physical exercise during the CoVID-19 pandemic, in addition to depression, anxiety, and stress analysis. The study was approved by the local ethics committee (CAAE: 31521720.8.0000.5082). <b>Results:</b> One thousand one hundred and fifty four answered the questionnaire (69.84% female). During the isolation period, the number of participants who declared not to exercise was 54.16%. Women generaly presented higher levels of anxiety, depression, and stress when compared to men (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001 for all domains). The risk of having increased anxiety were 118% higher (OR = 2.183; 95% CI = 1.717-2.775), the risk of depression was 152% higher (OR = 2.525; 95% CI = 1.991-3.205), and the risk of stress symptoms increased 75.1% (OR = 1.751; 95% CI = 1.386-2.213) in the participants who did not perform PE when compared to those who maintain regular PE. <b>Conclusion:</b> People who was not involved with PE during the COVID-19 pandemic had higher anxiety, depression, and stress scores.

135,Healthy Dietary Intake Behavior Potentially Modifies the Negative Effect of COVID-19 Lockdown on Depression: A Hospital and Health Center Survey,"<b>Background:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic causes a huge burden for affected countries. Several public health interventions were applied to contain the infection. However, the pandemic itself and the lockdown measure negatively influence people's lifestyles and psychological health. <b>Purpose:</b> To explore determinants of healthy dietary intake and depression, and examine the interaction between healthy dietary intake and COVID-19 lockdown on depression. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional study was conducted at 18 hospitals and health centers from February 14 to May 31, 2020. Data of 8,291 outpatients were collected including patients' characteristics, clinical parameters, health literacy, healthy dietary intake (using the healthy eating score, HES), other health-related behaviors, and depression (using the patient health questionnaire, PHQ). Depression was defined as PHQ score â‰¥ 10. <b>Results:</b> Protective factors of healthy dietary intake and depression were higher education, better medication payment ability, higher social status, more physical activity, and higher health literacy, whereas older age, ever married, own business or other types of occupation, lockdown, suspected COVID-19 symptoms, and comorbidity were associated with lower HES scores and a higher depression likelihood. Besides, overweight/obesity and alcohol drinking were associated with lower HES scores. As compared with patients not under lockdown and with lowest HES score, those who were under lockdown and with lowest HES score had 10.6 times higher depression likelihood (odds ratio, OR, 10.60; 95% CI 6.88, 16.32; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), whereas people with higher HES score had 15% lower depression likelihood (OR 0.85; 95% CI 0.82, 0.89; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). <b>Conclusions:</b> Healthy dietary intake and depression were determined by several sociodemographic, clinical, and behavioral factors. Lockdown measure affects people's dietary intake behavior and depression. Importantly, healthy dietary intake potentially modifies the negative effect of lockdown on depression.","Pham, Pham, Phan, Tran, Nguyen, Nguyen, Nguyen, Ha, Dao, Nguyen, Trinh, Do, Nguyen, Nguyen, Nguyen, Tran, Tran, Duong, Nguyen, Do, Vo, Do, Duong, Pham, Le, Do, Nguyen, Mai, Ha, Ngo, Nguyen, Yang, Chao, Duong",https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2020.581043,20201212.0,COVID-19; comorbidity; coronavirus; healthy eating; lockdown; obesity; physical activity; psychological,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
136,Poor Sleep Quality and Its Consequences on Mental Health During the COVID-19 Lockdown in Italy,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) seriously affected the whole of Italy. The extreme virulence and the speed of propagation resulted in restrictions and home confinement. This change was immediately perceived by people who found themselves exposed to feelings of uncertainty, fear, anger, stress, and a drastic change in the diurnal but above all nocturnal lifestyle. For these reasons, we aimed to study the quality of sleep and its connection to distress levels and to evaluate how lifestyle changed in the Italian population during the lockdown. By means of an Internet survey we recruited 6,519 adults during the whole of the COVID-19 lockdown (from March 10-1st phase to May 4-2nd phase). We investigated the sociodemographic and COVID-19-related information and assessed sleep quality using the Medical Outcomes Study-sleep scale (MOS-SS) and mental health with the short form of Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales-21 Items (DASS-21). Multiple logistic regression model was used to evaluate the multivariate association between the dependent variable (good sleeper vs. poor sleeper) and all the variables that were significant in the univariate analysis. A total of 3,562 (55.32%) participants reported poor sleep quality according to the MOS-Sleep Index II score. The multiple binary logistic regression results of poor sleepers revealed several risk factors during the outbreak restrictions: female gender, living in Central Italy, having someone close who died because of COVID-19, markedly changed sleep-wake rhythms characterized by earlier or postponed habitual bedtime, earlier habitual awakening time and reduced number of afternoon naps, and extremely severe levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. This is the first study designed to understand sleep quality and sleep habits during the whole of the lockdown period in the Italian population that provides more than 6,000 participants in a survey developed specifically for the health emergency related to COVID-19. Our study found that more than half of the Italian population had impaired sleep quality and sleep habits due to elevated psychological distress during the COVID-19 lockdown containment measures. A multidisciplinary action should be undertaken in order to plan appropriate responses to the current crisis caused by the lockdown for the COVID-19 outbreak.","Franceschini, Musetti, Zenesini, Palagini, Scarpelli, Quattropani, Lenzo, Freda, Lemmo, Vegni, Borghi, Saita, Cattivelli, De Gennaro, Plazzi, Riemann, Castelnuovo",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.574475,20201212.0,COVID-19; Italian lockdown; anxiety; clinical psychology; depression; sleep habits; sleep quality; stress,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
137,"Social, Cognitive, and eHealth Mechanisms of COVID-19-Related Lockdown and Mandatory Quarantine That Potentially Affect the Mental Health of Pregnant Women in China: Cross-Sectional Survey Study","Although lockdown and mandatory quarantine measures have played crucial roles in the sharp decrease of the number of newly confirmed/suspected COVID-19 cases, concerns have been raised over the threat that these measures pose to mental health, especially the mental health of vulnerable groups, including pregnant women. Few empirical studies have assessed whether and how these control measures may affect mental health, and no study has investigated the prevalence and impacts of the use of eHealth resources among pregnant women during the COVID-19 outbreak. This study investigated (1) the effects of lockdown and mandatory quarantine on mental health problems (ie, anxiety and depressive symptoms), (2) the potential mediation effects of perceived social support and maladaptive cognition, and (3) the moderation effects of eHealth-related factors (ie, using social media to obtain health information and using prenatal care services during the COVID-19 pandemic) on pregnant women in China. An online cross-sectional survey was conducted among 19,515 pregnant women from all 34 Chinese provincial-level administrative regions from February 25 to March 10, 2020. Of the 19,515 participants, 12,209 (62.6%) were subjected to lockdown in their areas of residence, 737 (3.8%) were subjected to mandatory quarantine, 8712 (44.6%) had probable mild to severe depression, 5696 (29.2%) had probable mild to severe anxiety, and 1442 (7.4%) had suicidal ideations. Only 640 (3.3%) participants reported that they used online prenatal care services during the outbreak. Significant sociodemographic/maternal factors of anxiety/depressive symptoms included age, education, occupation, the area of residence, gestational duration, the number of children born, complication during pregnancy, the means of using prenatal care services, and social media use for obtaining health information. Multiple indicators multiple causes modeling (Ï‡<sup>2</sup><sub>14</sub>=495.21; P&lt;.05; comparative fit index=.99; nonnormed fit index=.98; root mean square error of approximation=.04, 90% CI 0.038-0.045) showed that quarantine was directly and indirectly strongly associated with poor mental health through decreased perceived social support and increased maladaptive cognition (B=.04; Î²=.02, 95% CI 0.01-0.02; P=.001), while lockdown was indirectly associated with mental health through increased social support and maladaptive cognition among pregnant women (B=.03; Î²=.03, 95% CI 0.02-0.03; P=.001). Multigroup analyses revealed that the use of social media for obtaining health information and the means of using prenatal care services were significant moderators of the model paths. Our findings provide epidemiological evidence for the importance of integrating mental health care and eHealth into the planning and implementation of control measure policies. The observed social and cognitive mechanisms and moderators in this study are modifiable, and they can inform the design of evidence-based mental health promotion among pregnant women.","Yang, Song, Wu, Mo, Di, Wang, Lau, Wang",https://doi.org/10.2196/24495,20210128.0,anxiety; depression; eHealth; lockdown; pregnant women; quarantine; Adult; Anxiety; COVID-19; China; Cognition; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Female; Humans; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pregnancy; Pregnant Women; Prenatal Care; Quarantine; Suicidal Ideation; Surveys and Questionnaires; Telemedicine,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
138,"The effect of Emotional Freedom Techniques on nurses' stress, anxiety, and burnout levels during the COVID-19 pandemic: A randomized controlled trial","Infectious disease outbreaks pose psychological challenges to the general population, and especially to healthcare workers. Nurses who work with COVID-19 patients are particularly vulnerable to emotions such as fear and anxiety, due to fatigue, discomfort, and helplessness related to their high intensity work. This study aims to investigate the efficacy of a brief online form of Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT) in the prevention of stress, anxiety, and burnout in nurses involved in the treatment of COVID patients. The study is a randomized controlled trial. It complies with the guidelines prescribed by the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) checklist. It was conducted in a COVID-19 department at a university hospital in Turkey. We recruited nurses who care for patients infected with COVID-19 and randomly allocated them into an intervention group (nÂ =Â 35) and a no-treatment control group (nÂ =Â 37). The intervention group received one guided online group EFT session. Reductions in stress (p &lt; .001), anxiety (p &lt; .001), and burnout (p &lt; .001) reached high levels of statistical significance for the intervention group.

139,&quot;Staying at home&quot; to tackle COVID-19 pandemic: rhetoric or reality? Cross-cutting analysis of nine population groups vulnerable to homelessness in Japan,"Although the &quot;stay-at-home&quot; order is advocated against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the lives of individuals lacking adequate housing are threatened. We developed a framework to assess various populations with unstable housing in terms of socio-economic consequences of COVID-19, risk of COVID-19 infection and progression, existing/urgent measures, and remaining challenges. Within the framework, nine groups vulnerable to homelessness in Japan were classified into (i) &quot;people without accommodation,&quot; (ii) &quot;people living in temporary or crisis accommodation,&quot; and (iii) populations that include &quot;people living in severely inadequate and insecure accommodation.&quot; The assessment revealed that &quot;staying at home&quot; was physically and practically unattainable across groups. The study identified specific institutional, social, and cultural challenges apart from the common economic crisis, whereas the utilization of social welfare was low. Findings suggest that the rapid increase of groups classified as &quot;(i)&quot; and &quot;(ii)&quot; should be addressed by engaging stakeholders to enhance the availability and accessibility of social welfare and rescue measures, and to ensure safe and private accommodations for all groups. It is critical to enhance multi-sectoral collaboration in responding to the common and specific vulnerabilities of these population groups from health, socio-economic, and humanitarian perspectives. Under the pandemic, homelessness should be regarded less as a peculiar problem for specific populations but an extension of daily life. The framework can be a reference when planning the comprehensive yet concise assessment of populations with unstable housing in other countries to inform responses to the pandemic.","Fujita, Matsuoka, Kiyohara, Kumakura, Takeda, Goishi, Tarui, Inaba, Nagai, Hachiya, Fujita",https://doi.org/10.1186/s41182-020-00281-0,20201212.0,COVID-19; Homelessness; Staying at home; Vulnerable populations,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
140,Analysis of news media reports of suicides and attempted suicides during the COVID-19 lockdown in India,"Based on previous experience there is justifiable concern about suicidal behaviour and news media reporting of it during COVID-19 pandemic. This study used a systematic search of online news media reports (versions of newspapers, magazine and other digital publications) of suicidal behaviour during India's COVID-19 lockdown and compared it to corresponding dates in 2019. Data was gathered using a uniform search strategy from 56 online news media publications 24 March to 3 May for the years 2019 and 2020 using keywords, suicide, attempted suicide, hangs self and kills self. Demographic variables and methods used for suicide were compared for suicide and attempts between the 2Â years using chi-squared tests (Ï‡<sup>2</sup>). There were online news media reports of 369 cases of suicides and attempted suicides during COVID lockdown vs 220 reports in 2019, a 67.7% increase in online news media reports of suicidal behaviour. Compared to 2019, suicides reported during lockdown were significantly older (30 vs 50Â years, pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.05), men (71.2% vs 58.7%; pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.01), married (77.7% vs 49%; pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.01) and employed (82.9% vs 59.5%; pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.01). During the lockdown, significantly more suicides were by hanging (64.4% vs 42%), while poisoning (8.5% vs 21.5%) and jumping in front of a train (2% vs 9.4%) (pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.05) were significantly reduced. Comparison of COVID and non-COVID groups showed that online news media reports of COVID cases of suicide and attempted suicide were significantly more likely to be men (84.7% vs 60.4%; pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.01), older (31-50Â years 52.9% vs 25.8%; pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.01) employed (91.5% vs 64.3%; pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.01), had poor mental (40.1% vs 20.8%; pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.01) and poor physical health (24.8% vs 7.9%;11.8, pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.01). Increase in online news media reports of suicides and attempts during COVID-19 lockdown may indicate an increase in journalists' awareness about suicide or more sensational media reporting or may be a proxy indicator of a real community increase in suicidal behaviour. It is difficult to attribute changes in demographic profile and methods used only to changes in journalists' reporting behaviour and should be further explored. We therefore call upon the Government of India to urgently release national suicide data to help devise a comprehensive suicide prevention strategy to address COVID-19 suicidal behaviour.","Pathare, Vijayakumar, Fernandes, Shastri, Kapoor, Pandit, Lohumi, Ray, Kulkarni, Korde",https://doi.org/10.1186/s13033-020-00422-2,20201212.0,Attempted suicides; COVID-19; India; Lockdown; Reports; Suicide,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
141,Mental Health and Burnout Syndrome Among Postgraduate Students in Medical and Multidisciplinary Residencies During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Brazil: Protocol for a Prospective Cohort Study,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to high levels of physical, psychological, and social stress among health care professionals, including postgraduate students in medical and multidisciplinary residencies. This stress is associated with the intense fear of occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the virus known to cause COVID-19. These professionals are at risk of developing physical and mental illnesses not only due to the infection but also due to prolonged exposure to multidimensional stress and continued work overload. This study aims to evaluate the prevalence of symptoms suggestive of mental disorders and burnout syndrome and determine the risk factors for burnout among postgraduate students in medical and multidisciplinary residencies in Brazil during the COVID-19 pandemic. For this prospective cohort study with parallel groups, participants were recruited between July and September 2020 to achieve a sample size of at least 1144 participants. Research instruments such as Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale; Patient Health Questionnaire; Brief Resilient Coping Scale; and Oldenburg Burnout Inventory will be used to collect data. Data will be collected in 2 waves: the first wave will include data related to sample characterization and psychosocial evaluation, and the second wave will be launched 12 weeks later and will include an evaluation of the incidence of burnout as well as correlations with the potential predictive factors collected in the first wave. Additionally, we will collect data regarding participants' withdrawal from work. The recruitment took place from July 29 to September 5, 2020. Data analyses for this phase is already in progress. The second phase of the study is also in progress. The final data collection began on December 1, 2020, and it will be completed by December 31, 2020.

142,&quot;I Hate This&quot;: A Qualitative Analysis of Adolescents' Self-Reported Challenges During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic presents unique challenges for adolescents because of disruptions in school and social life. We compiled a diverse group (36.8% nonwhite or multiracial) of high schoolers' open-ended responses to the question: &quot;What are your three biggest challenges right now?&quot; (NÂ = 719 adolescents). Using open and axial coding, we identified NÂ = 1,902 thematic units (MÂ = 2.64, SDÂ = .701) and 14 thematic categories, including mental health, physical health, family, friends, social connection and community, academics, missing important events, socioeconomic issues, routine, COVID rules and adjustment, contraction/exposure to COVID, technology, and future plans. Adolescents most commonly reported challenges related to academics (23.7%) but also cited high numbers of challenges in mental (14.8%) and physical (13.2%) health and friend (11.4%) domains. Efforts should focus on helping adolescents cultivate academic skills needed during school closures, providing mental/physical health resources and helping them navigate peer relationships-especially given ongoing remote education and social distancing due to the pandemic.","Scott, Rivera, Rushing, Manczak, Rozek, Doom",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.11.010,20210222.0,"COVID-19; Public health; School closure; Social distancing; Adolescent; COVID-19; Education, Distance; Family; Female; Friends; Health Status; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Qualitative Research; Social Interaction; Students",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
143,The Impact of Coping Strategies and Perceived Family Support on Depressive and Anxious Symptomatology During the Coronavirus Pandemic (COVID-19) Lockdown,"The coronavirus pandemic represents a severe global crisis, affecting physical, and psychological health. Lockdown rules imposed to counteract the rapid growth of COVID-19, mainly social restrictions, have represented a risk factor for developing depressive and anxious symptoms. The research aims are to explore the effect of coping strategies and perceived social support on depressive and anxious symptomatology during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ninety-six healthy people (46 males, mean age = 39.3; <i>SD</i> = 16.6) completed through on-line platform: Socio-demographic questionnaire, Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (CISS), Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) and Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R), 3 weeks after the imposition of lockdown restrictions. SCL-90-R Depression scores showed significant positive correlation with CISS Emotion (<i>r</i> = 0.85; <i>p</i> = 0.001) and Avoidant (<i>r</i> = 0.34; <i>p</i> = 0.018), a significant negative correlation with MSPSS Family support (<i>r</i> = -0.43; <i>p</i> = 0.003). SCL-90-R Anxiety scores showed a significant positive correlation with CISS Emotion (<i>r</i> = 0.72; <i>p</i> = 0.001) and Avoidant (<i>r</i> = 0.35; <i>p</i> = 0.016). No significant correlations between both CISS Emotion and Avoidant scales with social support emerged. Two Multiple Linear Regression analysis were performed using, respectively, SCL-90-R Depression and Anxiety scores as dependent variables, and the CISS and MSPSS scales, age, and gender as predictors. The first regression model (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.78; adjusted <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.75) revealed CISS Emotion (Î² = 0.83; <i>p</i> = 0.001) and MSPSS Family support (Î² = -0.24; <i>p</i> = 0.004) had a predictive effect on SCL-90-R Depression scores. The second regression model (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.52; adjusted <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.472) revealed that only CISS Emotion (Î² = 0.71; <i>p</i> = 0.001) predicted the SCL-90-R Anxiety scores. In conclusion, during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns, coping focus on emotions seemed to increase anxious and depressive symptoms, probably due to the uncontrollable nature of the stressful event and the high emotional response. Family support which reduces the sense of loneliness had an exclusive role in mitigating depressive symptoms. These results highlight the importance of promoting psychological strategies to improve emotional regulation skills, reducing isolation from family, to prevent mood symptomatology in healthy citizens during large-scale health crises.","Mariani, Renzi, Di Trani, Trabucchi, Danskin, Tambelli",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.587724,20201208.0,COVID-19; anxiety; coping strategies; coronavirus pandemic; depression; perceived support,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
144,Identification of Functional Limitations and Discharge Destination in Patients With COVID-19,"The objectives of this study were to identify functional limitations in patients with coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) admitted to acute care hospitals; to evaluate functional limitations by demographic, medical, and encounter characteristics; and to examine functional limitations in relation to discharge destination. and Setting:This is a cross-sectional, retrospective study of adult patients with COVID-19 who were discharged from 2 different types of hospitals (academic medical center and a community hospital) within 1 health care system from January 1 to April 30,Â 2020. Patients were identified from the Cedars-Sinai COVID-19 data registry who had a new-onset positive test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. A total of 273 patients were identified, which included 230 patients who were discharged alive and 43 patients who died and were excluded from the study sample. Not applicable. Functional limitations in patients with COVID-19 in acute care hospitals and the predictors for discharge disposition. A total of 230 records were analyzed including demographic, encounter, medical, and functional variables. In a propensity score-matched cohort based on age and comorbidity, 88.2% had functional physical health deficits, 72.5% had functional mental health deficits, and 17.6% experienced sensory deficits. In the matched cohort, individuals discharged to an institution experienced greater physical (62.7% vs 25.5%, P&lt;.001) and mental health (49.0% vs 23.5%, P=.006) deficits than patients discharged home. Marital status (odds ratio, 3.17; P=.011) and physical function deficits (odds ratio, 3.63; P=.025) were associated with an increase odds ratio of discharge to an institution. This research highlights that functional status is a strong predictor for discharge destination to an institution for patients with COVID-19. Patients who were older, in the acute care hospital longer, and with comorbidities were more likely to be discharged to an institution. Rehabilitation is a significant aspect of the health care system for these vulnerable patients. The challenges of adjusting the role of rehabilitation providers and systems during the pandemic needs further exploration. Moreover, additional research is needed to look more closely at the many facets and timing of functional status needs, to shed light in use of interdisciplinary rehabilitation services, and to guide providers and health care systems in facilitating optimal recovery and patient outcomes.","Roberts, Wertheimer, Park, NuÃ±o, Riggs",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apmr.2020.11.005,20210308.0,"COVID-19; Rehabilitation; Academic Medical Centers; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Hospitals, Community; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Patient Discharge; Physical Functional Performance; Propensity Score; Recovery of Function; Registries; Rehabilitation Centers; Retrospective Studies; SARS-CoV-2",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30

146,Burnout and Associated Factors Among Health Care Workers in Singapore During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The strain on health care systems due to the COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased psychological distress among health care workers (HCWs). As this global crisis continues with little signs of abatement, we examine burnout and associated factors among HCWs. Cross-sectional survey study. Doctors, nurses, allied health professionals, administrative, and support staff in 4 public hospitals and 1 primary care service in Singapore 3Â months after COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic. Study questionnaire captured demographic and workplace environment information and comprised 3 validated instruments, namely the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI), Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Multivariate mixed model regression analyses were used to evaluate independent associations of mean OLBI-Disengagement and -Exhaustion scores. Further subgroup analysis was performed among redeployed HCWs. Among 11,286 invited HCWs, 3075 valid responses were received, giving an overall response rate of 27.2%. Mean OLBI scores were 2.38 and 2.50 for Disengagement and Exhaustion, respectively. Burnout thresholds in Disengagement and Exhaustion were met by 79.7% and 75.3% of respondents, respectively. On multivariate regression analysis, Chinese or Malay ethnicity, HADS anxiety or depression scores â‰¥8, shifts lasting â‰¥8Â hours, and being redeployed were significantly associated with higher OLBI mean scores, whereas high SAQ scores were significantly associated with lower scores. Among redeployed HCWs, those redeployed to high-risk areas in a different facility (offsite) had lower burnout scores than those redeployed within their own work facility (onsite). A higher proportion of HCWs redeployed offsite assessed their training to be good or better compared with those redeployed onsite. Every level of the health care workforce is susceptible to high levels of burnout during this pandemic. Modifiable workplace factors include adequate training, avoiding prolonged shifts â‰¥8Â hours, and promoting safe working environments. Mitigating strategies should target every level of the health care workforce, including frontline and nonfrontline staff. Addressing and ameliorating burnout among HCWs should be a key priority for the sustainment of efforts to care for patients in the face of a prolonged pandemic.","Tan, Kanneganti, Lim, Tan, Chua, Tan, Sia, Denning, Goh, Purkayastha, Kinross, Sim, Chan, Ooi",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2020.09.035,20201218.0,"COVID-19; anxiety; burnout; depression; health care workers; pandemic; Adult; Anxiety; Burnout, Professional; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Singapore; Surveys and Questionnaires",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
147,&quot;The psychological impact of COVID-19 on medical education of final year students in Pakistan: A cross-sectional study&quot;,"COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a strong impact on students' wellbeing, with associated uncertainty about the future. We conducted a cross-sectional survey to assess the psychological effects of COVID-19 on the medical education of final year students in Pakistan. We conducted prospective, cross-sectional survey, as a snapshot, from June 07, 2020 till June 16, 2020, among final year medical and dental students. The 20-questions survey questionnaire was based on rating-scale items to focus on psychological symptoms, institutional preparedness for such crisis and confidence in becoming a future doctor. Descriptive statistics were calculated using Multivariate regression analysis. Majority of participants (nâ€¯=â€¯1753/2661, 65.9%) were female. Despite timely closure of institutes, delay in the start of the online teaching (beta coefficient 0.08, P-value 0.02) was significantly correlated with the depressive symptoms. A significant percentage of students (nâ€¯=â€¯1594, 59.9%) wanted a delay in exit exams due to intimidation. A similar proportion of students also lost confidence to be a competent doctor in future which was positively associated with male gender (beta coefficient 0.21, P-valueâ€¯&lt;â€¯0.001). Our study shows that COVID-19 pandemic has brought significant psychological influence on the medical education of final year students. Despite a stressful crisis, final year medical and dental students are still willing to serve the community. In addition to supporting their emotions and psychological wellbeing, stress counselling, and transforming current medical curricula is crucial to pursue ceaseless medical education and to become a safe future doctor.","Dhahri, Arain, Memon, Rao, Mian, Khan, Hafeez, Dhahri, Mustafa, Malhi, Iqbal, Ahmad, Aziz, Arain, Nankani, Hussain, Kausar, Saqlain, Chawla, Azhar, Haneef, Arain, Arain, Shahid, Iqbal, Mughal, Awan, Mehbub, Qiam, Abro, Khattak, Bhatti, Choudhary, Khan, Baqai, Afzal, Dhahri, Dhahri, Ghufran, Umbrin, Shehdio, Shaikh, Dhahri, Memon, Yousufzai, Kumar, Ilyas, Chaudhary, Nawaz, Bilal, Faraz, Chawla, Shaikh",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2020.11.025,20210127.0,,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
148,"Young people, mental health and COVID-19 infection: the canaries we put in the coal mine","The number of people testing positive for Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) in the UK, particularly among young adults, is increasing. We report here on the mental health of young adults and related psychological and behavioural responses to the pandemic and consider the role of these factors in fuelling the increase in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in this group. An online survey was completed during the first six weeks of the first UK-wide lockdown by 3097 respondents, including data for 364 respondents aged 18-24 years. The survey included measures of mental health and indices capturing related psychological and behavioural responses to the pandemic. The mental health of 18- to 24-years-olds in the first 6 weeks of lockdown was significantly poorer than that of older respondents and previously published norms: with 84% reporting symptoms of depression and 72% reporting symptoms of anxiety. Young adults also reported significantly greater loneliness and reduced positive mood, both of which were also associated with greater mental health difficulties. We contend that the combination of mental health, social and economic considerations may have contributed to the rise of COVID-19 infections in young adults, and ascribing blame to this group will not aid our efforts to regain control of the disease.","Jia, Ayling, Chalder, Massey, Broadbent, Morling, Coupland, Vedhara",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2020.10.018,20210101.0,Behaviour; COVID-19; Mental health; Young people; Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior; Anxiety; Anxiety Disorders; COVID-19; Communicable Disease Control; Depression; Female; Humans; Loneliness; Male; Mental Health; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires; United Kingdom; Young Adult,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
149,Predictors of managers' mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic,"This study reports early evidence of managers' mental health and its predictors during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in May 2020. In a sample of 646 managers from 49 countries, 5.3% (32) of managers reached the cut-off levels for disorders in distress (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale-6; K-6), 7.3% (38) experienced anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder-7; GAD-7), and 10.7% (56) had depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9; PHQ-9). Age, relative income, and work status each predicted at least one of the conditions. Managers' 'illegitimate tasks' caused by COVID-19 predicted all three. Particularly noteworthy is the finding that the degree of downsizing an organization experienced during COVID-19 significantly predicted distress, anxiety, and depression for managers at the highest level (board members) only. This study helps identify managers in need of healthcare services as the COVID-19 pandemic affects organizations and their managers around the world. Este estudio informa sobre evidencia temprana en salud mental de los gerentes y sus predictores durante la pandemia de la enfermedad del coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) en mayo de 2020. En una muestra de 646 gerentes de 49 paÃ­ses, el 5.3% (32) de los gerentes alcanzaron niveles de punto de corte para trastornos en angustia (escala de angustia PsicolÃ³gica de Kessler-6; K-6), el 7,3% (38) experimentÃ³ ansiedad (Trastorno de ansiedad generalizado-7; GAD-7) y el 10,7% (56) tenÃ­a depresiÃ³n (Cuestionario de salud del paciente- 9; PHQ-9). La edad, los ingresos relativos y la situaciÃ³n laboral predijeron por si solos al menos una de las condiciones. Las â€˜tareas ilegÃ­timasâ€™ de los gerentes causadas por COVID-19 predijeron las tres. Particularmente digno de menciÃ³n es el hallazgo de que el grado de reducciÃ³n que experimentÃ³ una organizaciÃ³n durante el COVID-19 predijo significativamente angustia, ansiedad y depresiÃ³n solo para los gerentes del mÃ¡s alto nivel (miembros del directorio).

151,A Digital Program (Hope) for People Living With Cancer During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Protocol for a Feasibility Randomized Controlled Trial,"During the COVID-19 lockdown period in the United Kingdom that began on March 23, 2020, more than a quarter of a million people with cancer reported worsening mental health. Help to Overcome Problems Effectively (Hope) is a self-management program for people with cancer, designed to provide support for distress, unmet needs, and poor psychological health. In light of social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic, digital delivery of the Hope Programme has become ever more vital for people with cancer. Previous pre-post studies of the digital Hope Programme have found reduced anxiety and depression and improved well-being for people with cancer. However, evaluation of this evidence has been limited by the lack of a control group in these previous studies. We now present a protocol for a feasibility randomized controlled trial of the digital Hope Programme for people with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. Primary outcomes will be recruitment, dropout, and adherence rates, and estimations of sample and effect size. To detect signals of efficacy, secondary outcomes will be participant mental health and well-being. Participants will be recruited by Macmillan Cancer Support (MCS) through their social media networks. The study will employ a feasibility wait-list randomized controlled trial (RCT) design, with people with cancer being randomized to join the digital Hope Programme immediately (intervention group [IG]) or join a 6-week waiting list (wait-list control group [WLCG]) with a 1:1 allocation ratio. Participants will complete digital measures of depression, anxiety, mental well-being, and confidence in managing their own health. Online questionnaires will be administered preprogram and 6 weeks postprogram. All people who had requested access to the Hope Programme from MCS (N=61) will be invited to participate in the trial. Baseline data collection commenced in April 2020, and the Hope Programme began for the IG in May 2020 and for the WLCG in June 2020. Postprogram data collection was completed by the end of August 2020. This feasibility study will provide data to inform the design of a future definitive trial. Wider-scale provision of the digital Hope Programme has potential to improve the lives of thousands of people with cancer and reduce the burden on health care providers during these unprecedented times.

153,Mental health before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in two longitudinal UK population cohorts,"The COVID-19 pandemic and mitigation measures are likely to have a marked effect on mental health. It is important to use longitudinal data to improve inferences. To quantify the prevalence of depression, anxiety and mental well-being before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, to identify groups at risk of depression and/or anxiety during the pandemic. Data were from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) index generation (n = 2850, mean age 28 years) and parent generation (n = 3720, mean age 59 years), and Generation Scotland (n = 4233, mean age 59 years). Depression was measured with the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire in ALSPAC and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 in Generation Scotland. Anxiety and mental well-being were measured with the Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment-7 and the Short Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale. Depression during the pandemic was similar to pre-pandemic levels in the ALSPAC index generation, but those experiencing anxiety had almost doubled, at 24% (95% CI 23-26%) compared with a pre-pandemic level of 13% (95% CI 12-14%). In both studies, anxiety and depression during the pandemic was greater in younger members, women, those with pre-existing mental/physical health conditions and individuals in socioeconomic adversity, even when controlling for pre-pandemic anxiety and depression. These results provide evidence for increased anxiety in young people that is coincident with the pandemic. Specific groups are at elevated risk of depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic.

154,Suicidal ideation among Bangladeshi university students early during the COVID-19 pandemic: Prevalence estimates and correlates,"Lockdown, social isolation, and interruption of daily life during the COVID-19 period have impacted many lives. University students are particularly vulnerable to such disruptions and may be particularly disposed to suicidal ideation, potentially creating a new public health crisis. This study aimed to assess suicidal ideation and associated factors among university students in Bangladesh during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted using the Google form (Google survey tool) from April to May 2020. Initially, 3366 respondents voluntarily completed the survey form. Finally, 3331 surveys were included in the final analyses after removing incomplete surveys. The data ware reviewed, rechecked, and analyzed with SPSS (25.0 version) software. A total of 1979 (59.4%) males and 1352 (40.6%) females participated. Respondents were between the ages of 18 to 28Â years (mean age 21.4Â years [SDÂ =Â 1.9]). The prevalence estimate of suicidal ideation was 12.8%. Potential risk factors included less sleep, excess sleep, cigarette smoking, past suicidal thoughts, suicide attempt history, family history of suicidality, depression, anxiety, and stress.

155,Mental Health Measurement in a Post Covid-19 World: Psychometric Properties and Invariance of the DASS-21 in Athletes and Non-athletes,"Psychological science faces a call to action researching the implications of the corona virus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. Rapid reviews have reported that maintaining rigorous research standards is a priority for the field, such as ensuring reliable and valid measurement, when investigating people's experience of Covid-19 (O'Connor et al., 2020). However, no research to date has validated a measure mental health symptomology for an athlete population. The current research addresses this gap by examining the internal consistency, factor structure, invariance, and convergent validity of the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21; Lovibond and Lovibond, 1995) in two athlete samples. Participants completed the DASS-21 and sport-specific measures of mental health such as the Profile of Mood States - Depression subscale (POMS-D), Sport Anxiety Scale-2 (SAS-2), Athlete Burnout Questionnaire (ABQ), and Athlete Psychological Strain Questionnaire (APSQ). In sample one (<i>n</i> = 894), results of exploratory structural equation modeling indicated that a three-factor model provided good fit to the data, but a bifactor model provided better fit. Factor loadings indicated minimal misspecification and higher loadings on the general-factor. Invariance testing suggested equivalence across gender, athletic expertise, sport type, and injury status. Further, latent mean differences analyses indicated that females and injured athletes scored higher than male and non-injured athletes on all DASS-21 factors reporting higher mental health symptomology, those with more expertise scored higher on the general-factor and depression and those with less expertise scored higher on anxiety and stress, and no differences between team and individual athletes. In sample two (<i>n</i> = 589), the bifactor structure was replicated. Results largely supported the scales convergent validity with depression predicting POMS-D scores, whereas all three subscales predicted the SAS-2, ABQ, and APSQ scores. Internal consistency was acceptable in both samples. The current work provides initial support for use of the DASS-21 as an operationalisation of mental health symptomology in athletes. Theoretical and practical implications of these results are discussed.","Vaughan, Edwards, MacIntyre",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.590559,20201117.0,anxiety; athletes; depression; mental health; psychometrics; stress,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
156,From &quot;<i>It Has Stopped Our Lives</i>&quot; to &quot;<i>Spending More Time Together Has Strengthened Bonds&quot;</i>: The Varied Experiences of Australian Families During COVID-19,"The present study uses a qualitative approach to understand the impact of COVID-19 on family life. Australian parents of children aged 0-18 years were recruited via social media between April 8 and April 28, 2020, when Australians were experiencing social distancing/isolation measures for the first time. As part of a larger survey, participants were asked to respond via an open-ended question about how COVID-19 had impacted their family. A total of 2,130 parents were included and represented a diverse range of family backgrounds. Inductive template thematic analysis was used to understand patterns of meaning across the texts. Six themes were derived from the data, including &quot;Boredom, depression and suicide: A spectrum of emotion,&quot; &quot;Families are missing the things that keep them healthy,&quot; &quot;Changing family relationships: The push pull of intimacy,&quot; &quot;The unprecedented demands of parenthood,&quot; &quot;The unequal burden of COVID-19,&quot; and &quot;Holding on to positivity.&quot; Overall, the findings demonstrated a breadth of responses. Messages around loss and challenge were predominant, with many families reporting mental health difficulties and strained family relationships. However, not all families were negatively impacted by the restrictions, with some families reporting positive benefits and meaning, including opportunities for strengthening relationships, finding new hobbies, and developing positive characteristics such as appreciation, gratitude, and tolerance.","Evans, Mikocka-Walus, Klas, Olive, Sciberras, Karantzas, Westrupp",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.588667,20201117.0,Australia; COVID-19; family relationships; qualitative study; social restrictions,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
157,Adversity History Predicts Self-Reported Autonomic Reactivity and Mental Health in US Residents During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"<b>Background:</b> The spread of the COVID-19 virus presents an unprecedented event that rapidly introduced widespread life threat, economic destabilization, and social isolation. The human nervous system is tuned to detect safety and danger, integrating body and brain responses via the autonomic nervous system. Shifts in brain-body states toward danger responses can compromise mental health. For those who have experienced prior potentially traumatic events, the autonomic threat response system may be sensitive to new dangers and these threat responses may mediate the association between prior adversity and current mental health. <b>Method:</b> The present study collected survey data from adult U.S. residents (<i>n</i> = 1,666; 68% female; Age <i>M</i> = 46.24, <i>SD</i> = 15.14) recruited through websites, mailing lists, social media, and demographically-targeted sampling collected between March and May 2020. Participants reported on their adversity history, subjective experiences of autonomic reactivity, PTSD and depression symptoms, and intensity of worry related to the COVID-19 pandemic using a combination of standardized questionnaires and questions developed for the study. Formal mediation testing was conducted using path analysis and structural equation modeling. <b>Results:</b> Respondents with prior adversities reported higher levels of destabilized autonomic reactivity, PTSD and depression symptoms, and worry related to COVID-19. Autonomic reactivity mediated the relation between adversity and all mental health variables (standardized indirect effect range for unadjusted models: 0.212-0.340; covariate-adjusted model: 0.183-0.301). <b>Discussion:</b> The data highlight the important role of autonomic regulation as an intervening variable in mediating the impact of adversity on mental health. Because of the important role that autonomic function plays in the expression of mental health vulnerability, brain-body oriented therapies that promote threat response reduction should be investigated as possible therapeutic targets.","Kolacz, Dale, Nix, Roath, Lewis, Porges",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.577728,20201117.0,COVID-19; PTSD; autonomic nervous system; coronavirus; depression; polyvagal theory; trauma; worry,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
158,"Association Between Depression, Health Beliefs, and Face Mask Use During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is associated with increases in psychiatric morbidity, including depression. It is unclear if people with depressive symptoms understand or apply COVID-19 information differently to the general population. Therefore, this study aimed to examine associations between depression, health beliefs, and face mask use during the COVID-19 pandemic among the general population in Hong Kong. This study gathered data from 11,072 Hong Kong adults via an online survey. Respondents self-reported their demographic characteristics, depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), face mask use, and health beliefs about COVID-19. Hierarchical logistic regression was used to identify independent variables associated with depression. The point-prevalence of probable depression was 46.5% (<i>n</i> = 5,150). Respondents reporting higher mask reuse (<i>OR</i> = 1.24, 95%CI 1.17-1.34), wearing masks for self-protection (<i>OR</i> = 1.03 95%CI 1.01-1.06), perceived high susceptibility (<i>OR</i> = 1.15, 95%CI 1.09-1.23), and high severity (<i>OR</i> = 1.33, 95%CI 1.28-1.37) were more likely to report depression. Depression was less likely in those with higher scores for cues to action (<i>OR</i> = 0.82, 95%CI 0.80-0.84), knowledge of COVID-19 (<i>OR</i> = 0.95, 95%CI 0.91-0.99), and self-efficacy to wear mask properly (<i>OR</i> = 0.90 95%CI 0.83-0.98). We identified a high point-prevalence of probable major depression and suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 outbreak in Hong Kong, but this should be viewed with caution due to the convenience sampling method employed. Future studies should recruit a representative probability sample in order to draw more reliable conclusions. The findings highlight that COVID-19 health information may be a protective factor of probable depression and suicidal ideation during the pandemic. Accurate and up-to-date health information should be disseminated to distressed and vulnerable subpopulations, perhaps using digital health technology, and social media platforms to prompt professional help-seeking behavior.","Bressington, Cheung, Lam, Suen, Fong, Ho, Xiang",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.571179,20201117.0,COVID-19; Hong Kong; depression; face mask; health belief model,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
159,COVID-19 and Mental Health-What Do We Know So Far?,"The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic brought several worldwide health, social, and economic disturbances-particularly associated with the imposed confinement measures-that raised concerns about an emerging public mental health crisis. Studies investigating the early mental health impact of the pandemic on general population and vulnerable groups, such as healthcare workers, revealed a high prevalence of stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms, among others, and found several risk and protective factors. Along with these findings, the risk of substance use, suicide, domestic violence, and complicated grief may increase. We further discuss interventions that can be applied at a governmental, institutional, and individual level to minimize the mental health consequences of the pandemic, such as using telehealth to provide remote support or practicing self-care. These interventions should be maintained after the initial outbreak, as current disturbances may impact long-term well-being. We encourage the development of longitudinal studies to assess long-term adaptive responses.","Dos Santos, PicÃ³-PÃ©rez, Morgado",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.565698,20201117.0,COVID-19; anxiety; depression; health services; mental health,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
160,"Self-reported changes in anxiety, depression and suicidality during the COVID-19 lockdown in Greece","There are only a few published empirical data on COVID-19's effects on the mental health. During lockdown, an online questionnaire registered demographic, health data, previous psychiatric history, current anxiety, depression and suicidality, believing in conspiracy theories and other domains. Data from 3399 persons were used (81.08% females; aged 34.02Â Â±Â 9.72 and 18.27% males; aged 36.38Â±10.33). Distress and clinical depression were identified with the use of cut-off and a previously developed algorithm respectively. A post-stratification method was used; descriptive statistics were calculated. Chi-square tests, multiple forward stepwise linear regression analyses and Factorial Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) tested relations among variables. Clinical depression was present in 9.31% of the stratified sample, while 8.5% had severe distress; increased anxiety was present in more than 45%. Suicidal thoughts increased in 10.40% and decreased in 4.42%. Beliefs in conspiracy theories were widely prevalent; at least half of cases were following various misconceptions. A model for the development of depression was created with general health status, previous history of depression, self-harm and suicidal attempts, family responsibility, economic change, and age acting as risk factors, while keeping a daily routine, pursuing religiousness/spirituality, and believing in conspiracy theories acting as protective factors. The model developed here revealed multiple vulnerabilities and an interplay leading from simple anxiety to clinical depression and suicidality through distress. This could be of practical utility since most of these factors are modifiable. Future research, as well as interventions, should focus specifically on them.","Fountoulakis, Apostolidou, Atsiova, Filippidou, Florou, Gousiou, Katsara, Mantzari, Padouva-Markoulaki, Papatriantafyllou, Sacharidi, Tonia, Tsagalidou, Zymara, Prezerakos, Koupidis, Fountoulakis, Chrousos",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.10.061,20210113.0,"COVID-19; Depression; Lockdown; Mental health, conspiracy theories; Suicidality; Adult; Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Female; Greece; Health Status; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Protective Factors; SARS-CoV-2; Self Report; Self-Injurious Behavior; Suicidal Ideation; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30

163,Increasing Social Connectedness for Underserved Older Adults Living With Depression: A Pre-Post Evaluation of PEARLS,"To evaluate PEARLS effectiveness for increasing social connectedness among underserved older adults with depression. Multisite, pre-post single-group evaluation. Community-based social service organizations (Nâ€¯=â€¯16) in five U.S. states, purposively sampled for maximum variation of participants and providers. A total of 320 homebound older adults (mean(SD) age 72.9(9.6), 79% female, 44% people of color, 81% low-income, 61% living alone, average four chronic conditions) with clinically significant depression (PHQ-9 mean(SD) 12.7(4.6)). Four to 6 month home-based depression care management model delivered by trained front-line providers. Brief validated social connectedness scales: Duke Social Support Index 10-item (DSSI-10), PROMIS-Social Isolation (6-item), UCLA-Loneliness (3-item); sociodemographic and health measures. At baseline, PEARLS participants overall and with â‰¥1 of the following characteristics were less socially connected: younger (50-64), white, LGBTQ+, not partnered, not caregiving, living alone, financial limitations, chronic conditions, and/or recently hospitalized. Six-months post-PEARLS enrollment, participants significantly increased social interactions and satisfaction with social support (DSSI-10 t[312]â€¯=â€¯5.2, p &lt;0.001); and reduced perceived isolation (PROMIS t[310]â€¯=â€¯6.3, p &lt;0.001); and loneliness (UCLA t[301]â€¯=â€¯3.7, p =0.002), with small to moderate effect sizes (Cohen's d DSSI-10: 0.28, PROMIS-SI: 0.35, UCLA: 0.21). Increased social connectedness was associated with reduced depression. Improvements in social connectedness (except social interactions) persisted during early COVID-19. Being Latino and/or having difficulty paying for basic needs was associated with less improvement in post-PEARLS social connectedness. PEARLS has potential to improve social connectedness among underserved older adults, though additional supports may be needed for persons facing multiple social determinants of health. Further research is needed to establish causality.","Steinman, Parrish, Mayotte, Bravo Acevedo, Torres, Markova, Boddie, Lachenmayr, Montoya, Parker, Conton-Pelaez, Silsby, Snowden",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.10.005,20201117.0,Social isolation; community; depression care management; loneliness; underserved,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
164,Videoconferencing-Based Telemental Health: Important Questions for the COVID-19 Era From Clinical and Patient-Centered Perspectives,"The COVID-19 pandemic has intensified the search for digital approaches in mental health treatment, particularly due to patients and clinicians practicing social distancing. This has resulted in the dramatic growth of videoconferencing-based telemental health (V-TMH) services. It is critical for behavioral health providers and those in the mental health field to understand the implications of V-TMH expansion on the stakeholders who use such services, such as patients and clinicians, to provide the service that addresses both patient and clinical needs. Several key questions arise as a result, such as the following: (1) in what ways does V-TMH affect the practice of psychotherapy (ie, clinical needs), (2) to what extent are ethical and patient-centered concerns warranted in terms of V-TMH services (ie, patient needs), and (3) how do factors related to user experience affect treatment dynamics for both the patient and therapist (ie, patient and clinical needs)? We discuss how behavioral health providers can consider the future delivery of mental health care services based on these questions, which pose strong implications for technological innovation, the adaptation of treatments to new technologies, and training professionals in the delivery of V-TMH services and other digital health interventions.","Chiauzzi, Clayton, Huh-Yoo",https://doi.org/10.2196/24021,20201231.0,COVID-19; ethics; lived experience; mental health; patient-centered; privacy; psychotherapy; telehealth; telemental health; videoconferencing,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
165,Italians on the Age of COVID-19: The Self-Reported Depressive Symptoms Through Web-Based Survey,"The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected the Italian community. The widespread use of quarantine had the desired impact of controlling the epidemic, although it caused many psychological consequences. To date, compliance of the Italian public with voluntary home quarantine has been very high, but little is known about the impact of psychological health on sociodemographic categories during the quarantine. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of depressive symptoms in specific sociodemographic categories during the COVID-19 quarantine lockdown and the potential factors that contribute to, or mitigate, these effects. In the very early stage of the nationwide lockdown, 3,672 quarantined Italian adult residents (65% females, ranging from 18 to 85 years) participated in a web-based cross-sectional survey, including measures of depressive symptoms, which were measured by the Teate depression inventory, and state anxiety levels. The overall prevalence was 27.8% for moderate and 9.3% for severe levels of depressive symptoms. A generalized logistic model was used to identify the factors associated with mental health problems. Among these factors, sociodemographic variables (e.g., sex, age, employment status) and adherence to quarantine guidelines were analyzed. Females, younger people, students, singles, residents in northern Italy, people who were reluctant to adhere to quarantine guidelines, and people less worried about being infected with COVID-19 were at high risk of developing depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 epidemic, also after controlling for state anxiety. These findings showed that public levels of depressive symptoms did not increase the greater likelihood of being infected. Our study suggested that the monitoring of psychological outcomes for outbreaks could identify groups at higher risk of psychological morbidities due to the current pandemic in order to target future psychological interventions for implementation.","Balsamo, Carlucci",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.569276,20201113.0,anxiety; coronavirus disease 2019; depression; mental health; worry,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30

This may cause some emotional difficulties and mental health problems. The aim of the present study was to analyze the emotional status among the health care workers form the Hospital of Igualada (Barcelona), while they were facing with Covid-19 in one of the most affected regions in all of Europe. A total of 395 participants were included in the study. A cross-sectional assessment was carried out between the months of March and April. Information about anxiety, depression, and stress was gathered. We also collected demographic data and concerning potentially stressful factors. A significant proportion of professionals reported symptoms of anxiety (31.4%) and depression (12.2%) from moderate to severe intensity. Symptoms of acute stress were reported by 14.5% of participants. We performed a regression analysis, which explained the 30% of the variance associated with the degree of emotional distress (RÂ²â€¯=â€¯0.30). The final model reveals that females (or young males), who are working in the frontline as nursing assistants, caretakers or radiology technicians, with the uncertainty of a possible infection, the perception of inadequate protection measures and having experienced the death of a close person by Covid-19, showed a heightened risk of experiencing psychological distress.

Arabic-speaking adults, aged â‰¥18 years, and living in Saudi Arabia were recruited via a random phone list. This surveillance system used the proportional quota sampling technique to achieve an equal distribution of participants, stratified by age and gender, and region, within and across the 13 administrative regions of Saudi Arabia. A sample size of 4056 participants per wave was calculated to achieve enough power to detect changes in mental health status. The questionnaire includes the Arabic version of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to measure depressive symptoms and the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) to measure anxiety. In addition, it will collect data on sociodemographic variables and potential risk factors. Study recruitment began in May 2020. The data analysis was completed in October 2020, and the final report is expected to be published by the end of December 2020. Monitoring the population's mental health status during the COVID-19 pandemic will inform decision makers of any potential deterioration in mental health on a national level and among subgroups, including across regions, age groups, and gender groups. It will allow decision makers to recognize issues and intervene sooner. It will also provide valuable scientific data to help understand the effects of epidemics and pandemics on mental health. As far as we know, this is the only study that attempts to monitor the mental health status of the general population on a monthly basis.

173,Impact of Social Isolation Due to COVID-19 on Health in Older People: Mental and Physical Effects and Recommendations,"To review the impact of social isolation during COVID-19 pandemic on mental and physical health of older people and the recommendations for patients, caregivers and health professionals. Narrative review. Non-institutionalized community-living people. 20.069 individuals from ten descriptive cross-sectional papers. Articles since 2019 to 2020 published on Pubmed, Scielo and Google Scholar databases with the following MeSh terms ('COVID-19', 'coronavirus', 'aging', 'older people', 'elderly', 'social isolation' and 'quarantine') in English, Spanish or Portuguese were included. The studies not including people over 60 were excluded. Guidelines, recommendations, and update documents from different international organizations related to mental and physical activity were also analysed. 41 documents have been included in this narrative review, involving a total of 20.069 individuals (58% women), from Asia, Europe and America. 31 articles included recommendations and 10 addressed the impact of social distancing on mental or physical health. The main outcomes reported were anxiety, depression, poor sleep quality and physical inactivity during the isolation period. Cognitive strategies and increasing physical activity levels using apps, online videos, telehealth, are the main international recommendations. Mental and physical health in older people are negatively affected during the social distancing for COVID-19. Therefore, a multicomponent program with exercise and psychological strategies are highly recommended for this population during the confinement. Future investigations are necessary in this field.","SepÃºlveda-Loyola, RodrÃ­guez-SÃ¡nchez, PÃ©rez-RodrÃ­guez, Ganz, Torralba, Oliveira, RodrÃ­guez-MaÃ±as",https://doi.org/10.1007/s12603-020-1469-2,20201204.0,"COVID-19; Social isolation; aging; mental health; physical function; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Americas; Anxiety; Asia; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Europe; Exercise; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Quarantine; SARS-CoV-2; Sedentary Behavior; Sleep Wake Disorders; Social Isolation",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
174,Children's Mental Health in the Time of COVID-19: How Things Stand and the Aftermath,"Currently, the world is facing immediate and unexpected changes every day due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. These environmental stimulations have an impact on mental health, particularly in the case of children. Worldwide measures such as quarantine, social and physical distancing, and school closure can potentially take a toll on children's mental health, in both the short and long terms. Grief, adjustment disorder and acute stress disorder (ASD) are some of the mental health issues that children are prone to suffer during a pandemic, leading to mood disorder, psychosis and even suicidal tendency, if not addressed and treated timely. As the pandemic continues, it is crucial to monitor children's mental health status. Parents/caregivers must receive continuous guidance on handling the situation appropriately. Both professionals and families/caregivers must tend to children's mental health needs to safeguard their overall well-being.","Ramadhan, Putri, Melinda, Habibah, Fajriyah, Aini, Prananjaya, Ikhsan",https://doi.org/10.21315/mjms2020.27.5.15,20201107.0,children; coronavirus; mental health; pandemic effects,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
175,The effect of apnea management on novel coronavirus infection: A study on patients with obstructive sleep apnea,"To assess the frequency of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) and the effect of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) management on COVID-19 among patients with confirmed OSA. Cross-sectional telephone interview survey. Academic sleep labs. Iranian adults â‰¥ 18 years old with confirmed OSA. Among 275 participants with OSA, 20% (nÂ =Â 55) were suspected to have history of COVID-19 but had no positive test, and 18% (nÂ =Â 51) were in the definite COVID-19 group according to their reported symptoms or confirmed positive test. Having severe OSA (apnea hypopnea index â‰¥ 30) was associated with an increased risk of definite COVID-19, with an odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of 2.31 (0.87-5.55) compared to having mild OSA in definite COVID-19 group. Those not undergoing treatment for OSA had an OR (95% CI) of 2.43 (1.26-4.67) for definite COVID-19 compared to those accepting treatment in definite COVID-19 group. Total sleep times (TSTs) were 354, 340, and 320 minutes in healthy, suspected, and COVID-19 groups, respectively; TST was associated with COVID-19 (P-valueÂ =Â .04). Similarly, sleep efficiency (SE) scores were 75.7, 74.2, and 67.9% for the healthy, suspected, and COVID-19 groups, respectively (P-valueÂ =Â .005); Beck Depression scores were 13.8, 13.0, and 17.7, respectively (P-valueÂ =Â .056). OSA as a proinflammatory condition with multiple comorbidities may be a contributing factor to developing COVID-19. Greater OSA severity, no treatment for OSA, and lower TST and SE were associated with increased COVID-19 prevalence among patients with OSA.","Najafi, Sadeghniiat-Haghighi, Akbarpour, Samadi, Rahimi, Alemohammad",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleh.2020.09.003,20210305.0,"COVID-19; Management; Sleep apnea; Adult; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Iran; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive; Surveys and Questionnaires",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
176,Impact of the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic on Emergency Department Presentations in an Integrated Health System,"To quantify the impact of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic on emergency department volumes and patient presentations and evaluate changes in community mortality for the purpose of characterizing new patterns of emergency care use. This is an observational cross-sectional study using electronic health records for emergency department visits in an integrated multihospital system with academic and community practices across 4 states for visits between March 17 and April 21, 2019, and February 9 and April 21, 2020. We compared numbers and proportions of common and critical chief symptoms and diagnoses, triage assessments, throughput, disposition, and selected hospital lengths of stay and out-of-hospital deaths. In the period of interest, emergency department visits decreased by nearly 50% (35037 to 18646). Total numbers of patients with myocardial infarctions, stroke, appendicitis, and cholecystitis diagnosed decreased. The percentage of visits for mental health symptoms increased. There was an increase in deaths, driven by out-of-hospital mortality. Fewer patients presenting with acute and time-sensitive diagnoses suggests that patients are deferring care. This may be further supported by an increase in out-of-hospital mortality. Understanding which patients are deferring care and why will allow us to develop outreach strategies and ensure that those in need of rapid assessment and treatment will do so, preventing downstream morbidity and mortality.","Walker, Heaton, Monroe, Reichard, Kendall, Mullan, Goyal",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2020.09.019,20201130.0,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; COVID-19; Child; Child, Preschool; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Delivery of Health Care, Integrated; Emergency Service, Hospital; Facilities and Services Utilization; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Middle Aged; Mortality; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; United States; Young Adult",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30

The isolation, socio-economic disruption, uncertainty and fear of contagion have led to a spike of health anxiety in the general public. Individuals with health anxiety may get dismissed as the &quot;worried well&quot; in this pandemic due to disruption of mental health services and inability of healthcare systems to understand the psychosocial factors in the background.

178,"Infection, Screening, and Psychological Stress of Health-Care Workers With COVID-19 in a Nonfrontline Clinical Department","The aim of this study was to investigate risk factors and psychological stress of health-care workers (HCWs) with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a nonfrontline clinical department. Data of 2 source patients and all HCWs with infection risk were obtained in a department in Wuhan from January to February 2020. A questionnaire was designed to evaluate psychological stress of COVID-19 on HCWs. The overall infection rate was 4.8% in HCWs. Ten of 25 HCWs who contacted with 2 source patients were diagnosed with confirmed COVID-19 (8/10) and suspected COVID-19 (2/10). Other 2 HCWs were transmitted by other patients or colleagues. Close care behaviors included physical examination (6/12), life nursing (4/12), ward rounds (4/12), endoscopic examination (2/12). Contacts fluctuated from 1 to 24 times and each contact was short (8.1 min Â± 5.6 min). HCWs wore surgical masks (11/12), gloves (7/12), and isolation clothing (3/12) when providing medical care. Most HCWs experienced a mild course with 2 asymptomatic infections, taking 9.8 d and 20.9 d to obtain viral shedding and clinical cure, respectively. Psychological stress included worry (58.3%), anxiety (83.3%), depression (58.3%), and insomnia (58.3%). Close contact with COVID-19 patients and insufficient protection were key risk factors. Precaution measures and psychological support on COVID-19 is urgently required for HCWs.","Wang, Guan, Zhu, Wang, Fang, Wen, Xie, Tian, Li",https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2020.428,20210217.0,COVID-19; health-care worker; nonfrontline; psychological stress; risk factors,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
179,Anxiety of Nurses to support Wuhan in fighting against COVID-19 Epidemic and its Correlation With Work Stress and Self-efficacy,"We aimed to investigate the anxiety of nurses who are supporting Wuhan in fighting against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and explore relevant influencing factors. The COVID-19 outbreak poses a major threat to public health worldwide. Nurses play an important role in this epidemic. However, available data on the mental health among these nurses are limited. A descriptive, cross-sectional survey was performed. An online questionnaire was completed by 200 nurses who went to Wuhan to help to fight against COVID-19 from another province. Data collection tools include the Chinese version of the Stress Overload Scale (SOS), the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES). Descriptive, single-factor correlation and multiple regression analyses were used in exploring related influencing factors. Reporting followed the STROBE guidelines. The scores of SAS, SOS and GSES range from 20 to 80, 22 to 110 and 10 to 40, respectively, and the SAS (31.79Â Â±Â 7.32) and SOS (40.19Â Â±Â 12.92) and GSES scores (24.83Â Â±Â 6.60) were obtained. Anxiety was positively correlated with stress (rÂ =Â .679, pÂ &lt;Â .001) but negatively correlated with self-efficacy (rÂ =Â -.326, pÂ &lt;Â .001). Multiple regression analysis showed that professional qualification, sleep, stress and self-efficacy were the main factors affecting nurse anxiety (pÂ =Â .006, &lt;.001, &lt;.001, .039, respectively). Nurses who are supporting Wuhan in fighting against COVID-19 were under a low level of anxiety. The current study suggests work stress reduction might be a key factor in reducing anxiety and maintaining mental health to support nurses who are fighting against COVID-19 infection.","Mo, Deng, Zhang, Lang, Pang, Liao, Wang, Tao, Huang",https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15549,20210308.0,COVID-2019; Wuhan; anxiety; mental health; nurses; social support; work stress; Adult; Anxiety; COVID-19; China; Cross-Sectional Studies; Epidemics; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Nursing Staff; Occupational Stress; Self Efficacy; Surveys and Questionnaires,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
180,Revising our attitudes towards agonist medications and their diversion in a time of pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic led government regulators to relax prescribing rules for buprenorphine and methadone, the agonist medications that effectively treat opioid use disorder, allowing for take home supplies of up to 28Â days. These changes prioritized the availability of these medications over concerns about their misuse and diversion, and they provided a means for overdose prophylaxis during the highly uncertain conditions of the pandemic. In considering how to capitalize on this shift, research should determine the extent to which increased diversion has occurred as a result, and what the consequences may have been. The shifts also set the stage to consider if methadone can be safely prescribed in primary care settings, and if the monthly injectable formulation of buprenorphine is a suitable alternative to increased supplies of sublingual strips if concerns about diversion persist. The disruptions of the pandemic have caused a surge in overdose deaths, so carefully considering the prophylactic potential of agonist medications, in addition to their role as a treatment, may help us address this mortality crisis.","Del Pozo, Rich",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108139,20201116.0,"Analgesics, Opioid; Buprenorphine; COVID-19; Coronavirus Infections; Drug Overdose; Humans; Methadone; Opiate Substitution Treatment; Opioid-Related Disorders; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Prescription Drug Diversion",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
181,Extraversion Moderates the Relationship Between the Stringency of COVID-19 Protective Measures and Depressive Symptoms,"From the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, psychologists are theorizing that, as compared to introverts, extraverts experience more profound negative social consequences from protective measures (e.g., travel restrictions and bans on public gatherings). As the empirical evidence for this claim is lacking, this study tested the hypothesis that extraversion moderates the relationship between the stringency of COVID-19 protective measures and depressive symptoms. Our results were based on survey data from 93,125 respondents collected in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 20-April 6, 2020) across 47 countries and publicly available data on measure stringency. Findings demonstrate that extraversion moderates the relationship between measure stringency in the early days of the pandemic and depressive symptoms. For introverts, measure stringency has a negative effect on depressive symptoms, while for extraverts, it has a positive, but non-significant effect on depressive symptoms. This study suggests that, although stringent measures generally help people to worry less and feel safer, the lifestyle associated with such measures feels more natural to introverts than to extraverts.","Wijngaards, Sisouw de Zilwa, Burger",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.568907,20201103.0,COVID-19; COVID-19 protective measures; depressive symptoms; extraversion; mental healthâ€”related quality of life,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
182,Mental Health Through the COVID-19 Quarantine: A Growth Curve Analysis on Italian Young Adults,"Health emergencies, such as epidemics, have detrimental and long-lasting consequences on people's mental health, which are higher during the implementation of strict lockdown measures. Despite several recent psychological researches on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic highlighting that young adults represent a high risk category, no studies specifically focused on young adults' mental health status have been carried out yet. This study aimed to assess and monitor Italian young adults' mental health status during the first 4 weeks of lockdown through the use of a longitudinal panel design. Participants (<i>n</i> = 97) provided self-reports in four time intervals (1-week intervals) in 1 month. The Syndromic Scales of Adult Self-Report 18-59 were used to assess the internalizing problems (anxiety/depression, withdrawn, and somatic complaints), externalizing problems (aggressive, rule-breaking, and intrusive behavior), and personal strengths. To determine the time-varying effects of prolonged quarantine, a growth curve modeling will be performed. The results showed an increase in anxiety/depression, withdrawal, somatic complaints, aggressive behavior, rule-breaking behavior, and internalizing and externalizing problems and a decrease in intrusive behavior and personal strengths from T1 to T4. The results contributed to the ongoing debate concerning the psychological impact of the COVID-19 emergency, helping to plan and develop efficient intervention projects able to take care of young adults' mental health in the long term.","Parola, Rossi, Tessitore, Troisi, Mannarini",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.567484,20201103.0,Achenbach adult self-report; coronavirus disease 2019; growth model; internalizing/externalizing problems; mental health; quarantine; young adult,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
183,"Associations of Social Isolation with Anxiety and Depression During the Early COVID-19 Pandemic: A Survey of Older Adults in London, UK","The COVID-19 pandemic is imposing a profound negative impact on the health and wellbeing of societies and individuals, worldwide. One concern is the effect of social isolation as a result of social distancing on the mental health of vulnerable populations, including older people. Within six weeks of lockdown, we initiated the CHARIOT COVID-19 Rapid Response Study, a bespoke survey of cognitively healthy older people living in London, to investigate the impact of COVID-19 and associated social isolation on mental and physical wellbeing. The sample was drawn from CHARIOT, a register of people over 50 who have consented to be contacted for aging related research. A total of 7,127 men and women (mean age=70.7 [SD=7.4]) participated in the baseline survey, May-July 2020. Participants were asked about changes to the 14 components of the Hospital Anxiety Depression scale (HADS) after lockdown was introduced in the UK, on 23<sup>rd</sup> March. A total of 12.8% of participants reported feeling worse on the depression components of HADS (7.8% men and 17.3% women) and 12.3% reported feeling worse on the anxiety components (7.8% men and 16.5% women). Fewer participants reported feeling improved (1.5% for depression and 4.9% for anxiety). Women, younger participants, those single/widowed/divorced, reporting poor sleep, feelings of loneliness and who reported living alone were more likely to indicate feeling worse on both the depression and/or anxiety components of the HADS. There was a significant negative association between subjective loneliness and worsened components of both depression (OR 17.24, 95% CI 13.20, 22.50) and anxiety (OR 10.85, 95% CI 8.39, 14.03). Results may inform targeted interventions and help guide policy recommendations in reducing the effects of social isolation related to the pandemic, and beyond, on the mental health of older people.","Robb, de Jager, Ahmadi-Abhari, Giannakopoulou, Udeh-Momoh, McKeand, Price, Car, Majeed, Ward, Middleton",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.591120,20201103.0,COVID-19; anxiety; depression; loneliness; mental health; older adults; social isolation,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
184,The Effect of COVID-19 on Mental Health and Wellbeing in a Representative Sample of Australian Adults,"There is minimal knowledge about the impact of large-scale epidemics on community mental health, particularly during the acute phase. This gap in knowledge means we are critically ill-equipped to support communities as they face the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to provide data urgently needed to inform government policy and resource allocation now and in other future crises. The study was the first to survey a representative sample from the Australian population at the early acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Depression, anxiety, and psychological wellbeing were measured with well-validated scales (PHQ-9, GAD-7, WHO-5). Using linear regression, we tested for associations between mental health and exposure to COVID-19, impacts of COVID-19 on work and social functioning, and socio-demographic factors. Depression and anxiety symptoms were substantively elevated relative to usual population data, including for individuals with no existing mental health diagnosis. Exposure to COVID-19 had minimal association with mental health outcomes. Recent exposure to the Australian bushfires was also unrelated to depression and anxiety, although bushfire smoke exposure correlated with reduced psychological wellbeing. In contrast, pandemic-induced impairments in work and social functioning were strongly associated with elevated depression and anxiety symptoms, as well as decreased psychological wellbeing. Financial distress due to the pandemic, rather than job loss <i>per se</i>, was also a key correlate of poorer mental health. These findings suggest that minimizing disruption to work and social functioning, and increasing access to mental health services in the community, are important policy goals to minimize pandemic-related impacts on mental health and wellbeing. Innovative and creative strategies are needed to meet these community needs while continuing to enact vital public health strategies to control the spread of COVID-19.","Dawel, Shou, Smithson, Cherbuin, Banfield, Calear, Farrer, Gray, Gulliver, Housen, McCallum, Morse, Murray, Newman, Rodney Harris, Batterham",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.579985,20210208.0,COVID-19; anxiety; bushfire; coronavirus; depression; financial strain; mental health,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
185,Mental Health Outcomes in Perinatal Women During the Remission Phase of COVID-19 in China,"Since the middle of March, the COVID-19 outbreak has been well contained in China. The prevention and control measures for the outbreak have been downgraded to a normalized level. However, until now, the change in level of psychological health amongst perinatal women during the remission phase of the COVID-19 outbreak has not been investigated in China. The aim of this current study was to assess the symptoms of anxiety, depression, insomnia and quality of life (QOL) in perinatal women and to identify potential risk factors associated with these symptoms. This was a cross-sectional, hospital-based survey conducted between March 25<sup>th</sup> till June 5<sup>th</sup>, 2020 in southern China. Convenient sampling method was adopted. Women's anxiety, depression, insomnia symptoms and QOL was examined through standardized measurements. Multivariate logistic regression and Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted for the same. A total of 625 perinatal women completed the study; of them, 195 women (31.2%, 95%CI=27.56%-34.84%) reported anxiety, 120 (19.2%, 95%CI=16.10%-22.30%) reported depression, and 87 (13.9%, 95%CI=11.20%-16.64%) experienced symptoms of insomnia. Previous adverse experiences during pregnancy was a significant risk factor for anxiety (OR=1.628, 95%CI=1.069-2.480, P=0.023), depression (OR=1.853, 95%CI=1.153-2.977, P=0.011), and insomnia (OR=2.160, 95%CI=1.290-3.616, P=0.003). Participants having infected friends/families/colleagues were more likely to report anxiety (OR=2.195, 95%CI=1.245-3.871, P=0.007) and depression (OR=2.666, 95%CI=1.482-4.794, P=0.001). Those women whose regular check-ups were severely interrupted by the COVID-19 were also more likely to experience symptoms of anxiety (OR=2.935, 95%CI=1.701-5.062, P&lt;0.001) and insomnia (OR=2.195, 95%CI=1.098-4.390, P=0.026). The COVID-19 pandemic does affect the mental health and well being of perinatal women. Increased attention should be paid to women who have infected friends/families/colleagues and those with previous adverse experiences during pregnancy. Coping strategies that relieve psychological stress during the COVID-19 outbreak should be provided to prevent adverse outcomes for women and their infants.","Zeng, Li, Sun, Luo, Garg, Liu, Zhang, Zhang",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.571876,20201103.0,COVID-19; China; mental health; perinatal; women,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
186,"Depression and Coping Among COVID-19-Infected Individuals After 10 Days of Mandatory in-Hospital Quarantine, Irbid, Jordan","In-hospital mandatory quarantine of asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19-infected individuals was part of the national control strategy used to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak in Jordan. This study aims to evaluate depression, associated stressors, and various coping methods used among adult quarantined COVID-19-infected individuals. This cross-sectional study included all COVID-19-infected individuals who were obligatorily quarantined at King Abdullah University Hospital, Irbid, Jordan from March 15 to April 20, 2020. Symptoms of depression were assessed using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire after 10 days of quarantine. In addition, several questions regarding the patients' sights with the health-care system, and coping methods were added. Demographic characteristics, clinical presentation, and comorbidities were collected from the medical records. Out of 91 quarantined COVID-19 patients, a total of 66 completed the survey, with a participation rate of 72.5%. The majority were relatively young; the mean Â± SD age was 35.8 Â± 16.2 years (range 18-79), 59.1% were females and 47% were asymptomatic. A considerable proportion of patients (44%) reported symptoms of depression, with 21% were at high risk of major depressive disorder. Depression symptoms were significantly more common among females than males [PHQ-9 score â‰¥10: 13 (92.9%) vs 1 (7.1%), respectively; <i>p</i>=0.004]. The majority of patients (71.2%) reported having problems with health-care services. Insufficient involvement in making treatment decisions was the most commonly reported concern (59.1%). Patients who reported problems in maintaining privacy, reaching out to their physicians, or receiving conflicting information from the medical staff, had more symptoms of depression compared with the satisfied ones (<i>p</i>&lt;0.05). On the other hand, those who were receiving sufficient support from the family, friends, or medical staff during quarantine, were less likely to have depression symptoms (<i>p</i>&lt;0.05). Furthermore, symptoms of depression were less in patients who stayed in touch with others using phone calls, texting, or social media (<i>p</i>=0.024). Symptoms of depression were common among both symptomatic and asymptomatic quarantined COVID-19 patients. The support of family, friends, and medical staff was an essential alleviating factor. Facilitating adequate communication may promote the mental well-being of COVID-19-infected patients and help in reducing the risk of depression during the in-hospital quarantine.","Samrah, Al-Mistarehi, Aleshawi, Khasawneh, Momany, Momany, Abu Za'nouneh, Keelani, Alshorman, Khassawneh",https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S267459,20201030.0,COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; coronavirus; depression; psychological disorder; quarantine,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
187,Behavior of Callers to a Crisis Helpline Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Quantitative Data Analysis,"The World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 to be an international pandemic in March 2020. While numbers of new confirmed cases of the disease and death tolls are rising at an alarming rate on a daily basis, there is concern that the pandemic and the measures taken to counteract it could cause an increase in distress among the public. Hence, there could be an increase in need for emotional support within the population, which is complicated further by the reduction of existing face-to-face mental health services as a result of measures taken to limit the spread of the virus. The objective of this study was to determine whether the COVID-19 pandemic has had any influence on the calls made to Samaritans Ireland, a national crisis helpline within the Republic of Ireland. This study presents an analysis of calls made to Samaritans Ireland in a four-week period before the first confirmed case of COVID-19 (calls=41,648, callers=3752) and calls made to the service within a four-week period after a restrictive lockdown was imposed by the government of the Republic of Ireland (calls=46,043, callers=3147). Statistical analysis was conducted to explore any differences between the duration of calls in the two periods at a global level and at an hourly level. We performed k-means clustering to determine the types of callers who used the helpline based on their helpline call usage behavior and to assess the impact of the pandemic on the caller type usage patterns. The analysis revealed that calls were of a longer duration in the postlockdown period in comparison with the pre-COVID-19 period. There were changes in the behavior of individuals in the cluster types defined by caller behavior, where some caller types tended to make longer calls to the service in the postlockdown period. There were also changes in caller behavior patterns with regard to the time of day of the call; variations were observed in the duration of calls at particular times of day, where average call durations increased in the early hours of the morning. The results of this study highlight the impact of COVID-19 on a national crisis helpline service. Statistical differences were observed in caller behavior between the prelockdown and active lockdown periods. The findings suggest that service users relied on crisis helpline services more during the lockdown period due to an increased sense of isolation, worsening of underlying mental illness due to the pandemic, and reduction or overall removal of access to other support resources. Practical implications and limitations are discussed.","Turkington, Mulvenna, Bond, Ennis, Potts, Moore, Hamra, Morrissey, Isaksen, Scowcroft, O'Neill",https://doi.org/10.2196/22984,20201114.0,COVID-19; caller behavior; clustering; coronavirus; crisis helplines; machine learning; mental health; pandemic,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
188,From adversity to resilience in the COVID-19 era: strengthening mental health systems in the Eastern Mediterranean Region,"The global COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the impact of a major public health emergency on mental health, and the ways that individuals, communities, professionals and systems can react positively to such a crisis. The Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) has substantial experience in mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) in crises, and COVID-19 has driven further innovation to support mental health and well-being. Global and regional guidance has been developed quickly, applying lessons learnt from previous disease outbreaks to respond to the pandemic at a systems level, for different population groups, and for countries of different income levels. Preliminary results from a global rapid assessment survey to assess the impact of COVID-19 on MHPSS services, indicate that 20 of the 22 EMR Member States have MHPSS as integral components of national COVID-19 response plans; one-third have allocated additional funding. However, MHPSS services have been severely impacted by the pandemic, including psychotherapy, psychosocial interventions, community services, and services for children/adolescents. Innovative solutions such as crisis hotlines, tele-consultations, digital self-help platforms, novel approaches to ensure supply of psychotropic medicines, and task sharing/shifting for basic psychosocial support, are being used in many countries to overcome service disruptions and maintain care for those with mental conditions.","Eaton, Rahman, Gater, Saxena, Hammerich, Saeed",https://doi.org/10.26719/2020.26.10.1148,20201116.0,"Africa, Northern; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; Coronavirus Infections; Disasters; Global Health; Health Behavior; Health Promotion; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Mental Health; Mental Health Services; Middle East; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Resilience, Psychological; SARS-CoV-2; Social Determinants of Health; Socioeconomic Factors",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
189,,"Examine the association between news media use frequency during the COVID-19 pandemic and the scale of psychological distress in pregnant women, considering this distress known harmful effects on the fetus development. Pregnant women living in Quebec province (N = 1014) have been recruited in April 2020 through social media, while a state of health emergency was declared. Participants were divided in 4 groups, according to self-reported frequency of news media consulting (little or none; one time a day; several times a day; constant). They filled measures of depressive symptoms, negative affects, post-traumatic stress symptoms and anxiety specific to COVID-19. Instrument scores were grouped under a unique factor of psychological distress. An ANCOVA controlling for age, gestational age, education level, household annual revenue and a diagnosed mental disorder present at the time of participation in study shows that news media exposure frequency is significantly associated with psychological distress severity in pregnant women, during COVID-19 pandemic, F(3,998) = 27.02, p &lt; 0.001, Î·2 partial = 0.08. Given the mean comparisons <i>a posteriori</i>, higher psychological distress rates are found as soon as news media exposure exceeds once a day (effect sizes between 0.38 and 0.81). The more pregnant women report consulting the news media during the COVID-19 pandemic, the more likely they are to exhibit psychological distress.

This study aimed to identify individual and structural factors associated with mental health disorders (MHD) in the NGO's healthcare workers (HCW) in the early stage of the outbreak. Data were collected between April 6 and 11, 2020 for 135 HCW in ARCAD SantÃ© PLUS's 18 community-based HIV care centers. Outcomes corresponded to the PHQ-9, GAD-7 and ISI instruments for depression, anxiety and insomnia, respectively. A general mixture model with a negative binomial distribution was implemented. Most HCW were men (60.7%) and median age was 40 years IQR[33-46]. Symptoms of depression, anxiety and insomnia were declared by 71.9, 73.3, and 77% participants, respectively. Women were at greater risk of MHD. A lack of personal protection equipment and human resources, especially nurses, was associated with a high risk of MHD. Health policy must place non-front line HCW, including those in NGOs, at the core of the healthcare system response to the COVID-19 outbreak, as they ensure continuity of care for many diseases including HIV. The efficacy of public health strategies depends on the capacity of HCW to fully with and competently perform their duties.","Sagaon-Teyssier, Kamissoko, Yattassaye, Diallo, Rojas Castro, Delabre, Pouradier, Maradan, Bourrelly, CissÃ©, Vidal, KeÃ¯ta, Spire",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hpopen.2020.100017,20201224.0,COVID-19; HIV; Healthcare workers; Mali; Mental health,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30

To investigate the trajectory of mental health and well-being during the first 6 weeks of lockdown in adults in the UK. A quota survey design and a sampling frame that permitted recruitment of a national sample was employed. Findings for waves 1 (31 March to 9 April 2020), 2 (10 April to 27 April 2020) and 3 (28 April to 11 May 2020) are reported here. A range of mental health factors was assessed: pre-existing mental health problems, suicide attempts and self-harm, suicidal ideation, depression, anxiety, defeat, entrapment, mental well-being and loneliness. A total of 3077 adults in the UK completed the survey at wave 1. Suicidal ideation increased over time. Symptoms of anxiety, and levels of defeat and entrapment decreased across waves whereas levels of depressive symptoms did not change significantly. Positive well-being also increased. Levels of loneliness did not change significantly over waves. Subgroup analyses showed that women, young people (18-29 years), those from more socially disadvantaged backgrounds and those with pre-existing mental health problems have worse mental health outcomes during the pandemic across most factors. The mental health and well-being of the UK adult population appears to have been affected in the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.

193,Mental health presentations to Christchurch Hospital Emergency Department during COVID-19 lockdown,"To describe mental health presentations to a tertiary ED in New Zealand during a national COVID-19 lockdown. A retrospective, comparative cohort study in Christchurch Hospital, New Zealand. There was a 3510 (37%)-patient decrease in all presentations to Christchurch Hospital ED during the 5-week COVID-19 lockdown period from 26 March 2020 to 28 April 2020, compared to a 111 (1.2%)-patient decrease in the same time period in the previous year (P &lt;â€‰0.00001). There is usually a seasonal reduction in mental health attendances at this time of year compared to the weeks before. In 2019, there was a 49 (9.8%)-patient reduction in mental health presentations, whereas in 2020 there was a 193 (34%)-patient reduction (P &lt;â€‰0.001). In 2020, the proportion of mental health attendances compared to all ED attendances during the 5-week lockdown period was similar to the 5-week pre-lockdown period (564/9460 vs 371/5950, P =â€‰0.48).

194,Higher binding affinity of furin for SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein D614G mutant could be associated with higher SARS-CoV-2 infectivity,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused an exponential rise in death rates and hospitalizations. The aim of this study was to characterize the D614G substitution in the severe acute respiratory syndome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike glycoprotein (S protein), which may affect viral infectivity. The effect of D614G substitution on the structure and thermodynamic stability of the S protein was analyzed with use of DynaMut and SCooP. HDOCK and PRODIGY were used to model furin protease binding to the S protein RRAR cleavage site and calculate binding affinities. Molecular dynamics simulations were used to predict the S protein apo structure, the S protein-furin complex structure, and the free binding energy of the complex. The D614G substitution in the G clade of SARS-CoV-2 strains introduced structural mobility and decreased the thermal stability of the S protein (Î”Î”Gâ€‰=â€‰-0.086â€‰kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>). The substitution resulted in stronger binding affinity (K<sub>d</sub>â€‰=â€‰1.6â€‰Ã—â€‰10<sup>-8</sup>) for furin, which may enhance S protein cleavage. The results were corroborated by molecular dynamics simulations demonstrating higher binding energy of furin and the S protein D614G mutant (-61.9â€‰kcalâ€‰mol<sup>-1</sup> compared with -56.78â€‰kcalâ€‰mol<sup>-1</sup> for wild-type S protein). The D614G substitution in the G clade induced flexibility of the S protein, resulting in increased furin binding, which may enhance S protein cleavage and infiltration of host cells. Therefore, the SARS-CoV-2 D614G substitution may result in a more virulent strain.","Mohammad, Alshawaf, Marafie, Abu-Farha, Abubaker, Al-Mulla",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.10.033,20210216.0,"COVID-19; Furin; G clade; Interatomic binding; Molecular dynamics simulations; S protein; SARS-CoV-2; Thermodynamic stability; COVID-19; Furin; Humans; Mutant Proteins; Protein Binding; SARS-CoV-2; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus; Thermodynamics",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30

With public health, social service, and community partners connected through an ongoing academic-community collaborative, we developed and fielded a weekly repeated cross-sectional electronic survey assessing usage of and unmet need for health and social service resources. Using 10 weeks of surveys (April 3-June 11, 2020) by Allegheny County residents, we examined variation in responses by week and by sociodemographic characteristics using chi-square tests. We shared written reports weekly and discussed emerging trends with community partners. Participants ranged from 229 to 1001 per week. Unmet need for at least 1 health or health-related social need resource varied by week, ranging from 55% (95% confidence interval [CI] 50%-59%) of participants in week 2 to 43% (95% CI 37%-49%) of participants in week 9 (P = .006). Increased use of at least 1 resource ranged from 53% (95% CI 47%-58%) of participants in week 3 to 36% (95% CI 31%-42%) in week 9 (P &lt; .001). Unmet need for food and financial assistance peaked early during the stay-at-home order, while unmet need for mental health care rose later. Unmet need for food assistance varied significantly by race and ethnicity and by household prepandemic income. Over half of families with children reported unmet health or social service needs during the first month of a county-wide COVID-19 stay-at-home order.

198,Social support and acute stress symptoms (ASSs) during the COVID-19 outbreak: deciphering the roles of psychological needs and sense of control,"<b>Background:</b> A cute stress symptoms (ASSs) are likely to be a common mental health problem in the acute period following the 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) outbreak. To address this risk, substantial social support has been provided to relieve ASSs during the COVID-19 outbreak. However, the effectiveness of these support methods for relieving ASSs has not yet been assessed. <b>Objective:</b> The current study sought to examine the underlying mechanisms by which social support relieves ASSs, among primary and secondary school teachers. <b>Method:</b>Â A sample of 751 primary and secondary school teachers was selected to answer self-reported questionnaires regarding ASSs, social support, psychological needs, and the sense of control. <b>Results:</b> Structural equation modelling revealed that social support had a non-significant direct relationship with ASSs, and a significant indirect relationship with reduced ASSs via the needs for autonomy and relatedness, and via the paths from three types of psychological needs to the sense of control. <b>Conclusion:</b> These findings suggest that social support can play a relieving role in ASSs when the support satisfies individuals' psychological needs and improves their sense of control. To alleviate ASSs among primary and secondary school teachers, more attention should be paid to satisfying their specific psychological needs and improving their sense of control. <b>Antecedentes:</b> Es probable que los sÃ­ntomas de estrÃ©s agudo (SEAs) sean un problema de salud mental frecuente en el periodo agudo que sigue al nuevo brote de neumonÃ­a por coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). Para enfrentar este riesgo, se ha brindado un considerable soporte social para aliviar los SEAs durante el brote del COVID-19. Sin embargo, aÃºn no se han evaluado la efectividad de estos mÃ©todos de soporte para aliviar los SEAs.<b>Objetivo:</b> Para cubrir esta brecha, este estudio buscÃ³ evaluar los mecanismos subyacentes mediante los cuales el soporte social alivia los SEAs en profesores de escuelas primarias y secundarias.<b>MÃ©todo:</b> Se tomÃ³ una muestra de 751 profesores de escuelas primarias y secundarias para que respondieran cuestionarios de auto-reporte relacionadas con SEAs, soporte social, necesidades psicolÃ³gicas y la sensaciÃ³n de control.<b>Resultados:</b> El modelo de ecuaciones estructurales revelÃ³ que el soporte social tenÃ­a una relaciÃ³n directa, no significativa, con los SEAs; y que tenÃ­a una relaciÃ³n significativa indirecta con una reducciÃ³n de los SEAs a travÃ©s de las necesidades de autonomÃ­a y relaciÃ³n, y a travÃ©s de las vÃ­as de tres tipos de necesidades psicolÃ³gicas de la sensaciÃ³n de control.<b>Conclusiones:</b> Estos hallazgos sugieren que el soporte social puede desempeÃ±ar un papel de alivio sobre los SEAs cuando el soporte satisface las necesidades psicolÃ³gicas de los individuos y mejora su sensaciÃ³n de control. Para aliviar los SEAs entre los profesores de escuelas primarias y secundarias, se debe prestar mÃ¡s atenciÃ³n en satisfacer sus necesidades especÃ­ficas y mejorar su sensaciÃ³n de control. <b>èƒŒæ™¯ï¼š</b>åœ¨2019å¹´æ–°åž‹å† çŠ¶ç—…æ¯’æ€§è‚ºç‚Ž (COVID-19) çˆ†å‘åŽçš„æ€¥æ€§æœŸ, æ€¥æ€§åº”æ¿€ç—‡çŠ¶ (ASSs) å¯èƒ½æ˜¯å¸¸è§çš„å¿ƒç†å¥åº·é—®é¢˜ã€‚ä¸ºè§£å†³æ­¤é£Žé™©, åœ¨COVID-19çˆ†å‘æœŸé—´, å·²æä¾›äº†å¤§é‡çš„ç¤¾ä¼šæ”¯æŒä»¥ç¼“è§£ASSã€‚ä½†æ˜¯, å°šæœªè¯„ä¼°è¿™äº›æ”¯æŒæ–¹æ³•ç¼“è§£ASSçš„æœ‰æ•ˆæ€§ã€‚<b>ç›®çš„ï¼š</b>å½“å‰çš„ç ”ç©¶è¯•å›¾è€ƒæŸ¥ä¸­å°å­¦æ•™å¸ˆä¸­ç¤¾ä¼šæ”¯æŒå‡è½»ASSçš„æ½œåœ¨æœºåˆ¶ã€‚<b>æ–¹æ³•ï¼š</b>é€‰æ‹©751åä¸­å°å­¦æ•™å¸ˆä½œä¸ºæ ·æœ¬, ä»¥å›žç­”ASS, ç¤¾ä¼šæ”¯æŒ, å¿ƒç†éœ€æ±‚å’ŒæŽ§åˆ¶æ„Ÿç›¸å…³çš„è‡ªæˆ‘æŠ¥å‘Šé—®å·ã€‚<b>ç»“æžœï¼š</b>ç»“æž„æ–¹ç¨‹æ¨¡åž‹æ˜¾ç¤º, ç¤¾ä¼šæ”¯æŒä¸ŽASSä¹‹é—´æœ‰ä¸æ˜¾è‘—çš„ç›´æŽ¥å…³ç³», ä¸Žå‡è½»çš„ASSä¹‹é—´å­˜åœ¨é€šè¿‡å¯¹è‡ªä¸»æ€§ä¸Žå…³ç³»çš„éœ€æ±‚åŠä»Žä¸‰ç±»å¿ƒç†éœ€æ±‚åˆ°æŽ§åˆ¶æ„Ÿçš„è·¯å¾„çš„æ˜¾è‘—çš„é—´æŽ¥å…³ç³»ã€‚<b>ç»“è®ºï¼š</b>è¿™äº›å‘çŽ°è¡¨æ˜Ž, å½“ç¤¾ä¼šæ”¯æŒå¯ä»¥æ»¡è¶³ä¸ªäººçš„å¿ƒç†éœ€æ±‚å¹¶æé«˜å…¶æŽ§åˆ¶æ„Ÿæ—¶, å®ƒä»¬å¯ä»¥åœ¨ASSä¸­èµ·åˆ°ç¼“è§£ä½œç”¨ã€‚ä¸ºäº†å‡è½»ä¸­å°å­¦æ•™å¸ˆçš„ASS, åº”æ›´åŠ æ³¨æ„æ»¡è¶³å…¶ç‰¹å®šå¿ƒç†éœ€æ±‚å¹¶æé«˜ä»–ä»¬çš„æŽ§åˆ¶æ„Ÿã€‚<b>å…³é”®è¯</b>ï¼šæ€¥æ€§åº”æ¿€ç—‡çŠ¶; ç¤¾ä¼šæ”¯æŒ; å¿ƒç†éœ€æ±‚; æŽ§åˆ¶æ„Ÿ.","Zhou, Yao",https://doi.org/10.1080/20008198.2020.1779494,20201022.0,Social support can play a relieving role in ASSs when the support satisfies individualsâ€™ psychological needs and improves their sense of control during COVID-19 outbreak.; acute stress symptoms; psychological needs; sense of control; social support,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
199,Psychosocial Safety Climate of Employees During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Iran: A Policy Analysis,"Iran is among the top 15 countries in the world in terms of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infection rates. The numbers of infections and deaths are still increasing in September 2020. This study aims to investigate the impact of the policies on terminating the quarantine period on the perception of psychosocial safety by employees and workers in Iran. In this study, policy announcements and regulations, media reports, and the results were collected from 2 previously published population surveys that collected employees' views of the government approach to quarantine. The information thus collected was then analyzed using the &quot;What is the Problem Represented (WPR)&quot; approach for data analysis introduced by Carol Bacchi, and focuses on the question, &quot;What effects are produced by the representation of the problem?&quot; The Iranian Government decided to quarantine people and close most sectors during the New Year holidays in Iran in March 2020. The duration of quarantine was only 2 weeks, and the government then ordered government organizations and industrial companies to reopen. The advantage of a short quarantine period is assumed to be the reinstatement of productivity while the disadvantage is the likely risk of further transmission of the virus. The government approach to and communication about the quarantine period has neglected to consider the psychosocial safety climate of employees, who have to go to their workplaces using buses, subways, or other vehicles, and who are under pressure mentally because of fear of infection, dismissal for non-attendance, and the consequent economic problems. The government approach necessarily impacts on the perceived psychosocial safety climate of employees, and hence influences the causes of work stress. If the psychosocial safety climate is not considered and improved, it may reduce the quality of services and products, and increase accidents.","Seddighi, Dollard, Salmani",https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2020.370,20201125.0,COVID-19; Iran; human resources management; mental health; occupational health; policy analysis; psychosocial safety climate,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
200,The Impact of COVID-19 Stay-At-Home Orders on Health Behaviors in Adults,"Stay-at-home orders in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have forced abrupt changes to daily routines. This study assessed lifestyle changes across different BMI classifications in response to the global pandemic. The online survey targeting adults was distributed in April 2020 and collected information on dietary behaviors, physical activity, and mental health. All questions were presented as &quot;before&quot; and &quot;since&quot; the COVID-19 pandemic. In total, 7,753 participants were included; 32.2% of the sample were individuals with normal weight, 32.1% had overweight, and 34.0% had obesity. During the pandemic, overall scores for healthy eating increased (Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.001), owing to less eating out and increased cooking (Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.001). Sedentary leisure behaviors increased, while time spent in physical activity (absolute time and intensity adjusted) declined (Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.001). Anxiety scores increased 8.78â€‰Â±â€‰0.21 during the pandemic, and the magnitude of increase was significantly greater in people with obesity (Pâ€‰â‰¤â€‰0.01). Weight gain was reported in 27.5% of the total sample compared with 33.4% in participants with obesity. The COVID-19 pandemic has produced significant health effects, well beyond the virus itself. Government mandates together with fear of contracting the virus have significantly impacted lifestyle behaviors alongside declines in mental health. These deleterious impacts have disproportionally affected individuals with obesity.","Flanagan, Beyl, Fearnbach, Altazan, Martin, Redman",https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.23066,20210204.0,Adult; COVID-19; Exercise; Female; Health Behavior; Humans; Life Style; Male; Mental Health; Obesity; Overweight; Quarantine; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
201,COVID-19 pandemic and mental distress in multiple sclerosis: implications for clinical management,"In multiple sclerosis (MS), disease-related factors and dysfunctional coping might favor the development of mental distress induced by COVID-19 containment measures. Aim of this study was exploring the relationship between disability, coping strategies, daily life reorganization and neuropsychiatric symptoms in an Italian MS population during the COVID-19 lockdown, in order to identify potentially modifiable factors that could inform clinical management of mental distress in people with MS. We explored the relationship between mental distress, disability and coping strategies in the Italian MS population under lockdown. Structural equation modeling was applied to information collected via web survey to identify modifiable factors that could account for mental distress. A total of 845 participants (497 with MS and 348 controls) were included in the study. The MS group had higher scores than the control group for depression (PÂ =Â 0.005), but not for anxiety, emotional dyscontrol or sleep disturbances. The structural equation modeling explained 74% of the variance observed in depression score. Within the model, three latent factors were characterized from measured variables: motor disability and cognitive dysfunction contributed to disability (Î²Â =Â 0.509 and Î²Â =Â 0.836; PÂ &lt;Â 0.001); positive attitude and exercise contributed to active attitude (Î²Â =Â 0.386 and Î²Â =Â 0.297; PÂ &lt;Â 0.001); and avoidance, social support and watching television contributed to passive attitude (Î²Â =Â 0.301, Î²Â =Â 0.243 and Î²Â =Â 0.212; PÂ &lt;Â 0.001). With regard to the relationship between latent factors and their influence on depression, disability contributed to passive attitude (Î²Â =Â 0.855; PÂ &lt;Â 0.001), while both passive and active attitude significantly influenced depression (Î²Â =Â 0.729 and Î²Â =Â -0.456; PÂ &lt;Â 0.001). As a practical implication of our model, favoring exercise would enhance active attitude and its positive impact on mental well-being while, at the same time, reducing the negative impact of disability on depression, representing a valuable tool in facing COVID-19-related mental distress.","Costabile, Carotenuto, Lavorgna, Borriello, Moiola, Inglese, Petruzzo, Trojsi, Ianniello, Nozzolillo, Cellerino, Boffa, Rosa, Servillo, Moccia, Bonavita, Filippi, Lanzillo, Brescia Morra, Petracca",https://doi.org/10.1111/ene.14580,20201120.0,COVID-19; coping; depression; exercise; multiple sclerosis,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
202,&quot;Physical Sex Is Over for Now&quot;: Impact of COVID-19 on the Well-Being and Sexual Health of Adolescent Sexual Minority Males in the US,"This study aimed to explore how the COVID-19 pandemic and physical distancing measures have impacted the well-being and sexual health among adolescent sexual minority males (ASMM) during the initial phase of physical distancing mandates in the U.S. From March 27, 2020, to May 8, 2020, U.S. ASMM (NÂ = 151; aged 14-17 years) completed the online baseline survey of a sexual health intervention trial. COVID-19-related closed- and open-ended questions were included. A mixed-methods approach assessed COVID-19-related changes in well-being and sexual health by outness with an accepting guardian. The majority (57%) of participants reported being worried about COVID-19. Almost all (91%) were physically distancing. Participants noted that COVID-19 changed school, home, work, and family life. Participants highlighted that COVID-19 reduced their ability to socialize and had a deleterious effect on their mental health. In the past 3 months, participants reported seeing sexual partners in person less often, masturbating and viewing pornography more often, and sexting and messaging on men-seeking-men websites/phone applications about the same amount. Many described being physically distanced from sexual partners, and some noted an increase in their use of virtual ways to connect with partners (e.g., video chatting). There were no differences by outness with an accepting guardian in quantitative or qualitative responses. These findings provide a snapshot of the initial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic among a convenience sample of U.S. ASMM and underscore the need to provide access to resources sensitive to their social, developmental, and sexual health needs during this crisis.","Nelson, Gordon, John, Stout, Macapagal",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.08.027,20201224.0,ASMM; Adolescents; COVID-19; Mental health; Sexual health; Sexual minority; YMSM; Adolescent; Adolescent Health; COVID-19; Humans; Internet; Male; Sexual Partners; Sexual and Gender Minorities; Surveys and Questionnaires; United States,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
203,Impact on mental health of the COVID-19 outbreak among community pharmacists during the sanitary lockdown period,"COVID-19 outbreak can impact mental health including health care workers. The aim of this study was to assess the psychological impact of COVID-19 in French community pharmacists. We carried out a postal-based survey to assess the psychological impact of COVID-19 in French owner community pharmacists based on three validated self-report questionnaires: Perceived Stress scale, Impact of Event Scale-revised and Maslach Burnout Inventory. The sample consists of 135 community pharmacists. Twenty-three pharmacists reported significant post-traumatic stress symptoms (17%). High burnout symptoms were found in 33 (25%), 46 (34.9%) and 4 (3%) participants. Females scored higher than males for all questionnaires (P=0.01). This study is the first study which showed the psychological impact of COVID-19 in community pharmacists. Based on validated self-report questionnaires, up to 35% of pharmacists reported psychological disturbances. Interventions to promote psychological well-being of healthcare workers need to be developing.","Lange, Joo, Couette, de Jaegher, Joly, Humbert",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pharma.2020.09.002,20201119.0,"Burnout; COVID-19; Mental health; Pharmaciens; Pharmacists; SantÃ© mentale; Adult; Aged; Betacoronavirus; Burnout, Professional; COVID-19; Community Pharmacy Services; Coronavirus Infections; Depersonalization; Emotions; Female; France; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Occupational Stress; Pandemics; Pharmacists; Pneumonia, Viral; SARS-CoV-2; Self Report; Severity of Illness Index; Sex Distribution; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
204,Virtual Reality Behavioral Activation as an Intervention for Major Depressive Disorder: Case Report,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a global problem with an increasing incidence and prevalence. There has additionally been an increase in depression due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Behavioral activation is considered an evidence-based treatment for MDD. However, there are many barriers that could hinder one's ability to engage in behavioral activation, with COVID-19 &quot;shelter-in-place&quot; and social distancing orders being current and large impediments. Virtual reality (VR) has been successfully used to help treat a variety of mental health conditions, but it has not yet been used as a method of administering behavioral activation to a clinical population. Using VR to engage in behavioral activation could eliminate barriers that pandemic precautions place and help decrease symptoms of depression that are especially exacerbated in these times. The following case report examines the feasibility, acceptability, and tolerability of VR behavioral activation for an adult with MDD during a global pandemic. This participant was part of a larger pilot study, and the case serves as a description of the VR intervention. The participant engaged in a weekly 50-minute psychotherapy Zoom session for 4 weeks, in which a modified behavioral activation protocol was administered using a VR headset to simulate activities. Data on mood ratings, homework compliance, and headset use were obtained from the headset. Acceptability, tolerability, and depression symptoms were obtained using self-report rating scales. The intervention was feasible, acceptable, and tolerable, as reported by this participant. The participant's depressive symptoms decreased by five-points on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 over a month, with a beginning score of 10 (moderate depression) and a final score of 5 (mild depression). The implications of these findings for future research are discussed.

205,Trauma-informed responses in addressing public mental health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic: position paper of the European Society for Traumatic Stress Studies (ESTSS),"The COVID-19 pandemic has changed life in Europe and globally. The pandemic affects both individuals and the broader society across many domains, including physical and psychological health, the economy and general welfare. The measures taken to counteract the pandemic have significantly altered daily life and, along with the threat of contracting the coronavirus and uncertainties surrounding future developments, created a complex system of stressors with a negative impact on public mental health. This paper aims to outline the ESTSS strategy to address mental health issues related to COVID-19 and focuses on (1) trauma-informed policies, (2) capacity building, (3) collaborative research and (4) knowledge-exchange. To facilitate implementation of a trauma-informed approach and appropriate measures, ESTSS has developed a toolkit of recommendations on mental health and psychosocial assistance to be provided during the different phases of crisis and its aftermath. To promote capacity building, ESTSS offers a certification programme based on a curriculum in psychotraumatology and corresponding on-line training to the European community of mental health professionals. To assure evidence-based approaches and methods tailored to current circumstances, ESTSS has initiated a pan-European research project with international cooperation aimed at studying the mental health consequences of the pandemic, with a focus on psychological trauma and other stress-related reactions. To foster knowledge-exchange, the European Journal of Psychotraumatology (EJPT), the official journal of ESTSS, is publishing a special issue on COVID-19. La pandemia de COVID-19 ha cambiado la vida en Europa y en todo el mundo. La pandemia afecta tanto a los individuos como a la sociedad en general en muchos Ã¡mbitos, incluida la salud fÃ­sica y psicolÃ³gica, la economÃ­a y el bienestar general. Las medidas tomadas para contrarrestar la pandemia han alterado significativamente la vida diaria y, junto con la amenaza de contraer el coronavirus y las incertidumbres que rodean los desarrollos futuros, crearon un complejo sistema de estresores con un impacto negativo en la salud mental pÃºblica. En este artÃ­culo se pretende esbozar la estrategia de la ESTSS para abordar los problemas de salud mental relacionados con COVID-19 y se centra en: 1. PolÃ­ticas informadas en trauma, 2. capacitaciÃ³n, 3. investigaciÃ³n colaborativa, 4. e intercambio de conocimientos. Para facilitar la implementaciÃ³n de un enfoque basado en el trauma y las medidas apropiadas, la ESTSS ha desarrollado un conjunto de herramientas de recomendaciones sobre salud mental y asistencia psicosocial que se proporcionarÃ¡ durante las diferentes fases de la crisis y sus consecuencias. Para fomentar la capacitaciÃ³n, la ESTSS ofrece un programa de certificaciÃ³n basado en un plan de estudios en psicotraumatologÃ­a y la formaciÃ³n on-line correspondiente a la comunidad europea de profesionales de la salud mental. Para asegurar enfoques y mÃ©todos basados en la evidencia adaptados a las circunstancias actuales, la ESTSS ha iniciado un proyecto de investigaciÃ³n paneuropeo con cooperaciÃ³n internacional, destinado a estudiar las consecuencias de la pandemia en la salud mental, con enfoque en el trauma psicolÃ³gico y otras reacciones relacionadas con el estrÃ©s. Para fomentar intercambio de conocimiento, la European Journal of Psychotraumatology (EJPT), la revista oficial de ESTSS, publica un nÃºmero especial sobre COVID-19.

207,Risk of Mortality in Elderly Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients With Mental Health Disorders: A Nationwide Retrospective Study in South Korea,"This study aimed to investigate the different clinical characteristics among elderly coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with and without mental disorders in South Korea and determine if these characteristics have an association with underlying mental disorders causing mortality. A population-based comparative cohort study was conducted using the national claims database. Individuals aged â‰¥65 years with confirmed COVID-19 between January 1, 2020 and April 10, 2020 were assessed. The endpoints for evaluating mortality for all participants were death, 21 days after diagnosis, or April 10, 2020. The risk of mortality associated with mental disorders was estimated using Cox hazards regression. We identified 814 elderly COVID-19 patients (255 [31.3%] with mental disorder and 559 [68.7%] with nonmental disorder). Individuals with mental disorders were found more likely to be older, taking antithrombotic agents, and had diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive lung disease, and urinary tract infections than those without mental disorders. After propensity score stratification, our study included 781 patients in each group (236 [30.2%] with mental disorder and 545 [69.8%] with nonmental disorder). The mental disorder group showed higher mortality rates than the nonmental disorder group (12.7% [30/236] versus 6.8% [37/545]). However, compared to patients without mental disorders, the hazard ratio (HR) for mortality in elderly COVID-19 patients with mental disorders was not statistically significant (HR: 1.57, 95%CI: 0.95-2.56). Although the association between mental disorders in elderly individuals and mortality in COVID-19 is unclear, this study suggests that elderly patients with comorbid conditions and those taking psychiatric medications might be at a higher risk of COVID-19.","Lee, Cho, You, Park, Kim, Lee, Aizenstein, Andreescu, Karim, Hong, Rho, Park, Son",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.09.016,20201130.0,"COVID-19; Elderly; mental disorder; mortality; Aged; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; Cohort Studies; Comorbidity; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Proportional Hazards Models; Republic of Korea; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; SARS-CoV-2",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
208,"Communicable Diseases (Including COVID-19)-Induced Global Depression: Caused by Inadequate Healthcare Expenditures, Population Density, and Mass Panic","Coronavirus (COVID-19) is spreading at an enormous rate and has caused deaths beyond expectations due to a variety of reasons. These include: (i) inadequate healthcare spending causing, for instance, a shortage of protective equipment, testing swabs, masks, surgical gloves, gowns, etc.; (ii) a high population density that causes close physical contact among community members who reside in compact places, hence they are more likely to be exposed to communicable diseases, including coronavirus; and (iii) mass panic due to the fear of experiencing the loss of loved ones, lockdown, and shortage of food. In a given scenario, the study focused on the following key variables: communicable diseases, healthcare expenditures, population density, poverty, economic growth, and COVID-19 dummy variable in a panel of 76 selected countries from 2010 through 2019. The results show that the impact of communicable diseases on economic growth is positive because the infected countries get a reap of economic benefits from other countries in the form of healthcare technologies, knowledge transfers, cash transfers, international loans, aid, etc., to get rid of the diseases. However, the case is different with COVID-19 as it has seized the whole world together in a much shorter period of time and no other countries are able to help others in terms of funding loans, healthcare facilities, or technology transfers. Thus, the impact of COVID-19 in the given study is negatively impacting countries' economic growth that converts into a global depression. The high incidence of poverty and social closeness increases more vulnerable conditions that spread coronavirus across countries. The momentous increase in healthcare expenditures put a burden on countries' national healthcare bills that stretch the depression phase-out of the boundary. The forecasting relationship suggested the negative impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the global economy would last the next 10 years. Unified global healthcare policies, physical distancing, smart lockdowns, and meeting food challenges are largely required to combat the coronavirus pandemic and escape from global depression.","Anser, Yousaf, Khan, Sheikh, Nassani, Abro, Zaman",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.00398,20201006.0,(COVID-19); GMM estimator; communicable diseases; global depression; healthcare expenditures; population density; poverty incidence,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
209,Severe SARS-CoV-2 disease in the context of a NF-ÎºB2 loss-of-function pathogenic variant,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus that emerged recently and has created a global pandemic. Symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been associated with a host of symptoms affecting numerous organ systems, including the lungs, cardiovascular system, kidney, central nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, and skin, among others. Although several risk factors have been identified as related to complications from and severity of COVID-19, much about the virus remains unknown. The host immune response appears to affect the outcome of disease. It is not surprising that patients with intrinsic or secondary immune compromise might be particularly susceptible to complications from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pathogenic loss-of-function or gain-of-function heterozygous variants in nuclear factor-ÎºB2 have been reported to be associated with either a combined immunodeficiency or common variable immunodeficiency phenotype. We evaluated the functional consequence and immunologic phenotype of a novel NFKB2 loss of function variant in a 17-year-old male patient and describe the clinical management of SARS-CoV-2 infection in this context. This patient required a 2-week hospitalization for SARS-CoV-2 infection, including 7 days of mechanical ventilation. We used biologic therapies to avert potentially fatal acute respiratory distress syndrome and treat hyperinflammatory responses. The patient had an immunologic phenotype of B-cell dysregulation with decreased switched memory B cells. Despite the underlying immune dysfunction, he recovered from the infection with intense management. This clinical case exemplifies some of the practical challenges in management of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in the context of underlying immune dysregulation.","Abraham, Marshall, Kuehn, Rueda, Gibbs, Guider, Stewart, Rosenzweig, Wang, Jean, Peeples, King, Hunt, Honegger, Ramilo, Mustillo, Mejias, Ardura, Shimamura",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2020.09.020,20210215.0,"COVID-19; NF-ÎºB; NF-ÎºB pathway; NF-ÎºB2; SARS-CoV-2; immunodeficiency; Adenosine Monophosphate; Adolescent; Alanine; Antibodies, Viral; Antiviral Agents; B-Lymphocytes; COVID-19; Hospitalization; Humans; Interleukin-6; Male; NF-kappa B p52 Subunit; Respiration, Artificial; SARS-CoV-2; Severity of Illness Index",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
210,Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States: Online Survey,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had numerous worldwide effects. In the United States, there have been 8.3 million cases and nearly 222,000 deaths as of October 21, 2020. Based on previous studies of mental health during outbreaks, the mental health of the population will be negatively affected in the aftermath of this pandemic. The long-term nature of this pandemic may lead to unforeseen mental health outcomes and/or unexpected relationships between demographic factors and mental health outcomes. This research focused on assessing the mental health status of adults in the United States during the early weeks of an unfolding pandemic. Data was collected from English-speaking adults from early April to early June 2020 using an online survey. The final convenience sample included 1083 US residents. The 71-item survey consisted of demographic questions, mental health and well-being measures, a coping mechanisms checklist, and questions about COVID-19-specific concerns. Hierarchical multivariable logistic regression was used to explore associations among demographic variables and mental health outcomes. Hierarchical linear regression was conducted to examine associations among demographic variables, COVID-19-specific concerns, and mental health and well-being outcomes. Approximately 50% (536/1076) of the US sample was aged â‰¥45 years. Most of the sample was White (1013/1054, 96%), non-Hispanic (985/1058, 93%), and female (884/1073, 82%). Participants reported high rates of depression (295/1034, 29%), anxiety (342/1007, 34%), and stress (773/1058, 73%). Older individuals were less likely to report depressive symptomology (OR 0.78, P&lt;.001) and anxiety symptomology (OR 0.72, P&lt;.001); in addition, they had lower stress scores (-0.15 points, SE 0.01, P&lt;.001) and increased well-being scores (1.86 points, SE 0.22, P&lt;.001). Individuals who were no longer working due to COVID-19 were 2.25 times more likely to report symptoms of depression (P=.02), had a 0.51-point increase in stress (SE 0.17, P=.02), and a 3.9-point decrease in well-being scores (SE 1.49, P=.009) compared to individuals who were working remotely before and after COVID-19. Individuals who had partial or no insurance coverage were 2-3 times more likely to report depressive symptomology compared to individuals with full coverage (P=.02 and P=.01, respectively). Individuals who were on Medicare/Medicaid and individuals with no coverage were 1.97 and 4.48 times more likely to report moderate or severe anxiety, respectively (P=.03 and P=.01, respectively). Financial and food access concerns were significantly and positively related to depression, anxiety, and stress (all P&lt;.05), and significantly negatively related to well-being (both P&lt;.001). Economy, illness, and death concerns were significantly positively related to overall stress scores (all P&lt;.05). Our findings suggest that many US residents are experiencing high stress, depressive, and anxiety symptomatology, especially those who are underinsured, uninsured, or unemployed. Longitudinal investigation of these variables is recommended. Health practitioners may provide opportunities to allay concerns or offer coping techniques to individuals in need of mental health care. These messages should be shared in person and through practice websites and social media.","Jewell, Farewell, Welton-Mitchell, Lee-Winn, Walls, Leiferman",https://doi.org/10.2196/22043,20201101.0,COVID-19; anxiety; depression; mental health; pandemic; stress; well-being,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30

212,"A repeated cross-sectional survey assessing university students' stress, depression, anxiety, and suicidality in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland","The time of widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases can lead to elevated stress and mental health problems among all persons affected, and in particular those sub-groups of the population that are at an increased risk of mental health problems. One such vulnerable group constitutes university students. The aim of this study is to assess stress, depression, anxiety, and suicidality among different groups of university students (medical, psychology, and other). Using a repeated cross-sectional study design, we collected survey data among a large sample of 7228 university students from Poland (mean age = 22.78, s.d. = 4.40; 81% female). Data were collected in five waves, during the first 2 months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe (March and April 2020). The results demonstrate a significant increase in depression levels as the pandemic was progressing. We also found that female students scored significantly higher than male students on depression, anxiety, and stress. Psychology students recorded the lowest scores on depression and anxiety. Young adult students (aged 18-24 years) had more symptoms of depression, anxiety, and suicidality than adult students (â©¾25 years). These results provide insights into stress and mental health among university students during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings can be used for a more effective identification of students who may struggle during next stages of the pandemic and future crises.","Debowska, Horeczy, Boduszek, Dolinski",https://doi.org/10.1017/S003329172000392X,20201020.0,Anxiety; COVID-19 pandemic; depression; stress; suicidality; university students,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
213,[Psychological effects during the COVID-19 outbreak in Argentina],"After the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak, global measures were implemented with the aim of containing its progression. On March 20, 2020, the mandatory preventive quarantine began in Argentina. As a result of these events, previous studies conducted in the framework of this pandemic in China, have shown psychological consequences. The aim of this study is to explore, through a self-administered electronic survey, attitudes and fears regarding COVID-19, the development of depressive symptoms and the pattern of alcohol consumption among the argentinian population during quarantine (n = 759). As a result, we observed that fear of COVID-19 was greater in 55 to 59 years old people, with an abrupt drop above 70; that depressed mood and the increased of alcohol consumption were more frequent in youngest subjects, and that depressed mood was also frequent among subjects who lost their jobs during quarantine. Finally, we observed an elevated degree of agreement with the quarantine measure, even in some people who suffered a decrease in their income greater than 80% during quarantine. These results are useful for obtaining information about risk groups, enabling specific preventive and therapeutic strategies could be designed. Luego de que la OrganizaciÃ³n Mundial de la Salud (OMS) declarara la pandemia por el nuevo coronavirus (COVID-19), se implementaron medidas a nivel mundial con el objetivo de contener su progresiÃ³n. El 20 de marzo de 2020 se iniciÃ³ el confinamiento preventivo obligatorio en Argentina. Estudios realizados en el marco de esta pandemia en China, han evidenciado consecuencias psicolÃ³gicas como resultado del temor al contagio y de las medidas de aislamiento.

214,Management of psychiatric conditions and delirium during the COVID-19 pandemic across continents: lessons learned and recommendations,"With the uncertainties of COVID-19, people infected with coronavirus present with diverse psychiatric presentations. Some institutions have had to manage their patients with existing protocols, others have had to create them. In this article we aimed to report the challenges and good practices in the management of psychiatric conditions and delirium coexisting with COVID-19 across continents. Early Career Psychiatrists (ECPs) from across five continents were approached to share their experiences on the management of psychiatric conditions in patients with COVID-19 during the current pandemic. We collected information about the experiences from sixteen countries. Commonalities were similar psychiatric presentations and poor preparedness across countries. Differences were varying adjustments made in the management of psychiatric conditions coexisting with COVID-19 and different innovations. Good practices which can be adopted by other countries are novel approaches such as telepsychiatry, proactive consultation-liaison units and enhanced community services targeted at circumventing challenges faced when providing mental health services. These findings highlight the need for global preparedness in the mental health sector during outbreaks of infectious diseases, and the need for concerted efforts targeted at global and locally sensitive adaptation of existing protocols and the development of new guidelines for the management of psychiatric conditions for the present pandemic and subsequent occurrences.","Ojeahere, de Filippis, Ransing, Karaliuniene, Ullah, BytyÃ§i, Abbass, Kilic, Nahidi, Hayatudeen, Nagendrappa, Shoib, Jatchavala, Larnaout, Maiti, Ogunnubi, El Hayek, Bizri, Schuh Teixeira, Pereira-Sanchez, Pinto da Costa",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2020.100147,20201216.0,COVID-19; Coronavirus; Delirium; Early career psychiatrists (ECPs); Management; Psychiatric conditions,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
215,Health Anxiety and Mental Health Outcome During COVID-19 Lockdown in Italy: The Mediating and Moderating Roles of Psychological Flexibility,"The COVID-19 emergency has severely affected the Italian population. During a pandemic, those with high health anxiety are at risk of adverse mental health outcomes, including peritraumatic distress and mood disturbance. No prior research has explored the role of psychological flexibility in protecting people at high risk of poorer mental health impacts due to health anxiety during a pandemic. Psychological flexibility is the cornerstone of psychological health and resiliency. According to acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), it involves behaving consistently with one's chosen values even in the presence of emotional and mental discomfort. This study examined the mediating and moderating roles of psychological flexibility in the link between trait health anxiety and three mental health outcomes: COVID-19 peritraumatic distress, anxiety, and depression. We hypothesized that higher psychological flexibility would decrease the negative impacts of trait health anxiety on mental health outcomes. During the mandatory national lockdown (<i>M</i> = 35.70 days, <i>SD</i> = 8.41), 944 Italian adults (75.5% female, <i>M</i> = 38.86 years, <i>SD</i> = 13.20) completed an online survey consisting of standardized measures of psychological flexibility, trait health anxiety, COVID-19 distress, anxiety, and depression. Results indicated that psychological flexibility did not moderate the link between trait health anxiety and mental health outcomes. Rather, greater psychological flexibility mediated decreases in the adverse effects of trait health anxiety on COVID-19 distress, anxiety, and depression. In particular, two psychological flexibility processes, observing unhelpful thoughts rather than taking them literally (defusion) and values-based action (committed action), mediated decreases in the negative effects of trait health anxiety on all mental health outcomes. In contrast, the psychological flexibility process acceptance, which involves openness to inner discomfort, mediated increases in negative mental health outcomes. Overall, the combination of these processes mitigated the detrimental impacts of trait health anxiety on mental health during the emergency mandatory COVID-19 nationwide lockdown. Consistent with the ACT conceptualization of psychological flexibility, findings suggest embracing (rather than avoiding) inner discomfort and observing associated unhelpful thoughts, while also engaging in values-based action, increases resilience during adversity. Evidenced-based large-scale online public health interventions that target psychological flexibility in those experiencing health anxiety in the context of a pandemic are urgently needed. Many empirically-based ACT interventions are suited for this purpose.","Landi, Pakenham, Boccolini, Grandi, Tossani",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.02195,20201001.0,COVID-19; anxiety; depression; health anxiety; pandemic; psychological flexibility; quarantine,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
216,Effects of the lockdown on the mental health of the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy: Results from the COMET collaborative network,"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is an unprecedented traumatic event influencing the healthcare, economic, and social welfare systems worldwide. In order to slow the infection rates, lockdown has been implemented almost everywhere. Italy, one of the countries most severely affected, entered the &quot;lockdown&quot; on March 8, 2020. The COvid Mental hEalth Trial (COMET) network includes 10 Italian university sites and the National Institute of Health. The whole study has three different phases. The first phase includes an online survey conducted between March and May 2020 in the Italian population. Recruitment took place through email invitation letters, social media, mailing lists of universities, national medical associations, and associations of stakeholders (e.g., associations of users/carers). In order to evaluate the impact of lockdown on depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms, multivariate linear regression models were performed, weighted for the propensity score. The final sample consisted of 20,720 participants. Among them, 12.4% of respondents (NÂ =Â 2,555) reported severe or extremely severe levels of depressive symptoms, 17.6% (NÂ =Â 3,627) of anxiety symptoms and 41.6% (NÂ =Â 8,619) reported to feel at least moderately stressed by the situation at the DASS-21.According to the multivariate regression models, the depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms significantly worsened from the week April 9-15 to the week April 30 to May 4 (pÂ &lt;Â 0.0001). Moreover, female respondents and people with pre-existing mental health problems were at higher risk of developing severe depression and anxiety symptoms (pÂ &lt;Â 0.0001). Although physical isolation and lockdown represent essential public health measures for containing the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, they are a serious threat for mental health and well-being of the general population.

217,The potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on child growth and development: a systematic review,"This was a systematic review of studies that examined the impact of epidemics or social restriction on mental and developmental health in parents and children/adolescents. The PubMed, WHO COVID-19, and SciELO databases were searched on March 15, 2020, and on April 25, 2020, filtering for children (0-18 years) and humans. The tools used to mitigate the threat of a pandemic such as COVID-19 may very well threaten child growth and development. These tools - such as social restrictions, shutdowns, and school closures - contribute to stress in parents and children and can become risk factors that threaten child growth and development and may compromise the Sustainable Development Goals. The studies reviewed suggest that epidemics can lead to high levels of stress in parents and children, which begin with concerns about children becoming infected. These studies describe several potential mental and emotional consequences of epidemics such as COVID-19, H1N1, AIDS, and Ebola: severe anxiety or depression among parents and acute stress disorder, post-traumatic stress, anxiety disorders, and depression among children. These data can be related to adverse childhood experiences and elevated risk of toxic stress. The more adverse experiences, the greater the risk of developmental delays and health problems in adulthood, such as cognitive impairment, substance abuse, depression, and non-communicable diseases.

219,Redeployment of Surgical Trainees to Intensive Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evaluation of the Impact on Training and Wellbeing,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of redeployment of surgical trainees to intensive care units (ICUs) during the COVID-19 pandemic-in terms of transferrable technical and nontechnical skills and wellbeing. This was a survey study consisting of a 23-point questionnaire. The study involved surgical trainees that had been redeployed to the (ICU) across all hospitals in London during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey was sent to 90 surgical trainees who were between postgraduate years 2 to 4. Trainees in specialty training programs (&gt;5 years after graduation) were not included. Thirty-two trainees responded to the questionnaire and were included in the study results. All respondents spent between 4 and 8 weeks working in ICU. Prior to redeployment, 78% of participants had previous experience of ICU or an affiliated specialty, and &gt;90% had attended at least 1 educational course with relevance to ICU. There were statistically significant increases in confidence performing central venous cannulation and peripheral arterial catheterisation (p &lt; 0.05). With regards to clinical skills, respondents reported feeling more confident managing ventilated patients, patients on noninvasive ventilation, dialysis, and circulatory failure patients after working in ICU. Respondents (97%) felt that the experience would be beneficial to their future careers but 53% felt the redeployment had a negative impact on their mental health. Redeployment of surgical trainees to ICU led to increased confidence in a number of technical and nontechnical skills. However, proactive interventions are needed for training surgeons with regard to their psychological wellbeing in these extraordinary circumstances and to improve workforce planning for future pandemics.","Payne, Rahman, Bullingham, Vamadeva, Alfa-Wali",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsurg.2020.09.009,20201001.0,COVID-19; Pandemic; Surgical training; Wellbeing; Workforce,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
220,The prognosis and prevention measures for mental health in COVID-19 patients: through the experience of SARS,"Due to the high pathogenicity and mortality, the COVID-19 disaster caused global panic and anxiety. At present, diagnosis and treatment are of great concern. As time progresses, however, the sequelae caused by many other organ system complications and treatments will become increasingly obvious, and psychosomatic symptoms are one of these changes with great potential impact. Studies have shown that symptoms like poor sleep quality, anxiety and even delirium are not uncommon in patients during isolation. By summarizing the follow-up study on mental and psychological health of SARS in the past 10 years, and combining the characteristics of the existing cases of COVID-19, we will provide suggestions for the prevention and treatment of psychological diseases in clinical practice.","Mo, Wang, Chen, Jiang",https://doi.org/10.1186/s13030-020-00196-6,20200928.0,COVID-19; Depression; Mental health; Prognosis; Treatment,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
221,Hidden scars: the impact of violence and the COVID-19 pandemic on children's mental health,"More than 1 billion children are exposed to violence every year. The devastating immediate and long-term impact of violence on the mental health of children is well established. Despite commitments made by the international community to end violence against children and support their mental health, there has been a serious lack of investment and capacity to provide quality, rights-based, culturally appropriate mental health care globally. The arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic has magnified these challenges. This article outlines how the risk of children experiencing violence has increased and how the pandemic has weakened the capacity of child protection and mental health services to respond. The article argues for child protection, mental health and other core services to be prioritized during and after the pandemic. A failure to do so will undermine the international community's ability to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 and to fulfil its obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.",Maalla M'jid,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13034-020-00340-8,20200928.0,COVID-19 pandemic; Child rights; Mental health; Sustainable development goals; Violence against children,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30

It charts health systems and mental health impacts with a particular focus on children and adolescents, older people and people availing of mental health services. Issues of moral distress and the nursing reaction are considered alongside psychological and social concerns which continue to rapidly evolve. The perspective of a person attending adult community mental health services and the experience of engaging with a mental health service remotely is provided. Matters of note for acute inpatient mental health nursing are highlighted and informed by the lived experience of a mental health nurse.

223,[Immunopsychiatry and SARS-CoV-2Â pandemic: Links and possible consequences],"The SARS-CoV-2 (or COVID-19) pandemic has been propagating since December 2019, inducing a drastic increase in the prevalence of anxious and depressive disorders in the general population. Psychological trauma can partly explain these disorders. However, since psychiatric disorders also have an immuno-inflammatory component, the direct effects of the virus on the host's immune system, with a marked inflammatory response, but also the secondary inflammation to these psychosocial stressors, may cause the apparition or the worsening of psychiatric disorders. We describe here the probable immunopsychiatric consequences of the SARS-CoV-2Â pandemic, to delineate possible screening actions and care that could be planned. Data from previous pandemics, and existing data on the psychopathological consequences of the SARS-CoV-2Â pandemic, allowed us to review the possible immunopsychiatric consequences of the SARS-CoV-2Â pandemic, on the gestational environment, with the risk of consecutive neurodevelopmental disorders for the fetus on one hand, on the children and adults directly infected being at increased risks of psychiatric disorders on the other hand. As in previous pandemics, the activation of the immune system due to psychological stress and/or to infection during pregnancy, might lead to an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders for the fetus (schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders). Furthermore, in individuals exposed to psychological trauma and/or infected by the virus, the risk of psychiatric disorders, especially mood disorders, is probably increased. In this context, preventive measures and specialized care are necessary. Thus, it is important to propose a close follow-up to the individuals who have been infected by the virus, in order to set up the earliest care possible. Likewise, in pregnant women, screening of mood disorders during the pregnancy or the postpartum period must be facilitated. The follow-up of the babies born during the pandemic must be strengthened to screen and care for possible neurodevelopmental disorders.","Daaboul, Tamouza, Leboyer",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.07.002,20210322.0,Autism spectrum disorders; Immunopsychiatrie; Immunopsychiatry; Mood disorders; SARS-CoV-2; Schizophrenia; SchizophrÃ©nie; Troubles de lâ€™humeur; Troubles du spectre de lâ€™autisme,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
224,Self-Reported Compliance With Personal Preventive Measures Among Chinese Factory Workers at the Beginning of Work Resumption Following the COVID-19 Outbreak: Cross-Sectional Survey Study,"Maintaining compliance with personal preventive measures is important to achieve a balance of COVID-19 pandemic control and work resumption. The aim of this study was to investigate self-reported compliance with four personal measures to prevent COVID-19 among a sample of factory workers in Shenzhen, China, at the beginning of work resumption in China following the COVID-19 outbreak. These preventive measures included consistent wearing of face masks in public spaces (the workplace and other public settings); sanitizing hands using soap, liquid soap, or alcohol-based hand sanitizer after returning from public spaces or touching public installations and equipment; avoiding social and meal gatherings; and avoiding crowded places. The participants were adult factory workers who had resumed work in Shenzhen, China. A stratified two-stage cluster sampling design was used. We randomly selected 14 factories that had resumed work. All full-time employees aged â‰¥18 years who had resumed work in these factories were invited to complete a web-based survey. Out of 4158 workers who had resumed work in these factories, 3035 (73.0%) completed the web-based survey from March 1 to 14, 2020. Multilevel logistic regression models were fitted. Among the 3035 participants, 2938 (96.8%) and 2996 (98.7%) reported always wearing a face mask in the workplace and in other public settings, respectively, in the past month. However, frequencies of self-reported sanitizing hands (2152/3035, 70.9%), avoiding social and meal gatherings (2225/3035, 73.3%), and avoiding crowded places (1997/3035, 65.8%) were relatively low. At the individual level, knowledge about COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratios [AORs] from 1.16, CI 1.10-1.24, to 1.29, CI 1.21-1.37), perceived risk (AORs from 0.58, CI 0.50-0.68, to 0.85, CI 0.72-0.99) and severity (AOR 1.05, CI 1.01-1.09, and AOR 1.07, CI 1.03-1.11) of COVID-19, perceived effectiveness of preventive measures by the individual (AORs from 1.05, CI 1.00-1.10, to 1.09, CI 1.04-1.13), organization (AOR 1.30, CI 1.20-1.41), and government (AORs from 1.14, CI 1.04-1.25, to 1.21, CI 1.02-1.42), perceived preparedness for a potential outbreak after work resumption (AORs from 1.10, CI 1.00-1.21, to 1.50, CI 1.36-1.64), and depressive symptoms (AORs from 0.93, CI 0.91-0.94, to 0.96, CI 0.92-0.99) were associated with self-reported compliance with at least one personal preventive measure. At the interpersonal level, exposure to COVID-19-specific information through official media channels (AOR 1.08, CI 1.04-1.11) and face-to-face communication (AOR 0.90, CI 0.83-0.98) were associated with self-reported sanitizing of hands. The number of preventive measures implemented in the workplace was positively associated with self-reported compliance with all four preventive measures (AORs from 1.30, CI 1.08-1.57, to 1.63, CI 1.45-1.84). Measures are needed to strengthen hand hygiene and physical distancing among factory workers to reduce transmission following work resumption. Future programs in workplaces should address these factors at multiple levels.","Pan, Fang, Xin, Dong, Zhou, Hou, Li, Sun, Zheng, Yuan, Wang, He",https://doi.org/10.2196/22457,20201002.0,"COVID-19; compliance; cross-sectional; facemask wearing; hand hygiene; online; physical distancing; prevention; survey; work resumption, factory workers; Adult; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; China; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Disease Outbreaks; Employment; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Infection Control; Male; Occupational Health; Odds Ratio; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; SARS-CoV-2; Self Report; Workplace; Young Adult",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
225,A rapid review investigating the potential impact of a pandemic on the mental health of young people aged 12-25 years,"In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a pandemic. Adolescence and early adulthood are peak times for the onset of mental health difficulties. Exposure to a pandemic during this vulnerable developmental period places young people at significant risk of negative psychological experiences. The objective of this research was to summarise existing evidence on the potential impact of a pandemic on the mental health of 12-25 year olds. A rapid review of the published peer-reviewed literature, published between 1985 and 2020, using PsycINFO (Proquest) and Medline (Proquest) was conducted. Narrative synthesis was used across studies to identify key themes and concepts. This review found 3,359 papers, which was reduced to 12 papers for data extraction. Results regarding the prevalence of psychological difficulties in youth were mixed, with some studies finding this group experience heightened distress during an infectious disease outbreak, and others finding no age differences or higher distress among adults. Gender, coping, self-reported physical health and adoption of precautionary measures appear to play a role in moderating the psychological impact of an infectious disease outbreak. Most studies were conducted after the peak of an epidemic/pandemic or in the recovery period. More longitudinal research with young people, particularly adolescents in the general population, before and during the early stages of an infectious disease outbreak is needed to obtain a clear understanding of how best to support young people during these events.","O'Reilly, Tibbs, Booth, Doyle, McKeague, Moore",https://doi.org/10.1017/ipm.2020.106,20201207.0,COVID-19; Coronavirus; epidemic; infectious disease outbreak; pandemic; rapid review; youth mental health,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30

227,The Effect and Mechanism of Adverse Childhood Experience on Suicide Ideation in Young Cancer Patients During Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently prevalent worldwide. This research aimed to explore the effect of adverse childhood experience (ACE) on suicide ideation in young cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Self-reported questionnaires analyzed the mediating effects of sleep quality, anxiety symptoms, and inflammatory conditions between ACE and suicide ideation. A total of 197 young cancer patients (age 18-40) completed questionnaires and a blood test. Correlation analysis and structural equation model were used to explore the relationships between ACE, sleep quality, anxiety symptom, serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and suicide ideation. The mediating roles of sleep quality, anxiety symptoms, and CRP levels on the influence of ACE on suicide ideation were explored. ACE was positively related to anxiety symptoms, CRP levels, and suicide ideation, and negatively related to sleep quality. Anxiety symptoms and CRP levels were positively related to suicide ideation, while sleep quality was negatively related to suicide ideation. Anxiety symptoms were positively related to CRP levels but negatively related to sleep quality. From these results, we found ACE affected suicide ideation directly and was mediated by roles sleep quality, anxiety symptom and CRP. ACE not only directly affected suicide ideation but also affected suicide ideation through sleep quality, anxiety symptoms, and inflammatory conditions in young cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, targeted intervention and help for cancer patients from the perspective of ACE should be put into practice.","Yang, Xiao, Li, Yang",https://doi.org/10.2147/RMHP.S266269,20200928.0,adverse childhood experience; anxiety symptom; coronavirus disease 2019; psychosocial oncology; sleep quality; suicide ideation,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
228,Mental Health Challenges of United States Healthcare Professionals During COVID-19,"As COVID-19 continues to impact global society, healthcare professionals (HCPs) are at risk for a number of negative well-being outcomes due to their role as care providers. The objective of this study was to better understand the current psychological impact of COVID-19 on HCPs in the United States This study used an online survey tool to collect demographic data and measures of well-being of adults age 18 and older living in the United States between March 20, 2020 and May 14, 2020. Measures included anxiety and stress related to COVID-19, depressive symptoms, current general anxiety, health questions, tiredness, control beliefs, proactive coping, and past and future appraisals of COVID-related stress. The sample included 90 HCPs and 90 age-matched controls (<i>M</i><sub>age</sub> = 34.72 years, <i>SD</i> = 9.84, range = 23 - 67) from 35 states of the United States. A multivariate analysis of variance was performed, using education as a covariate, to identify group differences in the mental and physical health measures. HCPs reported higher levels of depressive symptoms, past and future appraisal of COVID-related stress, concern about their health, tiredness, current general anxiety, and constraint, in addition to lower levels of proactive coping compared to those who were not HCPs (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, Î·<sup>2</sup> = 0.28).

229,Evaluating the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic: perceived risk of COVID-19 infection and childhood trauma predict adult depressive symptoms in urban South Africa,"South Africa's national lockdown introduced serious threats to public mental health in a society where one in three individuals develops a psychiatric disorder during their life. We aimed to evaluate the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic using a mixed-methods design. This longitudinal study drew from a preexisting sample of 957 adults living in Soweto, a major township near Johannesburg. Psychological assessments were administered across two waves between August 2019 and March 2020 and during the first 6 weeks of the lockdown (late March-early May 2020). Interviews on COVID-19 experiences were administered in the second wave. Multiple regression models examined relationships between perceived COVID-19 risk and depression. Full data on perceived COVID-19 risk, depression, and covariates were available in 221 adults. In total, 14.5% of adults were at risk for depression. Higher perceived COVID-19 risk predicted greater depressive symptoms (p &lt; 0.001), particularly among adults with histories of childhood trauma, though this effect was marginally significant (p = 0.063). Adults were about two times more likely to experience significant depressive symptoms for every one unit increase in perceived COVID-19 risk (p = 0.021; 95% CI 1.10-3.39). Qualitative data identified potent experiences of anxiety, financial insecurity, fear of infection, and rumination. Higher perceived risk of COVID-19 infection is associated with greater depressive symptoms during the first 6 weeks of quarantine. High rates of severe mental illness and low availability of mental healthcare amidst COVID-19 emphasize the need for immediate and accessible psychological resources.","Kim, Nyengerai, Mendenhall",https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291720003414,20201001.0,COVID-19; South Africa; childhood trauma; depression; risk perception,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
230,Evaluation of anxiety and depression in patients with morphea taking immunosuppressive drugs during the COVID-19 pandemic,"During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, individuals especially those with chronic diseases face various problems like psychological distress. To evaluate anxiety and depression among morphea patients taking immunosuppressants compared with controls during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this case-control study, electronic data of 42 eligible morphea patients and 42 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects were extracted. All participants were asked about adherence to the health protocols and the symptoms of COVID-19. To investigate anxiety and depression, we provided the participants with an online version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) Questionnaire. In this standard questionnaire, a score â‰¥ 11 represents a significant psychological disorder. The two groups did not differ significantly in the mean HADS-Anxiety (HADS-A) and HADS-Depression (HADS-D) scores (<i>p</i>=Â .08 and <i>p</i>=Â .79, respectively). HADS-A and HADS-D scores were â‰¥ 11 in 16.67% and 11.90% of the patients, respectively. Among the morphea patients, those with sleeping problems during COVID-19 had a significantly higher mean HADS-D score (<i>p</i>=Â .048). Notably, 21.43% of patients discontinued their treatment due to fear of COVID-19 and experienced disease recurrence. Adherence to health protocols was higher in patients compared with controls. The rate of COVID-19 occurrence was not significantly different between the groups.

231,"&quot;It's about how much we can do, and not how little we can get away with&quot;: Coronavirus-related legislative changes for social care in the United Kingdom","The coronavirus pandemic, referred to here as Covid-19, has brought into sharp focus the increasing divergence of devolved legislation and its implementation in the United Kingdom. One such instance is the emergency health and social care legislation and guidance introduced by the United Kingdom Central Government and the devolved Governments of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland in response to this pandemic. We provide a summary, comparison and discussion of these proposed and actual changes with a particular focus on the impact on adult social care and safeguarding of the rights of citizens. To begin, a summary and comparison of the relevant changes, or potential changes, to mental health, mental capacity and adult social care law across the four jurisdictions is provided. Next, we critique the suggested and actual changes and in so doing consider the immediate and longer term implications for adult social care, including mental health and mental capacity, at the time of publication.several core themes emerged: concerns around process and scrutiny; concerns about possible changes to the workforce and last, the possible threat on the ability to safeguard human rights. It has been shown that, ordinarily, legislative provisions across the jurisdictions of the UK are different, save for Wales (which shares most of its mental health law provisions with England). Such divergence is also mirrored in the way in which the suggested emergency changes could be implemented. Aside from this, there is also a wider concern about a lack of parity of esteem between social care and health care, a concern which is common to all. What is interesting is that the introduction of CVA 2020 forced a comparison to be made between the four UK nations which also shines a spotlight on how citizens can anticipate receipt of services.","Vicary, Stone, McCusker, Davidson, Spencer-Lane",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijlp.2020.101601,20201021.0,"Adult social care; Coronavirus act (Scotland) 2020; Coronavirus act 2020; Covid-19; Law; Mental capacity; Mental health; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; Commitment of Mentally Ill; Coronavirus Infections; Health Care Reform; Humans; Legislation, Medical; Mental Competency; Mental Disorders; Mental Health Services; Northern Ireland; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; SARS-CoV-2; United Kingdom",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30

The association between diabetes and mental health disorders could be exacerbated in a stressful environment, and psychological distress could increase depressive symptoms and cause adverse diabetes outcomes. To assess the prevalence of mental health disorders in patients with diabetes during the social distancing period due to COVID-19 pandemic. This is a cross-sectional study developed to assess the impact of social distancing on a cohort of adults with type 1 (nâ€‰=â€‰52) and type 2 diabetes (nâ€‰=â€‰68) in Brazil. Inclusion criteria involved having an HbA1c test collected in the past 3Â months and having a valid telephone number in electronic medical records. The primary outcome was the prevalence of minor psychiatric disorders, assessed by survey (SRQ-20). Secondary outcomes included the prevalence of diabetes related emotional distress, eating and sleeping disorders, all assessed by validated surveys at the moment of the study. Statistical analyses included unpaired <i>t</i>-test for continuous variables and <i>Ï‡</i><sup>2</sup> test for categorical variables. Overall (nâ€‰=â€‰120), participants had a mean age of 54.8â€‰Â±â€‰14.4Â years-old, and HbA1c of 9.0â€‰Â±â€‰1.6% (75â€‰Â±â€‰17.5Â mmol/mol); 93% of patients showed signs of current mental suffering based on the surveys measured. Almost 43% of patients showed evidence of significant psychological distress, with a significant greater tendency in patients with type 2 diabetes. The presence of diabetes related emotional distress was found in 29.2% of patients; eating disorders in 75.8%; and moderate/severe sleeping disorders in 77.5%.

We used the depression-anxiety-stress scale and self-designed questionnaire on professional pride, intention to work in the front-line and the extent of family support. Medical students from 4 medical schools in Fujian and Hunan were investigated. Their mental health status, professional pride and first-line work willingness with different characteristics were compared, and the influential factors for professional pride and first-line work willingness were analyzed. A total of 266 valid questionnaires were collected. During the pandemic, there were significant differences in the proportion of depressed students among different college and universities, majors and stages (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05), and the professional pride was significantly different (<i>P</i>&lt;0.001). Medical students with different mental health status showed significant differences in professional pride (<i>P</i>&lt;0.01). Marriage, pressure and extent of family support were the influential factors for their professional pride (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05). The latter two were also influential factors for their intention to work in the front-line (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05). During the pandemic, students from college and nursing have relatively better mental health and higher professional pride. The professional pride is low in medical students who married, with abnormal stress or low family support. The intention to work in front-line is decreased in students with abnormal stress or low family support. <b>ç›®çš„</b>: äº†è§£2019å† çŠ¶ç—…æ¯’ç—…å¤§æµè¡ŒæœŸé—´åŒ»å­¦ç”Ÿçš„å¿ƒç†å¥åº·ã€èŒä¸šè‡ªè±ªæ„Ÿä¸Žä¸€çº¿å·¥ä½œæ„æ„¿ï¼Œä¸ºè¿›è¡Œå¿ƒç†å¹²é¢„æä¾›å‚è€ƒã€‚<b>æ–¹æ³•</b>: é‡‡ç”¨æŠ‘éƒ-ç„¦è™‘-åŽ‹åŠ›é‡è¡¨å’Œè‡ªè¡Œè®¾è®¡çš„å…³äºŽèŒä¸šè‡ªè±ªæ„Ÿã€ä¸€çº¿å·¥ä½œæ„æ„¿å’Œå®¶äººæ”¯æŒç¨‹åº¦çš„è°ƒæŸ¥é—®å·ï¼Œé€šè¿‡é—®å·æ˜Ÿå¹³å°å¯¹ç¦å»ºã€æ¹–å—4æ‰€åŒ»å­¦é™¢æ ¡çš„åŒ»å­¦ç”Ÿè¿›è¡Œè°ƒæŸ¥ï¼Œæ¯”è¾ƒä¸åŒç‰¹å¾çš„åŒ»å­¦ç”Ÿçš„å¿ƒç†å¥åº·çŠ¶å†µã€èŒä¸šè‡ªè±ªæ„Ÿå’Œä¸€çº¿å·¥ä½œæ„æ„¿ï¼Œå¹¶åˆ†æžèŒä¸šè‡ªè±ªæ„Ÿä¸Žä¸€çº¿å·¥ä½œæ„æ„¿çš„å½±å“å› ç´ ã€‚<b>ç»“æžœ</b>: å›žæ”¶æœ‰æ•ˆé—®å·266ä»½ã€‚ç–«æƒ…æœŸé—´ä¸åŒé™¢æ ¡ã€ä¸“ä¸šã€é˜¶æ®µåŒ»å­¦ç”Ÿå‘ç”ŸæŠ‘éƒçš„æ¯”ä¾‹å’ŒèŒä¸šè‡ªè±ªæ„Ÿå·®å¼‚æœ‰ç»Ÿè®¡å­¦æ„ä¹‰(åˆ†åˆ«<i>P</i>&lt;0.05ï¼Œ<i>P</i>&lt;0.001)ï¼Œä¸åŒå¿ƒç†å¥åº·çŠ¶å†µçš„åŒ»å­¦ç”ŸèŒä¸šè‡ªè±ªæ„Ÿå·®å¼‚æœ‰ç»Ÿè®¡å­¦æ„ä¹‰(<i>P</i>&lt;0.01)ï¼Œå©šå§»ã€åŽ‹åŠ›ã€å®¶äººæ”¯æŒç¨‹åº¦æ˜¯åŒ»å­¦ç”ŸèŒä¸šè‡ªè±ªæ„Ÿçš„å½±å“å› ç´ (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05)ï¼ŒåŽä¸¤è€…ä¹Ÿæ˜¯åŒ»å­¦ç”Ÿä¸€çº¿å·¥ä½œæ„æ„¿çš„å½±å“å› ç´ (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05)ã€‚<b>ç»“è®º</b>: ç–«æƒ…æœŸé—´å¤§ä¸“é™¢æ ¡ã€æŠ¤ç†ä¸“ä¸šåŒ»å­¦ç”Ÿå¿ƒç†å¥åº·çŠ¶å†µè¾ƒå¥½ï¼ŒèŒä¸šè‡ªè±ªæ„Ÿè¾ƒé«˜ï¼Œå·²å©šã€åŽ‹åŠ›å¼‚å¸¸ã€å®¶äººæ”¯æŒç¨‹åº¦ä½Žçš„åŒ»å­¦ç”ŸèŒä¸šè‡ªè±ªæ„Ÿè¾ƒä½Žï¼ŒåŽ‹åŠ›å¼‚å¸¸ã€å®¶äººæ”¯æŒç¨‹åº¦ä½Žçš„åŒ»å­¦ç”Ÿä¸€çº¿å·¥ä½œæ„æ„¿ä¸‹é™ã€‚.","Zhan, Sun, Xie, Wen, Fu",https://doi.org/10.11817/j.issn.1672-7347.2020.200440,20200908.0,"coronavirus disease 2019; intention to work in front-line; medical students; mental health; professional pride; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; China; Coronavirus Infections; Family; Humans; Intention; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Professionalism; SARS-CoV-2; Social Support; Stress, Psychological; Students, Medical; Surveys and Questionnaires",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
234,Psychological status of the staff in a general hospital during the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 and its influential factors,"To understand the psychological status of the staff in a general hospital during the coronavirus disease 2019 and its influential factors, and to provide references for the mental health services to hospital staff. Using star platform of questionnaire, the staff in the general hospital were investigated via Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS-21), Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS) and Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ). The influential factors were discussed by descriptive analysis, rank sum test, single factor analysis, correlation analysis and multiple factors binary logistic regression analysis. A total of 2 060 valid questionnaires were collected. The negative emotions of nurses and cleaners were the most obvious. The depression scores, anxiety scores and stress scores for nurses and cleaners were 5.06Â±7.47, 6.36Â±7.84, 9.75Â±8.65, and 6.72Â±8.84, 4.51Â±6.56, 9.69Â±9.56, respectively. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis showed that staff types, education levels, job status, economic situation and concerns on the supplies of protective goods were the main influential factors for depression; staff types, contacting status with infected patients, economic situation, concerns on the supplies of protective goods, history of disease were the main influential factors for anxiety; contacting status with infected patients, economic situation, concerns on the supplies of protective goods were the main influential factors for stress. There are differences in psychological characteristics among different groups of staff in the general hospital under the outbreak. Thus psychological protection and intervention measures should be formulated according to different groups and work status. <b>ç›®çš„</b>: äº†è§£2019å† çŠ¶ç—…æ¯’ç—…(coronavirus disease 2019ï¼ŒCOVID-19)ç–«æƒ…æœŸé—´ç»¼åˆåŒ»é™¢å‘˜å·¥çš„å¿ƒç†çŽ°çŠ¶å¹¶åˆ†æžå…¶å½±å“å› ç´ ï¼Œä¸ºåŒ»é™¢å‘˜å·¥å¿ƒç†æœåŠ¡æä¾›å‚è€ƒä¾æ®ã€‚<b>æ–¹æ³•</b>: é€šè¿‡é—®å·æ˜Ÿå¹³å°ï¼Œåº”ç”¨æŠ‘éƒ-ç„¦è™‘-åŽ‹åŠ›é‡è¡¨(Depressionï¼ŒAnxiety and Stress Scaleï¼ŒDASS-21)ã€ç¤¾ä¼šæ”¯æŒè¯„å®šé‡è¡¨(Social Support Rating Scaleï¼ŒSSRS)ã€ç®€æ˜“åº”å¯¹æ–¹å¼é‡è¡¨(Simplified Coping Style Questionnaireï¼ŒSCSQ)å¯¹æŸä¸‰çº§ç»¼åˆåŒ»é™¢çš„å‘˜å·¥è¿›è¡Œè°ƒæŸ¥ï¼Œé‡‡ç”¨æè¿°æ€§åˆ†æžã€ç§©å’Œæ£€éªŒã€å•å› ç´ åˆ†æžã€ç›¸å…³æ€§åˆ†æžåŠå¤šå› ç´ äºŒå…ƒlogisticå›žå½’åˆ†æžæŽ¢è®¨ç›¸å…³å½±å“å› ç´ ã€‚<b>ç»“æžœ</b>: å›žæ”¶æœ‰æ•ˆé—®å·2 060ä»½ã€‚æŠ¤å£«å’Œä¿æ´å‘˜è´Ÿæ€§æƒ…ç»ªæœ€æ˜Žæ˜¾ï¼Œå…¶ä¸­æŠ¤å£«æŠ‘éƒå¾—åˆ†5.06Â±7.47ï¼Œç„¦è™‘å¾—åˆ†6.36Â±7.84ï¼ŒåŽ‹åŠ›å¾—åˆ†9.75Â±8.65ï¼›ä¿æ´å‘˜æŠ‘éƒå¾—åˆ†6.72Â±8.84ï¼Œç„¦è™‘å¾—åˆ†4.51Â±6.56ï¼ŒåŽ‹åŠ›å¾—åˆ†9.69Â±9.56ã€‚å¤šå› ç´ äºŒå…ƒlogisticå›žå½’åˆ†æžæ˜¾ç¤ºï¼šå²—ä½ç±»åˆ«ã€æ–‡åŒ–ç¨‹åº¦ã€èŒåŠ¡ã€ç–«æƒ…å¯¹ç»æµŽçš„å½±å“ã€é˜²æŠ¤ç‰©è´¨ä¾›ç»™ä¸è¶³çš„æ‹…å¿ƒç¨‹åº¦æ˜¯æŠ‘éƒçš„å½±å“å› ç´ ï¼›å²—ä½ç±»åˆ«ã€ä¸Žæ„ŸæŸ“è€…æŽ¥è§¦æƒ…å†µã€ç–«æƒ…å¯¹ç»æµŽçš„å½±å“ã€é˜²æŠ¤ç‰©è´¨ä¾›ç»™ä¸è¶³çš„æ‹…å¿ƒç¨‹åº¦ã€ç–¾ç—…å²æ˜¯ç„¦è™‘çš„å½±å“å› ç´ ï¼›ä¸Žæ„ŸæŸ“è€…æŽ¥è§¦æƒ…å†µã€ç–«æƒ…å¯¹ç»æµŽå½±å“ï¼Œå¯¹é˜²æŠ¤ç‰©è´¨ä¾›ç»™ä¸è¶³çš„æ‹…å¿ƒç¨‹åº¦æ˜¯åŽ‹åŠ›çš„å½±å“å› ç´ ã€‚<b>ç»“è®º</b>: ç–«æƒ…æœŸé—´ç»¼åˆåŒ»é™¢ä¸åŒäººç¾¤çš„å¿ƒç†ç‰¹å¾æœ‰å·®å¼‚ï¼Œéœ€æ ¹æ®ä¸åŒäººç¾¤åŠå…¶å·¥ä½œçŠ¶æ€åˆ¶è®¢ç›¸åº”çš„å¿ƒç†é˜²æŠ¤åŠå¹²é¢„æŽªæ–½ã€‚.","Jiang, Liu, Zhao, Xie, Wang, Ouyang, Guo, Gong, Zhou, Li",https://doi.org/10.11817/j.issn.1672-7347.2020.200190,20200909.0,"anxiety; coronavirus disease 2019; depression; different groups of staff; influential factors; stress; Adaptation, Psychological; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; China; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Disease Outbreaks; Hospitals, General; Humans; Pandemics; Personnel, Hospital; Pneumonia, Viral; SARS-CoV-2; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
235,Does coronavirus pose a challenge to the diagnoses of anxiety and depression? A view from psychiatry,"Some authors have suggested that the emergence of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, and the subsequent pandemic has meant that the constructs of pathological anxiety and depression are meaningless owing to widespread anxiety and depressive symptoms. This paper examines what is required to make a diagnosis of a depressive or anxiety disorder and how this may differ from fleeting symptomatology in response to specific situations or stimuli. All people experience the emotions of both anxiety and depression, but far fewer have a persistent anxiety or depressive syndrome which interferes with their quality of life and functioning. The pandemic and its issues are then discussed, and existing studies examining the reactions of people living through the pandemic are presented. Finally, the paper examines possible ways to cope at times of increased stress and how we can try to protect ourselves from long-term mental health sequelae of chronic stress.",Drummond,https://doi.org/10.1192/bjb.2020.102,20201009.0,Anxiety; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; coronavirus; depression,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30

237,,"Since December 2019, 414,179 cases of people with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported. As a result of the rapid increase in confirmed cases and deaths, population and health personnel, have experienced psychological problems, such as anxiety, depression, and stress. Although scientific information on COVID-19 is constantly increasing, it mainly focuses on genetic, epidemiological aspects, and public health measures, leaving aside possible effects on mental health. In order to summarize the current evidence, we present a narrative review of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. So far, the presence of anxiety, depression, and stress has been reported mostly in general population. Nonetheless, mental health issues have also been reported in health care workers, especially among female professionals, nurses, and those who work directly with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19. In efforts to reduce the spread of the disease, attention should be paid to the diagnosis and treatment of mental health issues. We believe that addressing them adequately will empower Peru to contain and eradicate COVID-19.

238,Rapid response to crisis: Health system lessons from the active period of COVID-19,"This paper outlines the need for a health systems approach and rapid response strategy for gathering information necessary for policy decisions during pandemics and similar crises. It suggests a new framework for assessing the phases of the pandemic. The paper draws its information and conclusions from a rapid synthesis and translation process (RSTP) of a series of webinars and online discussions from the Pandemic-Mental Health International Network (Pan-MHIN) - policy experts from across 16 locations in Australia, Denmark, Italy, Spain, Taiwan, the UK and the USA. While the initial focus of this research was on mental health, COVID-19 has raised much broader issues and questions for health planners. We identified gaps affecting the capacity to respond effectively and quickly, including in relation to system indicators, the inadequacy of the prior classification of the phases of the pandemic, the absences of a healthcare ecosystem approach, and the quick shift to digital technologies. The strengths and weaknesses of COVID-19 responses across different systems, services, sites and countries been identified and compared, including both low and high impacted areas. There is an urgent need for managerial epidemiology based on healthcare ecosystem research encompassing multidisciplinary teams, visualization tools and decision analytics for rapid response. Policy and healthcare context played a key role in the response to COVID-19. Its severity, the containment measures and the societal response varied greatly across sites and countries. Understanding this variation is vital to assess the impact of COVID-19 in specific areas such as ageing or mental health.","Salvador-Carulla, Rosenberg, Mendoza, Tabatabaei-Jafari",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hlpt.2020.08.011,20210110.0,COVID-19; Health planning; Health systems research; Information systems,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
239,COVID-19 Racism and Mental Health in Chinese American Families,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has fueled xenophobia against Chinese Americans. We examined the rates of 6 types of COVID-19 racism and racial discrimination experienced by Chinese American parents and youth and the associations with their mental health. We recruited a population-based sample of Chinese American families to participate in this self-reported survey study conducted from March 14, 2020, to May 31, 2020. Eligible parent participants identified as ethnically/racially Chinese, lived in the United States, and had a 4- to 18-year-old child; their eligible children were 10 to 18 years old. The sample included 543 Chinese American parents (mean [SD] age, 43.44 [6.47] years; 425 mothers [78.3%]), and their children (<i>N</i> = 230; mean [SD] age, 13.83 [2.53] years; 111 girls [48.3%]). Nearly half of parents and youth reported being directly targeted by COVID-19 racial discrimination online (parents: 172 [31.7%]; youth: 105 [45.7%]) and/or in person (parents: 276 [50.9%]; youth: 115 [50.2%]). A total of 417 (76.8%) parents and 176 (76.5%) youth reported at least 1 incident of COVID-19 vicarious racial discrimination online and/or in person (parents: 481 [88.5%]; youth: 211 [91.9%]). A total of 267 (49.1%) parents and 164 (71.1%) youth perceived health-related Sinophobia in America, and 274 (50.4%) parents and 129 (56.0%) youth perceived media-perpetuated Sinophobia. Higher levels of parent- and youth-perceived racism and racial discrimination were associated with their poorer mental health.

The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Peritraumatic Dissociative Experience Questionnaire were used. Factors independently associated with reported symptoms of mental health disorders were identified.<b>Measurements and Main Results:</b> The response rate was 67%, with 1,058 respondents (median age 33 yr; 71% women; 68% nursing staff). The prevalence of symptoms of anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic dissociation was 50.4%, 30.4%, and 32%, respectively, with the highest rates in nurses. By multivariable analysis, male sex was independently associated with lower prevalence of symptoms of anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic dissociation (odds ratio of 0.58 [95% confidence interval, 0.42-0.79], 0.57 [95% confidence interval, 0.39-0.82], and 0.49 [95% confidence interval, 0.34-0.72], respectively). HCPs working in non-university-affiliated hospitals and nursing assistants were at high risk of symptoms of anxiety and peritraumatic dissociation. Importantly, we identified the following six modifiable determinants of symptoms of mental health disorders: fear of being infected, inability to rest, inability to care for family, struggling with difficult emotions, regret about the restrictions in visitation policies, and witnessing hasty end-of-life decisions.<b>Conclusions:</b> HCPs experience high levels of psychological burden during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hospitals, ICU directors, and ICU staff must devise strategies to overcome the modifiable determinants of adverse mental illness symptoms.","Azoulay, Cariou, Bruneel, Demoule, Kouatchet, Reuter, Souppart, Combes, Klouche, Argaud, Barbier, Jourdain, Reignier, Papazian, Guidet, GÃ©ri, Resche-Rigon, Guisset, LabbÃ©, MÃ©garbane, Van Der Meersch, Guitton, Friedman, Pochard, Darmon, Kentish-Barnes",https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.202006-2568OC,20201125.0,"ICU; anxiety; coronavirus; depression; pneumonia; Adult; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; Coronavirus Infections; Critical Care; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Female; France; Health Personnel; Humans; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prevalence; SARS-CoV-2; Stress Disorders, Traumatic; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
242,Psychological distress among health care professionals of the three COVID-19 most affected Regions in Cameroon: Prevalence and associated factors,"The present study aimed to assess the prevalence of symptoms of anxiety and depression among health professionals in the three most affected regions in Cameroon. The study was a descriptive cross-sectional type. Participants were health care professionals working in the three chosen regions of Cameroon. The non_probability convinient sample technique and that of the snowball were valued via a web questionnaire. The non-exhaustive sample size was 292. The diagnosis of anxiety and depression was made by the HAD (Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale). The prevalence of symptoms of anxiety ranging from mild to severe and those of depression were 42.20% and 43.50% respectively. Anxiety symptoms were associated with the age of the participants (<i>P</i>Â =Â 0.006), fear of contamination (<i>P</i>Â =Â 0.019), fear of death (<i>P</i>Â =Â 0.000), and depressive symptoms associated to the fear of death (<i>P</i>Â =Â 0.000). Les auteurs rapportent que le secteur mÃ©dical est classÃ© Ã un plus grand risque de contracter le COVID-19Â et de le propager potentiellement Ã dâ€™autres. Le nombre sans cesse croissant de cas confirmÃ©s et suspects, la pression dans les soins, lâ€™Ã©puisement des Ã©quipements de protection individuelle et le manque de mÃ©dicaments spÃ©cifiques peuvent contribuer Ã un vÃ©cu anxio-dÃ©pressif significatif. La prÃ©sente Ã©tude sâ€™est donnÃ©e pour ambition dâ€™Ã©valuer la prÃ©valence des symptÃ´mes de lâ€™anxiÃ©tÃ© et de la dÃ©pression chez les professionnels de santÃ© dans les trois RÃ©gions les plus concernÃ©es au Cameroun. Le choix des trois RÃ©gions du Cameroun se justifie non seulement par le fait quâ€™elles totalisent 95,8Â % des cas de coronavirus au pays depuis le dÃ©but de la pandÃ©mie, mais aussi parce quâ€™elles disposent de plus de la moitiÃ© des personnels de santÃ© (56Â %). Il sâ€™agit dâ€™une Ã©tude transversale, descriptive et analytique. Les participants sont des professionnels de la santÃ© en service dans les RÃ©gions du Centre, Littoral et de lâ€™Ouest du Cameroun. La mÃ©thode dâ€™Ã©chantillonnage non probabiliste de convenance couplÃ©e Ã celle de boule de neige via un web questionnaire a Ã©tÃ© adoptÃ©e. La collecte des donnÃ©es a durÃ© du 5Â au 19Â avril 2020, intervalle de temps aprÃ¨s lequel on nâ€™avait plus eu de rÃ©pondants. Ã€ la fin de cette pÃ©riode, la taille de lâ€™Ã©chantillon non exhaustive Ã©tait de 292Â professionnels. Le diagnostic de lâ€™Ã©tat anxio-dÃ©pressive Ã©tait posÃ© via lâ€™Ã©chelle de HAD (Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale). Dans le HAD, chaque rÃ©ponse cotÃ©e Ã©value de maniÃ¨re semi-quantitative lâ€™intensitÃ© du symptÃ´me au cours de la semaine Ã©coulÃ©e. Un score total est obtenu ainsi que des scores aux deux sous-Ã©chellesÂ : le score maximal est de 42Â pour lâ€™Ã©chelle globale et de 21Â pour chacune des sous-Ã©chelles. Le coefficient alpha de Cronbach est de 0,70Â pour la dÃ©pression et de 0,74Â pour lâ€™anxiÃ©tÃ©. Certains auteurs aprÃ¨s plusieurs travaux ont proposÃ© quâ€™une note infÃ©rieure ou Ã©gale Ã 7Â indique une absence dâ€™anxiÃ©tÃ© ou de dÃ©pressionÂ ; celle comprise entre 8Â et 10Â suggÃ¨re une anxiÃ©tÃ© ou une dÃ©pression faible Ã bÃ©nigneÂ ; entre 11Â et 14, pour une anxiÃ©tÃ© ou une dÃ©pression modÃ©rÃ©eÂ ; enfin, une note comprise entre 15Â et 21Â est rÃ©vÃ©latrice dâ€™une anxiÃ©tÃ© sÃ©vÃ¨re. Le logiciel Excel 2013Â et Epi Info version 7.2.2.6Â ont Ã©tÃ© utilisÃ©s pour les traitements statistiques.

243,"Effects of general and sexual minority-specific COVID-19-related stressors on the mental health of lesbian, gay, and bisexual people in Hong Kong","The impact of COVID-19 on mental health has begun to be widely recognized, but there is an absence of studies on how the mental health of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) people have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 857 LGB people in Hong Kong participated in a community-based survey study. Over one-fourth of them met the criteria for probable clinical depression (31.5%) and generalized anxiety disorder (27.9%). Besides general stressors, we identified sexual minority-specific stressors during the pandemic. 4.2% of the participants indicated that they had frequently experienced family conflict related to sexual orientation. One-third responded that they had largely reduced connection to the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender plus (LGBT+) community (34.7%). The results showed that sexual minority-specific COVID-19-related stressors explained significant variance in depressive and anxiety symptoms, above and beyond the contribution of general COVID-19-related stressors. Since LGB people are particularly vulnerable to poor mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, LGB people-targeting organizations need to understand more about family, space, and privacy concerns in order to provide better support, and LGB safe spaces and shelters may be needed as a policy response.","Suen, Chan, Wong",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113365,20201013.0,"COVID-19; Hong Kong; anxiety; depression; sexual minorities; Adult; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; Bisexuality; COVID-19; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Homosexuality, Female; Homosexuality, Male; Hong Kong; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Psychological Distress; SARS-CoV-2; Sexual Behavior; Sexual and Gender Minorities; Social Stigma; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
244,Sleep quality and mental health in the context of COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown in Morocco,"The lockdown of COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) is associated with several stressful factors that can negatively affect peoples' sleep quality and mental health. We conducted this study to evaluate sleep disorders and psychological impact associated with the spread of the COVID-19 and the lockdown on the Moroccan population. We also aimed to study the effects of respondents' beliefs and attitudes about sleep on sleep disorders, anxiety-related symptoms, and depressive symptoms. We used a questionnaire enclosing respondents' sociodemographic information, five psychological and behavioral tests including Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep (DBAS-16), Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) test. Our results highlighted widespread false beliefs about sleep and the prevalence of sleep disorders, anxiety, and depression-related symptoms within the Moroccan population. Nearly 82.3% of respondents revealed false beliefs about sleep. Furthermore, we confirmed a strong positive correlation between knowledge and attitudes about sleep and the prevalence of sleep disorders, anxiety, and depression-related symptoms. However, we found no significant difference in the prevalence of sleep and psychological disorders, between healthcare workers and other professions workers. Our study revealed a high prevalence of sleep disorders, anxiety, and depressive symptoms in the Moroccan population during the COVID-19 lockdown period. Moreover, false beliefs on sleep understanding were prevalent and were presenting a risk factor leading to sleep disorders, anxiety, and depressive symptoms.","Janati Idrissi, Lamkaddem, Benouajjit, Ben El Bouaazzaoui, El Houari, Alami, Labyad, Chahidi, Benjelloun, Rabhi, Kissani, Zarhbouch, Ouazzani, Kadiri, Alouane, Elbiaze, Boujraf, El Fakir, Souirti",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2020.07.045,20201016.0,"Anxiety; COVID-19; Depressive symptoms; Insomnia; Mental health; Morocco; Sleep knowledge; Sleep quality; Adult; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Morocco; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; SARS-CoV-2; Sleep Wake Disorders; Social Isolation; Surveys and Questionnaires",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30

This is particularly disconcerting regarding children and adolescents, who rely on the ability to play to meet developmental milestones and who require more exercise than adults. Youth populations have been significantly disrupted by school closures and home confinement and are in developmental periods that overlap with the emergence of serious mental illness. Therefore, it is important to consider the mental health consequences for youths, and also explore ways to combat sedentary activity for this vulnerable population.","Mittal, Firth, Kimhy",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaac.2020.08.003,20201119.0,"Adolescent; COVID-19; Child; Coronavirus Infections; Exercise; Humans; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Sedentary Behavior",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30

247,Is the psychological impact of exposure to COVID-19 stronger in adolescents with pre-pandemic maltreatment experiences? A survey of rural Chinese adolescents,"Since the COVID-19 outbreak at the end of 2019, it has evolved into a global pandemic with tremendous mental health impact besides the threats to people's physical health. The aims were to examine whether exposure to COVID-19 predicts elevated levels of anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms and whether pre-pandemic maltreatment experiences exacerbate this impact on mental health in adolescents. The survey was conducted online from February 8 st to February 27th, 2020, and the questionnaires were distributed and retrieved through a web-based platform. This study includes a total of 6196 subjects, aged range from 11 to 18 years old. Several multivariable linear regressions were used to analyse the data. The largest variance in PTSS and anxiety problems was explained by ACEs, with more pre-pandemic maltreatment experiences predicting more PTSS (effect size beta = 0.16âˆ¼0.27), and more anxiety (effect size beta = 0.32âˆ¼0.47). Experienced or subjective fear of exposure to COVID-19 predicted statistically significant variance in PTSS and anxiety, and standardized betas ranged from 0.04 to 0.09. Participants who had adverse childhood experiences and had experienced exposure to COVID-19 showed elevated PTSS. After pre-pandemic maltreatment experiences the impact of exposure to COVID-19 on mental health may be stronger. Scars from the past seem to be vulnerabilities during societal upheaval. We therefore suggest that when exposed to COVID-19 rural adolescents should get prioritized professional family support and mental health counseling in particular when they have experienced family abuse and neglect in childhood, even though such support is more difficult to organize in rural areas.","Guo, Fu, Liu, Zhang, Wang, van IJzendoorn",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2020.104667,20210111.0,"ACEs; Adolescents; Anxiety; Covid-19; Maltreatment; PTSS; Adolescent; Adverse Childhood Experiences; Anxiety; COVID-19; Child; Child Abuse; China; Female; Humans; Linear Models; Male; Pandemics; Psychology, Adolescent; Rural Population; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Surveys and Questionnaires",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
248,The Role of Anxiety and Cortisol in Outcomes of Patients With Covid-19,"The outbreak due to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is n global public health emergency and challenges psychological resilience. The central nervous system, endocrine system, and immune system are complex interacting systems. Cortisol has been implicated as the cause of a wide range of mental and physical health disorders; however, the impact of cortisol on outcomes in patients with COVID-19 is not clear. The current study enrolled patients with COVID-19 (onset of disease within 7 days of the first symptom) to evaluate the serum concentration of cortisol and levels of anxiety and depression using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to investigate a possible relationship between cortisol, depression, and anxiety levels and outcomes of patients with COVID-19. A total of 30 patients with COVID-19 were studied. The levels of cortisol and HADS score in patients who died of Covid-19 were significantly higher in comparison with surviving patients (P&lt;0.017 and P&lt;0.001 respectively). We also found that the HADS score was positively correlated with serum cortisol levels (r= 0.842, P=0.004). Our findings showed that stress and anxiety are associated with patients' outcomes.

249,"Stress, Anxiety, and Depression Levels Among Healthcare Staff During the COVID-19 Epidemic","In the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, medical staff Are in direct contact with the patients and experience high work pressure. Direct contact with the patients could create some psychological problems in this group. Thus, the prevalence of such problems must be investigated in them. The present study aimed to determine the level of stress, anxiety, and depression among the healthcare staff in Zanjan City, Iran, during the COVID-19 epidemic. This descriptive study has a cross-sectional design. The Sample of the study population consisted of 535 Staff healthcare members of Vali-e-Asr Hospital in Zanjan City, Iran. A sample of 200 of medical staff was randomly selected to participate in the present study. The required data were collected using the electronic version of Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS) tool. Descriptive statistics, as well as the inferential statistics (the Pearson correlation coefficient, Spearman correlation coefficient, Phi, and Cramer's correlation tests), were used to analyze the obtained data in SPSS. The mean age of the study participants was 40.60 years. The mean values of depression, anxiety, and stress in study samples were 6.27, 5.38, and 8.41, respectively. There was a significant relation between gender and variables of depression, anxiety, and stress. There was also an inverse relationship between stress and variables of educational level and age (P&lt;0/05). We found that our sample reported a normal degree of Depression, anxiety, and stress. The extent of stress induced by direct contact with patients was higher in female employees. Furthermore, with the increase in the education and age of the employees, their stress level decreased.","Hosseinzadeh-Shanjani, Hajimiri, Rostami, Ramazani, Dadashi",https://doi.org/10.32598/bcn.11.covid19.651.4,20200928.0,Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Medical staff; Stress,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
250,Hâ€³ITâ€³ting the Barriers for Exercising during Social Isolation,"Aerobic exercise is traditionally recommended to improve general health and prevent many non-communicable diseases. However, the measures adopted to control the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak culminated with closing of exercise facilities and fitness centers and, as a primary consequence, impaired aerobic exercise practice. This contributed to an increase in risk factors associated with physical inactivity such as insulin resistance, high blood pressure, low-grade inflammation, weight gain, and mental health problems. The scenario is worrisome, and it is important to propose alternatives for exercise practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interval training (IT) emerges as an exercise mode that might be feasible, low-cost, and potentially safe to be performed in many different places. IT consists of interspersing relative brief bouts of high-intensity exercise with recovery periods and promotes similar or greater health benefits when compared to moderate-intensity continuous exercise. Among the different types of IT, sprint interval training and &quot;Tabata protocols&quot; might be particularly useful during social isolation. These protocols can be controlled and performed without the need of complex equipment and can be adapted to different places, including domestic environments. In this article, we present variations of IT as possible alternatives to cope physical inactivity during COVID-19 pandemics with a focus on its practical applications. The protocols suggested can be performed without the need of specialized equipment or facilities, in a time-efficient manner, and aiming to prevent detraining or even improve physical fitness and general health.","Souza, Coswig, de Lira, Gentil",https://doi.org/10.3390/biology9090245,20201027.0,COVID-19; aerobic exercise; calisthenics; high-intensity interval training; immunity; intermittent exercise,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
251,COVID-19 Impacts Mental Health Outcomes and Ability/Desire to Participate in Research Among Current Research Participants,"This study aimed to examine the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on current research participants' mental health outcomes, ability to adhere to behavioral intervention recommendations, and desire to participate in research. A quantitative/qualitative cross-sectional survey was used among adults currently enrolled in health-related research (Nâ€‰=â€‰250; 85% women;â€‰&gt;â€‰50% currently enrolled in behavioral weight loss intervention). COVID-19 was perceived as a severe threat by most (62.3%). Related to COVID-19, 29.6% of participants reported moderate/severe symptoms of anxiety/depression, and 68.4% reported moderate/severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology, with women more likely to demonstrate moderate/severe anxiety/depression (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.047) and PTSD symptomatology (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.028) relative to men. Those with moderate/severe levels of anxiety/depression (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0154) and distress (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0330) were more likely to report a decreased desire to participate in research. Among those in behavioral interventions, individuals perceiving COVID-19 as a moderate/severe threat or experiencing moderate/severe depression or PTSD symptomatology were 4 to 19 times more likely to report that COVID-19 affected their ability to adhere to behavioral recommendations. Qualitative analysis identified four themes describing COVID-19's impact on research experiences: transition, remote intervention delivery, ability to adhere to program goals, and research participation interest. These data suggest that participants engaged in health-related research perceive COVID-19 as a significant threat, affecting mental health, desire to participate in research, and ability to adhere to intervention recommendations.","Cardel, Manasse, Krukowski, Ross, Shakour, Miller, Lemas, Hong",https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.23016,20201204.0,"Adult; Anxiety; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Research Subjects; SARS-CoV-2; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30

253,[Adaptations of an outpatient Dialectical Behavioral Therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic and consequences of the confinement on patients with borderline personality disorder],"The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the accessibility of psychotherapy for particularly vulnerable patients during the period of confinement in the French-speaking part of Switzerland. We had to adapt our usual therapeutic programs. We illustrate this approach in an outpatient program of dialectical behavioral therapy for patients with borderline personality disorder. Each week the individual therapies took place by videoconference or phone. The skills training group was held individually by videoconference or phone and was supported by an online skills training program. Patients filled out their diary cards online. Intersession contact with the therapist remained available as usual and we could organize team consultation. The aim of this study is to describe how a sample of our patients experienced the period of confinement. We compared the experiences of seven patients suffering from borderline personality disorder during two periods: eight weeks prior to confinement, and during the eight weeks of confinement. We analyzed their daily diary cards (<i>n</i>Â =Â 426) and their weekly frequency of problem behaviors (<i>n</i>Â =Â 69). We performed multilevel analyses to take into account the hierarchical structure of the data and the autocorrelation of observations. The seven patients were predominantly female (85.7Â %) and had an average age of 35.1 (11.5) years. Measurements prior to the start of the pandemic indicated on average severe depression (Beck Depression Inventory, mÂ =Â 30.9 [10.0]) and marked hopelessness (Beck Hopelessness Scale, mÂ =Â 15.0 [5.0]). Analysis of the daily diary cards indicated that the confinement period significantly predicted a decrease in feelings of shame or guilt, fear and tension. At the same time, however, there was an increase in distress. Weekly monitoring of problem behaviors showed a decrease in binge-eating behaviors and a trend towards a decrease in alcohol consumption during confinement. Despite the small number of patients included, two types of repeated measurements indicated convergent results, with some improvements during confinement: a decrease of the feelings of fear, shame or guilt, and tension, and a decrease of the frequency of binge-eating behaviors. The decreased pace of daily social and professional life may explain these improvements. The diminution of the above-mentioned feelings as triggers for addictive and compulsive behaviors may also account for the improvements regarding binge-eating. However, they also experienced an increased distress that may reflect the loneliness experienced during this period. The pre-pandemic development of computerized tools that were already familiar to patients greatly facilitated the necessary adaptations to maintain an intensive therapeutic setting during the confinement. This may partly explain why these patients were able to adjust the challenges of this period.","Salamin, Rossier, Joye, Nolde, Pierrehumbert, Gothuey, Guenot",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2020.08.006,20210217.0,Borderline personality disorder; Confinement; Coronavirus; Dialectical behavior therapies; Pandemic; Psychiatry,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30

257,REMOTE WORKING DURING THE PANDEMIC: A Q&amp;A WITH GILLIAN ISAACS RUSSELL: Questions from the Editor and Editorial Board of the <i>BJP</i>,"In this interview by email, Gillian Isaacs Russell, author of the influential <i>Screen Relations: The Limits of Computer-Mediated Psychoanalysis and Psychotherapy</i>, responds to a set of questions from the <i>BJP</i>. The interview focuses on the impact of remote working during the coronavirus epidemic, starting with the question of whether an effective therapeutic process can occur without physical co-presence. Isaacs Russell shares her immediate thoughts about the virtually overnight changes to our practice that came with the epidemic, and the work of the American Psychoanalytic Association's Covid-19 Advisory Team, on which she sits. Her responses are informed by recent cross-disciplinary and neuropsychological research on the digital age. She considers what happens to free association, evenly suspended attention and reverie when working by phone or online; the loss of the consulting room as a containing physical space for both clinician and patient; the relationship between place and time; and whether (and how) we can maintain a focus on transference and countertransference in the presence of the threat of death. The interview ends with her thoughts on whether we should assume that the landscape of analytic therapy will be permanently altered by Covid-19, and with her hope that general awareness of the impact of trauma on our mental health has been raised.",Isaacs Russell,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjp.12581,20200928.0,COVIDâ€19; PANDEMIC; PRESENCE; PSYCHOANALYSIS; PSYCHOTHERAPY; REMOTE THERAPY; SCREEN RELATIONS; TECHNOLOGY,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
258,"[PSYCOVID-19, psychological support device in the fields of mental health, somatic and medico-social]","In December 2019 the World Health Organization (WHO) recorded the first cases of an infectious disease that appeared in China in November of the same year. Generated by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV2, it is quickly named COVID-19 for COronaVirus Infectious Disease 2019. The spread of this unknown disease will soon have worldwide consequences: the contagiousness of the virus is extremely high and potentially lethal. In France, the population initially reacted with disbelief until the disease reached Europe and the first cases appeared on French territory, at the end of January. A few weeks later, on 16 March 2020, President Macron declared the country &quot;at war&quot; against COVID-19. The next day the population was placed in lockdown. At the present time, the country's activity is at a standstill. Schools, businesses and shops are closed. The French citizens are astounded. They suddenly have to face fear: fear of falling ill or that a close relative may fall ill, fear of being locked up and experiencing restrictions of liberties, fear of economic precariousness. And, above all, fear of uncertainty. In order to prevent the mental consequences of this crisis, psychological support units have been created with urgency at national scale. These units are intended to support the healthcare professionals as well as the patients and more broadly, the general population. The unit responsible for the department of Gironde has been set up quickly, over the weekend of March 21, 2020. The COVIDPSY33 listening unit has thus been created in Bordeaux by the Charles Perrens Hospital with support from the Agence RÃ©gionale de SantÃ© Nouvelle-Aquitaine (ARS). Simultaneously, the PSYCOVID-19 unit was created. This additional unit works in collaboration with the COVIDPSY33 platform and offers psychological assistance to the general population and caregivers in the sectors of Bordeaux Rive Droite, Bordeaux Gare, Rives de Garonne, Rives d'Arcins and Sud Gironde. It thus covers an area equivalent to approximately half of Gironde, the largest department in metropolitan France. In the present interview, Samantha Al Joboory and Florence Monello, psychiatrist and psychologist coordinating PSYCOD-19, present this psychological support unit.","Al Joboory, Monello, Bouchard",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2020.06.008,20200918.0,Coronavirus; Covid-19; Crisis unit; Epidemic; PSYCOVID-19; Pandemic; Psychological support; SARS-CoV2,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
259,"[General sanitary containment during the Coronavirus epidemic: Medico-psychological consequences in general population, caregivers, and subjects suffering previously from mental disorders (Retrospective on the repercussions of lethal mass risks, scientific models of collective confinement, first clinical observations, implementation of countermeasures and innovative therapeutic strategies)]","The situation we are currently experiencing is unprecedented. Declaring a state of health emergency in order to curb a frightening epidemic, the authorities have decreed the home confinement of the majority of the population of our country for several weeks. In a few days, innumerable questions arise for very diverse spaces: epidemiological, immunological, sociological, information scientists, medical, administrative, political, etc. We propose a reflection intended to describe the psychological risks, to clarify the disorders found, and to discuss the means to take care of them in the duration. We base our thinking on a review of the literature confronted with our current clinical experience, including concerning the possibilities of dematerialised medico-psychological monitoring. We recall the collective repercussions of emerging lethal mass risks, and in particular viral infectious agents, before approaching the existing scientific models of collective confinement according to military operations in war zones, polar wintering missions and aerospace conquest. It appears that for the study of a global containment, somewhat studied during previous pandemics, the conceptions of stress reaction and psychodynamic adaptation prove to be relevant. We detail the psychological consequences of confinement on individual mental health and their countermeasures according to three population typologies: general population, population of caregivers on the front line against the epidemic, and population of subjects already suffering from mental illness or seeing their disorders reappear. We also refer to works in social cognitive psychology explaining how, in an anxiety-provoking situation, reasoning can be biased and lead to choices that ultimately prove to be not very rational, in the opinion of those who made them. The current situation in the health sector is favourable in this, as evidenced by the &quot;debate on chloroquine&quot; widely reported in the media and on social networks, opposing conclusions most often decided on the basis of beliefs on contrary to evidence based medicine. The psychological repercussions of confinement appear conditioned by the multiple forms that it can take: voluntary or suffered, more or less prolonged, spent at home or in another place, lived in individual isolation or in a small community, associated other stressors and/or traumatic factors, etc. The home confinement of a population across a country has never been assessed. This experience seems to us to confront our society as a whole with the taboo of death, which is imposed, death more and more evaded as the &quot;Western man&quot; tries to move away from his terrestrial origins. In this sense, psychotraumatic type repercussions are to be prevented. In order to face multiple challenges, the healthcare system has adapted with, in particular, the development of the use of the Internet for the provision of information intended to better experience confinement, or even the generalisation of e-psychotherapy asking as many questions as it provides answers. These intricacies of computer techniques in the area of psychotherapy, techniques with which we had some questioning, became established as quickly as the virus: the task of clinicians and researchers to measure the issues and the consequences. Public health programs could emerge on the model of those already existing in order to manage well-known chronic endemic disorders: protection against the effects of an unbalanced diet associated with a sedentary lifestyle, fight against smoking and alcoholism, prevention of self-aggressive behaviour, etc. We will also need to support the caregivers who have been on the front line and who will emerge tested from this pandemic: depending on the sustainability of the action capacities of our healthcare system to return to its nominal state and also perhaps, so that it can face consequences resulting from other crises, especially social ones.","AuxÃ©mÃ©ry, Tarquinio",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2020.06.001,20200918.0,Confinement; Coronavirus; Epidemiology; Online psychotherapy; Psychopathology; Reaction to stress; Sociopathology,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30

Kessler psychological distress scale (<i>K</i>10) was used to evaluate stress symptoms. This study first conducted an online focus group discussion (OFGD) with the target population to develop the scale of &quot;e-Learning crack-up&quot; and &quot;fear of academic year loss&quot;. Afterward, a questionnaire was developed based on OFGD findings. An online survey was conducted amongst college students in Bangladesh using a purposive sampling technique. Results show that &quot;e-Learning crack-up&quot; perception has a significant positive impact on student's psychological distress, and fear of academic year loss is the crucial factor that is responsible for psychological distress during COVID-19 lockdown. This study can provide an understanding of how &quot;e-Learning crack-up&quot; and &quot;Fear of academic year loss&quot; influence college students' mental health.

The outbreak has been continuing to heavily impact the mental health of people. Developing key strategies to prevent mental illnesses is extremely important for the well-being of people. A survey conducted during the last week of March 2020 showed that 72% of Americans felt that their lives were impacted by the outbreak, which was a 32% increase from the survey conducted only 2Â weeks earlier. The results show a positive correlation between COVID-19 infections/casualties and growing public concern. These observations suggest possible increase in mental health illnesses in United States as a consequence of the pandemic. The authors review a recently published model on COVID-19 related fear among the people. The fear of being infected or dying from the disease is one of the most significant causes of mental health disorders. Loss of employment or the fear of losing employment is another major concern leading to mental illnesses. Several unique strategies to prevent or mitigate mental illnesses are discussed.","Bhattacharjee, Acharya",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11126-020-09836-0,20201105.0,"Anxiety disorder; COVID-19; Mental health; Pandemic; Prevention strategies; Adaptation, Psychological; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; Coronavirus Infections; Employment; Fear; Humans; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; SARS-CoV-2; United States",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
263,Mental health amongst obstetrics and gynaecology doctors during the COVID-19 pandemic: Results of a UK-wide study,"To explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. A cross-section survey-based study amongst doctors working within Obstetrics and Gynaecology in the United Kingdom. A total of 207 doctors completed the survey. Obstetricians and Gynaecologists reported significantly higher rates of both Major Depressive Disorder (versus, p = 0.023) and Generalised Anxiety Disorder (versus, p = 0.044) as compared to the UK-wide estimates. Sub-group analysis showed that anxiety was more common amongst female doctors as compared to males (versus, p = 0.047). Although the prevalence of GAD was higher amongst registrars compared to their Consultant and/or Senior House Officer counterparts, this was not statistically significant. Respondents felt that the most significant factor for work-related changes to mental health was keeping up to date with frequently changing guidelines and protocols related to COVID-19. Only of respondents felt able to talk to colleagues about their mental health. Key findings include the high prevalence of mental health conditions amongst doctors, demonstration of the persistent taboo that mental health carries within the speciality and the key contributory factors to poor mental health. Further work should be done to assess if changes to the way new and updating guidelines, protocols and pathways are disseminated reduces the impact on the mental health of doctors. With the threat of a second COVID-19 peak looming, now more than ever, it is vital that steps are taken to break the stigmatisation of mental health amongst doctors, encouraging doctors to seek help when required.","Shah, Raheem, Sideris, Velauthar, Saeed",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejogrb.2020.07.060,20200929.0,"Education and training; Gynaecology; Mental health; Obstetrics; Adult; Anxiety Disorders; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depressive Disorder, Major; Female; Gynecology; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Middle Aged; Obstetrics; Occupational Diseases; Pandemics; Physicians; Pneumonia, Viral; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires; United Kingdom",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
264,"Public Behavior Change, Perceptions, Depression, and Anxiety in Relation to the COVID-19 Outbreak","COVID-19 has spread rapidly and internationally, which has elicited public panic and psychological problems. Public protective behaviors and perception play crucial roles in controlling the spread of illness and psychological status. We conducted a cross-sectional online survey in the hardest-hit Hubei province and other areas in China affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. Questions about their basic information, the perception of the COVID-19 outbreak, recent preventive or avoidance behaviors, and self-reported mental health scales including the Patient Health Questionnaire and Self-Rating Anxiety Scale were included. Binary logistic regressions were used to investigate the association between personal variables/perceptions and psychological distress. A total of 6261 people were included in the analysis, with 3613 (57.7%) in Hubei province (1743 in Wuhan). The majority of people have adopted preventive and avoidance behaviors. People from Hubei, with contact history, and people who were infected or whose family members were infected had a much higher prevalence of depression and anxiety. Providing truthful and sufficient information, informing the public about the severity of the disease, and perceptions that the outbreak can be controlled by protective behaviors were associated with lower prevalence of depression and anxiety. Assessing the public response, perception, and psychological burden during the outbreak may help improve public health recommendations and deliver timely psychological intervention. Further research may focus on the psychological status of a specialized group to identify methods of delivery of better support based on public response and psychological demand.","Huang, Liu, Teng, Chen, Zhao, Wang, Wu, Xiao, Wang, Wu",https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa273,20200928.0,COVID-19; anxiety; depression; perceptions; public behavior change,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
265,The social underpinnings of mental distress in the time of COVID-19 - time for urgent action,"We argue that predictions of a 'tsunami' of mental health problems as a consequence of the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the lockdown are overstated; feelings of anxiety and sadness are entirely normal reactions to difficult circumstances, not symptoms of poor mental health.Â Some people will need specialised mental health support, especially those already leading tough lives; we need immediate reversal of years of underfunding of community mental health services.Â However, the disproportionate effects of COVID-19 on the most disadvantaged, especially BAME people placed at risk by their social and economic conditions, were entirely predictable. Mental health is best ensured by urgently rebuilding the social and economic supports stripped away over the last decade. Governments must pump funds into local authorities to rebuild community services, peer support, mutual aid and local community and voluntary sector organisations.Â Health care organisations must tackle racism and discrimination to ensure genuine equal access to universal health care.Â Government must replace highly conditional benefit systems by something like a universal basic income. All economic and social policies must be subjected to a legally binding mental health audit.Â This may sound unfeasibly expensive, but the social and economic costs, not to mention the costs in personal and community suffering, though often invisible, are far greater.","Rose, Manning, Bentall, Bhui, Burgess, Carr, Cornish, Devakumar, Dowd, Ecks, Faulkner, Ruck Keene, Kirkbride, Knapp, Lovell, Martin, Moncrieff, Parr, Pickersgill, Richardson, Sheard",https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16123.1,20200928.0,BAME; Mental distress; benefit system reform; social disadvantage; universal basic income,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
266,Effect of Common Medications on the Expression of SARS-CoV-2 Entry Receptors in Kidney Tissue,"Besides the respiratory system, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was shown to affect other essential organs such as the kidneys. Early kidney involvement during the course of infection was associated with worse outcomes, which could be attributed to the direct SARS-CoV-2 infection of kidney cells. In this study, the effect of commonly used medications on the expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)2, and TMPRSS2 protein in kidney tissues was evaluated. This was done by in silico analyses of publicly available transcriptomic databases of kidney tissues of rats treated with multiple doses of commonly used medications. Of 59 tested medications, 56% modified ACE2 expression, whereas 24% modified TMPRSS2 expression. ACE2 was increased with only a few of the tested medication groups, namely the renin-angiotensin inhibitors, such as enalapril, antibacterial agents, such as nitrofurantoin, and the proton pump inhibitor, omeprazole. The majority of the other medications decreased ACE2 expression to variable degrees with allopurinol and cisplatin causing the most noticeable downregulation. The expression level of TMPRSS2 was increased with a number of medications, such as diclofenac, furosemide, and dexamethasone, whereas other medications, such as allopurinol, suppressed the expression of this gene. The prolonged exposure to combinations of these medications could regulate the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in a way that may affect kidney susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data presented here suggest that we should be vigilant about the potential effects of commonly used medications on kidney tissue expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2.","Saheb Sharif-Askari, Saheb Sharif-Askari, Alabed, Tayoun, Loney, Uddin, Senok, Al Heialy, Hamoudi, Kashour, Alsheikh-Ali, Hamid, Halwani",https://doi.org/10.1111/cts.12862,20201222.0,"Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2; Animals; COVID-19; Gene Expression Regulation; Kidney; Rats; Receptors, Coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2; Serine Endopeptidases",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30

To better understand and to document these impacts, we contacted anaesthesia trainees and trainers across six continents and collated their experiences during the pandemic. All aspects of training programmes have been affected. Trainees report that reduced caseload, sub-specialty experience, and supervised procedures are impairing learning. Cancelled educational activities, postponed examinations, and altered rotations threaten progression through training. Job prospects and international opportunities are downgraded. Work-related anxieties about provision of personal protective equipment, and risks to self and to colleagues are superimposed on concerns for family and friends and domestic disruption. These seismic changes have had consequences for well-being and mental health. In response, anaesthetists have developed innovations in teaching and trainee support. New technologies support trainer-trainee interactions, with a focus on e-learning. National training bodies and medical regulators that specify training and oversee assessment of trainees and their progression have provided flexibility in their requirements. Within anaesthesia departments, support transcends grades and job titles with lessons for the future.

268,Prevalence and associated factors of poor sleep quality among Chinese returning workers during the COVID-19 pandemic,"The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is a severe global crisis which has resulted in many public health problems. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of poor sleep quality and its related factors among employees who returned to work during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our online cross-sectional study included 2,410 participants aged â‰¥17 years in Deqing and Taizhou, Zhejiang Province, China from 5th to 14th March 2020. The questionnaire covered information on demographic characteristics, health status, workplace, lifestyle, attitude towards COVID-19, assessment of anxiety, depression and sleep quality. The Chinese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (CPSQI) was administered to measure the poor sleep quality. Poor sleep quality was defined as a global PSQI score&gt;5. Factors associated with sleep quality were analyzed by logistic regression models. In sum near half (49.2%) of 2,410 returning workers were females and the average year of subjects was 36.3Â Â±Â 9.1 years. The overall prevalence of poor sleep quality was 14.9% (95%CI: 13.5%-16.3%). The average score of PSQI was 3.0Â Â±Â 2.5 and average sleep duration was 7.6Â Â±Â 1.2Â h. Independent related factors of poor sleep quality included age older than 24 years, higher education level, negative attitude towards COVID-19 control measures, anxiety and depression. Poor sleep quality was common and there was a shorter sleep duration among returning workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Possible risk factors identified from this study may be of great importance in developing proper intervention for the targeted population to improve the sleep health during the COVID-19 public health emergency.","Yang, Zhu, Yang, Lin, Chen, Zhao, Fu",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2020.06.034,20200925.0,"COVID-19; China; Occupational population; Pittsburgh sleep quality index; Poor sleep quality; Adolescent; Adult; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; China; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prevalence; SARS-CoV-2; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders; Surveys and Questionnaires; Workplace; Young Adult",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
269,COVID-19 lockdown in people with severe mental disorders in Spain: Do they have a specific psychological reaction compared with other mental disorders and healthy controls?,"The COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown restrictions could have adverse consequences for patients with severe mental disorders (SMD). Here, we aim to compare the early psychological impact (depression, anxiety, and stress responses, intrusive and avoidant thoughts, and coping strategies) on people with SMD (nâ€¯=â€¯125) compared with two control groups: common mental disorders (CMD, nâ€¯=â€¯250) and healthy controls (HC, nâ€¯=â€¯250). An anonymous online questionnaire using a snowball sampling method was conducted from March 19-26, 2020 and included sociodemographic and clinical data along with the DASS-21 and IES scales. We performed descriptive and bivariate analyses and multinomial and linear regression models. People with SMD had higher anxiety, stress, and depression responses than HC, but lower scores than CMD in all domains. Most people with SMD (87.2%) were able to enjoy free time, although control groups had higher percentages. After controlling for confounding factors, anxiety was the only significant psychological domain with lower scores in HC than people with SMD (ORâ€¯=â€¯0.721; 95% CI: 0.579-0.898). In the SMD group, higher anxiety was associated with being single (betaâ€¯=â€¯0.144), having COVID-19 symptoms (betaâ€¯=â€¯0.146), and a higher score on the stress subscale of DASS-21 (betaâ€¯=â€¯0.538); whereas being able to enjoy free time was a protective factor (betaâ€¯=â€¯-0.244). Our results showed that patients with SMD reacted to the pandemic and the lockdown restrictions with higher anxiety levels than the general public, and suggesting this domain could be a criterion for early intervention strategies and closer follow-up.","GonzÃ¡lez-Blanco, Dal Santo, GarcÃ­a-Ãlvarez, de la Fuente-TomÃ¡s, Moya Lacasa, Paniagua, SÃ¡iz, GarcÃ­a-Portilla, Bobes",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.schres.2020.07.018,20201211.0,"Anxiety; Bipolar disorder; COVID-19; Pandemics; Psychological distress; Psychosis; Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Anxiety; Anxiety Disorders; Avoidance Learning; Bipolar Disorder; COVID-19; Case-Control Studies; Communicable Disease Control; Depression; Depressive Disorder; Employment; Family; Female; Humans; Income; Linear Models; Male; Marital Status; Mental Disorders; Middle Aged; Protective Factors; Psychological Distress; Psychotic Disorders; Risk Factors; Spain; Stress, Psychological",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
270,Surgical Education in the Time of COVID: Understanding the Early Response of Surgical Training Programs to the Novel Coronavirus Pandemic,"Describe the early impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on general surgery residency training nationwide. A 31-question electronic survey was distributed to general surgery program directors. Qualitative data underwent iterative coding analysis. Quantitative data were evaluated with summary statistics and bivariate analyses. Eighty-four residency programs (33.6% response rate) with representation across US geographic regions, program affiliations, and sizes. Widespread changes were observed in the surgical training environment. One hundred percent of programs reduced the number of residents on rounds and 95.2% reduced the size of their in-hospital resident workforce; on average, daytime staffing decreased by nearly half. With telehealth clinics (90.5%) and remote inpatient consults (26.2%), both clinical care and resident didactics (86.9%) were increasingly virtual, with similar impact across all program demographics. Conversely, availability of some wellness initiatives was significantly higher among university programs than independent programs, including childcare (51.2% vs 6.7%), housing (41.9% vs 13.3%), and virtual mental health services (83.7% vs 53.3%). Changes in clinical care delivery dramatically reduced in face-to-face learning opportunities for surgical trainees during the COVID-19 pandemic. While this effect had equal impact across all program types, sizes, and geographies, the same cannot be said for wellness initiatives. Though all programs initiated some strategies to protect resident health, the disparity between university programs and independent programs may be cause for action.","White, Shaughnessy, Esposito, Slade, Korah, Yoo",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsurg.2020.07.036,20210305.0,"COVID-19; coronavirus; general surgery; graduate medical education; resident wellness; virtual education; COVID-19; Education, Medical, Graduate; General Surgery; Humans; Internship and Residency; Pandemics; Personnel Staffing and Scheduling; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires; United States",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
271,Immunopsychiatry and SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: Links and possible consequences,"Objectif La pandémie de SARS-CoV-2 (ou COVID-19) se propage depuis décembre 2019, et a été, comme attendu, accompagnée d’une augmentation drastique de la prévalence des troubles anxieux et dépressifs dans la population générale. Les traumatismes psychologiques peuvent bien sûr, expliquer une partie de ces troubles. Cependant, dans la mesure où les troubles psychiatriques sont également associés à une composante immuno-inflammatoire, les effets directs du virus sur le système immunitaire de l’hôte, avec une réponse inflammatoire marquée, mais également l’inflammation secondaire à ces facteurs de stress psychosociaux, peuvent entraîner l’apparition ou l’aggravation de pathologies psychiatriques. Cet article vise donc à identifier les possibles conséquences immuno-psychiatriques de la pandémie de SARS-CoV-2 qui pourraient être utiles en termes de dépistage et/ou de prise en charge. Méthode Nous nous sommes appuyés sur les données issues des précédentes pandémies et les données existantes à ce jour sur les conséquences psychopathologiques de la pandémie de SARS-CoV-2, pour réaliser une revue de la littérature narrative sur les possibles conséquences immuno-psychiatriques de la pandémie de SARS-CoV-2. Nous avons ciblé l’environnement gestationnel en raison des risques de troubles neuro-développementaux pour le fœtus, d’une part, et les enfants et adultes directement infectés avec les risques de développer des troubles psychiatriques, d’autre part. Résultats Comme durant les précédentes pandémies, l’activation du système immunitaire due au stress et/ou à l’infection pendant la grossesse pourrait conduire à un risque accru de troubles du neuro-développement chez le fœtus (schizophrénie et troubles du spectre de l’autisme). De plus, chez les individus exposés à des traumatismes psychologiques et/ou infectés par le virus, le risque de troubles psychiatriques, notamment de troubles de l’humeur, est probable. Conclusion Dans ce contexte, des mesures de dépistage et de prise en charge dédiées sont indispensables. Il est, de fait, important de proposer aux individus ayant été infectés par le virus, un suivi rapproché afin de mettre en place une prise en charge la plus précoce possible. De même chez les femmes enceintes, le dépistage de troubles de l’humeur pendant la grossesse ou en post-partum doit être facilité. Le suivi des bébés nés pendant la période pandémique doit être renforcé afin de dépister et de prendre en charge d’éventuels troubles du neuro-développement. Objective The SARS-CoV-2 (or COVID-19) pandemic has been propagating since December 2019, inducing a drastic increase in the prevalence of anxious and depressive disorders in the general population. Psychological trauma can partly explain these disorders. However, since psychiatric disorders also have an immuno-inflammatory component, the direct effects of the virus on the host's immune system, with a marked inflammatory response, but also the secondary inflammation to these psychosocial stressors, may cause the apparition or the worsening of psychiatric disorders. We describe here the probable immunopsychiatric consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, to delineate possible screening actions and care that could be planned. Method Data from previous pandemics, and existing data on the psychopathological consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, allowed us to review the possible immunopsychiatric consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, on the gestational environment, with the risk of consecutive neurodevelopmental disorders for the fetus on one hand, on the children and adults directly infected being at increased risks of psychiatric disorders on the other hand. Results As in previous pandemics, the activation of the immune system due to psychological stress and/or to infection during pregnancy, might lead to an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders for the fetus (schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders). Furthermore, in individuals exposed to psychological trauma and/or infected by the virus, the risk of psychiatric disorders, especially mood disorders, is probably increased. Conclusion In this context, preventive measures and specialized care are necessary. Thus, it is important to propose a close follow-up to the individuals who have been infected by the virus, in order to set up the earliest care possible. Likewise, in pregnant women, screening of mood disorders during the pregnancy or the postpartum period must be facilitated. The follow-up of the babies born during the pandemic must be strengthened to screen and care for possible neurodevelopmental disorders.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.07.002,20210401.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
272,NO<inf>2</inf> levels as a contributing factor to COVID-19 deaths: The first empirical estimate of threshold values,"This study represents the first empirical estimation of threshold values between nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations and COVID-19-related deaths in France. The concentration of NO2 linked to COVID-19-related deaths in three major French cities were determined using Artificial Neural Networks experiments and a Causal Direction from Dependency (D2C) algorithm. The aim of the study was to evaluate the potential effects of NO2 in spreading the epidemic. The underlying hypothesis is that NO2, as a precursor to secondary particulate matter formation, can foster COVID-19 and make the respiratory system more susceptible to this infection. Three different neural networks for the cities of Paris, Lyon and Marseille were built in this work, followed by the application of an innovative tool of cutting the signal from the inputs to the selected target. The results show that the threshold levels of NO2 connected to COVID-19 range between 15.8 µg/m3 for Lyon, 21.8 µg/m3 for Marseille and 22.9 µg/m3 for Paris, which were significantly lower than the average annual concentration limit of 40 µg/m³ imposed by Directive 2008/50/EC of the European Parliament.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.110663,20210301.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30

274,Anxiety and Depression Associated with the Management of COVID-19 Among Healthcare workers in Cameroon,"Objectif La pandémie de la COVID-19 a eu un retentissement important dans le monde, à différents niveaux. La littérature consultée indique que les travailleurs de santé, en première ligne de la riposte, sont généralement ceux qui paient le plus lourd tribu. La présente étude évalue l’importance des symptomatologies anxieuse et dépressive chez ces acteurs de la riposte à la COVID-19, dans le contexte du Cameroun. Méthode La Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) a été mise à contribution pour évaluer les symptomatologies anxieuse et dépressive. La collecte des données a eu recours à la construction d’un web questionnaire sur la plateforme Google Forms. Le lien du questionnaire a été envoyé à des groupes professionnels dans les 10 Régions du pays, au préalable de leur consentement éclairé. Au total, 331 professionnels de santé ont été interrogés sur la période du 05 au 19 avril 2020. Résultats Les résultats montrent un taux important d’anxiété (41,8 %) et de dépression (42,8 %). On observe une plus forte susceptibilité à la dépression chez les sujets jeunes (30-39 ans). La peur de la contamination et la peur de la mort sont des facteurs modulateurs de la dépression et de l’anxiété. La comorbidité anxiété-dépression dans l’échantillon est de 14,73 %. Les taux de prévalence du trouble dépressif majeur et du trouble de l’adaptation dans l’échantillon sont respectivement de 8,2 % et 3,3 %. Les données présentées confirment les tendances enregistrées dans la littérature, concernant l’impact des épidémies mortelles sur la santé mentale des travailleurs de santé. Discussion Les résultats indiquent, comme c’est le cas dans la plupart des travaux consultés dans la littérature, que la pandémie de la Covid 19 affecte de manière importante la santé mentale des travailleurs de santé. Ceci souligne l’urgence de mettre en place un dispositif d’aide et/ou d’accompagnement spécialisé, dans le contexte de l’actuelle pandémie, comme celui des crises sanitaires de même nature. Un tel dispositif n’existe pas au Cameroun, où la réponse de santé mentale reste faible. Conclusion Ces résultats suggèrent que les personnels de santé engagés dans la riposte contre la COVID-19 au Cameroun sont affectés de manière significative dans leur santé mentale. Ce qui souligne la nécessité d’une aide psychologique spécialisée pour le personnel soignant. Objective The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact worldwide, at different levels. The literature consulted indicates that healthcare workers, who are the first to respond, are generally the ones who pay the highest price. The present study assesses the extent of anxious and depressive symptoms among these actors responding to COVID-19, in the context of Cameroon. Method The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to assess anxious and depressive symptoms. Data collection involved the use of a web questionnaire for this purpose through the Google Forms virtual platform. The questionnaire link was sent to professional groups spread throughout Cameroon's ten regions. A total of 331 health professionals were interviewed over the period from April 5 to 19, 2020. Result The results show a high rate of anxiety (41.8%) and depression (42.8%). There is a higher susceptibility to depression in young people (30-39 years). Fear of contamination and fear of death are modulators of depression and anxiety. The anxiety-depression comorbidity in the sample is 14.73%. The prevalence rates of major depressive disorder and adjustment disorder in the sample were 8.2% and 3.3%, respectively. The data presented confirm the trends recorded in the literature regarding the impact of fatal epidemics on the mental health of healthcare workers. Discussion The results indicate, as is the case with most of the work consulted in the literature, that the Covid 19 pandemic is significantly affecting the mental health of healthcare workers. This underlines the urgency of setting up a specialized aid and/or support system, in the context of the current pandemic, such as that of similar health crises. Such a device does not exist in Cameroon, where the mental health response remains weak. Conclusion These results suggest that the healthcare staff involved in the response to COVID-19 in Cameroon are significantly affected in their mental health. This underlines the need for specialized psychological help for nursing staff.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.evopsy.2020.11.002,20210301.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30

276,Psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with allergic diseases,"Background On March 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic disease. Interactions between allergy-related inflammatory and psychiatric disorders including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been documented. Therefore, those who have pre-existing allergic conditions may have an increased psychiatric reaction to the stresses of the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective Identify the psychological impact of COVID-19 in patients with allergic diseases and determine if these individuals have a greater risk of presenting with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Methods It is a cross-sectional, survey-based study designed to assess the degree of symptoms of depression and the risk of PTSD using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Impact of Event Scale–Revised (IES-R), respectively, in allergic patients. Results A total of 4106 surveys were evaluated; 1656 (40.3%) were patients with allergic disease, and 2450 (59.7%) were non-allergic (control) individuals. Of those with allergies, 76.6% had respiratory allergic disease including asthma and allergic rhinitis. Individuals with allergic disease reported higher scores regarding symptoms of PTSD on the IES-R scale (p = 0.052, OR 1.24 CI 0.99–1.55) as well as a higher depression risk score in the PHQ-9 questionnaire (mean 6.82 vs. 5.28) p = 0.000 z = -8.76. The allergy group presented a higher score in the IES-R questionnaire (mean 25.42 vs. 20.59), being more susceptible to presenting PTSD (p = 0.000, z = -7.774). The individuals with allergic conditions were further divided into subgroups of those with respiratory allergies such as allergic rhinitis and asthma vs those with non-respiratory allergies such as drug and food allergy, urticaria and atopic dermatitis. This subgroup analysis compares respiratory versus non-respiratory allergic patients, with similar results on the IES-R (mean 25.87 vs 23.9) p = 0.0124, z = -1.539. There was no significant difference on intrusion (p = 0.061, z = -1.873) and avoidance (p = 0.767, z = -0.297), but in the hyperarousal subscale, patients with respiratory allergy had higher scores (mean 1.15 vs. 0.99) p = 0.013 z = -2.486. Conclusions Psychological consequences such as depression and reported PTSD are present during the COVID-19 pandemic causing an impact particularly in individuals with allergic diseases. If we acknowledge the impact and how it is affecting our patients, we are able to implement interventions, follow up, and contribute to their overall well-being.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.waojou.2021.100510,20210301.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30

278,Confinement variables by COVID-19 predictors of anxious and depressive symptoms in pregnant women,"Antecedentes y objetivos La aparición de una enfermedad altamente contagiosa obligó a confinar a la población en casi todo el mundo, ocasionando el aumento de problemática psicológica, siendo las mujeres embarazadas un grupo especialmente vulnerable a sufrir consecuencias negativas. El objetivo de esta investigación fue comprobar qué variables de confinamiento o estrés psicológico están relacionadas con el aumento de la sintomatología ansiosa y depresiva en mujeres embarazadas, como consecuencia de la pandemia ocasionada por la COVID-19. Materiales y métodos La muestra estuvo compuesta por 131 mujeres embarazadas que vivieron el confinamiento impuesto por el Gobierno de España el 14 de marzo de 2020. Se recogieron variables sociodemográficas, obstétricas, relacionadas con el confinamiento y variables psicológicas. Resultados El estrés percibido, estrés específico del embarazo, así como el insomnio son variables predictoras en la mayoría de síntomas ansiosos (obsesiones y compulsiones, ansiedad y ansiedad fóbica) y depresivos relacionados con la COVID-19. Conclusiones Es importante destinar futuras intervenciones psicológicas en esta población al control del estrés y monitorización del sueño, ya que estas variables influyen en el incremento de ansiedad y depresión. Background and objectives The appearance of a highly contagious disease forced the confinement of the population in almost all parts of the world, causing an increase in psychological problems, with pregnant women being a particularly vulnerable group to suffer negative consequences. The aim of this research was to check which confinement or psychological stress variables are related to the increase of anxious and depressive symptoms in pregnant women, as a consequence of the pandemic caused by the COVID-19. Materials and methods The sample was composed of 131 pregnant women who experienced the confinement imposed by the Government of Spain on March 14, 2020. Sociodemographic, obstetric, confinement related and psychological variables were collected. Results Perceived stress, pregnancy-specific stress, as well as insomnia are predictive variables in most anxious (obsessions and compulsions, anxiety and phobic anxiety) and depressive symptoms related to COVID-19.

281,Adaptations of an outpatient Dialectical Behavioral Therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic and consequences of the confinement on patients with borderline personality disorder,"Objectif La pandémie due à la COVID-19 a impacté l’accessibilité à la psychothérapie pour des patients particulièrement vulnérables pendant la période de confinement. Nous présentons les adaptations d’un programme de thérapie comportementale dialectique et les conséquences du confinement sur le vécu de patients souffrant d’un trouble de personnalité borderline. Méthode Nous avons, pour sept patients, comparé deux périodes de huit semaines, avant et pendant le confinement. Nous avons analysé leurs cartes journalières (n =426) et le recensement hebdomadaire de la fréquence de leurs comportements problèmes (n =69). Résultats L’analyse des cartes journalières indique que la période de confinement prédit une diminution significative des sentiments de peur, de honte ou culpabilité et de tension mais une augmentation de la détresse. Le suivi hebdomadaire montre une diminution significative des comportements hyperphagiques. Discussion Malgré le petit nombre de patients inclus, cette étude se base sur des échantillonnages d’expérience au quotidien et des mesures hebdomadaires. Ces deux types de mesures répétées indiquent certaines améliorations pendant le confinement, attestant des capacités d’adaptation de ces patients, soutenus par un cadre thérapeutique intensif qui a été maintenu. Background The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the accessibility of psychotherapy for particularly vulnerable patients during the period of confinement in the French-speaking part of Switzerland. We had to adapt our usual therapeutic programs. We illustrate this approach in an outpatient program of dialectical behavioral therapy for patients with borderline personality disorder. Each week the individual therapies took place by videoconference or phone. The skills training group was held individually by videoconference or phone and was supported by an online skills training program. Patients filled out their diary cards online. Intersession contact with the therapist remained available as usual and we could organize team consultation. The aim of this study is to describe how a sample of our patients experienced the period of confinement. Method We compared the experiences of seven patients suffering from borderline personality disorder during two periods: eight weeks prior to confinement, and during the eight weeks of confinement. We analyzed their daily diary cards (n =426) and their weekly frequency of problem behaviors (n =69). We performed multilevel analyses to take into account the hierarchical structure of the data and the autocorrelation of observations. Results The seven patients were predominantly female (85.7 %) and had an average age of 35.1 (11.5) years. Measurements prior to the start of the pandemic indicated on average severe depression (Beck Depression Inventory, m=30.9 [10.0]) and marked hopelessness (Beck Hopelessness Scale, m=15.0 [5.0]). Analysis of the daily diary cards indicated that the confinement period significantly predicted a decrease in feelings of shame or guilt, fear and tension. At the same time, however, there was an increase in distress. Weekly monitoring of problem behaviors showed a decrease in binge-eating behaviors and a trend towards a decrease in alcohol consumption during confinement. Conclusions Despite the small number of patients included, two types of repeated measurements indicated convergent results, with some improvements during confinement: a decrease of the feelings of fear, shame or guilt, and tension, and a decrease of the frequency of binge-eating behaviors. The decreased pace of daily social and professional life may explain these improvements. The diminution of the above-mentioned feelings as triggers for addictive and compulsive behaviors may also account for the improvements regarding binge-eating. However, they also experienced an increased distress that may reflect the loneliness experienced during this period. The pre-pandemic development of computerized tools that were already familiar to patients greatly facilitated the necessary adaptations to maintain an intensive therapeutic setting during the confinement. This may partly explain why these patients were able to adjust the challenges of this period.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2020.08.006,20210201.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30

284,Prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in the pediatric population from the family and community perspective,"Partiendo del informe sobre la situación de la COVID-19 en España, del 3 de abril del 2020, los casos confirmados ascienden a 117.710, de los que 343 tienen una edad inferior a 14 años (< 1%). Es fundamental conocer la especificidad de este proceso en la población infantil, así como las recomendaciones específicas para una adecuada prevención y cuidado de los niños durante la pandemia por la COVID-19. Este artículo tiene como objetivo analizar la evidencia científica sobre las recomendaciones específicas para la atención pediátrica en casos de COVID-19 desde el ámbito familiar y comunitario. Se han seleccionado y analizado las principales recomendaciones y medidas preventivas en los entornos de Atención Primaria de salud y el domicilio desde un enfoque integrador dónde se incluyen los aspectos biopsicosociales del niño durante el confinamiento. La importancia de los cuidados de la infancia frente a la enfermedad radican sobre todo en asegurar las correctas medidas de prevención del contagio por la condición de actuar como posibles portadores durante un período de incubación de hasta 21 días. La recomendación es que los niños participen activamente en las acciones preventivas habituales para la contención de la expansión de la enfermedad. A nivel domiciliario, el aislamiento supone un importante reto para las familias donde se presentan manifestaciones de incertidumbre, miedo e indefensión ante los cambios y entre las recomendaciones se encuentran establecer rutinas orden mediante horarios de actividades y ocio unido a las medidas de higiene. Dada la rapidez con la que se ha producido la pandemia por SARS-CoV-2, existen pocas evidencias del impacto en niños en España por el momento. Es necesario desarrollar estudios específicos sobre prevención y tratamiento en la edad pediátrica para mejorar las recomendaciones disponibles. Based on the report on the situation of COVID-19 in Spain, dated April 3, 2020, the confirmed cases amount to 117,710, of which 343 are under 14 years of age (< 1%). It is essential to know the specificity of this process in the child population, as well the specific recommendations for proper prevention and care of children during the COVID-19 pandemic. The paper aim is to analyze the scientific evidence on the specific recommendations for pediatric care in cases of COVID-19 from the family and community settings. The main recommendations and preventive measures in primary health care settings and at home have been selected and analyzed from an integrative approach that includes the biopsychosocial aspects of the child during confinement. The importance of caring for children in the face of the disease lies above all in ensuring the correct measures for the prevention of contagion due to the condition of acting as possible carriers during an incubation period of up to 21 days. The recommendation is that children actively participate in routine preventive actions to contain the spread of the disease. At the household level, isolation is an important challenge for families where there are manifestations of uncertainty, fear and helplessness in the face of changes and among the recommendations are establishing routines and order through schedules of activities and leisure together with hygiene measures.

285,Smartphone Screen Time: Inaccuracy of self-reports and influence of psychological and contextual factors,"Previous research investigating associations between screen time and various undesirable consequences (e.g., poor mental health) has relied heavily on self-report measures. However, there is debate regarding whether self-reports overestimate or underestimate actual screen time. We used advances in iPhone software to address this question and to investigate the influence of individual difference factors, and COVID-19 lockdown restrictions, on screen time. Participants (N = 267, 18–25 years) completed scales measuring depression, anxiety, smartphone attachment, and estimated their screen time. Thereafter, they shared screenshots of their battery use (BUS) and iPhone screen time (iOS STT) data. Some (n = 24) shared their BUS data again during the COVID-19 lockdown. Whereas the BUS data (10-day average, including two weekends) indicated that self-reports underestimated actual use, the iOS STT data (7-day average) indicated that self-reports overestimated actual use (ps < .007). Smartphone use was heavier over weekends and screen time increased significantly during the lockdown (p = .001). Finally, smartphone attachment mediated the relationship between objective screen time and depression, but not anxiety. We conclude that iPhone tracking features can reliably collect objective screen time data, and that screen time is significantly influenced by both individual difference factors and environmental context.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2020.106616,20210201.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30

293,Factors Associated With Psychiatric Adverse Effects in Healthcare Personnel During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Ecuador,"Introducción Desde la aparición de la enfermedad por el nuevo coronavirus de 2019 (COVID-19), el mundo se enfrentó a una pandemia con consecuencias a todo nivel. En muchos países los sistemas de salud se han visto colapsados y el personal de salud ha tenido que enfrentarse a esta crisis en primera línea. Los efectos adversos sobre la salud mental del personal sanitario han sido ampliamente reportados. La presente investigación se enfoca en identificar los principales factores asociados con efectos adversos psicológicos. Métodos Estudio descriptivo, transversal, basado en encuestas, aplicando los test PHQ-9, GAD-7, ISI y EIE-R a personal de salud de Ecuador durante la pandemia de COVID-19. Resultados Participaron 1.028 personas, distribuidas en: 557 médicos (54,18%), 349 enfermeras (33,94%), 29 laboratoristas (2,82%), 27 paramédicos (2,62%), 52 psicólogos (5,05%) y 14 terapeutas respiratorios (1,36%), de 16 de las 24 provincias de Ecuador. El 27,3% tenía síntomas de depresión; el 39,2%, síntomas de ansiedad; el 16,3%, insomnio y el 43,8%, síntomas de TEPT; los 4 tipos de síntomas iban de moderados a graves. Los factores asociados más relevantes fueron: trabajar en Guayas (la provincia más afectada) (OR = 2,18 para síntomas depresivos y OR = 2,59 para síntomas de TEPT); ser médico posgradista (OR = 1,52 para síntomas depresivos y OR = 1,57 para insomnio), percepción de no contar con el equipo de protección adecuado (OR = 1,71 para síntomas de depresión y OR = 1,57 para síntomas de ansiedad) y ser mujer (OR = 1,39 para ansiedad). Conclusiones El personal de salud puede tener una afección mental importante que puede requerir intervención médica psiquiátrica y psicológica. Los principales factores asociados se relacionan sobre todo con vivir y trabajar en ciudades con mayor número de casos y las características del trabajo, como ser médico posgradista, así como la percepción propia de seguridad. Se requiere realizar más estudios según evolucione la pandemia. Introduction Since the emergence of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the world has faced a pandemic with consequences at all levels. In many countries, the health systems collapsed and healthcare professionals had to be on the front line of this crisis. The adverse effects on the mental health of healthcare professionals have been widely reported. This research focuses on identifying the main factors associated with adverse psychological outcomes. Methods Descriptive, cross-sectional study based on surveys, applying the PHQ-9, GAD-7, ISI and EIE-R tests to healthcare professionals from Ecuador during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results 1,028 participants, distributed in: 557 physicians (54.18%), 349 nurses (33.94%), 29 laboratory workers (2.82%), 27 paramedics (2.62%), 52 psychologists (5.05%) and 14 respiratory therapists (1.36%), from 16 of the 24 provinces of Ecuador. Of these, 27.3% presented symptoms of depression, 39.2% anxiety symptoms, 16.3% insomnia and 43.8% symptoms of PTSD, with the 4 types of symptoms ranging from moderate to severe. The most relevant associated factors were: working in Guayas (the most affected province) (OR = 2.18 for depressive symptoms and OR = 2.59 for PTSD symptoms); being a postgraduate doctor (OR = 1.52 for depressive symptoms and OR = 1.57 for insomnia), perception of not having the proper protective equipment (OR = 1.71 for symptoms of depression and OR = 1.57 for symptoms of anxiety) and being a woman (OR = 1.39 for anxiety). Conclusions Healthcare professionals can suffer a significant mental condition that may require psychiatric and psychological intervention. The main associated factors are primarily related to living and working in cities with a higher number of cases and the characteristics of the job, such as being a postgraduate doctor, as well as the perception of security. The main risk factors are primarily related to geographical distribution and job characteristics, such as being a resident physician and self-perception of safety. Further studies are required as the pandemic evolves.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rcp.2020.12.007,20210101.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30

Método Estudio cualitativo exploratorio a través del análisis de ilustraciones realizadas por 71 escolares de 7-8 años de edad. El análisis se llevó a cabo según el marco teórico de Rose. Se realizó análisis descriptivo de los datos sociodemográficos. Resultados Del análisis del contenido emergieron cinco categorías: 1) sentimientos de tristeza y miedo; 2) importancia del núcleo familiar, seguridad y protección; 3) hábitos de vida sedentarios durante el confinamiento; 4) infraestructuras de las viviendas y desigualdades sociales (la vida tras una ventana); y 5) respuesta social, lucha colectiva y de los/las profesionales de la salud. Conclusiones La situación de pandemia de COVID-19 y las medidas estrictas de confinamiento han tenido un importante impacto en la población escolar, que es la que ha vivido las mayores restricciones. La infraestructura del hogar se ha mostrado como un claro diferenciador que ahonda en las desigualdades sociales y el impacto que la situación tiene en los/las escolares. Es necesario ampliar los estudios acerca del impacto psicosocial que esta situación va a tener a largo plazo en su salud física y mental. Objective To explore the experiences of schoolchildren in an exceptional health alert situation in which strict confinement measures have been applied to the population. Method Qualitative exploratory study through the analysis of illustrations carried out by schoolchildren aged 7 to 8. The analysis was carried out according to Rose's theoretical framework. Descriptive analysis of socio-demographic data was performed. Results Five categories emerged from the analysis of the content: 1) feelings of sadness and fear; 2) importance of the family nucleus, safety and protection; 3) sedentary living habits during confinement; 4) housing infrastructure and social inequalities (life through a window); and 5) social response, collective struggle and through health professionals. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic situation and the strict confinement measures have had a significant impact on the school population, who had experienced the greatest restrictions.

300,"An insight into the mental health needs of the common public of Tamil Nadu, India, subjected to COVID-19 lockdown, a rare unprecedented crisis","Purpose COVID-19, a major “Public Health Emergencies of International Concern”, had sought greater attention among researchers to study its pathogenesis, associated complications and management. However, there are only few studies that had studied its potential impact on mental health of general public, who are subjected to social distancing, community lockdown and restrictions in their routine activities. Objectives The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of psychological distress and mental health needs among general public in Tamil Nadu subjected to lockdown, social distancing amidst COVID-19 crisis. Tamil Nadu is one of the worst affected states of southern India. Methods A self-administered, web-based application study using “WHO-Self Reported Questionnaire-20”, in bilingual version, both English and Tamil, is used to screen the public for the level of distress. The study is done while the state is under extended lockdown and restricted movement. Key findings A total of 918 respondents participated in the survey and it is found that about more than one third of the respondents (~35%) are under psychological distress. A significant association between younger age group, female gender, unmarried, people with children are found to be under distress. The lockdown had increased the frequency of smoking and quantity of cigarettes among smokers, also has increased the frequency of drinking among alcohol consumers. Of the SRQ-20 items recorded, stress related neurotic symptoms (>70%) was observed more than the depressive mood. About 33% of those scored>7, had suicidal tendency. The districts declared red zones had significantly reported a greater number of respondents under distress. Conclusion Besides effectively mitigating the COVID-19 crisis, in terms of prevention, control and treatment strategies, it is prerogative to effectively manage fear, distress due to the COVID-19 and associated anxiety and depression among the public.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2021.02.013,20210101.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
301,Effect of COVID-19 confinement on the mental status of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus,"Antecedentes y objetivo Las pacientes con lupus eritematoso sistémico (LES) son más vulnerables a presentar mayores niveles de estrés y síntomas psicopatológicos que la población general sana, por lo que el brote de la COVID-19 podría alterar su estado psicológico. El objetivo fue analizar el impacto psicológico de la pandemia y del confinamiento sobre los niveles de estrés y sintomatología psicopatológica en pacientes con LES. Pacientes y método En este estudio transversal se compararon niveles de estrés mediante la Escala de Estrés Percibido y el Inventario de Vulnerabilidad al Estrés, y síntomas psicopatológicos mediante el Inventario de síntomas SCL-90-R, en pacientes con LES durante el período de confinamiento (grupo 1; n=276) con respecto a pacientes con LES evaluadas en un período anterior a la pandemia (grupo 2; n=152). Resultados La comparación entre ambos grupos mostró que existían diferencias estadísticamente significativas en vulnerabilidad al estrés (p<0,0001), depresión (p=0,05), ansiedad (p=0,05), ansiedad fóbica (p<0,0001), sensibilidad interpersonal (p=0,043), y psicoticismo (p=0,023). En estas variables el grupo de pacientes con lupus en confinamiento obtuvo puntuaciones superiores. Conclusiones El confinamiento y la amenaza del brote por COVID-19 ha tenido importantes repercusiones en el estado psicológico de las pacientes con LES, mostrando altos niveles de estrés, ansiedad y depresión. Estos hallazgos muestran su vulnerabilidad ante una alerta de salud pública, y señala la necesidad de realizar un abordaje psicológico de estas pacientes mientras dure el estado de emergencia sanitaria, así como ante posibles rebrotes del virus. Background and objective Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are more vulnerable to higher levels of stress and psychopathological symptoms than the general healthy population. Therefore, the COVID-19 outbreak could alter their psychological state. The objective was to analyze the psychological impact of the pandemic and confinement on stress levels and psychopathological symptoms in patients with SLE. Patients and method In this cross-sectional study, stress levels were compared with the Perceived Stress Scale, the Stress Vulnerability Inventory and psychopathological symptoms of the SCL-90-R Symptom Inventory in patients with SLE during the period of confinement (group 1; n=276) in comparison to patients with SLE evaluated in a period before the pandemic (group 2; n=152). Results The comparison between both groups showed there were statistically significant differences in vulnerability to stress (P <.0001), depression (P =.05), anxiety (P =.05), phobic anxiety (P <.0001), interpersonal sensitivity (P =.043), and psychoticism (P =.023). In these variables, the group of patients with lupus in confinement obtained higher scores. Conclusions The confinement and threat of the COVID-19 outbreak had important repercussions on the psychological state of patients with SLE with high levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. These findings show their vulnerability to a public health alert and indicate the need to carry out a psychological approach to these patients while the state of health emergency lasts as well as to possible outbreaks of the virus.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medcli.2020.12.004,20210101.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30

303,Did child-psychiatry patients really experience the dreaded clinical degradation during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown?,"Objectifs La période de confinement qui s’est déroulée en France de la mi-mars à la mi-mai 2020, à l’occasion de la pandémie COVID-19, soulève d’importantes questions sur ses effets psychologiques directs et indirects chez les enfants et adolescents. Considérée intuitivement comme nuisible, voire traumatisante dans le discours médiatique, nous avons tenté de mieux qualifier ses effets à partir de deux démarches complémentaires. D’une part, nous avons réalisé une revue de la littérature sur le sujet, d’autre part, nous y avons associé une objectivation de l’évolution de l’état clinique global des enfants au sein de la file active du service de psychiatrie infanto-juvénile du CHRU de Brest pendant la période de confinement. La revue de la littérature portant sur les effets psychologiques de situations de confinement ou de quarantaine à l’occasion d’épidémies passées ou actuelle de COVID-19, notamment en Chine, rapporte de nombreuses données sur leurs conséquences délétères. Les effets relatés sont de nature variable : symptômes anxieux et dépressifs principalement, mais aussi Stress Post Traumatique, dans des proportions importantes. Cependant, la définition des situations vécues et les contextes dans lesquels se sont déroulées ces études sont en fait peu comparables à la situation française. Par ailleurs, les effets de la peur de la contamination n’y sont pas différenciés de ceux liés au confinement lui-même. Patients et méthodes Parmi les enfants et adolescents suivis dans le service, 354 ont bénéficié d’une mesure de l’impact du confinement sur leur état clinique global évalué à la Clinical Global Impression Improvement (CGI-I) par leur praticien habituel au cours de la période du 16 mars au 11 mai 2020. Résultats Nos résultats mettent en évidence que 50 % des enfants ont connu un état clinique global inchangé en comparaison à leur état avant le confinement, 25 à 30 % ont connu une amélioration et 20 à 25 % ont montré une légère dégradation pendant la période de confinement. L’état décrit est globalement stable dans le temps au cours des huit semaines de la durée du confinement. L’âge ou la sévérité préalable de la pathologie n’a pas d’influence significative, même si on note une amélioration globale plus fréquente chez les adolescents. Conclusion Ces résultats sont assez discordants avec le discours général. Plusieurs hypothèses sont discutées pour expliquer les raisons de cette absence de dégradation qui pourrait éventuellement être étendue aux enfants et adolescents en général pendant cette période. Background The general lockdown period during the COVID-19 pandemic which covered mid-March to mid-May 2020 in France raised important questions about the direct and indirect psychological effects on children and adolescents. Perceived intuitively as harmful and even traumatic in the media's discourse, we tried to better qualify its effects from two complementary approaches. We carried out a review of the literature on the subject to which we associated a regular assessment of the children's global clinical state in the entire active file of the child-psychiatry department of the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Brest throughout the lockdown period. The findings of the literature review on the psychological effects of lockdowns or quarantines during past or current epidemics, in particular in China, report many deleterious and variable effects such as symptoms of anxiety, depression, as well as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, at a significant rate. However, the definition of the situations experienced and the contexts in which those studies took place appear to be not truly comparable to the French situation. Moreover, the effects of the fear of contamination are not differentiated from those linked to confinement itself. Patients and methods Among children and adolescents under the care of the above department, 354 underwent an assessment of the impact of lockdown on their global clinical condition using the Clinical Global Impression Improvement (CGI-I) performed by their usual practitioner during the period from March 16 to May 11, 2020. Results Our results highlight that 50% of children remained in stable condition, 25 to 30% improved and 20 to 25% experienced a slight degradation. The evolution of the clinical status appeared stable over time during the eight weeks. The initial age or severity of mental disorder had no significant influence, although there was a slightly more frequent improvement in adolescents. Conclusion These results are quite inconsistent with general discourse and common expectations. Several psychopathological hypotheses are discussed to support this absence of psychological degradation which might even be extended to children and adolescents in the general population.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neurenf.2021.02.006,20210101.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30

305,Doomscrolling during COVID-19: The negative association between daily social and traditional media consumption and mental health symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Consumption of traditional and social media markedly increased at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic as new information about the virus and safety guidelines evolved. Much of the information concerned restrictions on daily living activities and the risk posed by the virus. The term ``doomscrolling'' was used to describe the phenomenon of elevated negative affect after viewing pandemic-related media. The magnitude and duration of this effect, however, is unclear. Furthermore, the effect of doomscrolling likely varies based on prior vulnerabilities for psychopathology such as a history of childhood maltreatment. It was hypothesized that social and traditional media exposure was related to an increase in depression and PTSD and that this increase was moderated by childhood maltreatment severity. Participants completed a baseline assessment for psychopathology and 30 days of daily assessments of depression and PTSD. Using multilevel modeling on 1,117 daily observations, social media access was associated with increased depression and PTSD. This association was stronger for those with more severe maltreatment histories. Furthermore, those with more severe baseline psychopathology used more social media during this period. These results suggest that doomscrolling is associated with increases in psychopathology for those with existing vulnerabilities.",Matthew Price et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46028-EE6-197,20210330.0,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; ptsd; ema; multilevel model; doomscrolling; covid-19; depression,PsyArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
306,Heart Rate Variability Moderates the Effects of COVID-19-Related Stress and Family Adversity on Emotional Problems in Adolescents: Testing Models of Differential Susceptibility and Diathesis Stress,"The COVID-19 pandemic is a unique period of stress and uncertainty that will have significant implications for adolescent mental health. Nevertheless, stress about COVID-19 may be more consequential for some adolescents’ mental health than for others. We examined whether heart rate variability (HRV) indicated differential susceptibility to mental health difficulties associated with COVID-19 stress. Approximately four years prior to the pandemic, we assessed resting HRV and HRV reactivity to a well-validated stress paradigm in 87 adolescents. During the pandemic, these adolescents (ages 13-19) reported on their health-related stress and concerns about COVID-19 and their recent emotional problems. The association between COVID-19 stress and emotional problems was significantly stronger for adolescents who previously exhibited higher resting HRV or higher HRV reactivity. For adolescents who exhibited lower resting HRV or lower HRV reactivity, COVID-19 stress was not associated with emotional problems. Thus, parasympathetic functioning may reflect differential susceptibility to the effects of COVID-19 stress on mental health during the pandemic.",Jonas G.

307,"Multilevel Associations of Daily Skill Use and Effectiveness With Anxiety, Depression, and Stress in a Transdiagnostic Sample Undergoing Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Training","Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is effective at treating disorders of emotion dysregulation. However, it is unclear which mechanisms contribute to these effects. The aim of this study was to characterize the within-person associations of two theoretically relevant mechanisms of change, skill use and skill effectiveness, with anxiety, stress, and depression. Participants (n = 19, Mage = 31.8, 68% female) with a primary anxiety or depressive disorder completed daily reports (N = 1344) of DBT skill use, perceived effectiveness, anxiety, stress, and depression during a 16-session DBT skills training group. DBT skill use increased across treatment, p < .01, but effectiveness did not, p = .64. Within persons, participants used more skills on days with greater stress and anxiety, p < .01, which predicted next-day decreases in stress and anxiety, p = .03. On days when participants reported higher effectiveness, they used more skills than their personal average when experiencing more intense negative affect, p < .01. These results suggest using more skills, especially when used more effectively, is a mechanism by which DBT skills groups address emotional dysfunction for those with transdiagnostic emotional disorders.",Matthew W.

308,Traumatic Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic in an International Sample: Contribution of Fatalism to Psychological Distress and Behavior Change,"This study aimed to assess the traumatic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and to explore the contribution of fatalism to a) psychological distress and b) pandemic-related behavior change. Data for the study were collected via an anonymous online survey. The survey included questions about demographic characteristics, health status, pandemic-related stress, impact of COVID-19 on health and behavior, posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), and fatalism. The sample included 465 participants from 30 countries (mean age = 36.87, SD = 13.39, age range = 18 – 76; 80% female). While none of the study participants have been diagnosed with COVID-19, almost 25% knew someone who had received the diagnosis. The overwhelming majority (79%) had to make changes to their daily routine, and 48.82% of the sample reported moderate to severe PTSS. Fatalism was found to be a statistically significant predictor of PTSS in a multiple regression model and was also associated with lack of behavior changes in response to the pandemic. Our findings indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic is a traumatic event with a potential to affect mental health and well-being of individuals and communities. Fatalism may contribute to severity of psychological distress and diminish individuals’ ability to engage in health-protective behaviors.",Olga Bogolyubova et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4615A-020-15D,20200818.0,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; health behavior; traumatic stress; mental health; covid-19; coronavirus; ptss; posttraumatic stress symptoms; fatalism,PsyArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
309,The Benefits of Living with Close Others: A Longitudinal Examination of Mental Health Before and During a Global Stressor,"For better or worse, the people we live with may exert a powerful influence on our mental health, perhaps especially during times of stress. The COVID-19 pandemic—a large-scale stressor that prompted health recommendations to stay home to reduce disease spread—provided a unique context for examining how the people we share our homes with may shape our mental health. A seven-wave longitudinal study assessed mental health month-to-month before and during the pandemic (February through September, 2020) in two diverse samples of U.S. adults (N = 656; N = 544). Pre-registered analyses demonstrated that people living with close others (children and/or romantic partners) experienced better well-being before and during the pandemic’s first six months. These groups also experienced unique increases in ill-being during the pandemic’s onset, but parents’ ill-being also recovered more quickly.

Using an online survey, we collected data on healthcare workers’ perception regarding COVID-19 exposure in a work unit. Workers’ depression, insomnia, and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Insomnia Severity Index, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale, respectively. Work-related stress and anxiety in response to the viral epidemic were measured using the Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemic-9 (SAVE-9) scale. We found that work-related stress and anxiety in response to the viral epidemic was associated with female sex, perception of the workplace as being dangerous, and depressive symptoms. Unhealthy behaviors, such as smoking and drinking as coping behaviors during the pandemic, were associated with male sex, young age, depression, and insomnia.

311,Sleeping for Two: Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial of cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia in pregnant women,"Insomnia and sleep disturbances are common in pregnancy and have potentially significant consequences for both maternal and infant health. There is limited research examining the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) during pregnancy. With increased distress and limited access to services during the COVID-19 pandemic, there is also an unprecedented need for telehealth delivery of treatment programs for pregnant women. The primary aim of the trial is to evaluate the impact of in-person or telehealth cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) versus a treatment as usual (TAU) control group in reducing symptoms of insomnia experienced in pregnancy. We hypothesize that participants who receive CBT-I delivered in person or via telehealth will report fewer insomnia symptoms. The secondary aims are to investigate if CBT-I versus TAU increases gestational length and reduces symptoms of depression. We hypothesize that receiving CBT-I will be associated with longer gestational length (as confirmed by public health records) and lower depressive symptoms.",Anna L.

Two participants with major depressive disorder were included in a 30-days observational ecological momentary assessment study just before the lockdown in Montreal, Canada. In both cases, the self-reported depressive symptoms and core affects fluctuated during the lockdown. However, all depressive symptoms were not systematically exacerbated. Among them, significant linear and non-linear temporal patterns have been identified. For case 1, the lockdown period did not worsen the sleep quality and sleep parameters. The psychomotor retardation, fatigue, appetite loss and level of arousal played a prominent role in the idiographic dynamic symptom networks. These case studies allow a granular understanding of the lockdown effects on depressive symptoms and affective experiences dynamics, and highlight the need for person-centered mental health care to help people with major depressive disorder.",Paquito Bernard et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46114-B73-F26,20200714.0,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; idiographic; sleep; insomnia; covid-19; depressive symptoms,PsyArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
313,Sociodemographic and psychological risk factors for anxiety and depression: Findings from the Covid-19 Health and Adherence Research in Scotland (CHARIS) cross-sectional survey THIS ARTICLE HAS BEEN PEER REVIEWED AND IS NOW AVAILABLE HERE: https://linkspringercom/article/101007/s12529-021-09967-z,"ABSTRACT Background: Investigations about mental health report prevalence rates with fewer studies investigating psychological and social factors influencing mental health during the Covid-19 pandemic. The aims of the study were to: (1) identify sociodemographic groups of the adult population at risk of anxiety and depression, and (2) determine if the following social and psychological risk factors for poor mental health moderated these direct sociodemographic effects: loneliness, social support, risk perception, and illness representations. Methods Cross sectional nationally representative telephone survey in Scotland in June 2020. If available, validated instruments were used for example, Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4) to measure anxiety and depression. Simple linear regressions followed by examination of moderation effect. Results 1006 participants; median age 53 years, 61.4% female, 3.8% in the most deprived and 15.6% in the most affluent areas. Analyses show associations of anxiety and depression with sociodemographic (age, gender, deprivation), social (social support, social isolation, loneliness) and psychological factors (perceived threat and illness representations). Mental health was poorer in younger adults, women and people living in the most deprived areas. Age effects were exaggerated by loneliness and illness representations, gender effects by loneliness and illness representations, and deprivation effects by loneliness, social support, illness representations and perceived threat. In each case, the moderating variables amplified the detrimental effects of the sociodemographic factors. Conclusions These findings confirm the results of previous studies about associations between sociodemographics and adult mental health. Loneliness, lack of social support and thoughts about Covid-19 exaggerated these effects and offer pointers for pre-emptive action.",Gill Hubbard et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461FE-9B3-409,20200911.0,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; public mental health; coronavirus; illness representations; risk perception; loneliness; social support,PsyArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
314,Correlates of Financial Concerns and Symptoms of Depression and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder in Impoverished Urban-dwelling Individuals in Bangladesh During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Face-to-face Interview Findings,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the physical, mental and financial health of many individuals. How substantially marginalized groups like impoverished urban-dwelling individuals are specifically impacted amid this pandemic is poorly understood. The present study aimed to investigate correlates of financial concerns and symptoms of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during the COVID-19 pandemic among impoverished urban-dwelling individuals residing in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted between August and September 2020 using face-to-face interviews in six disadvantaged neighborhoods (“slums”) in Dhaka. Individuals were interviewed using a structured questionnaire consisting of questions assessing socio-demographics, lifestyle, financial well-being relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, depression, and PTSD. Results: A total of 435 individuals (male=54.7%; mean age=45.0±12.0 years; age range=18-85 years) participated. Most (96.3%) reported that their household income decreased due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Associated factors included female gender, primary education, jobless, food scarcity, and depression. Depression symptoms were linked to female gender, being jobless, being divorced, living in a joint family, excessive sleep, and smoking. Low incomes, excessive sleep, joblessness, and food scarcity were positively associated with PTSD symptoms. In contrast, less sleep appeared protective against PTSD. Limitations: Potential limitations included cross-sectional study design and limited sample size. Conclusions: Public health initiatives, in particular mental health services, should be introduced to mitigate against psychological and financial effects of the pandemic on impoverished urban-dwelling individuals in Bangladesh.",Saiful Islam et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46157-0D3-AD5,20201108.0,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry,PsyArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
315,"Change in mental and physical health, and social relationships, during highly restrictive lockdown in the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from Australia","Background. A novel coronavirus first reported in Wuhan City in China in 2019 (COVID-19) developed into a global pandemic throughout 2020. Many countries around the world implemented strict social distancing policies to curb the spread of the virus. In this study we aimed to examine potential change in mental/physical health and social relationships during a highly restrictive COVID-19 lockdown period in Australia during April 2020. Methods. Our survey (n = 1599) included questions about concerns, social behaviour, perceived change in relationship quality, social media use, frequency of exercise, physical health, and mental health during COVID-19 lockdown (April, 2020). Results. When estimating their mental health for the previous year 13% of participants reported more negative than positive emotion, whereas this increased to 41% when participants reflected on their time during COVID-19 lockdown. A substantial proportion (39-54%) of participants reported deterioration in mental health, physical health, financial situation, and work productivity. However, most of these participants reported 'somewhat' rather than 'a lot' of deterioration, and many others reported 'no change' (40-50%) or even 'improvement' (6-17%). Therefore, the psychological toll on Australians may not have been as large as other parts of the world with greater COVID-19 infection rates. Even less impact was apparent for social relationships (~68% reported 'no change') as participants compensated for decreased face-to-face interaction via increased technology-mediated interaction. Our findings highlight how technology-mediated communication can allow people to adequately maintain social relationships during an extreme lockdown event.",Shane L.

316,A Perspective on Mature Gratitude as a Way of Coping with COVID-19,"Aim and Method: This perspective searches presents evidence of mature gratitude as a way of coping with the threats and boundaries of COVID-19. This narrative, non-systematic review will be based on studies from the COVID-19 period in association with more general literature on the characteristics of mature gratitude related to good mental health. Results: The results from the literature suggest that a confrontation with our existential vulnerability during a pandemic is not only a crisis but also an opportunity to view our lives in a different way. Mature gratitude, as proposed in this perspective, can help us in coping with the threats and boundaries that are part of our lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This time of crisis gives us the opportunity to self-reflect on our current life and plans for the future and to reframe them through a positive lens which can encourage individuals to actively strengthen their psychological resilience and coping skills. Conclusion: Cultivating an attitude of mature gratitude through actions of kindness, expressing being thankful for life and God, and enjoying all the small things in life helps in coping with the current threats of COVID-19 and building lifelong resilience for the future Knowledge about these associations can help psychologists, counselors, and coaches to support people who experience psychological issues due to the current pandemic and all crises to come.",Lilian Jans-Beken,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46133-92B-5AA,20201125.0,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Narrative Research; clinical psychology; virtues; character strengths; corona; positive psychology",PsyArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
317,The Psychological Impact of Threat & Lockdown During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"This study aimed to investigate the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health, particularly the effects of perceived threat and lockdown measures, and to elucidate individual and social factors exacerbating or mitigating its negative effects, particularly sense of control. An online survey was completed by participants (N=8,229) recruited from 79 countries. In line with pre-registered hypotheses, participants showed elevated levels of anxiety and depression worldwide. This poor mental health was predicted by perceived threat. The effect of threat on depression was further moderated by social isolation, but there was no effect of sense of control. Sense of control was low overall, and was predicted negatively by maladaptive coping, but positively by adaptive coping and the perception that the government is dealing with the outbreak. Social isolation increased with quarantine duration, but was mitigated by frequent communication with close ones. Engaging in individual actions to avoid contracting the virus was associated with higher anxiety, except when done professionally. We suggest that the psychological detrimental effects of the pandemic can be alleviated by individual actions such as maintaining frequent social contact and adaptive coping, and by governmental actions which demonstrate support in a public health crisis. Citizens and governments can work together to adapt better to restrictive but necessary measures during the current and future pandemics.",Valerie Van Mulukom et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4617A-B65-F7C,20200722.0,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; government; sense of control; psychological well-being; lockdown; quarantine; anxiety; covid-19; survey; psychology; coronavirus; social isolation; depression; mental health,PsyArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
318,"‘Stressed, uncomfortable, vulnerable, neglected’: a qualitative study of the psychological and social impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on UK frontline keyworkers","Aims: Non-healthcare keyworkers face distinct occupational vulnerabilities that have received little consideration within broader debates about ‘essential’ work and psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study was therefore to explore the impact of the pandemic on the working lives and mental health and wellbeing of non-healthcare keyworkers in the UK. Methods: In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 23 participants employed in a range of non-healthcare keyworker occupations, including transport, retail, education, postal services and the police force. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed using a reflexive thematic approach. Results: Keyworkers experienced adverse psychological effects during the COVID-19 pandemic, including fears of COVID-19 exposure, contagion and subsequent transmission to others, especially their families. These concerns were often experienced in the context of multiple exposure risks, including insufficient PPE and a lack of workplace mitigation practices. Keyworkers also described multiple work-related challenges, including increased workload, a lack of public and organisational recognition and feelings of disempowerment. Conclusion: In efforts to reduce psychosocial concerns among non-healthcare keyworkers, there is a need for appropriate support during the COVID-19 pandemic and in preparation for other infections (e.g. seasonal influenza) in the future. This includes the provision of psychological and workplace measures attending to the intersections of personal vulnerability and work conditions that cause unique risks and challenges among those in frontline keyworker occupations.",Tom May et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46142-BD7-DC1,20210219.0,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Health Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction; keyworkers; frontline services; qualitative; covid-19; psychological wellbeing,SocArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
319,Decline in rate of divorce and separation filings in Denmark in 2020 compared to previous years,"The radical changes to everyday life brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and the closure of non-family social spheres in particular may have impacted marriage dynamics. We provide evidence on the monthly rates of initiation of divorce and separation filings in Denmark for the period 2016-2020 to examine how filing behavior changed during 2020 compared to the four previous years. Because filing rates precedes a divorce, rates reflect more precise the temporal dynamic of divorce initiation. Rates of initiation of divorce filings declined in 2020 to the lowest level in the period 2016-2020. On average, monthly rates in 2020 were 7 percent lower than 2019 rates and 20 percent lower than 2016 rates.

320,“My Husband Thinks I’m Crazy”: COVID-19-Related Conflict in Couples with Young Children,"Objective: We examine how disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic are creating conflicts for couples with young children. Background: National polls suggest that COVID-19 has led to increased conflict for couples in the U.S. Although scholars have not examined the source of these new conflicts, pre-pandemic research suggests that pandemic-related disruptions may create conflicts around paid work and parenting, economic security, politics, and health decision-making. Method: This study uses the Pandemic Parenting Study, a mixed-methods study of Southern Indiana mothers, conducted April-May 2020, and involving surveys (N=139), diary entries (N=104), and in-depth interviews (N=65). We examine mothers’ reports of pandemic-related changes in their frustrations with their partners and how those changes vary with the disruptions couples have experienced during the pandemic. We then use qualitative data to understand how pandemic-related disruptions are generating conflicts for couples and what consequences those conflicts have. Results: A substantial minority of mothers (39%) report pandemic-related increases in their frustrations with their partners. These frustrations are particularly common among mothers whose partners are (reportedly) providing insufficient support with pandemic parenting or dismissing mothers’ concerns about COVID-19. Mothers blame themselves for these conflicts and feel responsible for reducing them, including by leaving the workforce, beginning use of antidepressants, or ignoring their own concerns about COVID-19.

In addition to these changes, students with disabilities/health concerns may face accessibility problems with online learning or communication tools, and their stress may be compounded by additional risks such as financial stress or pre-existing conditions. To our knowledge, no one has looked specifically at the impact of COVID-19 on students with disabilities/health concerns. In this paper, we present data from a survey of 147 students with and without disabilities collected in late March to early April of 2020 to assess the impact of COVID-19 on these students' education and mental health. Our findings show that students with disabilities/health concerns were more concerned about classes going online than their peers without disabilities. In addition, students with disabilities/health concerns also reported that they have experienced more COVID-19 related adversities compared to their peers without disabilities/health concerns. We argue that students with disabilities/health concerns in higher education need confidence in the accessibility of the online learning tools that are becoming increasingly prevalent in higher education not only because of COVID-19 but also more generally. In addition, educational technologies will be more accessible if they consider the learning context, and are designed to provide a supportive, calm, and connecting learning environment.","Zhang, Han; Nurius, Paula; Sefidgar, Yasaman; Morris, Margaret; Balasubramanian, Sreenithi; Brown, Jennifer; Dey, Anind K.; Kuehn, Kevin; Riskin, Eve; Xu, Xuhai; Mankoff, Jen",https://doi.org/nan,20200511.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
322,"Robot art, in the eye of the beholder?: Personalization through self-disclosure facilitates visual communication of emotions in representational art","Socially assistive robots could help to support people's well-being in contexts such as art therapy where human therapists are scarce, by making art such as paintings together with people in a way that is emotionally contingent and creative. However, current art-making robots are typically either contingent, controlled as a tool by a human artist, or creative, programmed to paint independently, possibly because some complex and idiosyncratic concepts related to art, such as emotion and creativity, are not yet well understood. For example, the role of personalized taste in forming beauty evaluations has been studied in empirical aesthetics, but how to generate art that appears to an individual to express certain emotions such as happiness or sadness is less clear. In the current article, a collaborative prototyping/Wizard of Oz approach was used to explore generic robot art-making strategies and personalization of art via an open-ended emotion profile intended to identify tricky concepts. As a result of conducting an exploratory user study, participants indicated some preference for a robot art-making strategy involving""visual metaphors""to balance exogenous and endogenous components, and personalized representational sketches were reported to convey emotion more clearly than generic sketches. The article closes by discussing personalized abstract art as well as suggestions for richer art-making strategies and user models. Thus, the main conceptual advance of the current work lies in suggesting how an interactive robot can visually express emotions through personalized art; the general aim is that this could help to inform next steps in this promising area and facilitate technological acceptance of robots in everyday human environments.","Cooney, Martin",https://doi.org/nan,20200508.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
323,What are We Depressed about When We Talk about COVID19: Mental Health Analysis on Tweets Using Natural Language Processing,"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) recently has affected human life to a great extent. Besides direct physical and economic threats, the pandemic also indirectly impact people's mental health conditions, which can be overwhelming but difficult to measure. The problem may come from various reasons such as unemployment status, stay-at-home policy, fear for the virus, and so forth. In this work, we focus on applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze tweets in terms of mental health. We trained deep models that classify each tweet into the following emotions: anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise and trust. We build the EmoCT (Emotion-Covid19-Tweet) dataset for the training purpose by manually labeling 1,000 English tweets. Furthermore, we propose and compare two methods to find out the reasons that are causing sadness and fear.","Li, Irene; Li, Yixin; Li, Tianxiao; Alvarez-Napagao, Sergio; Garcia, Dario",https://doi.org/nan,20200422.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30

While lockdowns may help to contain the spread of the virus, it is possible that substantial damage to population well-being will result. This study relies on Google Trends data and tests whether the lockdowns implemented in Europe and America led to changes in well-being related topic search terms. Using different methods to evaluate the causal effects of lockdown, we find a substantial increase in the search intensity for boredom in Europe and the US. We also found a significant increase in searches for loneliness, worry and sadness, while searches for stress, suicide and divorce on the contrary fell. Our results suggest that people's mental health may have been severely affected by the lockdown.","Brodeur, Abel; Clark, Andrew E.; Fleche, Sarah; Powdthavee, Nattavudh",https://doi.org/nan,20200425.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
325,A chatbot architecture for promoting youth resilience,"E-health technologies have the potential to provide scalable and accessible interventions for youth mental health. As part of a developing an ecosystem of e-screening and e-therapy tools for New Zealand young people, a dialog agent, Headstrong, has been designed to promote resilience with methods grounded in cognitive behavioral therapy and positive psychology. This paper describes the architecture underlying the chatbot. The architecture supports a range of over 20 activities delivered in a 4-week program by relatable personas. The architecture provides a visual authoring interface to its content management system. In addition to supporting the original adolescent resilience chatbot, the architecture has been reused to create a 3-week 'stress-detox' intervention for undergraduates, and subsequently for a chatbot to support young people with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, with all three systems having been used in field trials. The Headstrong architecture illustrates the feasibility of creating a domain-focused authoring environment in the context of e-therapy that supports non-technical expert input and rapid deployment.","Holt-Quick, Chester; Warren, Jim; Stasiak, Karolina; Williams, Ruth; Christie, Grant; Hetrick, Sarah; Hopkins, Sarah; Cargo, Tania; Merry, Sally",https://doi.org/nan,20200515.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
326,Visualising COVID-19 Research,"The world has seen in 2020 an unprecedented global outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, a new strain of coronavirus, causing the COVID-19 pandemic, and radically changing our lives and work conditions. Many scientists are working tirelessly to find a treatment and a possible vaccine. Furthermore, governments, scientific institutions and companies are acting quickly to make resources available, including funds and the opening of large-volume data repositories, to accelerate innovation and discovery aimed at solving this pandemic. In this paper, we develop a novel automated theme-based visualisation method, combining advanced data modelling of large corpora, information mapping and trend analysis, to provide a top-down and bottom-up browsing and search interface for quick discovery of topics and research resources. We apply this method on two recently released publications datasets (Dimensions' COVID-19 dataset and the Allen Institute for AI's CORD-19). The results reveal intriguing information including increased efforts in topics such as social distancing; cross-domain initiatives (e.g. mental health and education); evolving research in medical topics; and the unfolding trajectory of the virus in different territories through publications. The results also demonstrate the need to quickly and automatically enable search and browsing of large corpora. We believe our methodology will improve future large volume visualisation and discovery systems but also hope our visualisation interfaces will currently aid scientists, researchers, and the general public to tackle the numerous issues in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bras, Pierre Le; Gharavi, Azimeh; Robb, David A.; Vidal, Ana F.; Padilla, Stefano; Chantler, Mike J.",https://doi.org/nan,20200513.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30

329,"Universal Masking is Urgent in the COVID-19 Pandemic: SEIR and Agent Based Models, Empirical Validation, Policy Recommendations","We present two models for the COVID-19 pandemic predicting the impact of universal face mask wearing upon the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus--one employing a stochastic dynamic network based compartmental SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) approach, and the other employing individual ABM (agent-based modelling) Monte Carlo simulation--indicating (1) significant impact under (near) universal masking when at least 80% of a population is wearing masks, versus minimal impact when only 50% or less of the population is wearing masks, and (2) significant impact when universal masking is adopted early, by Day 50 of a regional outbreak, versus minimal impact when universal masking is adopted late. These effects hold even at the lower filtering rates of homemade masks. To validate these theoretical models, we compare their predictions against a new empirical data set we have collected that includes whether regions have universal masking cultures or policies, their daily case growth rates, and their percentage reduction from peak daily case growth rates. Results show a near perfect correlation between early universal masking and successful suppression of daily case growth rates and/or reduction from peak daily case growth rates, as predicted by our theoretical simulations. Our theoretical and empirical results argue for urgent implementation of universal masking. As governments plan how to exit societal lockdowns, it is emerging as a key NPI; a""mouth-and-nose lockdown""is far more sustainable than a""full body lockdown"", on economic, social, and mental health axes. An interactive visualization of the ABM simulation is at http://dek.ai/masks4all. We recommend immediate mask wearing recommendations, official guidelines for correct use, and awareness campaigns to shift masking mindsets away from pure self-protection, towards aspirational goals of responsibly protecting one's community.","Kai, De; Goldstein, Guy-Philippe; Morgunov, Alexey; Nangalia, Vishal; Rotkirch, Anna",https://doi.org/nan,20200422.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30

We collected 22 million Twitter messages related to the COVID-19 pandemic using a list of 25 hashtags such as""coronavirus,""""COVID-19,""""quarantine""from March 1 to April 21 in 2020. We used a machine learning approach, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to identify popular unigram, bigrams, salient topics and themes, and sentiments in the collected Tweets. Popular unigrams included""virus,""""lockdown,""and""quarantine.""Popular bigrams included""COVID-19,""""stay home,""""corona virus,""""social distancing,""and""new cases.""We identified 13 discussion topics and categorized them into different themes, such as""Measures to slow the spread of COVID-19,""""Quarantine and shelter-in-place order in the U.S.,""""COVID-19 in New York,""""Virus misinformation and fake news,""""A need for a vaccine to stop the spread,""""Protest against the lockdown,""and""Coronavirus new cases and deaths.""The dominant sentiments for the spread of coronavirus were anticipation that measures that can be taken, followed by a mixed feeling of trust, anger, and fear for different topics. The public revealed a significant feeling of fear when they discussed the coronavirus new cases and deaths. The study concludes that Twitter continues to be an essential source for infodemiology study by tracking rapidly evolving public sentiment and measuring public interests and concerns. Already emerged pandemic fear, stigma, and mental health concerns may continue to influence public trust when there occurs a second wave of COVID-19 or a new surge of the imminent pandemic. Hearing and reacting to real concerns from the public can enhance trust between the healthcare systems and the public as well as prepare for a future public health emergency.","Xue, Jia; Chen, Junxiang; Hu, Ran; Chen, Chen; Zheng, ChengDa; Zhu, Tingshao",https://doi.org/nan,20200526.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30

The public anxiety has increased the psychological burden on government and healthcare professionals, resulting in a government worker suicide in Japan. The terrified people are asking the government for border measures. However, are border measures possible for this virus? By analyzing 48 almost complete virus genome sequences, we found out that the viruses that invaded Taiwan, the United States, and Japan were introduced independently. We identified thirteen parsimony-informative sites and three groups (CTC, TCC, and TCT). Viruses found outside China did not form a monophyletic clade, opposite to previous study. These results suggest the difficulty of implementing effective border measures against this virus.","Matsuda, Tomoko; Suzuki, Hikoyu; Ogata, Norichika",https://doi.org/nan,20200220.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30

333,Symptom extraction from the narratives of personal experiences with COVID-19 on Reddit,"Social media discussion of COVID-19 provides a rich source of information into how the virus affects people's lives that is qualitatively different from traditional public health datasets. In particular, when individuals self-report their experiences over the course of the virus on social media, it can allow for identification of the emotions each stage of symptoms engenders in the patient. Posts to the Reddit forum r/COVID19Positive contain first-hand accounts from COVID-19 positive patients, giving insight into personal struggles with the virus. These posts often feature a temporal structure indicating the number of days after developing symptoms the text refers to. Using topic modelling and sentiment analysis, we quantify the change in discussion of COVID-19 throughout individuals' experiences for the first 14 days since symptom onset. Discourse on early symptoms such as fever, cough, and sore throat was concentrated towards the beginning of the posts, while language indicating breathing issues peaked around ten days. Some conversation around critical cases was also identified and appeared at a roughly constant rate. We identified two clear clusters of positive and negative emotions associated with the evolution of these symptoms and mapped their relationships. Our results provide a perspective on the patient experience of COVID-19 that complements other medical data streams and can potentially reveal when mental health issues might appear.","Murray, Curtis; Mitchell, Lewis; Tuke, Jonathan; Mackay, Mark",https://doi.org/nan,20200521.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30

Summary The responses of nursing homes to the present pandemic and lock-down reveal and amplify the usual defensive mechanisms deployed by professional caregivers against depression. The danger of death and the need to confine the residents, both coming from the outside world, and the permanent management of physical protective measures do not remove the feeling of uselessness and the anxiety of death that the nursing staff habitually tolerates or avoids. On the contrary, these aspects add to caregivers’ need to talk and be listened to.","Charazac, P.

335,What does social distancing mean for patients in forensic mental health settings?,"Governments across the globe have called for social distancing measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Secure settings will not be able to comply with these strictly, nor will they have the same recourse to the novel and creative solutions the general population does. Activities have been restricted in quality, quantity and scope; transfers and discharges have been halted and patient progress put on pause. Understanding how and what ways these restrictions will affect patients is crucial. This is especially salient given that large numbers of the general population have reported heightened mental health burden in recent surveys. However, it is not yet clear how and in what ways the COVID-19 restrictions will affect the mental health of patients in secure care. Past research investigating patients experiences of restrictions on autonomy in secure care that were present before the pandemic can be helpful here. Studies suggest that patient experience restrictions in care in myriad subjective ways. These include limitations on family contact, outside leave, and making hot drinks but also more profoundly on their autonomy, sense of self, and personhood. Quantitative studies have found correlations between experiences of restrictiveness and ward atmosphere, quality of life, suicidal ideation, depression and general psychological state in this patient group. This paper suggests how we can use past research exploring patient expereinces of restrictive interventions to guide the implementation of social distancing measures in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Tomlin, Dr Jack",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsiml.2020.100018,20200428.0,,Elsevier; PMC; WHO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30

337,Panique et pandémie: revue de la littérature sur les liens entre le trouble panique et l'épidémie à SARS-CoV-2,"Résumé L’état de panique associé à la pandémie liée au SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) incite à s’interroger sur les troubles anxieux que cette situation pourrait générer ou aggraver. Si la littérature a déjà fourni des projections généralistes en la matière, les données concrètes concernent à ce stage davantage le trouble de stress post-traumatique et le trouble obsessionnel compulsif, tandis que quelques évaluations s’intéressent au cadre nosographie du trouble anxieux généralisé. Le trouble panique ne se voit que peu ou pas cité et l’évocation de la « panique », au sens social, la supplante largement. Bien que d’une légitimité clinique encore débattue, le trouble panique qualifié de « respiratoire » pourrait se voir augmenter en nombre et/ou être intensifié chez les patients qui en présentent déjà. D’éventuelles situations co-morbides entre un tel trouble et la COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) doivent inciter à certaines précautions en matière de prescriptions médicamenteuses, notamment en lien avec les traitements, ou situations, sources d’hypokaliémie : (i) le salbutamol, source potentielle de surconsommation, notamment chez les patients anxieux, (ii) l’infection par le SARS-CoV-2 et plus encore en cas de diarrhées et/ou vomissements. L’hypokaliémie est associée à un risque accru de torsade de pointe, il convient donc également d’être prudent en matière de prescription de psychotropes à risque : comme avec le citalopram et l’escitalopram, des antidépresseurs indiqués dans le trouble panique, ou encore l’hydroxyzine, à visée anxiolytique. Ces données sont de nature à resituer l’importance de la prise en considération du trouble panique dans le cadre de la pandémie en cours. Abstract Although the ‘panic’ word has been abundantly linked to the SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) pandemic in the press, in the scientific literature very few studies have considered whether the current epidemic could predispose to the onset or the aggravation of panic attacks or panic disorder. Indeed, most studies thus far have focused on the risk of increase and aggravation of other psychiatric disorders as a consequence of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Yet, risk of onset or aggravation of panic disorder, especially the subtype with prominent respiratory symptoms, which is characterized by a fear response conditioning to interoceptive sensations (e.g., respiratory), and hypervigilance to these interoceptive signals, could be expected in the current situation. Indeed, respiratory symptoms, such as coughs and dyspnea, are among the most commonly associated with the SARS-CoV-2 (59-82 % and 31-55 %, respectively), and respiratory symptoms are associated with a poor illness prognosis. Hence given that some etiological and maintenance factors associated with panic disorder – i.e., fear conditioning to abnormal breathing patterns attributable or not to the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), as well as hypervigilance towards breathing abnormalities – are supposedly more prevalent, one could expect an increased risk of panic disorder onset or aggravation following the COVID-19 epidemic in people who were affected by the virus, but also those who were not. In people with the comorbidity (i.e., panic disorder or panic attacks and the COVID-19), it is particularly important to be aware of the risk of hypokalemia in specific at-risk situations or prescriptions. For instance, in the case of salbutamol prescription, which might be overly used in patients with anxiety disorders and COVID-19, or in patients presenting with diarrhea and vomiting. Hypokalemia is associated with an increased risk of torsade de pointe, thus caution is required when prescribing specific psychotropic drugs, such as the antidepressants citalopram and escitalopram, which are first-line treatments for panic disorder, but also hydroxyzine, aiming at anxiety reduction. The results reviewed here highlight the importance of considering and further investigating the impact of the current pandemic on the diagnosis and treatment of panic disorder (alone or comorbid with the COVID-19).","Javelot, H; Weiner, L",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.05.010,20200521.0,,Elsevier; PMC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021-03-30
