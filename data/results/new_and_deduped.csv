0,High risk of patient self-inflicted lung injury in COVID-19 with frequently encountered spontaneous breathing patterns: a computational modelling study,"There is ongoing controversy regarding the potential for increased respiratory effort to generate patient self-inflicted lung injury (P-SILI) in spontaneously breathing patients with COVID-19 acute respiratory failure. However, direct clinical evidence linking increased inspiratory effort to lung injury is scarce. We adapted a recently developed computational simulator that replicates distinctive features of COVID-19 pathophysiology to quantify the mechanical forces that could lead to P-SILI at different levels of respiratory effort. In accordance with recent data, the simulator was calibrated to represent a spontaneously breathing COVID-19 patient with severe hypoxaemia (SaO2 80.6%) and relatively well-preserved lung mechanics (lung compliance of 47.5 ml/cmH2O), being treated with supplemental oxygen (FiO2 = 100%). Simulations were conducted at tidal volumes (VT) and respiratory rates (RR) of 7 ml/kg and 14 breaths/min (representing normal respiratory effort) and at VT/RR of 15/14, 7/20, 15/20, 10/30, 12/30, 10/35, 12/35, 10/40, 12/40 ml/kg / breaths/min. Lung compliance was unaffected by increased VT but decreased significantly at higher RR. While oxygenation improved, significant increases in multiple indicators of the potential for lung injury were observed at all higher VT/RR combinations tested. Pleural pressure swing increased from 10.1 cmH2O at baseline to 30 cmH2O at VT/RR of 15 ml/kg / 20 breaths/min and to 54.6 cmH2O at 12 ml/kg / 40 breaths/min. Dynamic strain increased from 0.3 to 0.49 at VT/RR of 12 ml/kg / 30 breaths/min, and to 0.6 at 15 ml/kg / 20 breaths/min. Mechanical power increased from 7.83 J/min to 17.7 J/min at VT/RR of 7 ml/kg / 20 breaths/min, and to 240.5 7 J/min at 12 ml/kg / 40 breaths/min. Our results suggest that the forces generated during increased inspiratory effort in severe COVID-19 are compatible with the development of P-SILI. If conventional oxygen therapy or non-invasive ventilation is ineffective in reducing respiratory effort, control of driving and transpulmonary pressures with invasive ventilation may reduce the risk of P-SILI and allow time for the resolution of the underlying condition.",Anup Das; Liam Weaver; Sina Saffaran; Nadir Yehya; Timothy E.

18,Modeling SARS-CoV-2 infection in individuals with opioid use disorder with brain organoids,"The COVID-19 pandemic has aggravated a preexisting epidemic: the opioid crisis  Much literature has shown that the circumstances imposed by COVID-19, such as social distancing regulations, medical and financial instability, and increased mental health issues, have been detrimental to those with opioid use disorder (OUD)  In addition, unexpected neurological sequelae in COVID-19 patients suggest that COVID-19 compromises neuroimmunity, induces hypoxia, and causes respiratory depression, provoking similar effects as those caused by opioid exposure  Combined conditions of COVID-19 and OUD could lead to exacerbated complications  With limited human in vivo options to study these complications, we suggest that iPSC-derived brain organoid models may serve as a useful platform to investigate the physiological connection between COVID-19 and OUD  This mini-review highlights the advances of brain organoids in other neuropsychiatric and infectious diseases and suggests their potential utility for investigating OUD and COVID-19, respectively  © The Author(s) 2021","Willner, M.

24,Learning as an Important Privilege: A Life Span Perspective with Implications for Successful Aging,"Research has demonstrated the cognitive and mental health benefits of learning new skills and content across the life span, enhancing knowledge as well as cognitive performance  We argue that the importance of this learning-which is not available equally to all-goes beyond the cognitive and mental health benefits  Learning is important for not only the maintenance, but also enhancement of functional independence in a dynamic environment, such as changes induced by the COVID-19 pandemic and technological advances  Learning difficult skills and content is a privilege because the opportunities for learning are neither guaranteed nor universal, and it requires personal and social engagement, time, motivation, and societal support  This paper highlights the importance of considering learning new skills and content as an important privilege across the life span and argues that this privilege becomes increasingly exclusionary as individuals age, when social and infrastructural support for learning decreases  We highlight research on the potential positive and negative impacts of retirement, when accessibility to learning opportunities may vary, and research on learning barriers due to low expectations and limited resources from poverty  We conclude that addressing barriers to lifelong learning would advance theories on life span cognitive development and raise the bar for successful aging  In doing so, our society might imagine and achieve previously unrealized gains in life span cognitive development, through late adulthood  © 2021","Wu, R.; Zhao, J.; Cheung, C.; Natsuaki, M.

29,5PSQ-214 ‘Unit dose’: clinical risk management of COVID-19 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine,"Background and importanceThe use of unit dose (UD) has been proved to be a critical tool in supporting the phases of prescription, preparation and administration of therapies, and most importantly in the management of the COVID-19 emergency  All drugs managed in the UD are screened and validated by the pharmacist;during this stage, if any prescription presents a potential risk of adverse events for a patient, the pharmacist is required to insert notes requesting modification of the prescription  These notes provide information about the risk of potential errors such as therapy duration, dosage, administration frequency, interactions, therapeutic indications, dilution, type of formulation and double prescriptions Aim and objectivesThe aim of this work was to demonstrate the key role that pharmacists play in patient safety and clinical risk management, particularly in the prescription of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for COVID-19 patients Material and methodsWe analysed therapies from all patients managed with UD in the period 1 March 2020 to 31 July 2020, and reviewed the notes entered by the pharmacists  These notes were further divided based on the potential risk of event/error, latent/active and high and low risk (HR, LW), where high risk refers to potentially harmful events for the patient ResultsDuring the observed period, hospitalised patients receiving the UD regimen were 4649 patients, 413 resulting from COVID-19, including 231 men and 182 women, with a median age of 70 (20–99) years and average number of hospitalisation days of 19 (SD±17)  In 334 (81%) prescriptions for these patients, one or more notes were reported from the pharmacist, including 283 HR and 51 LR  The total number of notes entered were 445, with 322 (72%) related to HCQ interactions as follows: (1) 67% medicines that prolong the QT interval which can induce heart rhythm disorders (class IA and III antiarrhythmics, tricyclic antidepressants, antipsychotics, macrolides and quinolones);(2) 3% digoxin;(3) 20% antidiabetics;and (4) 10% antiepileptics Conclusion and relevanceThis study showed that in 72% of notes reported in advance by the pharmacist in the prescription, there was a HR of potential adverse events resulting from the interaction with HCQ  This led to interruption in the use of this drug, as subsequently confirmed by the decision of the EMA (29 May 2020) to recommend its use only in clinical trials References and/or acknowledgementsConflict of interestNo conflict of interest","Corridoni, S.; Sorice, P.; Auriemma, L.; Pizzica, S.; Cinalli, C.; Florio, G.

37,Sino-Western rivalry in the COVID-19 “vaccine wars”–A race to the bottom?,"Purpose: This paper analyses the escalating Sino-Western race to develop a safe, efficacious and durable vaccine (i e  “Goldilocks COVID-19 vaccine”)  It argues that such efforts would be considerably more effective if there is greater international cooperation instead of the corrosive rivalry driven by misplaced nationalism  Design/methodology/approach: This study deploys a case-study approach, supported by literature on existing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine development efforts  Findings: Despite the seeming success of recent COVID-19 vaccines, their actual efficacy is far from certain  Moreover, access to these vaccines would not be equitable internationally  This problem is exacerbated by the fact that their unique properties make storage and distribution prohibitively expensive, and international mechanisms to provide distribution to economically depressed regions are non-existent  Given the significant difficulties, it would be incumbent upon the great powers (i e  China and America) to work together not only in vaccine development but also in the establishment of a distribution platform to ensure equitable access worldwide  Originality/value: This study is one of the few social science research papers on COVID-19 vaccine development and its implications for society at large  © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited","Wong, W.

38,Impact of COVID-19 social media news on employee behavior: the mediating role of psychological well-being and depression,"Purpose: The study's objective is to examine the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) social media news (SMN) on work boredom (WB) and task performance (TP)  The study proposes that psychological well-being (PWB) and depression mediate the relationship between COVID-19 SMN, WB and TP  Design/methodology/approach: The data for this research was collected from white-collar employees of two Asian countries, Pakistan (study 1, n = 167) and Malaysia (study 2, n = 118), was collected using an online survey during strict movement control order (MCO), work from home, at the beginning of the year 2020  Findings: In both studies, the PWB of employees mediated the relationship between COVID-19 SMN and their WB  On the other hand, depression only mediated the relationship between COVID-19 SMN and WB in Pakistan  PWB only mediated the relationship between COVID-19 SMN and TP in study 2  Depression only mediated the relationship between COVID-19 SMN and TP in study 1  Research limitations/implications: A couple of limitations worth noting are that the study adopted a cross-sectional approach  Thus, the sample size is not large in both counties  Because of the outbreak, limited employees agree to be part of an online survey  The scope of the study also restricts the authors to collect data during MCO, when employees were forced to work from home  In Pakistan, MCO began on 20th March and ended on 30th April, while in Malaysia, MCO started on 18th March and ended on 12th May  This also limits the study's claim of generalizability  Practical implications: The practical implication of the study is to guide practitioners of both Pakistan and Malaysia in developing strategies that help them understand that employees having PWB look for growth and challenging opportunities even during pandemic situations;employers can leverage it to deal with external threats like COVID-19 because improving the PWB can improve TP and reduce WB  The interesting results highlighted the fact that high TP not necessarily means everything is fine with employees, when the uncertainty level is high, employees may be performing well due to fear and depression instead of work motivation  Thus, employers should be more vigilant during a pandemic situation  This study also helps policymakers understand that the overall economic situation affects the individual employee’s state of mind and work behavior  Originality/value: The paper contributes to scare literature on COVID-19 and SMN and illustrates employees' work behavior when forced to work from home during the MCO  © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited","Anwar, A.; Kee, D.

46,A French point of view on COVID-19 and obesity,"Beyond age, which remain the main risk factor, there is a wide range of comorbidity associated with severe forms of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)  Obesity is the only one that generated such a strong, almost discriminatory reaction in society or in the medical field  Is this hammering a relevant and efficient way of addressing the issue of the aggravating relationship between COVID-19 and obesity? Pointing out the topic of obesity has an immediate impact on patients’ mental health, adding up to increased difficulties they already experience, mental distress being directly associated to the perception of the discrimination they face  The massive and obsessing reiteration (so much that it ends up inducing culpability) of the vulnerability of obese patients is likely to generate or increase mental disorders that will, in turn, aggravate binge eating and reinforce the medical distancing already observed in this population  Behaviors initiated by the unprecedented situation of the lock down and the alarmist discussions about food and health are so contradictory that their impact of cognitive restraint may induce or worsen eating disorders in patients  © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS","Tubiana, A.; Morvan, R.; Garcia, S.; Lecerf, J.

72,Continuity of care in a psychiatric Day Hospital during the COVID-19 emergency Transformations of therapeutic models between crisis and change,"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged our treatment models, leading our team to rethink and share strategies of care, in order to ensure the continuity of therapeutic relationships during the precarious context of the pandemic  Objective: To evaluate the feasibility and perceived efficacy of a remote therapeutic intervention in the treatment of patients in a psychiatric Day Hospital (DH)  Methods: A group of 48 children and adolescents (64 6% female, age from 9 to 19 years, mean age 15 2 years and SD 2 50), already in treatment for severe and complex psychopathology at the psychiatric-therapeutic DH of the Child Neuropsychiatry Service of the Regina Margherita Hospital of Turin prior to the COVID-19 emergency, received remotely a multidisciplinary intervention for 90 days, with maintenance of the weekly / multi-weekly therapeutic session and additional contacts based on individual needs  Patients were prospectively assessed, at the lockdown onset (T0) and after 30 (T1), 60 (T2) and 90 days (T3), with clinical evaluation of the overall severity of psychopathology using the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity scales (CGI-S) and -Improvement (CGI-I) and monitoring suicidal ideation or behavior, non-suicidal self-harm (NSSI) and social withdrawal  Patients and parents were asked to indicate on a Likert scale the perceived usefulness of the telemedicine interventions  Data were analyzed with non-parametric tests and an ordinal logistic regression analysis was performed  Results: An average of 5 4 remote interventions per patient per week (min: 2, max: 9) were provided, without any complete drop-out  During the 90 days of the intervention, no suicide attempt was recorded  Three patients (6 2%), were hospitalized  CGI-S scores indicated a significant reduction in the severity of illness between T0 and T3 (p = 0 03), with improvement in 45 8% of patients, worsening in 25%, and no change in the remaining 29 2%  Clinical improvement was more evident among patients without social withdrawal than in those with social withdrawal (p 0 04)  Suicidal thoughts were reported by 35 4% of the participants at T0 and 20 8% at T3  Based on information from patients, parents and educators, NSSI was present in 22 9% at T0 and in 12 5% at T3 (p = 0 063)  Of the patients with NSSI at T0, 45 4% showed a reduction of self-injury  There were no newly reported cases of NSSI during the 90 days of intervention  Individual NPI visits were rated from moderately to extremely useful by 92 3% of the patients, and 82% of the parents rated from moderately to extremely useful NPI visits, psychotherapy sessions and teaching  Conclusions: The remote intervention during the lockdown period COVID-19 was feasible, well accepted by patients and parents and accompanied by indicators of improvement, despite the necessary suspension of in person DH treatments  It is conceivable to hypothesize that the continuity of care through telemedicine and the flexibility of the multidisciplinary model helped patients maintain the therapeutic alliance  (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Abstract (Italian) Introduzione: La pandemia da COVID-19 ha messo alla prova i nostri modelli di cura lanciando nello stesso tempo una sfida: ripensarli e condividerli, per garantire continuita di relazione terapeutica pur in un contesto di emergenza e precarieta  Obiettivo: Valutare la fattibilita e efficacia percepita di un intervento terapeutico da remoto nel trattamento di pazienti in un Day Hospital psichiatrico (DH)  Metodi: Un gruppo di 48 bambini e adolescenti (64,6% di sesso femminile, eta da 9 a 19 anni, eta media 15,2 e DS 2,50), gia in trattamento per psicopatologia grave e complessa presso il DH psichiatrico-terapeutico del Servizio di Neuropsichiatria Infantile dell'Ospedale Regina Margherita di Torino nel periodo precedente all'emergenza sanitaria, hanno ricevuto un intervento multidisciplinare da remoto per 90 giorni: mantenimento dei setting terapeutici settimanali/plurisettimanali e contatti in urgenza in base ai bisogni individuali dei pa ienti  I pazienti sono stati seguiti nel tempo, prima dell'intervento (T0) e dopo 30 (T1), 60 (T2), e 90 giorni (T3), con valutazione clinica della gravita complessiva della psicopatologia mediante le scale Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) e -Improvement (CGI-I) e monitoraggio di possibile ideazione o comportamento suicidari, autolesionismo non suicidario (NSSI), e ritiro sociale  A pazienti e genitori e stato chiesto di indicare su scala Likert l'utilita percepita degli interventi erogati in modalita telematica  I dati sono stati analizzati con test non parametrici ed e stata effettuata un'analisi di regressione logistica ordinale  Risultati: Gli interventi erogati a distanza sono stati in media 5,4 per paziente per settimana (min: 2;max: 9)  Nessun paziente ha abbandonato il trattamento  Non si sono verificati drop out completi rispetto alla presa in carico  Non si sono verificati tentativi di suicidio  Per 3 pazienti (6 2%) si e reso necessario programmare un ricovero  La CGI-S ha indicato una significativa riduzione della severita del quadro clinico (p = 0,03), con un miglioramento nel 45,8% dei pazienti, una stazionarieta nel 29,2% e peggioramento nel 25%  Il miglioramento clinico si e reso piu evidente nel gruppo di pazienti senza ritiro sociale rispetto al gruppo di pazienti con ritiro sociale (p = 0,04)  Ideazione suicidaria era presente nel 35,4% dei pazienti a T0 e nel 20,8% a T3  Sulla base delle dichiarazioni dei pazienti, dei genitori e degli educatori, i pazienti con NSSI a T0 erano il 22,9% e a T3 il 12,5% (p = 0,063)  Tra i pazienti con NSSI a T0 si e riscontrata una riduzione del NSSI a T3  Non si sono registrati nuovi casi di NSSI  Le visite NPI sono state valutate da moderatamente a estremamente utili dal 92,3% dei pazienti e l'82% dei genitori ha valutato da moderatamente a estremamente utili le visite NPI, le sedute di psicoterapia e la didattica a distanza  Conclusioni: L'intervento a distanza durante il periodo di lockdown COVID-19 si e dimostrato fattibile, ben accettato da pazienti e genitori, e accompagnato da indici di miglioramento, nonostante la necessaria sospensione dei trattamenti in presenza  E ipotizzabile che la continuita del trattamento e la flessibilita del modello multidisciplinare, anche in modalita telematica, abbiano consentito ai pazienti di mantenere l'alleanza terapeutica e di conservare la fiducia nella relazione di cura  (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights

In order to summarize the current evidence, we present a narrative review of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. So far, the presence of anxiety, depression, and stress has been reported mostly in general population. Nonetheless, mental health issues have also been reported in health care workers, especially among female professionals, nurses, and those who work directly with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19.

Az elmúlt hónapokban életünket alapvetoen megváltoztatta a COVID-19-pandémia, melynek egészségügyi, gazdasági és társadalmi hatásai egyelore szinte felbecsülhetetlenek. A vírusfertozés akut következményei mellett egyre több adat bizonyítja a teljes népességre kifejtett hatásait: a pszichológiai distressz, a depressziós és szorongásos tünetek, valamint az addiktív viselkedésformák gyakoriságának növekedését. Az is nagyon fontos kérdés, hogy a globális válsághelyzet hogyan befolyásolja az öngyilkossági arányszámokat. Írásomban az elmúlt idoszak legjelentosebb pszichiátriai szakirodalma alapján foglalom össze a vírusfertozés akut és krónikus hatásait, valamint a járványhelyzet általános és specifikus pszichológiai-pszichopatológiai következményeit, kiemelt figyelmet fordítva a suicidiumrizikóra és a leginkább veszélyeztetett csoportokra. A vizsgálatok arra utalnak, hogy a pandémia következtében kialakuló mentális gondok és a suicid viselkedés egyre fontosabb népegészségügyi problémává válnak. Bár napjainkban még a vírusfertozöttek gyógyítása és a fertozés terjedésének lassítása a legfontosabb cél, mindannyiunknak fel kell készülnünk a járvány hosszú távú következményeire. A pandémia várható negatív mentálhigiénés hatásainak megelozésére és enyhítésére általános és specifikus módszerek kidolgozása és alkalmazása szükséges. Ebben az egészségügyi, mentálhigiénés és közösségi ellátórendszerek mellett szerepet kell vállalniuk a politikai és gazdasági döntéshozóknak, a társadalmi szervezeteknek és a média munkatársainak is. Hatékony együttmuködésük kulcsfontosságú az egyéni, közösségi és társadalmi szinten is alkalmazható prevenciós stratégiák megvalósításában, hiszen csak így válik lehetové a súlyosabb mentálhigiénés problémák járványszeru elterjedésének, a ""pszichodémiának"" a megelozése. Orv Hetil. 2021; 162(10): 366-374. Summary. In recent months, our lives have been fundamentally changed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the health, economic, and social impacts of which are almost invaluable for the time being. In addition to the acute consequences of viral infection, more and more data are proving its effects on the entire population: an increase in the incidence of psychological distress, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and addictive behaviours. It is also a very important question, how the global crisis is affecting suicide rates. In my paper, I summarize the acute and chronic effects of viral infection and the general and specific psychological-psychopathological consequences of the epidemic based on the most significant psychiatric literature of the recent period, paying special attention to suicidal risk and the most vulnerable groups. Studies suggest that mental troubles and suicidal behaviour resulting from a pandemic are becoming an increasingly important public health problem. Although the treatment of viral infections and slowing the spread of the infection are still the most important goals today, we all need to be prepared for the long-term consequences of the epidemic. In order to prevent and mitigate the expected negative mental health effects of a pandemic, it is necessary to develop and apply general and specific methods. In addition to health care, mental health and community care systems, political and economic decision-makers, civil society organizations and the media must also play a role. Their effective cooperation is key to the implementation of prevention strategies that can be applied at the individual, community and social levels, as this is the only way to prevent the epidemic spread of more serious mental health problems, the ""psychodemia"".

A total of 1172 (683 female and 489 male) children and adolescents aged 8-18 years were involved in completing the measurements of PTSD, GAD, perceived threat of COVID-19, and COVID-19-related courtesy stigma. The Latent Profile Analysis identified the three profiles of the symptoms for PTSD and GAD which were labeled as Moderate PTSD, Mild Comorbidity, and Severe Comorbidity. The scores of the symptoms for PTSD, GAD, perceived threat, and stigma were different among the three profiles. The risk factors (i.e., perceived threat and stigma) that are related to comorbidity patterns were examined through a three-step method. The possibility of entry into the Severe Comorbidity Profile increased with increasing perceived threat and stigma. The mental health care interventions for children and adolescents who are susceptible to COVID-19 can be developed to reduce perceived threat and stigma.","Li, Yumei; Duan, Wenjie; Chen, Zheng",https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105235,,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Child Youth Serv Rev;116: 105235, 2020 Sep.; Publication details: Child Youth Serv Rev;116: 105235, 2020 Sep.; Publication type: article",WHO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
88,Les enfants suivis en psychiatrie infanto-juvénile ont ils connu la dégradation redoutée pendant la période de confinement liée à la pandémie COVID-19?,"Résumé Objectifs: La période de confinement qui s’est déroulée en France de la mi-mars à la mi-mai 2020, à l’occasion de la pandémie COVID-19, soulève d’importantes questions sur ses effets psychologiques directs et indirects chez les enfants et adolescents  Considérée intuitivement comme nuisible, voire traumatisante dans le discours médiatique, nous avons tenté de mieux qualifier ses effets à partir de deux démarches complémentaires D’une part, nous avons réalisé une revue de la littérature sur le sujet, d’autre part, nous y avons associé une objectivation de l’évolution de l’état clinique global des enfants au sein de la file active du service de psychiatrie infanto-juvénile du CHRU de Brest pendant la période de confinement La revue de la littérature portant sur les effets psychologiques de situations de confinement ou de quarantaine à l’occasion d’épidémies passées ou actuelle de COVID-19, notamment en Chine, rapporte de nombreuses données sur leurs conséquences délétères  Les effets relatés sont de nature variable: symptômes anxieux et dépressifs principalement, mais aussi Stress Post Traumatique, dans des proportions importantes  Cependant, la définition des situations vécues et les contextes dans lesquels se sont déroulées ces études sont en fait peu comparables à la situation française  Par ailleurs, les effets de la peur de la contamination n’y sont pas différenciés de ceux liés au confinement lui-même  Patients et méthodes: 354 enfants et adolescents suivis dans le service ont bénéficié d’une mesure de l’impact du confinement sur leur état clinique global évalué à la Clinical Global Impression Improvement (CGI-I) par leur praticien habituel au cours de la période du 16 mars au 11 mai 2020  Résultats: Nos résultats mettent en évidence que 50% des enfants ont connu un état clinique global inchangé en comparaison à leur état avant le confinement, 25 à 30% ont connu une amélioration et 20 à 25% ont montré une légère dégradation pendant la période de confinement  L’état décrit est globalement stable dans le temps au cours des huit semaines de la durée du confinement  L’âge ou la sévérité préalable de la pathologie n’a pas d’influence significative, même si on note une amélioration globale plus fréquente chez les adolescents  Conclusion: Ces résultats sont assez discordants avec le discours général  Plusieurs hypothèses sont discutées pour expliquer les raisons de cette absence de dégradation qui pourrait éventuellement être étendue aux enfants et adolescents en général pendant cette période  Background: The general lockdown period during the COVID-19 pandemic which covered mid-March to mid-May 2020 in France raised important questions about the direct and indirect psychological effects on children and adolescents  Perceived intuitively as harmful and even traumatic in the media’s discourse, we tried to better qualify its effects from two complementary approaches  We carried out a review of the literature on the subject to which we associated a regular assessment of the children's global clinical state in the entire active file of the child-psychiatry department of the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Brest throughout the lockdown period  The findings of the literature review on the psychological effects of lockdowns or quarantines during past or current epidemics, in particular in China, report many deleterious and variable effects such as symptoms of anxiety, depression, as well as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, at a significant rate  However, the definition of the situations experienced and the contexts in which those studies took place appear to be not truly comparable to the French situation  Moreover, the effects of the fear of contamination are not differentiated from those linked to confinement itself  Patients and methods: 354 children and adolescents under the care of the above department underwent an assessment of the impact of lockdown on their global clinical condition using the Clinical Global Impression Improvement (CGI-I) performed by their usual practitioner during the period from March 16 to May 11, 2020  Results: Our results highlight that 50% of children remained in stable condition, 25 to 30% improved and 20 to 25% experienced a slight degradation  The evolution of the clinical status appeared stable over time during the eight weeks  The initial age or severity of mental disorder had no significant influence, although there was a slightly more frequent improvement in adolescents  Conclusion: These results are quite inconsistent with general discourse and common expectations  Several psychopathological hypotheses are discussed to support this absence of psychological degradation which might even be extended to children and adolescents in the general population","Lavenne-Collot,

93,Italian Nurses' experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative analysis of internet posts,"To investigate the experience of Italian nurses during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak by analysing professional social media posts. The COVID-19 outbreak has overwhelmed health care institutions; as a consequence, nurses' lives and psycho-physical health have been affected. The COVID-19 pandemic forced nurses to work in physically and psychologically stressful conditions impacting on their life. A qualitative descriptive study. All narratives (texts and videos) posted by nurses from the 23<sup>rd</sup> of February 2020 to the 3<sup>rd</sup> of May (from the start of the outbreak to the end of the first lockdown) were analysed and published on the five most popular Italian professional social media platforms. The Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative research guidelines were followed. Five themes emerged from the 380 narratives explored: 'Sharing what is happening within myself'; 'Experiencing unprecedented working conditions'; 'Experiencing a deep change'; 'Failing to rehabilitate the image of nurses in society'; and 'Do not abandon us'. Even though nurses appreciated the recognition of their communities, they still felt devalued and not recognized as professionals. Several psychological, physical, social and professional implications emerged from nurses working during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite being highly praised, nurses perceived they had failed in rehabilitating the image of nurses in society. The experience of working during the COVID-19 pandemic represented a traumatic event for nurses but it offered them personal and professional growth opportunities. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE, NURSING POLICY AND HEALTH POLICY: Supporting nurses' mental health is highly recommended, together with a cultural investment on nurses' role recognition, and a zero-tolerance policy towards violence and aggression towards nurses.","Fontanini, Visintini, Rossettini, Caruzzo, Longhini, Palese",https://doi.org/10.1111/inr.12669,20210317.0,COVID-19; Experience; Mental health; Nurses; Nursing practice; Public image; Social media,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

The present study aimed to clarify the prevalence of psychological distress and determine the population most affected by risk factors such as the pandemic, socioeconomic status (SES), and lifestyle-related factors causing psychological distress in the early phases of the pandemic in Japan. This study was conducted via a web-based survey using quota sampling to ensure representativeness of the Japanese population aged 20-64 years. A cross-sectional study of 11,342 participants (5,734 males and 5,608 females) was conducted using a self-administered questionnaire that included the Japanese version of the Kessler 6 Psychological Distress Scale (K6) and questions related to the pandemic, SES, and lifestyle. The prevalence of psychological distress, represented by a K6 score of 5 or more, was 50.3% among males and 52.6% among females. Both males and females with annual household incomes less than 2 million yen and males aged in their twenties had significantly higher K6 scores than those with annual household incomes above 2 million yen and males aged over 30 years. Binary logistic regression analyses found pandemic-related factors such as medical history, inability to undergo clinical tests immediately, having trouble in daily life, unavailability of groceries, new work style, and vague anxiety; SES-related factors such as lesser income; and lifestyle-related factors such as insufficient rest, sleep, and nutritious meals to be significantly related to psychological distress. Psychological distress was more prevalent among people with low income and in younger generations than among other groups. There is an urgent need to provide financial, medical, and social support to those affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.","Nagasu, Muto, Yamamoto",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0247705,20210317.0,,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

A total of 4,087 pregnant women from China completed a cross-sectional online survey between 3 to 10 March 2020. The prevalence of probable depression and anxiety was 48.7% and 33.0% respectively; 23.8% reported always wearing face mask when going out. Between 32.1% to 36.4% of participants perceived themselves or their family members susceptible to COVID-19 infection, between 78.7% to 86.1% agreed the disease would have various severe consequences. Between 54.7% to 55.7% showed self-efficacy in protecting themselves or their family members from contracting COVID-19; 31.8% reported a high level of fear to the disease, and 68% to 74.8% showed worries about various aspects of COVID-19. Results from multivariate multinominal logistic regressions showed that perceived severity, perceived impact, fear and worry were risk factors, while self-efficacy was a protective factor for probable depression and anxiety. Results from multivariate logistic regression showed that perceived susceptibility was associated with always wearing face mask. Chinese pregnant women showed high level of mental distress but low level of personal protective behavior during the COVID-19 period. Interventions are needed to promote their mental health and health behavior.","Mo, Fong, Song, Di, Wang, Wang",https://doi.org/10.2196/24053,20210317.0,,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
97,Living in opposition: How women in the United States cope in spite of mistrust of federal leadership during the pandemic of Covid-19,"International research collaborators conducted research investigating sociocultural responses to the Covid-19 pandemic. Our mixed methods research design includes surveys and interviews conducted between March and September of 2020 including 249 of 506 survey responses and 18 of 50 in-depth, exploratory, semi-structured interviews with self-defined politically left-leaning women in the United States. We employ a sequential design to analyze statistical and qualitative data. Despite international data suggesting that trust in federal governments reduces anxiety, women who did not trust and actively opposed the Trump administration reported lower levels of anxiety than expected. Results indicate reliance on and development of new forms of connection that seem to mitigate symptomatic anxieties when living in opposition. Women living in opposition to the leadership of the federal government use and develop resources to help them cope. Research on coping strategies and mental health and anxiety during crisis can inform recommendations for ways to support and strengthen sense of coherence during tumultuous times.","Hardy, Mana, Mundell, Benheim, Morales, Sagy",https://doi.org/10.1002/jcop.22544,20210317.0,Covid-19; anxiety; health equity; mixed methods; pandemic; politics; women,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
98,"Bushfires, COVID-19 and Australian community pharmacists: ongoing impact on mental health and wellbeing","The nation was recovering from the aftermath of the catastrophic 2019-2020 bushfires when the first cases of the COVID-19 pandemic emerged in Australia. During the peak of the pandemic, Australia closed both its state and international borders to all travelers and interstate travel was very tightly regulated. Community pharmacists and pharmacy staff were one of the very few primary healthcare workers still serving their communities during these periods of strict lockdown. In this personal view article, the challenges and their toll on the mental health and wellbeing of these &quot;essential workers&quot; are described. Community pharmacists and pharmacy staff were under immense pressure to remain open and serve their communities amidst rapidly changing legislation and, at times, conflicting advice from the range of Australian health agencies. Rapid changes to workload and workflow were combined with the dilemma of balancing professional obligations with the personal duty of keeping themselves and their sometimes geographically distant families safe. Fluctuating demands and traumatic situations found community pharmacy staff often feeling distressed and underprepared. Despite a global pandemic following a season of extraordinary bushfires, it has barely been acknowledged that community pharmacy staff are one of the highest risk groups for long-term psychological impacts. To our knowledge, very little research has addressed the toll of these cataclysmic events on this group of essential healthcare workers.","McCallum, Dunkley, Hotham, Suppiah",https://doi.org/10.1093/ijpp/riaa020,20210317.0,,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
99,Four-Month Clinical Status of a Cohort of Patients After Hospitalization for COVID-19,"Little is known about long-term sequelae of COVID-19. To describe the consequences at 4 months in patients hospitalized for COVID-19. In a prospective uncontrolled cohort study, survivors of COVID-19 who had been hospitalized in a university hospital in France between March 1 and May 29, 2020, underwent a telephone assessment 4 months after discharge, between July 15 and September 18, 2020. Patients with relevant symptoms and all patients hospitalized in an intensive care unit (ICU) were invited for further assessment at an ambulatory care visit. Survival of hospitalization for COVID-19. Respiratory, cognitive, and functional symptoms were assessed by telephone with the Q3PC cognitive screening questionnaire and a checklist of symptoms. At the ambulatory care visit, patients underwent pulmonary function tests, lung computed tomographic scan, psychometric and cognitive tests (including the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey and 20-item Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory), and, for patients who had been hospitalized in the ICU or reported ongoing symptoms, echocardiography. Among 834 eligible patients, 478 were evaluated by telephone (mean age, 61 years [SD, 16 years]; 201 men, 277 women). During the telephone interview, 244 patients (51%) declared at least 1 symptom that did not exist before COVID-19: fatigue in 31%, cognitive symptoms in 21%, and new-onset dyspnea in 16%. There was further evaluation in 177 patients (37%), including 97 of 142 former ICU patients. The median 20-item Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory score (nâ€‰=â€‰130) was 4.5 (interquartile range, 3.0-5.0) for reduced motivation and 3.7 (interquartile range, 3.0-4.5) for mental fatigue (possible range, 1 [best] to 5 [worst]). The median 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey score (nâ€‰=â€‰145) was 25 (interquartile range, 25.0-75.0) for the subscale &quot;role limited owing to physical problems&quot; (possible range, 0 [best] to 100 [worst]). Computed tomographic lung-scan abnormalities were found in 108 of 171 patients (63%), mainly subtle ground-glass opacities. Fibrotic lesions were observed in 33 of 171 patients (19%), involving less than 25% of parenchyma in all but 1 patient. Fibrotic lesions were observed in 19 of 49 survivors (39%) with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Among 94 former ICU patients, anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic symptoms were observed in 23%, 18%, and 7%, respectively. The left ventricular ejection fraction was less than 50% in 8 of 83 ICU patients (10%). New-onset chronic kidney disease was observed in 2 ICU patients. Serology was positive in 172 of 177 outpatients (97%). Four months after hospitalization for COVID-19, a cohort of patients frequently reported symptoms not previously present, and lung-scan abnormalities were common among those who were tested. These findings are limited by the absence of a control group and of pre-COVID assessments in this cohort. Further research is needed to understand longer-term outcomes and whether these findings reflect associations with the disease.","Morin, Savale, Pham, Colle, Figueiredo, Harrois, Gasnier, Lecoq, Meyrignac, Noel, Baudry, Bellin, Beurnier, Choucha, Corruble, Dortet, Hardy-Leger, Radiguer, Sportouch, Verny, Wyplosz, Zaidan, Becquemont, Montani, Monnet",https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2021.3331,20210317.0,,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
100,Managing noncommunicable diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil: findings from the PAMPA cohort,"The objective was to identify the impact of social distance in the management of noncommunicable diseases (NCD) in the adult population from the state of Rio Grande do Sul, southern Brazil. This is an ambispective, population-based cohort study. Descriptive analysis and Poisson regression models were used and the results were reported as prevalence ratio and 95% confidence intervals. From a total of 1,288 participants, 43.1% needed medical care and 28.5% reported impaired management of NCDs during social distance. Female sex, age between 18 and 30 years old, living in the Serra region (central region of the state), people with depression and multimorbidity were more likely to have impaired management of NCDs. Being physically active reduced the probability of having impaired management of NCD by 15%. Reduced monthly income was associated with the difficulty in accessing prescription medicine and avoidance of seeking in-person medical assistance. Depression was associated with difficulties in accessing medications, while avoidance of seeking in-person medical assistance was more likely for people with multimorbidity, arthritis/arthrosis/fibromyalgia, heart disease, and high cholesterol.","Leite, Feter, Caputo, Doring, Cassuriaga, Reichert, Silva, Rombaldi",https://doi.org/10.1590/1413-81232021263.39232020,20210317.0,,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
101,Social representations of media reception during the COVID-19 lockdown in Colombia: from messages to meanings,"Recent studies on COVID-19 have focused on the pandemic's effects on public health and the biosafety controls and their socioeconomic implications. The current mixed-methods study takes a new look at the topic, combining qualitative and quantitative strategies to identify the social representations of media reception in a sector of the Colombian population during social isolation in the COVID-19 pandemic. The results indicate that these representations vary and are associated with the media channel and the effect the reception produces on mood and mental health. A total of 80 interviews and 1,068 online survey forms were applied in different regions of Colombia. The qualitative phase showed that the programs or messages received were represented positively when they came from audiovisual entertainment and contributed to the family unit and reduced stress during the lockdown. Meanwhile, media reception was represented negatively when the messages or news came from journalism or social networks and increased the misinformation, anxiety, and fear of contagion. The quantitative phase found that media reception decreased as the lockdown continued, due to information saturation and the proliferation of news emphasizing the risks of COVID-19. The results reveal the need to focus health communication on the development of information skills that allow people to learn and assess the veracity and relevance of information received during the pandemic. Las investigaciones recientes sobre la COVID-19 se han centrado en los efectos de esta pandemia en la salud pÃºblica, asÃ­ como en los controles de bioseguridad y sus implicaciones socioeconÃ³micas. El presente estudio mixto aporta una nueva mirada acerca del tema, combinando estrategias cualitativas y cuantitativas para identificar las representaciones sociales de la recepciÃ³n mediÃ¡tica, en un sector de la poblaciÃ³n en Colombia, durante la cuarentena por la COVID-19. Los resultados indican que estas representaciones son diversas y estÃ¡n asociadas con el canal mediÃ¡tico y la afectaciÃ³n que produce la recepciÃ³n en el estado de Ã¡nimo y la salud mental. En total, se realizaron 80 entrevistas y 1.068 encuestas online en diferentes regiones de Colombia. En la fase cualitativa se encontrÃ³ que los programas o mensajes recibidos fueron representados positivamente, cuando provienen de la recepciÃ³n de entretenimiento audiovisual y contribuye a la unidad familiar y a reducir el estrÃ©s en la cuarentena. De modo contrario, la recepciÃ³n mediÃ¡tica fue representada negativamente, cuando los mensajes o noticias recibidas provienen del periodismo o las redes sociales y aumenta la desinformaciÃ³n, la angustia y el miedo al contagio. En la fase cuantitativa se encontrÃ³ que la recepciÃ³n mediÃ¡tica disminuyÃ³ a medida que trascurrÃ­a la cuarentena, debido a la sobresaturaciÃ³n informativa y a la proliferaciÃ³n de noticias que enfatizan los riesgos de la COVID-19. Los resultados revelan la necesidad de enfocar la comunicaciÃ³n en salud al desarrollo de habilidades informacionales que permitan a la ciudadanÃ­a aprender a evaluar la veracidad y relevancia de la informaciÃ³n recibida en la pandemia.

102,Addressing Stress in High School Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Safety isolation protocols in response to the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic have had the unintended consequence of social isolation for adolescents, youth who have a developmental need for autonomy and peer connection. Social isolation alone can lead to various psychological effects such as anxiety, stress, low mood, fear, frustration, and boredom. School nurses serve a vital role in addressing stress among adolescents by initiating early interventions, ensuring positive school experiences for students, and providing support surrounding the development of mental health disorders. Through implementation of NASN's Framework for 21st Century School Nursing Practice, school nurses address stress among high school students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Innovative interventions can include recognizing signs and symptoms of stress on physical and emotional health, advocating for mental health literacy curriculums, social prescribing, incorporating anticipatory guidance related to health promotion lifestyle practices into each school health encounter, and creating a virtual school health office to reach students while COVID-19 safety isolation continues.","Williams, Morse, DeGraffenried, McAuliffe",https://doi.org/10.1177/1942602X21993053,20210317.0,COVID-19; adolescents; high school students; school nurse; school-related stress,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
103,"Identifying Psychological Perceptions of People Ignoring the Novel COVID-19 Warnings: A Qualitative Thematic Analysis in Isfahan, Iran","Psychological factors are important for the prevention of disease. This study aims to identify the psychological perceptions of people who are ignoring the warnings of novel COVID-19 infection. A qualitative content analysis was carried out from May to July 2020. The interviewees were selected purposefully from Isfahan, Iran. The saturation point was achieved in 20 semi-structured interviews. The thematic analysis approach was used to analyze the transcribed documents using MAXQDA software (version 12).The results revealed 2 themes and 6 sub-themes related to the psychological beliefs of individuals with no attention to corona alerts. Themes and sub-themes included Biased cognitive processing (biased beliefs, attention biases, metacognitive beliefs and Depressogenic schemata), low compassion, and empathy for oneself and others (Negative Emotions towards Oneself, low altruism). To ensure a positive attitude towards precautionary measures in society, the thoughts, perceptions, and behaviors of people who ignore coronavirus alerts need to be changed. This is achieved through the use of mass media and virtual networks, by encouraging people to change their negative attitude towards the use of preventive measures, individual and social protection campaigns, and by fostering a sense of responsibility.","Nosratabadi, Halvaiepour",https://doi.org/10.1007/s12124-021-09608-w,20210317.0,Coronavirus; Psychological perceptions; Qualitative study,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

New self-care practices are presented. Globally, thousands of health care practitioners and staff have been infected; many have died. Research studies reveal that this pandemic has threatened the health of healthcare staff, their families, and communities in many unique ways, such as fear of infecting family (lack of safety at home), moral injury, witnessing the suffering of the &quot;innocent,&quot; coping with a problem too big to solve (the enormity problem), and racial trauma. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the global population in ways not seen in a century. The unique self-care challenges of COVID-19 while enhancing the symptoms of burnout, i.e., physical, and mental exhaustion, despair, helplessness, and suicidal thinking, need to be addressed directly.

105,Analysing the impact of COVID-19 on the mothers of Bangladesh: hearing the unheard,"The purpose of this empirical study was to understand, explore and analyse how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the mothers of our society, with particular emphasis on Bangladesh, which has so far been a relatively unexplored area. The study adopted qualitative and interpretative methods of social research, including content analysis and a perception study of 223 respondents through a semi-structured questionnaire survey, who were selected using purposive random sampling. The data obtained from the perception study was further complemented through phone interviews. The study found that the pandemic has not affected all mothers uniformly; rather, the intensity of its impact varied depending on factors such as the occupation of mothers and their husbands and their family pattern. Despite such variation, all mothers experienced a subsequent increase in workload, challenges while availing routine health facilities and higher levels of stress, anxiety, depression and certain behavioural changes. However, the worst affected have been the mothers belonging to the lower socio-economic strata because the pandemic has made them and their husbands jobless, leading them towards an uncertain future.","Ehsan, Jahan",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10389-021-01501-5,20210317.0,Anxiety; Covid-19; Mothers; Pandemic; Stress; Workload,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
106,Mental health in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic: A longitudinal examination of the ameliorating effect of meaning salience,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, various restrictions forced people around the world to socially isolate. People were asked to stay at home and were largely unable to do many of the activities that they derived meaning from. Since meaning is often related to mental health, these restrictions were likely to decrease mental health. The current study aimed to examine these effects and additionally benefit individuals' mental health by making their meaning salient. Specifically, the goal of the research was to design an intervention that could counter the potential negative effects of social distancing. We recruited a total of 96Â U.S.A. residents (<i>M</i><sub> <i>age</i> </sub> â€‰=â€‰34.45, 92.7% Female) and assigned them to either the control group or to a meaning salience intervention. That is, participants either focused on the meaning of their daily activities (<i>n</i>â€‰=â€‰45) or did not participate in any study-related activities during the week (<i>n</i>â€‰=â€‰51). They completed various measures of mental health before and after this experimental period. Results suggested that the control group reported significantly greater anxiety, depression, and stress at the end of the week. In contrast, the experimental group reported less anxiety and trended toward less depression and stress at the end of that same week. In all, results suggest that simply focusing on one's daily activities and the meaning found in them protected people fromÂ the otherwise detrimental effects of the restrictions. This provides a promising and simple intervention that may assist both individuals and practitioners aiming to improve mental health, especially in challenging times.","Klussman, Nichols, Langer",https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-01538-5,20210317.0,Anxiety; Depression; Meaning in life; Meaning salience; Stress,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
107,[Did child-psychiatry patients really experience the dreaded clinical degradation during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown?],"The general lockdown period during the COVID-19 pandemic which covered mid-March to mid-May 2020 in France raised important questions about the direct and indirect psychological effects on children and adolescents. Perceived intuitively as harmful and even traumatic in the media's discourse, we tried to better qualify its effects from two complementary approaches. We carried out a review of the literature on the subject to which we associated a regular assessment of the children's global clinical state in the entire active file of the child-psychiatry department of the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Brest throughout the lockdown period.The findings of the literature review on the psychological effects of lockdowns or quarantines during past or current epidemics, in particular in China, report many deleterious and variable effects such as symptoms of anxiety, depression, as well as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, at a significant rate. However, the definition of the situations experienced and the contexts in which those studies took place appear to be not truly comparable to the French situation. Moreover, the effects of the fear of contamination are not differentiated from those linked to confinement itself. Among children and adolescents under the care of the above department, 354 underwent an assessment of the impact of lockdown on their global clinical condition using the Clinical Global Impression Improvement (CGI-I) performed by their usual practitioner during the period from March 16 to May 11, 2020. Our results highlight that 50% of children remained in stable condition, 25 to 30% improved and 20 to 25% experienced a slight degradation. The evolution of the clinical status appeared stable over time during the eight weeks. The initial age or severity of mental disorder had no significant influence, although there was a slightly more frequent improvement in adolescents. These results are quite inconsistent with general discourse and common expectations. Several psychopathological hypotheses are discussed to support this absence of psychological degradation which might even be extended to children and adolescents in the general population.","Lavenne-Collot, Ailliot, Badic, FavÃ©, FranÃ§ois, Saint-AndrÃ©, Thierry, Bronsard",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neurenf.2021.02.006,20210317.0,Adolescent; COVID-19; Child psychiatry; Children; Lockdown,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

However, Taiwan is a country with a low COVID-19 threat, and people's daily lives have remained mostly unchanged during this period. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the trend of trauma incidence and the service of trauma care is affected by the relatively minor COVID-19 pandemic in Taiwan. A single-institute, retrograde cohort study. An observational study based on the trauma registry of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (CGMH). Trauma patients presented to the emergency department of CGMH in the period of 1 January to 30 June 2020 (week 1 to week 26) were designated as the COVID-19 group, with 1980 patients in total. Patients of the same period in 2015-2019 were designated as the pre-COVID-19 group, with 10â€‰334 patients overall. The primary outcome is the incidence of trauma admission. Differences in trauma mechanism, severity, location and outcome were also compared in both groups. A decrease in trauma incidence during March and April 2020 was noticed. Significant change (p&lt;0.001) in trauma mechanisms was discovered, with decreased burn (5.8% vs 3.6%) and assault (4.8% vs 1.2%), and increased transport accidents (43.2% vs 47.2%) and suicide (0.2% vs 1.0%) in the COVID-19 cohort. A shift in injury locations was also found with a 5% decrement of workplace injuries (19.8% vs 14.8%, p&lt;0.001). The limited COVID-19 outbreak in Taiwan has led to a decreased incidence of trauma patients, and the reduction is mostly attributed to the decline in workplace injuries.","Kuo, Fu, Liao, Liao, Wu, Huang, Hsieh, Cheng",https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-046405,20210317.0,COVID-19; epidemiology; trauma management,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

A cross-sectional, mixed-methods survey. APNs in any UK setting. The survey was sent to an existing UK-wide cohort of APNs. 124 APNs responded (51%). UK-based APNs in this study reported shortages of staff (51%) and personal protective equipment (PPE) (68%) during the first 3â€‰months of the coronavirus outbreak. Almost half (47%) had considered leaving their job over the same 3â€‰months. Despite difficulties, there were reports of positive changes to working practice that have enhanced care. UK APNs report COVID-19-related shortages in staff and equipment across primary and secondary care and all regions of the UK. Shortages of PPE during a pandemic are known to be a factor in the development of mental health sequelae as well as a risk factor for increased turnover and retention issues. Half of APNs surveyed were considering a change in job. The UK risks a further crisis in staff morale and retention if this is not acknowledged and addressed. APNs also expressed concern about patients not receiving routine care as many specialties closed or reduced working during the crisis. However, there were also many examples of good practice, positive changes and innovation.","Wood, King, Senek, Robertson, Taylor, Tod, Ryan",https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-044139,20210317.0,COVID-19; health &amp; safety; health policy; rationing,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
110,The prevalence and risk factors for depressive symptoms in frontline nurses under COVID-19 pandemic based on a large cross-sectional study using the propensity score-matched method,"To explore the prevalence of depressive symptoms and the associated risk factors in frontline nurses under COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sectional study was conducted from February 20, 2020 to March 20, 2020 and involved 562 frontline nurses. The effective response rate was 87.68%. After propensity score matched, there were 498 participants left. Extensive characteristics, including demographics, dietary habits, life-related factors, work-related factors, and psychological factors were collected based on a self-reported questionnaire. Specific scales measured the levels of sleep quality, physical activity, depressive symptoms, perceived organization support and psychological capital. Adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were determined by binary paired logistic regression. Of the nurses enrolled in the study, 50.90% had depressive symptoms. Three independent risk factors were identified: poor sleep quality (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.608, 95% CI: 1.384-1.896), lower optimism of psychological capital (ORâ€‰=â€‰0.879, 95% CI: 0.805-0.960) and no visiting friend constantly (ORâ€‰=â€‰0.513, 95% CI: 0.286-0.920). This study revealed a considerable high prevalence of depressive symptoms in frontline nurses during the COVID-19 outbreak, and identified three risk factors, which were poor sleep quality, lower optimism of psychological capital, and no visiting friend constantly. Protecting mental health of nurses is important for COVID-19 pandemic control and their wellbeing. These findings enrich the existing theoretical model of depression and demonstrated a critical need for additional strategies that could address the mental health in frontline nurses for policymakers.","Wang, Dai, Yao, Zhu, Jiang, Li, Han",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03143-z,20210317.0,"Depressive symptoms; Nurse; Psychological capital; Sleep quality, depression",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
111,Physical and Mental Functions of Cardiovascular Disease Patients Decrease during the State of Emergency Initiated by the COVID-19 Pandemic in Japan,"We aimed to examine the differences in life-space mobility and quality of life (QoL) of patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) between the pre- and post-nationwide state of emergency initiated by the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Japan and to show the factors associated with the decrease in life-space mobility and QoL in these patients. We undertook a longitudinal study of 20 of 51 consecutive CVD patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) who met the study criteria. We used the Life-Space Assessment (LSA) tool to evaluate Life-space mobility and assessed QoL with the five-level EuroQoL five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) in Japanese. The LSA scores and EQ-5D-5L QoL score decreased significantly from the pre- to post-nationwide state of emergency in Japan (p &lt; 0.01). Î”LSA was significantly positively associated with body mass index and significantly negatively associated with knee extensor muscle strength and pre-LSA score (p &lt; 0.05). There were no significant relationships between Î”LSA and Î”EQ-5D-5L QoL scores and between Î”EQ-5D-5L QoL scores and patient characteristics. The policies promoted to address the state of emergency in Japan might affect life-space mobility and QoL of CAD patients. Moreover, CAD patients in Japan who were not obese and maintained their physical function and activity tended to refrain from activity during the period between the pre- and post-nationwide state of emergency.

112,Psychological impact of COVID-19 outbreak on health workers in a university hospital in Turkey,"We investigated the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in terms of stress, anxiety, depression, sleep quality and affecting factors on healthcare workers (HWs) without secondary trauma thus far in the period between the first cases in Turkey and the arrival of the first case in ahospital. This descriptive cross-sectional study included 169 HWs. We used Impact of Event Scale (IES-R), Depression Anxiety Stress Scale and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) for assessment. The mean age of HWs was 33.9Â±6.9 years and 56.2% were males. Of the HWs; 20.7% were nurses, 33.7% doctors and 45.6% staff members. IES-R classified the HWs as follows: 15.4% of them were affected mildly, 4.7% moderately and 9.5% of them were affected severely. 42.6% of HWs had apoor sleep quality. This study shows that how HWs were affected when the outbreak had not yet reached the hospital in which they work. In total, 29.6% of the HWs were psychologically affected by mild to severe levels from the outbreak in this period. The most prevalent psychological impact was poor sleep quality. Psychological impact on HWs may have begun before the outbreak reached the hospitals; therefore, necessary measures should be taken as early as possible.","Sahin, Arslan, Atalay, Demir, Elboga, AltÄ±ndaÄŸ",https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2021.1900578,20210317.0,COVID-19; Outbreak; anxiety; healthcare workers; stress,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
113,Short-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with a chronic pain disorder,"The current Covid-19 pandemic has already had a definite impact on the daily life of many people worldwide. It has been proposed that people with preexisting medical conditions will be harder hit by the pandemic and the subsequent measures to contain the spread of the disease. In this questionnaire-based, observational study, we aimed to assess the impact of the pandemic on patients with a chronic pain disorder, who are treated at a tertiary multidisciplinary pain center.Participants rated the impact of the pandemic on their chronic pain disorder using a self-designed questionnaire. Also, participants filled out the regular follow-up questionnaire to assess a chronic pain disorder measuring among other parameters pain intensity, symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, and pain-related quality of life.Of 136 eligible patients who presented to our pain center between May 5th and July 17th, 112 agreed to participate in the study (82.4%). Eighty two participants (73.2%) reported a deterioration of the pain disorder using the self-designed questionnaire. The more robust parameters of the regular follow-up questionnaire showed no relevant changes compared to data collected before the pandemic. We were not able to detect any demographic and medical parameters that were clinically relevantly associated with a higher impact of the pandemic.We conclude that a chronic pain disorder is a relatively stable disease that does not change significantly due to external factors, like the Covid-19 pandemic, even if the subjective impact is perceived to be high.","Lassen, Siam, Degenhart, Klier, Bundscherer, Lindenberg",https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000025153,20210317.0,,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
114,A randomized trial in the investigation of anxiety and depression in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),"In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern. A small proportion of patients infected with COVID-19 go on to develop pneumonia. We speculated that COVID-19 may be likely to result in psychological disorders such as anxiety and depression. In this study, we conducted an investigation of anxiety and depression in patients with COVID-19. Sixty-five COVID-19 patients were randomly enrolled into this study. Anxiety and depression among participants were measured through the completion of anonymous Chinese-language Zung self-rating anxiety scale and self-rating depression scale questionnaires. Data were analyzed using independent samples t-tests, Mann-Whitney U-tests, and Ï‡2 tests. The questionnaire results showed that 26.15% and 41.54% of participants suffered from anxiety and depression, respectively, although there was no significantly statistical difference between the proportions of COVID-19 patients with anxiety and depression. Statistically significant differences in employment status, partial pressure of oxygen, and corticosteroid application existed between moderate- and severe COVID-19 patients (P&lt;0.05). In particular, the partial pressure of oxygen was significantly lower in severe COVID-19 patients than in their moderate counter parts (71.31Â±23.54 vs. 101.06Â±34.43, U=156, P=0.006). Total lymphocytes was lower in severe group than in moderate group [1.659Â±0.643 vs. 0.745 (0.645, 0.928), U=109, P=0.000]. Also, a higher proportion of female than male patients had anxiety (Ï‡2=5.388, P=0.02). COVID-19 patients who received antiviral medications also displayed a higher rate of anxiety (Ï‡2=4.481, P=0.034). Total lymphocytes between the non-anxiety and anxiety had statistical difference (U=321, P=0.019). Meanwhile, total lymphocytes between the non-depression and depression also had statistical difference (U=389.5, P=0.01). Among patients with COVID-19, females and those treated with antiviral medications were more likely to experience anxiety. In addition, our findings reflected the effect of anxiety and depression on immune system.","Zhou, Wang, Huang, Du, Wu, Qian, Li, Wang, Jiang, Jiang, Yu, Cheng",https://doi.org/10.21037/apm-21-212,20210317.0,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); antiviral medication; anxiety; arterial partial pressure of oxygen (arterial PaO2); corticosteroids; depression,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
115,A Study of Depressive Symptoms in Doctors Working at COVID-19 Hospitals: An Online Survey,"COVID19 outbreak has put a tremendous physical and mental burden on frontline doctors. A limited amount of literature is available in this area. The present study was done to assess the depressive symptoms and depression levels in doctors working at COVID-19 Hospitals. This study was based on an online survey that was started on May 2020 and ended on 30<sup>th</sup> June, 2020. An online questionnaire which included details such as age, gender, and 21 items to assess depressive symptoms was sent through social media to doctors from various countries. Depressive symptoms were measured by Beck's Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Items of a total of 220 questionnaires were responded. Out of these, only 200 responses were analyzed using SPSS software. Out of 200 subjects, 110 (55%) had depressive symptoms and 90 (45%) had no symptoms. Males had more depressive symptoms (42.5%) than females (12.5%). Those who worked at COVID-19 centers 75 (37.5%) had higher depressive symptoms. The number of males working at COVID-19 centers was much higher (36%) than females (12%). Depressive symptoms were significantly higher in males than females (35.35Â±10.25 vs 16.90Â±7.76; p&lt;0.0001).

116,Addressing the mental health impact of COVID-19 through population health,"The COVID-19 pandemic has and will continue to result in negative mental health outcomes such as depression, anxiety and traumatic stress in people and populations throughout the world. A population mental health perspective informed by clinical psychology, psychiatry and dissemination and implementation science is ideally suited to address the broad, multi-faceted and long-lasting mental health impact of the pandemic. Informed by a systematic review of the burgeoning empirical research on the COVID-19 pandemic and research on prior coronavirus pandemics, we link pandemic risk factors, negative mental health outcomes and appropriate intervention strategies. We describe how social risk factors and pandemic stressors will contribute to negative mental health outcomes, especially among vulnerable populations. We evaluate the scalability of primary, secondary and tertiary interventions according to mental health target, population, modality, intensity and provider type to provide a unified strategy for meeting population mental health needs. Traditional models, in which evidence-based therapies delivered are delivered in-person, by a trained expert, at a specialty care location have proved difficult to scale. The use of non-traditional models, tailoring preventive interventions to populations based on their needs, and ongoing coordinated evaluation of intervention implementation and effectiveness will be critical to refining our efforts to increase reach.","Boden, Zimmerman, Azevedo, Ruzek, Gala, Abdel Magid, Cohen, Walser, Mahtani, Hoggatt, McLean",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpr.2021.102006,20210317.0,COVID-19; Evidence-based psychotherapy; Intervention; Mental health; Population mental health; Risk factor,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

Orv Hetil. 2021; 162(10): 366-374. Summary. In recent months, our lives have been fundamentally changed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the health, economic, and social impacts of which are almost invaluable for the time being. In addition to the acute consequences of viral infection, more and more data are proving its effects on the entire population: an increase in the incidence of psychological distress, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and addictive behaviours. It is also a very important question, how the global crisis is affecting suicide rates. In my paper, I summarize the acute and chronic effects of viral infection and the general and specific psychological-psychopathological consequences of the epidemic based on the most significant psychiatric literature of the recent period, paying special attention to suicidal risk and the most vulnerable groups. Studies suggest that mental troubles and suicidal behaviour resulting from a pandemic are becoming an increasingly important public health problem. Although the treatment of viral infections and slowing the spread of the infection are still the most important goals today, we all need to be prepared for the long-term consequences of the epidemic. In order to prevent and mitigate the expected negative mental health effects of a pandemic, it is necessary to develop and apply general and specific methods. In addition to health care, mental health and community care systems, political and economic decision-makers, civil society organizations and the media must also play a role. Their effective cooperation is key to the implementation of prevention strategies that can be applied at the individual, community and social levels, as this is the only way to prevent the epidemic spread of more serious mental health problems, the &quot;psychodemia&quot;.

The long-term respiratory sequelae in ICU survivors remain unclear. what are the major long-term pulmonary sequelae in critical COVID-19 survivors? Consecutive patients with COVID-19 requiring ICU admission were recruited and evaluated 3 months after hospitalization discharge. The follow-up comprised symptom and quality of life, anxiety and depression questionnaires, pulmonary function tests, exercise test (6-minute walking test (6MWT)) and chest computed tomography (CT). 125 ICU patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19 were recruited between March and June 2020. At the 3-month follow-up, 62 patients were available for pulmonary evaluation. The most frequent symptoms were dyspnea (46.7%), and cough (34.4%). Eighty-two percent of patients showed a lung diffusing capacity of less than 80%. The median (IQR) distance in the 6MWT was 400 (362;440) meters. CT scans were abnormal in 70.2% of patients, showing reticular lesions in 49.1% and fibrotic patterns in 21.1%. Patients with more severe alterations on chest CT had worse pulmonary function and presented more degrees of desaturation in the 6MWT. Factors associated with the severity of lung damage on chest CT were age and length of invasive mechanical ventilation during the ICU stay. Pulmonary structural abnormalities and functional impairment are highly prevalent in surviving ICU patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19 3 months after hospital discharge.

Both the ligands and complexes were well characterized by using various spectroscopic, thermal and X-ray diffraction techniques. Both the complexes as well as ligands were screened through in silico method with the chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine which essentially proved pivotal for successful understanding towards the target protein and their mechanism of action. The results indicated that the balanced hydrophobic and polar groups in the complexes favor their binding in the active site of the viral ADP-ribose-1 monophosphatase enzyme over the parent organic molecules.","Ali, Sepay, Afzal, Sepay, Alarifi, Shahid, Ahmad",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bioorg.2021.104772,20210317.0,ADP-ribose-1 monophosphatase enzyme; COVID-19; Chloroquine; Copper complex; Hydroxychloroquine,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
120,"<i>&quot;Everything Is Gonna Be Alright with Me&quot;</i>: The Role of Self-Compassion, Affect, and Coping in Negative Emotional Symptoms during Coronavirus Quarantine","Self-compassion has been associated with less distress, particularly when people face stressful and negative events. This study analyzed the mediation role of coping and affect in the relation between self-compassion and negative emotional symptoms during the quarantine decreed by Portuguese Health Authorities in the first phase of the coronavirus outbreak. A total of 428 Portuguese adults (75% women; <i>M</i><sub>age</sub> = 40.8, <i>SD</i> = 11.6) completed an online survey comprised by the Self-Compassion Scale (predictor); Short Version of Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (outcomes); The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule; and Brief-COPE. These instruments were adapted to COVID 19's epidemic. Parallel mediation analyses demonstrated that self-compassionate participants were at less risk of suffering from symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress during the quarantine. Plus, the relation between self-compassion and depressive, anxious, and stress symptoms were mediated by negative affect and dysfunctional coping style, but only for symptoms of depression. The findings support coping strategies and affect as links between self-compassion and distress but also the importance of separately analyzing the role of self-compassion, negative affect, and coping on symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress. Low self-compassion might increase negative affect, maintaining stress responses to face demanding events during the COVID-19 epidemic.

121,A New Tool for Detecting COVID-19 Psychological Burden Among Postacute and Long-term Care Residents (Mood-5 Scale): Observational Study,"Older adults are at high risk for developing serious somatic and psychological symptoms associated with COVID-19. Currently available instruments may not be sensitive to the concerns about COVID-19 in postacute and long-term care and their applications in telehealth remain to be clarified. We investigated the psychometric properties of the Mood-5 Scale (M5) as a rapid self-assessment of the COVID-19 psychological burden among postacute and long-term care residents. Residents (N=131), aged 50 years and above, from 20 postacute and long-term care facilities in Maryland, USA, were evaluated in-person or via telehealth (43/131, 32.8%) across a 4-week period (May 11 to June 5, 2020) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 psychological burden experienced by the residents was rated by geriatric psychologists who independently reviewed their clinical documentation. Psychometric analyses were performed on the M5 in relation to psychological tests, COVID-19 psychological burden, and diagnostic data collected during the evaluation. The M5 demonstrated acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach Î±=.77). M5 scores were not confounded by demographic variables or telehealth administration (P&gt;.08). Convergent validity for the M5 was established via positive associations with anxiety (r=0.56, P&lt;.001) and depressive (r=0.49, P&lt;.001) symptoms. An M5 cutoff score of 3 demonstrated strong sensitivity (0.92) and adequate specificity (0.75) for identifying COVID-19 psychological distress among postacute and long-term care residents (area under the curve of 0.89, positive predictive value=0.79, negative predictive value=0.91). The M5 is a reliable and valid tool for self-assessment of mood that can help identify postacute and long-term care residents with significant psychological burden associated with COVID-19. It can be completed in less than 1 minute and is appropriate for use in both in-person and virtual visits.","Mansbach, Mace, Tanner",https://doi.org/10.2196/26340,20210312.0,COVID-19; burden; coping; depression; elderly; long-term care; mental health; mood; nursing homes; older adults; risk; scale; self-assessment; stress; telehealth,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
122,The impact of COVID-19 lockdown and of the following &quot;re-opening&quot; period on specific and general psychopathology in people with Eating Disorders: the emergent role of internalizing symptoms,"We assessed the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on specific Eating Disorder (ED) and general psychopathology in people with an ED diagnosis during the lockdown period and after the end of the related containment measures. People with clinically defined diagnosis and undergoing treatment for an ED completed an online survey, which included adapted questions from standardized psychometric scales. Data relative to three different time periods (before, during and after the end of lockdown) were collected. Psychopathological changes over these periods were investigated and compared through one-way analysis of variance or covariance with repeated measures. Three hundred twelve people completed the survey (57.4% diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa (AN) or atypical AN, 20.2% with Bulimia Nervosa, 15.4% with Binge Eating Disorder, 7.05% with Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorders). The severity of both specific and general psychopathology increased during the lockdown and the rise of general symptoms persisted in the following re-opening phase, except for suicide ideation. Almost all of these findings were not affected by ED diagnosis, participants' age and illness duration. The retrospective nature of data collection is the main limitation of the study. People with EDs showed a COVID-19 emergency-induced worsening of both general and specific psychopathology. The effect on general psychopathology persisted in the re-opening period. These findings suggest a high stress vulnerability of ED individuals with important effects on internalizing symptoms, which are worth of attention by clinicians.","Monteleone, Marciello, Cascino, Abbate-Daga, Anselmetti, Baiano, Balestrieri, Barone, Bertelli, Carpiniello, Castellini, Corrivetti, DE Giorgi, Favaro, Gramaglia, Marzola, Meneguzzo, Monaco, Oriani, Pinna, Rania, Renna, Ricca, Salvo, Segura-Garcia, Scarabel, Todisco, Volpe, Zeppegno, Monteleone",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.02.037,20210317.0,COVID-19; Confinement; Eating disorders; Psychopathology; Social exposure; Stress,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
123,Rapid Design and Delivery of an Experience-Based Co-designed Mobile App to Support the Mental Health Needs of Health Care Workers Affected by the COVID-19 Pandemic: Impact Evaluation Protocol,"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of health care workers' mental health and well-being for the successful function of the health care system. Few targeted digital tools exist to support the mental health of hospital-based health care workers, and none of them appear to have been led and co-designed by health care workers. RMHive is being led and developed by health care workers using experience-based co-design (EBCD) processes as a mobile app to support the mental health challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic to health care workers. We present a protocol for the impact evaluation for the rapid design and delivery of the RMHive mobile app. The impact evaluation will adopt a mixed methods design. Qualitative data from photo interviews undertaken with up to 30 health care workers and semistructured interviews conducted with up to 30 governance stakeholders will be integrated with qualitative and quantitative user analytics data and user-generated demographic and mental health data entered into the app. Analyses will address three evaluation questions related to engagement with the mobile app, implementation and integration of the app, and the impact of the app on individual mental health outcomes. The design and development will be described using the Mobile Health Evidence Reporting and Assessment guidelines. Implementation of the app will be evaluated using normalization process theory to analyze qualitative data from interviews combined with text and video analysis from the semistructured interviews. Mental health impacts will be assessed using the total score of the 4-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ4) and subscale scores for the 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire for depression and the 2-item Generalized Anxiety Scale for anxiety. The PHQ4 will be completed at baseline and at 14 and 28 days. The anticipated average use period of the app is 30 days. The rapid design will occur over four months using EBCD to collect qualitative data and develop app content. The impact evaluation will monitor outcome data for up to 12 weeks following hospital-wide release of the minimal viable product release. The study received funding and ethics approvals in June 2020. Outcome data is expected to be available in March 2021, and the impact evaluation is expected to be published mid-2021. The impact evaluation will examine the rapid design, development, and implementation of the RMHive app and its impact on mental health outcomes for health care workers. Findings from the impact evaluation will provide guidance for the integration of EBCD in rapid design and implementation processes. The evaluation will also inform future development and rollout of the app to support the mental health needs of hospital-based health care workers more widely.

124,Time out of cell and time in purposeful activity and adverse mental health outcomes amongst people in prison: a literature review,"The purpose of this study is to synthesise the available peer-reviewed literature on the impact of time out of cell (TOOC) and time in purposeful activity (TIPA) on adverse mental outcomes amongst people in prison. The outcomes of interest of this literature review were mental health, suicide, deliberate self-harm (DSH) and violence. Exposures of interest were TOOC, TIPA or a partial or indirect measure of either. In total, 14 studies were included. An abbreviated review methodology was used because of time constraints. There was consistent evidence of an association between lower TOOC and TIPA and worse mental health and higher suicide risk. Limited evidence suggests a link between TOOC and DSH. No evidence was identified regarding the relationship between TOOC/TIPA and violence. A lack of longitudinal studies prevents conclusions regarding causality. Significant heterogeneity of mental health outcomes limits the comparability of studies. These findings highlight the importance of considering the impact of TOOC and TIPA on adverse mental outcomes for prisoners when designing prison regimes, including during urgent adaptation of such regimes in response to Covid-19. They are likely to be of interest to practitioners and policymakers concerned with prison regime design. This paper is the first to synthesise the existing literature on the impact of TOOC and TIPA on mental health outcomes.","Stephenson, Leaman, O'Moore, Tran, Plugge",https://doi.org/10.1108/IJPH-06-2020-0037,20210310.0,"Health promoting prison; Mental health; Prison psychiatry; Self-harm; Suicide; Violence; COVID-19; Confined Spaces; Correctional Facilities; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Prisoners; SARS-CoV-2; Social Isolation; Stress, Psychological",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
125,Effect of COVID-19 confinement on the mental status of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus,"Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are more vulnerable to higher levels of stress and psychopathological symptoms than the general healthy population. Therefore, the COVID-19 outbreak could alter their psychological state. The objective was to analyze the psychological impact of the pandemic and confinement on stress levels and psychopathological symptoms in patients with SLE. In this cross-sectional study, stress levels were compared with the Perceived Stress Scale, the Stress Vulnerability Inventory and psychopathological symptoms of the SCL-90-R Symptom Inventory in patients with SLE during the period of confinement (group 1; n=276) in comparison to patients with SLE evaluated in a period before the pandemic (group 2; n=152). The comparison between both groups showed there were statistically significant differences in vulnerability to stress (P&lt;.0001), depression (Pâ‰¤.05), anxiety (Pâ‰¤.05), phobic anxiety (P&lt;.0001), interpersonal sensitivity (Pâ‰¤.043), and psychoticism (Pâ‰¤.023). In these variables, the group of patients with lupus in confinement obtained higher scores. The confinement and threat of the COVID-19 outbreak had important repercussions on the psychological state of patients with SLE with high levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. These findings show their vulnerability to a public health alert and indicate the need to carry out a psychological approach to these patients while the state of health emergency lasts as well as to possible outbreaks of the virus.","Santos-Ruiz, Montero-LÃ³pez, Ortego-Centeno, Peralta-RamÃ­rez",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medcli.2020.12.004,20210228.0,COVID-19; Confinamiento; Confinement; EstrÃ©s percibido; Lupus eritematoso sistÃ©mico; Perceived stress; Psychopathological symptoms; Systemic lupus erythematosus; SÃ­ntomas psicopatolÃ³gicos,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
126,"Understanding Concerns, Sentiments, and Disparities Among Population Groups During the COVID-19 Pandemic Via Twitter Data Mining: Large-scale Cross-sectional Study","Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in late 2019, its far-reaching impacts have been witnessed globally across all aspects of human life, such as health, economy, politics, and education. Such widely penetrating impacts cast significant and profound burdens on all population groups, incurring varied concerns and sentiments among them. This study aims to identify the concerns, sentiments, and disparities of various population groups during the COVID-19 pandemic through a cross-sectional study conducted via large-scale Twitter data mining infoveillance. This study consisted of three steps: first, tweets posted during the pandemic were collected and preprocessed on a large scale; second, the key population attributes, concerns, sentiments, and emotions were extracted via a collection of natural language processing procedures; third, multiple analyses were conducted to reveal concerns, sentiments, and disparities among population groups during the pandemic. Overall, this study implemented a quick, effective, and economical approach for analyzing population-level disparities during a public health event. The source code developed in this study was released for free public use at GitHub. A total of 1,015,655 original English tweets posted from August 7 to 12, 2020, were acquired and analyzed to obtain the following results. Organizations were significantly more concerned about COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] 3.48, 95% CI 3.39-3.58) and expressed more fear and depression emotions than individuals. Females were less concerned about COVID-19 (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.71-0.75) and expressed less fear and depression emotions than males. Among all age groups (ie, â‰¤18, 19-29, 30-39, and â‰¥40 years of age), the attention ORs of COVID-19 fear and depression increased significantly with age. It is worth noting that not all females paid less attention to COVID-19 than males. In the age group of 40 years or older, females were more concerned than males, especially regarding the economic and education topics. In addition, males 40 years or older and 18 years or younger were the least positive. Lastly, in all sentiment analyses, the sentiment polarities regarding political topics were always the lowest among the five topics of concern across all population groups. Through large-scale Twitter data mining, this study revealed that meaningful differences regarding concerns and sentiments about COVID-19-related topics existed among population groups during the study period. Therefore, specialized and varied attention and support are needed for different population groups. In addition, the efficient analysis method implemented by our publicly released code can be utilized to dynamically track the evolution of each population group during the pandemic or any other major event for better informed public health research and interventions.","Zhang, Xu, Li, Hu",https://doi.org/10.2196/26482,20210313.0,COVID-19; Twitter mining; concerns; disparities; infodemiology; infoveillance; pandemic; population groups; sentiments,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
127,,"COVID-19, a major 'Public Health Emergencies of International Concern,' had sought greater attention among researchers to study its pathogenesis, associated complications and management. However, there are only few studies that had studied its potential impact on mental health of general public, who are subjected to social distancing, community lockdown and restrictions in their routine activities. The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of psychological distress and mental health needs among general public in Tamil Nadu subjected to lockdown, social distancing amidst COVID-19 crisis. Tamil Nadu is one of the worst affected states of southern India. A self-administered, web-based application study using 'WHO-Self Reported Questionnaire-20', in bilingual version, both English and Tamil, is used to screen the public for the level of distress. The study is done while the state is under extended lockdown and restricted movement. A total of 918 respondents participated in the survey and it is found that about more than one third of the respondents (âˆ¼35%) are under psychological distress. A significant association between younger age group, female gender, unmarried, people with children are found to be under distress. The lockdown had increased the frequency of smoking and quantity of cigarettes among smokers, also has increased the frequency of drinking among alcohol consumers. Of the SRQ-20 items recorded, stress related neurotic symptoms (&gt;70%) was observed more than the depressive mood. About 33% of those scored &gt; 7, had suicidal tendency. The districts declared red zones had significantly reported a greater number of respondents under distress.

129,Suicide in the context of COVID-19 diagnosis in India: Insights and implications from online print media reports,"Suicide reports during the COVID pandemic is an increasing cause for concern. However, there is a limited understanding of suicide among individuals with positive/suspected COVID diagnosis specifically. Hence, this study, using online newspaper reports, aimed to determine factors influencing suicide among individuals withCOVID-19 infection status. Information regarding positive/suspected COVID related suicide was obtained from online newspapers published in 4 languages between 30<sup>th</sup> Jan 2020 to 16<sup>th</sup> August 2020 using google news aggregator. Of 235 online identified, 93 were eligible for analysis after the exclusion and analysed using descriptive statistics. Median Age of COVID related suicide victims was 45 years (range 15 - 80) wherein 61.3% belonged to 30-59 year age group, and 75.3% were males. 50% of suicides occurred within the first week of COVID diagnosis confirmation, and 50% suicides occurred at COVID centres. Hanging (53.8%) was the commonest method of suicide, followed by jumping (12.9%). Higher risk for suicide was observed among male gender and those with positive/suspected COVID infection within the first week, while receiving treatment in COVID care centres. Hanging and jumping were the two commonest methods. The above highlight an urgent need to integrate suicide preventive strategies into standard care protocols of COVID-19 positive and suspected cases.","Sripad, Pantoji, Gowda, Ganjekar, Reddi, Math",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113799,20210312.0,COVID; Newspaper; Online; Print media; Suicide,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
130,Self-treatment and adverse reactions with herbal products for treating symptoms associated with anxiety and depression in adults from the central-western region of Mexico during the Covid-19 pandemic,"There are plant species used in the Mexican traditional medicine for the empirical treatment of anxiety and depression. This work assessed the prevalence of self-medication with medicinal plants and the prevalence of the concomitant use of prescribed psychiatric drugs and medicinal plants for treating symptoms associated with anxiety and depression during the Covid-19 lockdown in Mexico. The suspected adverse reactions associated with drug-herb interactions were assessed. The factors associated with self-medication, the concomitant use of herb-drug combinations, and the presence of adverse reactions due their combined use is also reported. The study was descriptive and cross-sectional using an online questionnaire conducted among population with symptoms associated with anxiety and depression (nÂ =Â 2100) from seven states of central-western Mexico. The prevalence of the use of herbs (61.9%) and the concomitant use of drug-herb combinations (25.3%) were associated with being diagnosed with mental illness [OR:2.195 (1.655-2.912)] and the use of psychiatric medications [OR:307.994 (178.609-531.107)], respectively. The presence of adverse reactions (nÂ =Â 104) by the concomitant use of drug-herb combinations was associated with being unemployed [pÂ =Â 0.004, OR: 3.017 (1.404-6.486)].

131,The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on bariatric patients' self-management post-surgery,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had far reaching consequences on the health and well-being of the general public. Evidence from previous pandemics suggest that bariatric patients may experience increased emotional distress and difficulty adhering to healthy lifestyle changes post-surgery. We aimed to examine the impact of the novel COVID-19 public health crisis on bariatric patients' self-management post-surgery. In a nested-qualitative study, semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with 23 post-operative bariatric patients who had undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) at a Canadian Bariatric Surgery Program between 2014 and 2020. A constant comparative approach was used to systematically analyze the data and identify the overarching themes. Participants (nÂ =Â 23) had a mean age of (48.82Â Â±Â 10.03) years and most were female (nÂ =Â 19). The median time post-surgery was 2 years (range: 6 months-7 years). Themes describing the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on patients' post-bariatric surgery self-management included: coping with COVID-19; vulnerability factors and physical isolation; resiliency factors during pandemic; and valuing access to support by virtual care. The need for patients to access post-operative bariatric care during COVID-19 differed based on gender and socioeconomic status. This study showed that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted patients' ability to self-manage obesity and their mental health in a variety of ways. These findings suggest that patients may experience unique psychological distress and challenges requiring personalized care strategies to improve obesity self-care and overall well-being.","Youssef, Cassin, Wnuk, Leung, Jackson, Sockalingam",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2021.105166,20210316.0,,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
132,Food Insufficiency and Mental Health in the US During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, the rates of food insecurity and mental illness have been projected to increase in the U.S. owing to significant social and economic disruption. This study aims to estimate the prevalence of food insufficiency (often the most extreme form of food insecurity), the correlates of food insufficiency, and the associations between food insufficiency and symptoms of poor mental health in the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic. Cross-sectional data from 63,674 participants of the U.S. Census Household Pulse Survey were collected and analyzed in 2020. Multiple Poisson regression models were used to estimate associations with food insufficiency. Food insufficiency rose from 8.1% to 10.0% from March to June 2020. Factors associated with food insufficiency included lower age, Black/African American or Latinx race/ethnicity, being unmarried, larger household size, recent employment loss, income below the federal poverty line, and lower education (all p&lt;0.001). Food insufficiency was independently associated with all symptoms of poor mental health, adjusting for socioeconomic and demographic factors (adjusted RRs ranged from 1.16 to 1.42, all p&lt;0.001). The association between food insufficiency and poor mental health was attenuated among people who received free groceries or meals. Food insufficiency has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic and affects vulnerable populations, placing individuals at higher risk for symptoms of poor mental health. Particularly in the current crisis, clinicians should regularly screen patients for food insufficiency and mental health outcomes as well as provide support in accessing appropriate resources.","Nagata, Ganson, Whittle, Chu, Harris, Tsai, Weiser",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2020.12.004,20210219.0,,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
133,The effects of home confinement on physical activity level and mental status in professional football players during COVID-19 outbreak,"<b>Objectives</b>: The coronavirus outbreak caused significant changes in football around the world, such as the suspension of leagues and home isolation of players, etc. The main purpose of the present study was to assess the psychological impacts of lockdown and similar restrictions on professional football players during the coronavirus pandemic. <b>Materials and methods</b>: The players from 36 professional football teams (nÂ =Â 977) among Turkish Super League and First League teams were invited to complete a questionnaire including the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), Impact of Event Scale-Revised Scores (IES-R) and short form of International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). <b>Results</b>: The online survey was completed by 237 players (24.3%). The mean number of self-quarantine day of participants was 26.9Â Â±Â 6.2Â days. The median CES-D Scale and IES-R scores were 6.0 (min:0, max:42) and 23.0 (min:0, max:59), respectively. IPAQ scores of the players showed that four-fifths of the players still maintain high physical activity levels. There were negative, very weak and significant correlations between CES-D score and being married (rÂ =Â -0.146, p =Â 0.024), as well as between CES-D score and IPAQ-Walking (rÂ =Â -0.189, p =Â 0.004). A significant positive very weak correlation was observed between CES-D score and self-quarantine days (rÂ =Â 0.148, p =Â 0.024).

134,College student mental health risks during the COVID-19 pandemic: Implications of campus relocation,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, many universities evacuated their campuses, requiring students to vacate on campus residences. The psychological outcomes of students who relocated during the pandemic remains unknown. We examined mandated relocation experiences related to self-reported worry, grief, loneliness, and depressive, generalized anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms among college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyzed cross-sectional survey data obtained from April 9 to August 4, 2020 on 791 young adults (ages 18-30 years) who were enrolled at a U.S. university. The CARES 2020 Project (COVID-19 Adult Resilience Experiences Study) is an online survey of young adults' mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recruitment relied on snowball sampling. Participants were asked if they were required to relocate from campus and among those who did, their experiences in moving. COVID-19-related worry and grief, loneliness, and depressive, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms were assessed. Approximately one-third of students reported being mandated to relocate. Students mandated to relocate reported more COVID-19-related grief, loneliness, and generalized anxiety symptoms compared to those who did not even after controlling for the severity level of local COVID-19 outbreaks. Students who had to leave behind valuable personal belongings reported more COVID-19-related worries, grief, and depressive, generalized anxiety, and PTSD symptoms. Students who were mandated to relocate reported worse psychological outcomes compared to students who were not mandated to relocate. Our findings have implications for addressing the psychological impact of evacuating college campuses during public health emergencies and other disasters.","Conrad, Hahm, Koire, Pinder-Amaker, Liu",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.01.054,20210315.0,Anxiety; Loneliness; Relocation; Stress; University; Young adults,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

The 2020 study period included 'pre-lockdown' (1 March-25 March), 'level 4 (strict) lockdown' (26 March-27 April) and 'level 3 (eased) lockdown' (28 April-13 May). Patient volumes reduced in all SDHB EDs during levels 4 and 3, mostly representing a loss of low acuity patients (Australasian Triage Scale 3, 4 and 5), although high-acuity presentations also declined. Average patient age increased by 5â€‰years; however, the proportions of sexes and ethnicities did not change. Presentations of cerebrovascular accidents and appendicitis did not change significantly. Trauma, mental health, acute coronary syndrome and infectious respiratory presentations decreased significantly during level 4, and infectious respiratory presentations decreased further in level 3. Within the SDHB, patient volumes reduced during levels 4 and 3 of our lockdown, with reduced low-acuity presentations. High-acuity patient numbers also declined.

136,"Ethnic Differences in Loneliness, Depression, and Malnutrition Among Older Adults During COVID-19 Quarantine","Depression in older adults may result from a variety of reasons such as loneliness feelings and malnutrition. To examine the direct and indirect effect of loneliness feelings on depressive symptoms, mediated by malnutrition, among older adults from different cultures during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic quarantine. A convenience sample of 101 Arabs and 100 Jewish older adults aged 65 and over was interviewed. Using bootstrapping, we tested the strength and significance of the conditional indirect effect of malnutrition (mediator) on the relationship between loneliness feelings and depressive symptoms. The relationship between loneliness feelings and depressive symptoms was mediated by malnutrition and Arab older adults reported a higher level than Jewish older adults of loneliness, depression, and malnutrition during the Covid-19 pandemic quarantine. To reduce loneliness feelings, depressive symptoms, and malnutrition in times of crisis like the Covid-19 pandemic, it is essential to develop new communication methods for and with older adults in general, with particular attention paid to ethnic differences, that will be effective in reducing loneliness and in promoting nutrition intervention. Possible solutions include new social network technologies for reducing loneliness, with continued reliance on phone communication for combined intervention that includes psychological support accompanied by instructions for a healthy lifestyle and malnutrition prevention.","Schorr, Yehuda, Tamir",https://doi.org/10.1007/s12603-020-1540-z,20210303.0,"Covid-19; Loneliness feelings; depressive symptoms; malnutrition; older adults; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; COVID-19; Depression; Female; Humans; Loneliness; Male; Malnutrition; Middle Aged; Quarantine; SARS-CoV-2",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

An online cross-sectional study. Registered nurses who graduated from a nursing school in Southern California, USA, participated in the study from 20 April-10 May 2020 (NÂ =Â 320). Kendall's tau correlations and multivariate logistic regression procedures were performed with stress, anxiety and depression as outcome variables. Most nurses reported moderate/high stress (80.1%), while 43% and 26% reported moderate/severe anxiety and depression, respectively. COVID-19 patient care was positively associated with moderate/severe high stress (ORÂ =Â 2.25; pÂ =Â .012) and moderate/severe anxiety (ORÂ =Â 3.04; pÂ &lt;Â .001), whereas quarantine was associated with moderate/severe depression (ORÂ =Â 2.68; pÂ &lt;Â .001).

Building upon studies from various countries, we aimed to investigate (1) the prevalence of various work-related stressors among healthcare professionals in Germany specific to the COVID-19 pandemic, (2) the psychological effects of these stressors in terms of clinical symptoms, and (3) the healthcare professionals' help-seeking behaviour. To this end, N = 300 healthcare professionals completed an online survey including the ICD-10 Symptom Rating checklist (ISR), event-sampling questions on pandemic-related stressors and self-formulated questions on help-seeking behaviour. Participants were recruited between 22 May and 22 July 2020. Findings were analysed using t tests, regressions and comparisons to large clinical and non-clinical samples assessed before and during the pandemic. Results show that healthcare professionals were most affected by protective measures at their workplace and changes in work procedures. Psychological symptoms, particularly anxiety and depression, were significantly more severe than in a non-clinical pre-pandemic sample and in the general population during the pandemic. At the same time, most professionals indicated that they would not seek help for psychological concerns. These findings indicate that healthcare employers need to pay greater attention to the mental health of their staff.","Weibelzahl, Reiter, Duden",https://doi.org/10.1017/S0950268821000303,20210225.0,COVID-19; help-seeking behaviour; mental health; nursing staff; occupational stress; pandemics; Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Germany; Health Personnel; Incidence; Pandemics; Prevalence,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
139,Telemedicine in Pediatrics: Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials,"Telemedicine modalities, such as videoconferencing, are used by health care providers to remotely deliver health care to patients. Telemedicine use in pediatrics has increased in recent years. This has resulted in improved health care access, optimized disease management, progress in the monitoring of health conditions, and fewer exposures to patients with illnesses during pandemics (eg, the COVID-19 pandemic). We aimed to systematically evaluate the most recent evidence on the feasibility and accessibility of telemedicine services, patients' and care providers' satisfaction with these services, and treatment outcomes related to telemedicine service use among pediatric populations with different health conditions. Studies were obtained from the PubMed database on May 10, 2020. We followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. In this review, we included randomized controlled trials from the last 10 years that used a telemedicine approach as a study intervention or assessed telemedicine as a subspecialty of pediatric care. Titles and abstracts were independently screened based on the eligibility criteria. Afterward, full texts were retrieved and independently screened based on the eligibility criteria. A standardized form was used to extract the following data: publication title, first author's name, publication year, participants' characteristics, study design, the technology-based approach that was used, intervention characteristics, study goals, and study findings. In total, 11 articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in this review. All studies were categorized as randomized controlled trials (8/11, 73%) or cluster randomized trials (3/11, 27%). The number of participants in each study ranged from 22 to 400. The health conditions that were assessed included obesity (3/11, 27%), asthma (2/11, 18%), mental health conditions (1/11, 9%), otitis media (1/11, 9%), skin conditions (1/11, 9%), type 1 diabetes (1/11, 9%), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (1/11, 9%), and cystic fibrosis-related pancreatic insufficiency (1/11). The telemedicine approaches that were used included patient and doctor videoconferencing visits (5/11, 45%), smartphone-based interventions (3/11, 27%), telephone counseling (2/11, 18%), and telemedicine-based screening visits (1/11, 9%). The telemedicine interventions in all included studies resulted in outcomes that were comparable to or better than the outcomes of control groups. These outcomes were related to symptom management, quality of life, satisfaction, medication adherence, visit completion rates, and disease progression. Although more research is needed, the evidence from this review suggests that telemedicine services for the general public and pediatric care are comparable to or better than in-person services. Patients, health care professionals, and caregivers may benefit from using both telemedicine services and traditional, in-person health care services. To maximize the potential of telemedicine, future research should focus on improving patients' access to care, increasing the cost-effectiveness of telemedicine services, and eliminating barriers to telemedicine use.","Shah, Badawy",https://doi.org/10.2196/22696,20210225.0,COVID-19; coronavirus; digital; eHealth; mHealth; mobile health; pandemic; pediatrics; telehealth; telemedicine,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
140,Mental health interventions for healthcare workers during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in Spain,"In order to reduce distress associated with working with COVID-19 patients, several psychological intervention programmes for healthcare workers have been developed in Spain. We aimed to describe the main characteristics and components of these programmes for healthcare workers treating COVID-19 patients in Spanish hospitals. An online survey was designed to evaluate the main characteristics of psychological intervention programmes for healthcare workers during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic. Valid responses were received from 36 hospitals. Most of these programmes offered both in-person and online therapy. The most common aim of these interventions was emotional regulation, which was treated by psychoeducational and cognitive-behavioural techniques in individual interventions. Group interventions mainly used psychoeducation and mindfulness. Only half of the teams that offered in-person interventions received training in the proper use of personal protective equipment. Several hospitals in Spain have developed mental health interventions for healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, deploying a wide range of therapeutic modalities and techniques. The rapid implementation of these programmes during the pandemic suggests that safety may not have received sufficient attention. The planning and development of interventions for healthcare workers during pandemics merits greater attention by national and regional authorities and institutions.","Priede, LÃ³pez-Ãlvarez, Carracedo-SanchidriÃ¡n, GonzÃ¡lez-Blanch",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rpsm.2021.01.005,20210228.0,COVID-19; Distress; Healthcare workers; Malestar psicolÃ³gico; Mental health; Psychological treatment; Salud mental; Trabajadores sanitarios; Tratamiento psicolÃ³gico,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
141,<i>ACE2</i> and <i>FURIN</i> variants are potential predictors of SARS-CoV-2 outcome: A time to implement precision medicine against COVID-19,"The severity of the new COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is strikingly variable in different global populations. SARS-CoV-2 uses <i>ACE2</i> as a cell receptor, <i>TMPRSS2</i> protease, and <i>FURIN</i> peptidase to invade human cells. Here, we investigated 1,378 whole-exome sequences of individuals from the Middle Eastern populations (Kuwait, Qatar, and Iran) to explore natural variations in the <i>ACE2</i>, <i>TMPRSS2,</i> and <i>FURIN</i> genes. We identified two activating variants (K26R and N720D) in the <i>ACE2</i> gene that are more common in Europeans than in the Middle Eastern, East Asian, and African populations. We postulate that K26R can activate <i>ACE2</i> and facilitate binding to S-protein RBD while N720D enhances <i>TMPRSS2</i> cutting and, ultimately, viral entry. We also detected deleterious variants in <i>FURIN</i> that are frequent in the Middle Eastern but not in the European populations. This study highlights specific genetic variations in the <i>ACE2</i> and <i>FURIN</i> genes that may explain SARS-CoV-2 clinical disparity. We showed structural evidence of the functionality of these activating variants that increase the SARS-CoV-2 aggressiveness. Finally, our data illustrate a significant correlation between <i>ACE2</i> variants identified in people from Middle Eastern origins that can be further explored to explain the variation in COVID-19 infection and mortality rates globally.","Al-Mulla, Mohammad, Al Madhoun, Haddad, Ali, Eaaswarkhanth, John, Nizam, Channanath, Abu-Farha, Ahmad, Abubaker, Thanaraj",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06133,20210317.0,ACE2; COVID-19; FURIN; Genomic medicine; Middle Eastern populations; Precision medicine; SARS-CoV-2; TMPRSS2; Variants; eQTLs,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
142,Surveilling COVID-19 Emotional Contagion on Twitter by Sentiment Analysis,"The fight against the COVID-19 pandemic seems to encompass a social media debate, possibly resulting in emotional contagion and the need for novel surveillance approaches. In the current study, we aimed to examine the flow and content of tweets, exploring the role of COVID-19 key events on the popular Twitter platform. Using representative freely available data, we performed a focused, social media-based analysis to capture COVID-19 discussions on Twitter, considering sentiment and longitudinal trends between January 19 and March 3, 2020. Different populations of users were considered. Core discussions were explored measuring tweets' sentiment, by both computing a polarity compound score with 95% Confidence Interval and using a transformer-based model, pretrained on a large corpus of COVID-19-related Tweets. Context-dependent meaning and emotion-specific features were considered. We gathered 3,308,476 tweets written in English. Since the first World Health Organization report (January 21), negative sentiment proportion of tweets gradually increased as expected, with amplifications following key events. Sentiment scores were increasingly negative among most active users. Tweets content and flow revealed an ongoing scenario in which the global emergency seems difficult to be emotionally managed, as shown by sentiment trajectories. Integrating social media like Twitter as essential surveillance tools in the management of the pandemic and its waves might actually represent a novel preventive approach to hinder emotional contagion, disseminating reliable information and nurturing trust. There is the need to monitor and sustain healthy behaviors as well as community supports also via social media-based preventive interventions.","Crocamo, Viviani, Famiglini, Bartoli, Pasi, CarrÃ ",https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.3,20210315.0,Emotional contagion; mental health; sentiment analyses; social media; COVID-19; Emotions; Health Behavior; Health Education; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Social Media; Trust,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
143,&quot;I Couldn't Have Asked for a Better Quarantine Partner!&quot;: Experiences with Companion Dogs during Covid-19,"The Covid-19 pandemic has been found to negatively impact the psychological well-being of significant numbers of people globally. Many individuals have been challenged by social distancing mandates and the resultant social isolation. Humans, in our modern world, have rarely been as isolated and socially restricted. Social connectedness and support are critical protective factors for human survival and well-being. Social isolation can lead to loneliness, boredom, and can become a risk factor for physical and mental health issues such as anxiety and depression. The attachments formed with dogs, however, can be as strong or even stronger than human connections, and has been shown to relate to fewer physical health and mental health problems, as well as decrease isolation and loneliness. The purpose of this qualitative research was to examine the thoughts, experiences and concerns of 4105 adults regarding their companion dog during the initial months of Covid-19. Data were collected between March 31st-April 19th, 2020 via online survey and themes were coded by the researchers using directed content analysis. Results highlighted a strong human-animal appreciation, and that dog ownership during this pandemic diminished participants' sense of isolation and loneliness, as well as supported their mental/physical health.","Bussolari, Currin-McCulloch, Packman, Kogan, Erdman",https://doi.org/10.3390/ani11020330,20210316.0,Covid-19; companionâ€“animal relationships; dog ownership; humanâ€“dog bond; social isolation,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

This study aimed to investigate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) -associated epidemiology and clinical outcomes in Bangladesh in order to understand the future course of the COVID-19 pandemic and develop approaches to prevention. A cross-sectional study based on retrospective interviews was conducted on 1021 individuals with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 admitted in six different hospitals in Bangladesh and who recovered 4 weeks before the interview date. Of the 1021 patients, 111 (10.9%) were asymptomatic and the other 910 (89.1%) were symptomatic. Higher prevalence of COVID-19 was found in the male population (75%), in cohorts with B-positive blood group (36.3%) and in the 31-40 years age group. Common symptoms observed in our study participants were fever (72.4%), cough (55.9%), loss of taste (40.7%) and body ache (40%); whereas among the biochemical parameters, neutrophil count (46.4%), D-dimer (46.1%) and ferritin (37.9%) levels were elevated. Among the recovered individuals, short-term outcomes including pains and aches (31.8%), weakened attention span (24.4%) and anxiety or depression (23.1%) were also significantly prevalent in the symptomatic cases with comorbidities. Our study showed that in Bangladesh, adult males aged between 31 and 40 years were more vulnerable to developing COVID-19. It also indicated a rising trend of asymptomatic cases as the pandemic progressed. As a consequence, deployment of interventions to curb further spread of community infection is necessary to avoid grave outcomes of COVID-19 in Bangladesh.","Mannan, Mehedi, Chy, Qayum, Akter, Rob, Biswas, Hossain, Ayub",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nmni.2021.100838,20210202.0,Asymptomatic; Bangladesh; comorbidities; coronavirus disease 2019; epidemiology; post-coronavirus disease 2019 complications,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

Cognitive biases have been related to depression degree in previous studies. Here, we used behavioral and brain imaging analysis, to determine if and how the COVID-19 pandemic affects the relationship between current cognitive biases and future depression degree and the underlying neural basis in a nonclinical depressed population. An out-expectation result showed that a more negative memory bias was associated with a greater decrease in future depressive indices in nonclinical depressed participants during the COVID-19 pandemic, which might be due to decreased social stress. These data enhance our understanding of how the depressive degree of nonclinical depressed populations will change during the COVID-19 pandemic and also provide support for social distancing policies from a psychological perspective.","Zhang, Piao, Chen, Ren, Zhang, Qiu, Wei, Zhang",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2021.102081,20210316.0,behavioral neuroscience; clinical neuroscience; cognitive neuroscience,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

149,Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Patient Preferences and Decision Making for Symptomatic Urolithiasis,"<b> <i>Background:</i> </b> Pandemic restrictions have changed how patients approach symptomatic kidney stones. We used a mixed-methods digital ethnographic approach to evaluate social media discussions about patient concerns and preferences for urolithiasis care during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b> <i>Materials and Methods:</i> </b> We retrospectively analyzed kidney stone-related discussions on a large social media platform using qualitative analysis and natural language processing-based sentiment analysis. Posts were mined for demographic details, treatments pursued, and health care encounters. Pre-COVID-19 (January 1, 2020-February 29, 2020) and COVID-19 (March 1, 2020-June 1, 2020) posts were extracted from the popular online Reddit discussion board, &quot;r/KidneyStones,&quot; which is dedicated to discussions related to urolithiasis. <b> <i>Results:</i> </b> We extracted <i>n</i>â€‰=â€‰649 posts (250 pre-COVID-19, 399 COVID-19); 150 from each cohort underwent thematic analysis and data extraction. Quantitative sentiment analysis was performed on 418 posts (179 pre-COVID-19, 239 COVID-19) that described stone-related decision making before intervention. Notable discussion themes during COVID-19 focused on barriers to care and concerns about stone management. Discussants exhibited more negative and anxious tones during COVID-19, based on sentiment analysis (<i>p</i>â€‰&lt;â€‰0.01). Patient preferences shifted away from in-person visits and procedures (<i>p</i>â€‰&lt;â€‰0.001). Mean reported stone size among those visiting emergency room (ER) increased from 5.1 to 10.5â€‰mm (<i>p</i>â€‰&lt;â€‰0.001).

Opioid mentions increased from 9% to 27% of posts (<i>p</i>â€‰&lt;â€‰0.001) and were most associated with conservative management discussions. <b> <i>Conclusions:</i> </b> Online discussion forums provide contemporaneous insight into patients' experiences during a time when traditional patient-centered research methodologies are limited due to social distancing. During the pandemic, patients with symptomatic kidney stones expressed anxiety regarding outpatient encounters and reluctance toward procedural intervention. Patients opted instead for at-home conservative treatment beyond clinical guidelines and reserved ER visits for larger stones, potentially causing self-harm. Opioid discussions proliferated, an alarming consequence of the pandemic.","Jiang, Osadchiy, Weinberger, Zheng, Owen, Leonard, Mills, Kachroo, Eleswarapu",https://doi.org/10.1089/end.2020.1141,20210304.0,COVID-19; natural language processing; patient perspectives; urolithiasis,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

We performed an internet-based cross-sectional survey of an age-, sex-, and race-stratified representative sample from the US general population. Degrees of anxiety, depression, and loneliness were assessed using the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale (GAD-7), the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, and the 8-item UCLA Loneliness Scale, respectively. Unadjusted and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to determine associations with baseline demographic characteristics. A total of 1,005 finished surveys were returned of the 1,020 started, yielding a completion rate of 98.5% in the survey panel. The mean (standard deviation) age of the respondents was 45 (16) years, and 494 (48.8%) were male. Overall, 264 subjects (26.8%) met the criteria for an anxiety disorder based on a GAD-7 cutoff of 10; a cutoff of 7 yielded 416 subjects (41.4%), meeting the clinical criteria for anxiety. On multivariable analysis, male sex (odds ratio [OR] = 0.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.49, 0.87]), identification as Black (OR = 0.49, 95% CI [0.31, 0.77]), and living in a larger home (OR = 0.46, 95% CI [0.24, 0.88]) were associated with a decreased odds of meeting the anxiety criteria. Rural location (OR 1.39, 95% CI [1.03, 1.89]), loneliness (OR 4.92, 95% CI [3.18, 7.62]), and history of hospitalization (OR = 2.04, 95% CI [1.38, 3.03]) were associated with increased odds of meeting the anxiety criteria.

About 30% of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease. Among them, approximately 25% require hospitalization. In medicine, cases are identified as those who become ill. During this pandemic, cases have been identified as those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test, including approximately 70% who were asymptomatic-this has caused unnecessary anxiety. Individuals more than 65 years old, those affected by obesity, diabetes, asthma, or are immune-depressed owing to cancer and other conditions, are at a higher risk of hospitalization and of dying of COVID-19. Healthy individuals younger than 40 years very rarely die of COVID-19. Estimates of the COVID-19 mortality rate vary because the definition of COVID-19-related deaths varies. Belgium has the highest death rate at 154.9 per 100,000 persons, because it includes anyone who died with symptoms compatible with COVID-19, even those never tested for SARS-CoV-2. The United States includes all patients who died with a positive test, whether they died because of, or with, SARS-CoV-2. Countries that include only patients in which COVID-19 was the main cause of death, rather than a cofactor, have lower death rates. Numerous therapies are being developed, and rapid improvements are anticipated. Because of disinformation, only approximately 50% of the U.S. population plans to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.

More parents with busy jobs have chosen to use mHealth. During the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, mHealth can assist with health promotion, directions for medication use, and disease diagnosis via online chat and video consultation without contacting others. To our knowledge, no studies have been performed to explore the role of mHealth in parents' attitudes toward child health care at home during the COVID-19 outbreak. This study aims to identify the associated factors of willingness to adopt mHealth among Chinese parents during the COVID-19 outbreak and to explore the correlation between the frequency of adopting mHealth and parents' attitudes toward child health care at home. Chinese parents were asked to complete an online survey from January 25 to February 15, 2020. The questionnaire comprised of two parts with a total of 16 items, including parents' demographic variables and attitudes toward child health care at home. By multivariate logistic regression, we explored factors associated with parents' willingness to adopt mHealth during the COVID-19 outbreak. Pearson chi-square tests were used to reveal the correlation between the frequency of adopting mHealth and parents' attitudes toward child health care at home. A total of 254 parents enrolled, and 202 (79.5%) parents were willing to adopt mHealth during the COVID-19 outbreak. Parents' age (26-35 years: adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 8.114, 95% CI 1.471-44.764), parents' interest in the COVID-19 pandemic (moderate: AOR 8.753, 95% CI 2.009-38.127; high: AOR 22.194, 95% CI 5.509-89.411), the source that recommended mHealth (medical health providers: AOR 4.257, 95% CI 1.439-12.596), the presence of chronic disease in their children (yes: AOR 20.844, 95% CI 4.600-94.443), parents' duration of daily internet use (4-6 hours: AOR 6.487, 95% CI 1.870-22.495; &gt;6 hours: AOR 8.766, 95% CI 1.883-40.804), and adoption of mHealth before the COVID-19 outbreak (yes: AOR 3.413, 95% CI 1.234-9.444) were significantly correlated with the parents' willingness to adopt mHealth during the COVID-19 outbreak. The frequency of mHealth use among parents was correlated with their behaviors in regard to handwashing (Ï‡<sup>2</sup><sub>6</sub>=18.967, P=.004), mask wearing (Ï‡<sup>2</sup><sub>6</sub>=45.364, P&lt;.001), frequency of leaving the home (Ï‡<sup>2</sup><sub>6</sub>=16.767, P=.01), room disinfection and ventilation (Ï‡<sup>2</sup><sub>6</sub>=19.515, P=.003), temperature checking (Ï‡<sup>2</sup><sub>6</sub>=17.47, P=.007), and mental health care of children (Ï‡<sup>2</sup><sub>6</sub>=63.810, P&lt;.001) during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found various objective factors that were associated with parents' willingness to adopt mHealth during the COVID-19 outbreak. Overall, parents' willingness to adopt mHealth was high. The frequency of mHealth use among parents was correlated with their attitudes toward child health care at home. The option of mHealth to patients at home during the COVID-19 outbreak would be beneficial for education and improvement in self-management of child health care at home.","Yang, Chen, Zhou, Huang, Dai",https://doi.org/10.2196/23155,20210201.0,COVID-19; child health at home; mHealth; parents; Adult; COVID-19; China; Cross-Sectional Studies; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Humans; Male; Parents; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Surveys and Questionnaires; Telemedicine,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
157,Psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study of online help-seeking Canadian men,"<b>Purpose</b>: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the lives of men. The present study investigated psychosocial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on a help-seeking sample of Canadian men, focusing on diverse aspects of their psychosocial well-being. <b>Methods</b>: A cross-sectional, open survey study design was used. Canadian adult men who were visiting an eHealth depression resource (HeadsUpGuys.org) were recruited to complete an online survey. Descriptive statistics, including means and standard deviations for continuous variables and frequency and percentages for categorical variables, were used to summarize survey responses. Regression analysis was utilized to identify factors associated with various mental health indicators (anxiety, depression, fear of COVID-19, suicidality). The Patient Health Questionnaire-4, Fear of COVID-19 Scale, and item 9 (suicidality item) from the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 were used to assess the mental health indicators. <b>Results</b>: A total of 434 men completed the study. Most respondents (79.3%; N =Â 344) indicated that their mental health was negatively affected by COVID-19, and two-thirds (65.5%; N =Â 284) conveyed that government-imposed physical distancing measures had negatively affected their mental health. Half the sample (51.2%; N =Â 222) reported at least moderate financial stress due to COVID-19. Nearly a third of respondents (31.1%; N =Â 135) reported that their current living situation has had a considerable or severe negative impact on their mental health since COVID-19. About two-fifths (37.7%; N =Â 94) of men felt that COVID-19 has had a negative impact on their relationship with their intimate partner. Nearly a third of respondents who were in a relationship (30.9%; N =Â 77) reported that they engaged in some type of abuse (primarily verbal abuse, 22.9%; N =Â 57) toward their intimate partner during COVID-19, and more than a quarter (27.3%; N =Â 68) reported being abused by their intimate partner (also primarily verbal abuse, 22.5%; N =Â 56). Just under half (42.2%; N =Â 183) of the respondents indicated experiencing suicidal ideation. <b>Conclusion</b>: These findings can help inform providers of health services to Canadian men, as well as policies that will be implemented during subsequent waves of COVID-19 or during future infectious outbreaks.","Ogrodniczuk, Rice, Kealy, Seidler, Delara, Oliffe",https://doi.org/10.1080/00325481.2021.1873027,20210118.0,COVID-19; men; mental health; suicidal ideation,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

Cardiovascular comorbidities and complications, including right ventricular dysfunction, are common and are associated with worse outcomes in patients with COVID-19. The data on the clinical usefulness of the 12-lead ECG to aid with prognosis are limited. This study retrospectively evaluated records from 480 patients who were consecutively admitted with COVID-19. ECGs obtained at presentation in the emergency department (ED) were considered index ECGs. RHS-ECG was defined by any new right-axis deviation, S<sub>1</sub>Q<sub>3</sub>T<sub>3</sub> pattern, or ST depressions with T-wave inversions in leads V<sub>1</sub> to V<sub>3</sub> or leads II, III, and aVF. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to assess whether RHS-ECGs were independently associated with primary outcomes. ECGs from the ED were available for 314 patients who were included in the analysis. Most patients were in sinus rhythm, with sinus tachycardia being the most frequent dysrhythmia. RHS-ECG findings were present in 40 (11%) patients. RHS-ECGs were significantly associated with the incidence of adverse outcomes and an independent predictor of mortality (adjusted odds ratio [adjOR]: 15.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.1 to 45.2; pÂ &lt;Â 0.001), the need for mechanical ventilation (adjOR: 8.8; 95%Â CI: 3.4 to 23.2; pÂ &lt;Â 0.001), and their composite (adjOR: 12.1; 95%Â CI: 4.3 to 33.9]; pÂ &lt;Â 0.001).

160,Suicidal Ideation Among Individuals Who Have Purchased Firearms During COVID-19,"Given the increase in firearm purchases during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study seeks to determine the extent to which COVID-19 firearm purchasers differ in terms of suicide risk from nonfirearm owners and firearm owners who did not make a purchase during COVID-19. Participants (N=3,500) were recruited through Qualtrics Panels to participate in an online survey examining methods for self-protection. ANCOVAs were utilized to assess suicidal ideation. Multivariate ANCOVAs were used to examine firearm storage practices and storage changes during COVID-19. Data were collected in late June and early July 2020, and analyses were conducted in July 2020. Individuals who purchased a firearm during COVID-19 more frequently reported lifetime, past-year, and past-month suicidal ideation than nonfirearm owners and firearm owners who did not make a purchase during COVID-19. COVID-19 purchasers with lifetime ideation were less likely to hide loaded firearms in a closet than those without lifetime ideation. COVID-19 purchasers with past-year or past-month ideation were more likely to use locking devices than COVID-19 purchasers without past-month ideation. In contrast to firearm owners more generally, COVID-19 firearm purchasers appear far more likely to have experienced suicidal ideation and appear less likely to use certain unsafe firearm storage methods but also report a greater number of storage changes during COVID-19 that made firearms less secure. Future research should seek to further understand those who purchased a firearm during COVID-19 and determine ways to increase secure storage among firearm owners.","Anestis, Bond, Daruwala, Bandel, Bryan",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2020.10.013,20210301.0,Adult; COVID-19; Consumer Behavior; Female; Firearms; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Ownership; Suicidal Ideation,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

We analyzed questionnaire data from the end of May 2020 from 180 hospitals (102,578 beds) certified by the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine. Acute (emergency) medicine physicians treated severe COVID-19 patients in more than half of hospitals. Emergency medical teams consisted of acute medicine physicians and other specialists. Frontline acute care physicians were concerned about their risk of infection in 80% of hospitals, and experienced stress due to a lack of personal protective equipment. Twenty-six of the 143 hospitals that had a mental health check/consultation system in place indicated that there was a doctor who experienced mental health problems. Of the 37 hospitals without a system, only one hospital was aware of the presence of a doctor complaining of mental health problems. Acute care physicians and physicians in other departments experienced high levels of stress as they fought to arrange COVID-19 treatment teams and inpatient COVID-19 wards for infected patients. Medical materials and equipment may be sufficient for a second or third wave; however, active support is needed for the physical and mental care of medical staff. Mental health problems may be missed in facilities without mental check and consultation system.","Oda, Tanabe, Nishimura, Muguruma, Matsuyama, Sugawara, Ogura",https://doi.org/10.1002/ams2.614,20201219.0,COVIDâ€19; medical staff; mental care system; survey,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
163,Relationship of Physical Activity With Anxiety and Depression Symptoms in Chinese College Students During the COVID-19 Outbreak,"During the COVID-19 outbreak, many citizens were asked to stay at home in self-quarantine, which can pose a significant challenge with respect to remaining physically active and maintaining mental health. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of inadequate physical activity, anxiety, and depression and to explore the relationship of physical activity with anxiety and depression symptoms among Chinese college students during quarantine. Using a web-based cross-sectional survey, we collected data from 1,396 Chinese college students. Anxiety and depression were assessed with the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), respectively. The data on physical activity were collected by types of physical activity and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-SF). During the COVID-19 outbreak, about 52.3% of Chinese college students had inadequate physical activity. The rates of anxiety and depression symptoms were 31.0 and 41.8%, respectively. A high level of physical activity (Î² = -0.121, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) was significantly closely associated with low anxiety, while a moderate (Î² = -0.095, <i>P</i> = 0.001), or high (Î² = -0.179, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) level of physical activity was significantly closely associated with reduced depression after adjusting confounding demographic factors. Moreover, specific types of physical activity, such as stretching and resistance training, were negatively correlated with both anxiety and depression; doing household chores was negatively correlated with depression. Our findings highlight specific levels and types of home-based physical activities that need to be taken into consideration to protect the mental health of college students during the COVID-19 epidemic.","Xiang, Tan, Sun, Yang, Zhao, Liu, Hou, Hu",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.582436,20201218.0,COVID-19; anxiety; college students; depression; physical activity,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
164,Beneficial Effects of Exercise on Depression and Anxiety During the Covid-19 Pandemic: A Narrative Review,"First reported in Dec 2019, the on-going COVID-19 pandemic has become a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). The isolation and quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic limited the physical and social activities of the population, which contributed to the increased prevalence of mental disorder. Depression and anxiety are the most common mental illnesses conferring a serious impact on individuals' life quality. This review summarizes the mental health consequences of COVID-19, especially for depression and anxiety. Exercise as an intervention for anxiety and depression has been demonstrated in both of the animal studies and human clinical trials. The underlying mechanism including the regulation on the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), D-Î²-hydroxybutyrate, synaptic transmission, hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis, tryptophan hydroxylase, GSK3Î²/Î²-catenin pathway, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and PGC-1Î±1-PPAR axis. In addition, we summarized the exercise strategies to fight against anxiety and depression according to the information from American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), World Health Organization and recent literatures about physical exercise during COVID-19.","Hu, Tucker, Wu, Yang",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.587557,20201218.0,COVID-19; anxiety; depression; isolation; physical exercise; quarantine,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
165,Effect of Psychological-Behavioral Intervention on the Depression and Anxiety of COVID-19 Patients,"The COVID-19 epidemic has caused increasing public panic and mental health stress. In this study, we explore the prevalence and factors linked to anxiety and depression in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. A total of 144 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 underwent depression and anxiety assessment by using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Social support level was also evaluated by the Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS) at admission. Results showed that gender, age, oxygen saturation, and social support were associated with anxiety for COVID-19 patients. In addition, age, family infection with SARS-CoV-2, and social support were the risk factors associated with depression. Moreover, we designed a psychological-behavioral intervention (PBI) program that included psychological support and breathing exercises, and explored its effects on patients with COVID-19. Of the 144 participants, 26 patients with both anxiety and depression symptoms (cutoff score of â‰¥8 on HADS-A and HADS-D) were randomly assigned to the intervention group and the control group at a 1:1 ratio. After 10-day treatment, the HADS scores of depression and anxiety were significantly reduced in the intervention group, and PSSS scores were also significantly improved. However, no significant differences in HADS and PSSS scores between pre- and post-treatment were found in the control group. Our findings indicate that mental concern and appropriate intervention are essential parts of clinical care for COVID-19 patients.","Kong, Kong, Zheng, Tang, Chen, Zhou, Li, Diao, Wu, Jiao, Su, Dong",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.586355,20201218.0,COVID-19; anxiety; depression; psychological-behavioral intervention; social support,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
166,"Mental Health Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on International University Students, Related Stressors, and Coping Strategies","<b>Background:</b> The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted university teaching globally. The mental health impacts on international university students have been overlooked. <b>Aims:</b> This study examined the differences in COVID-19-related stressors and mental health impacts between international university students studying in the UK or USA who returned to their home country or region (returnees) and those who stayed in their institution country (stayers), and identified COVID-19-related stressors and coping strategies that were predictors of mental health. <b>Method:</b> An online questionnaire survey was conducted from April 28 through May 12, 2020 using an exponential, non-discriminative snowball sampling strategy (registered at the National Institutes of Health: NCT04365361). <b>Results:</b> A total of 124 full-time international university students (36.3% male) were included: 75.8% had returned to their home country or region for reasons related to COVID-19; 77.4% were pursuing a bachelor's program, and 53.2% were in programs with practicum component. 84.7% of all students had moderate-to-high perceived stress, 12.1% had moderate-to-severe symptoms of anxiety and depression, and 17.7% had moderate-to-severe symptoms of insomnia. Compared with returnees, stayers had significantly higher stress from COVID-19-related stressors such as personal health and lack of social support (Cohen's d: 0.57-1.11), higher perceived stress [10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10)] {22.6 Â± 6.2 vs. 19.1 Â± 6.1, Î² [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 4.039 (0.816, 7.261), Cohen's d: 0.52}, and more severe insomnia symptoms [Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)] [11.8 Â± 6.1 vs. 7.6 Â± 5.2, Î² (95% CI): 3.087 (0.262, 5.912), Cohen's d: 0.45], with moderate-to-large effect sizes. Compared with males, females reported significantly higher stress from uncertainties about academic program (Cohen's d: 0.45) with a small effect size. In the total sample, stress related to academics (e.g., personal attainment, uncertainties about academic program, and changes in teaching/learning format), health (including personal health and health of family and friends), availability of reliable COVID-19-related information, and lack of social support predicted more negative mental health impacts. Resilience, positive thinking, and exercise were predictors of less severe mental health impacts. <b>Conclusions:</b> Stayers experienced more adverse mental health impacts than returnees. We call on educators and mental health professionals to provide appropriate support for international students, particularly the stayers, during the pandemic.","Lai, Lee, Wang, Feng, Lai, Ho, Lam, Ip, Lam",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.584240,20201218.0,anxiety; coping; depression; insomnia; mental health; stress; students; university,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
167,A Systematic Review of the Impact of Viral Respiratory Epidemics on Mental Health: An Implication on the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic,"<b>Background:</b> The twenty-first century viral respiratory epidemics have taught us valuable lessons. Our systematic review examined the impact of these epidemics, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), on mental health among different population groups, drawing on their insights for recommendations for the current COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> Searches were performed on PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, and Cochrane on April 4, 2020. Studies that had undefined mental health outcomes or did not use a validated scale for measure were excluded. Quality assessment was carried out <i>via</i> the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. <b>Results:</b> We included 95 studies, most of which were conducted in Hong Kong (31.6%) and China (21.4%). A total of 30 (30.9%) studies are on the general public, 41 (42.2%) on healthcare workers, and 26 (26.6%) on patients and quarantined individuals. Furthermore, 36 (37.1%) of the studies are of high quality, 48 (49.5%) are of moderate quality, and 13 (13.4%) are of low quality. The most significant mental health outcomes reported include anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. The subgroups identified to have a higher risk of psychiatric symptoms among the general public include females, the elderly, individuals with chronic illness, migrant workers, and students. Long-term mental health impact was reported in some healthcare workers and epidemic patients, even up to 3 years in the former. Interestingly, when compared to non-quarantined groups, quarantine was not significantly associated with worse mental health outcomes. <b>Conclusion:</b> Important implications for the COVID-19 pandemic were highlighted. Respiratory epidemics pose a significant psychological morbidity onto many population groups. Psychological support for vulnerable groups, including healthcare workers and patients, should be implemented to prevent them from spiraling into clinical psychiatric conditions.","Luo, Chua, Xiong, Ho, Ho",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.565098,20201218.0,COVID-19; MERS; SARS; coronavirus; epidemics; influenza; mental health,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
168,Suicide Ideation and Attempts in a Pediatric Emergency Department Before and During COVID-19,"Elevated rates of mental health concerns have been identified during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In this study, we sought to evaluate whether youth reported a greater frequency of suicide-related behaviors during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic as compared with 2019. We hypothesized that rates of suicide-related behaviors would be elevated between the months of March and July 2020 as compared with 2019, corresponding to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Routine suicide-risk screening was completed with youth aged 11 to 21 in a pediatric emergency department. Electronic health records data for suicide-risk screens completed between January and July 2019 and January and July 2020 were evaluated. A total of 9092 completed screens were examined (mean age 14.72 years, 47.7% Hispanic and/or Latinx, 26.7% non-Hispanic white, 18.7% non-Hispanic Black). Rates of positive suicide-risk screen results from January to July 2020 were compared with corresponding rates from January to July 2019. Results indicated a significantly higher rate of suicide ideation in March and July 2020 and higher rates of suicide attempts in February, March, April, and July 2020 as compared with the same months in 2019. Rates of suicide ideation and attempts were higher during some months of 2020 as compared with 2019 but were not universally higher across this period. Months with significantly higher rates of suicide-related behaviors appear to correspond to times when COVID-19-related stressors and community responses were heightened, indicating that youth experienced elevated distress during these periods.","Hill, Rufino, Kurian, Saxena, Saxena, Williams",https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2020-029280,20210312.0,"Adolescent; COVID-19; Child; Emergency Service, Hospital; Female; Hospitals, Pediatric; Humans; Male; Pandemics; Prevalence; SARS-CoV-2; Stress, Psychological; Suicidal Ideation; Suicide, Attempted; United States; Young Adult",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
169,[Anxiety and Depression Associated with the Management of COVID-19 Among Healthcare workers in Cameroon],"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact worldwide, at different levels. The literature consulted indicates that healthcare workers, who are the first to respond, are generally the ones who pay the highest price. The present study assesses the extent of anxious and depressive symptoms among these actors responding to COVID-19, in the context of Cameroon. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to assess anxious and depressive symptoms. Data collection involved the use of a web questionnaire for this purpose through the Google Forms virtual platform. The questionnaire link was sent to professional groups spread throughout Cameroon's ten regions. A total of 331 health professionals were interviewed over the period from April 5 to 19, 2020. The results show a high rate of anxiety (41.8%) and depression (42.8%). There is a higher susceptibility to depression in young people (30-39 years). Fear of contamination and fear of death are modulators of depression and anxiety. The anxiety-depression comorbidity in the sample is 14.73%. The prevalence rates of major depressive disorder and adjustment disorder in the sample were 8.2% and 3.3%, respectively. The data presented confirm the trends recorded in the literature regarding the impact of fatal epidemics on the mental health of healthcare workers. The results indicate, as is the case with most of the work consulted in the literature, that the Covid 19 pandemic is significantly affecting the mental health of healthcare workers. This underlines the urgency of setting up a specialized aid and/or support system, in the context of the current pandemic, such as that of similar health crises. Such a device does not exist in Cameroon, where the mental health response remains weak. These results suggest that the healthcare staff involved in the response to COVID-19 in Cameroon are significantly affected in their mental health. This underlines the need for specialized psychological help for nursing staff.","Mboua, Keubo, Fouaka",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.evopsy.2020.11.002,20210225.0,Adjustment disorder; Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Healthcare worker; Major depressive disorder; Mental health,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
170,Effects of COVID-19 Epidemic Lockdown on Postpartum Depressive Symptoms in a Sample of Italian Mothers,"The extraordinary health emergency of the COVID-19 pandemic represents a new challenge for mental health researchers and clinical practitioners. The related containment measures may be a risk factor for psychological distress and mood disorders, especially in at-risk populations. This study aims to explore the impact of COVID-19 on postpartum depressive symptoms in mothers with children below 1 year of age. An online questionnaire survey was therefore conducted in Italy between May and June 2020. The survey consisted of several self-administered questionnaires: besides some <i>ad-hoc</i> questionnaires, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), the Scale of Perceived Social Support (SPSS) and the Maternity Social Support Scale (MSSS) were used. Two hundred forty-three Italian women were included in the study. The prevalence of postpartum depression symptomatology among mothers was 44%, as measured through the EPDS (cut-off &gt;12). Women who spent the isolation in northern Italy adopted maladaptive coping strategies significantly more than women living in areas at lower risk. The analysis highlighted a significant difference between the group that was not directly affected by the virus and women who have had a direct or indirect contact with it. Besides situational factors specific to the pandemic, the results show that there are some risk factors tied to the personal history of the mother (e.g., having had a previous abortion). These data should inform and enlighten future protocols of intervention.","Spinola, Liotti, Speranza, Tambelli",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.589916,20201216.0,COVID- 19; lockdown; mental health; motherhood; postpartum depression (PPD),PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

However, there is limited information from clinically driven research. The objectives of the present study were to examine the magnitude of psychiatric symptoms and to determine their association with caregiver distress, in a cross-section of community-dwelling older adults and a subsample of aging adults with Down syndrome (DS) attending a psychogeriatric service in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. <b>Method:</b> Telephone-based interviews and electronically filled self-assessment questionnaires were used to collect information from patients and caregivers, addressing their impressions and concerns about the pandemic and related effects on the patient's emotional state and behavior. Clinical information was obtained from hospital charts, medical records, and psychometric tests administered through telephone interviews [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q)]. <b>Results:</b> We included 100 consecutive participants, comprising 71 older adults with psychogeriatric/neurocognitive disorders and 29 aging adults with DS. Higher HADS and NPI-Q scores were significantly associated with caregiver distress (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) in both groups. Correlation analyses indicated strong, positive associations between caregiver burden and scores in HADS anxiety (HADS-A) and HADS depression (HADS-D) scales in the subsamples of euploid and DS subjects. Higher NPI-Q scores in the former group were also correlated with caregiver distress, with stronger associations for neuropsychiatric symptoms. Similar findings were observed among DS subjects. ANOVA tests indicated significant associations between NPI-Q scores and caregiver distress among dementia patients, as well as with HADS scores. Similar results were found after multiple linear regressions; as such, among the elderly subsample, higher scores in HADS-A (<i>p</i> = 0.002) and HADS-D (<i>p</i> = 0.001) predict a significant impact on caregiver burden (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.00001, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> 0.46); taking into consideration caregiver burden as a dependent variable and NPI-Q total score as an independent variable, we obtained significant strong prediction values for either DS (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.00001, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> 0.95) or elderly adults (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.00001, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> 0.88). <b>Conclusion:</b> During the COVID-19 pandemic, patients with neurocognitive disorders present with clinically relevant neuropsychiatric symptoms, with significant impact on caregiver distress. Apathy, aberrant motor behavior, sleep disorders, and psychoses were the main psychopathological domains, which had determined caregiver burden worsening.","Penteado, Loureiro, Pais, Carvalho, Sant'Ana, Valiengo, Stella, Forlenza",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.578672,20201216.0,Down syndrome; caregiver burden; caregiver distress; coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); mental health; pandemic; psychogeriatrics,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
172,"Physical Inactivity Is Associated With Increased Levels of Anxiety, Depression, and Stress in Brazilians During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study","<b>Objective:</b> To evaluate the levels of anxiety, depression, and stress associated with the practice of physical exercise (PE) during pandemic by COVID-19. <b>Methods:</b> This study has a cross-sectional characteristic and was carried out between May 12 and 14, 2020. An online questionnaire was applied with questions to assess sociodemographic characteristics and physical exercise during the CoVID-19 pandemic, in addition to depression, anxiety, and stress analysis. The study was approved by the local ethics committee (CAAE: 31521720.8.0000.5082). <b>Results:</b> One thousand one hundred and fifty four answered the questionnaire (69.84% female). During the isolation period, the number of participants who declared not to exercise was 54.16%. Women generaly presented higher levels of anxiety, depression, and stress when compared to men (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001 for all domains). The risk of having increased anxiety were 118% higher (OR = 2.183; 95% CI = 1.717-2.775), the risk of depression was 152% higher (OR = 2.525; 95% CI = 1.991-3.205), and the risk of stress symptoms increased 75.1% (OR = 1.751; 95% CI = 1.386-2.213) in the participants who did not perform PE when compared to those who maintain regular PE. <b>Conclusion:</b> People who was not involved with PE during the COVID-19 pandemic had higher anxiety, depression, and stress scores. Based on this, it seems important to advise people to continue PE, following all the recommendations of preventive measures of the pertinent health organizations.","Silva, Seguro, de Oliveira, Santos, de Oliveira, de Souza Filho, de Paula JÃºnior, Gentil, Rebelo",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.565291,20201216.0,COVID-19; anxiety; depression; mental health; pandemic; physical exercise; physical inactivity; stress,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

175,Healthy Dietary Intake Behavior Potentially Modifies the Negative Effect of COVID-19 Lockdown on Depression: A Hospital and Health Center Survey,"<b>Background:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic causes a huge burden for affected countries. Several public health interventions were applied to contain the infection. However, the pandemic itself and the lockdown measure negatively influence people's lifestyles and psychological health. <b>Purpose:</b> To explore determinants of healthy dietary intake and depression, and examine the interaction between healthy dietary intake and COVID-19 lockdown on depression. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional study was conducted at 18 hospitals and health centers from February 14 to May 31, 2020. Data of 8,291 outpatients were collected including patients' characteristics, clinical parameters, health literacy, healthy dietary intake (using the healthy eating score, HES), other health-related behaviors, and depression (using the patient health questionnaire, PHQ). Depression was defined as PHQ score â‰¥ 10. <b>Results:</b> Protective factors of healthy dietary intake and depression were higher education, better medication payment ability, higher social status, more physical activity, and higher health literacy, whereas older age, ever married, own business or other types of occupation, lockdown, suspected COVID-19 symptoms, and comorbidity were associated with lower HES scores and a higher depression likelihood. Besides, overweight/obesity and alcohol drinking were associated with lower HES scores. As compared with patients not under lockdown and with lowest HES score, those who were under lockdown and with lowest HES score had 10.6 times higher depression likelihood (odds ratio, OR, 10.60; 95% CI 6.88, 16.32; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), whereas people with higher HES score had 15% lower depression likelihood (OR 0.85; 95% CI 0.82, 0.89; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). <b>Conclusions:</b> Healthy dietary intake and depression were determined by several sociodemographic, clinical, and behavioral factors. Lockdown measure affects people's dietary intake behavior and depression. Importantly, healthy dietary intake potentially modifies the negative effect of lockdown on depression.","Pham, Pham, Phan, Tran, Nguyen, Nguyen, Nguyen, Ha, Dao, Nguyen, Trinh, Do, Nguyen, Nguyen, Nguyen, Tran, Tran, Duong, Nguyen, Do, Vo, Do, Duong, Pham, Le, Do, Nguyen, Mai, Ha, Ngo, Nguyen, Yang, Chao, Duong",https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2020.581043,20201212.0,COVID-19; comorbidity; coronavirus; healthy eating; lockdown; obesity; physical activity; psychological,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
176,Poor Sleep Quality and Its Consequences on Mental Health During the COVID-19 Lockdown in Italy,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) seriously affected the whole of Italy. The extreme virulence and the speed of propagation resulted in restrictions and home confinement. This change was immediately perceived by people who found themselves exposed to feelings of uncertainty, fear, anger, stress, and a drastic change in the diurnal but above all nocturnal lifestyle. For these reasons, we aimed to study the quality of sleep and its connection to distress levels and to evaluate how lifestyle changed in the Italian population during the lockdown. By means of an Internet survey we recruited 6,519 adults during the whole of the COVID-19 lockdown (from March 10-1st phase to May 4-2nd phase). We investigated the sociodemographic and COVID-19-related information and assessed sleep quality using the Medical Outcomes Study-sleep scale (MOS-SS) and mental health with the short form of Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales-21 Items (DASS-21). Multiple logistic regression model was used to evaluate the multivariate association between the dependent variable (good sleeper vs. poor sleeper) and all the variables that were significant in the univariate analysis. A total of 3,562 (55.32%) participants reported poor sleep quality according to the MOS-Sleep Index II score. The multiple binary logistic regression results of poor sleepers revealed several risk factors during the outbreak restrictions: female gender, living in Central Italy, having someone close who died because of COVID-19, markedly changed sleep-wake rhythms characterized by earlier or postponed habitual bedtime, earlier habitual awakening time and reduced number of afternoon naps, and extremely severe levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. This is the first study designed to understand sleep quality and sleep habits during the whole of the lockdown period in the Italian population that provides more than 6,000 participants in a survey developed specifically for the health emergency related to COVID-19. Our study found that more than half of the Italian population had impaired sleep quality and sleep habits due to elevated psychological distress during the COVID-19 lockdown containment measures. A multidisciplinary action should be undertaken in order to plan appropriate responses to the current crisis caused by the lockdown for the COVID-19 outbreak.","Franceschini, Musetti, Zenesini, Palagini, Scarpelli, Quattropani, Lenzo, Freda, Lemmo, Vegni, Borghi, Saita, Cattivelli, De Gennaro, Plazzi, Riemann, Castelnuovo",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.574475,20201212.0,COVID-19; Italian lockdown; anxiety; clinical psychology; depression; sleep habits; sleep quality; stress,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
177,"Social, Cognitive, and eHealth Mechanisms of COVID-19-Related Lockdown and Mandatory Quarantine That Potentially Affect the Mental Health of Pregnant Women in China: Cross-Sectional Survey Study","Although lockdown and mandatory quarantine measures have played crucial roles in the sharp decrease of the number of newly confirmed/suspected COVID-19 cases, concerns have been raised over the threat that these measures pose to mental health, especially the mental health of vulnerable groups, including pregnant women. Few empirical studies have assessed whether and how these control measures may affect mental health, and no study has investigated the prevalence and impacts of the use of eHealth resources among pregnant women during the COVID-19 outbreak. This study investigated (1) the effects of lockdown and mandatory quarantine on mental health problems (ie, anxiety and depressive symptoms), (2) the potential mediation effects of perceived social support and maladaptive cognition, and (3) the moderation effects of eHealth-related factors (ie, using social media to obtain health information and using prenatal care services during the COVID-19 pandemic) on pregnant women in China. An online cross-sectional survey was conducted among 19,515 pregnant women from all 34 Chinese provincial-level administrative regions from February 25 to March 10, 2020. Of the 19,515 participants, 12,209 (62.6%) were subjected to lockdown in their areas of residence, 737 (3.8%) were subjected to mandatory quarantine, 8712 (44.6%) had probable mild to severe depression, 5696 (29.2%) had probable mild to severe anxiety, and 1442 (7.4%) had suicidal ideations. Only 640 (3.3%) participants reported that they used online prenatal care services during the outbreak. Significant sociodemographic/maternal factors of anxiety/depressive symptoms included age, education, occupation, the area of residence, gestational duration, the number of children born, complication during pregnancy, the means of using prenatal care services, and social media use for obtaining health information. Multiple indicators multiple causes modeling (Ï‡<sup>2</sup><sub>14</sub>=495.21; P&lt;.05; comparative fit index=.99; nonnormed fit index=.98; root mean square error of approximation=.04, 90% CI 0.038-0.045) showed that quarantine was directly and indirectly strongly associated with poor mental health through decreased perceived social support and increased maladaptive cognition (B=.04; Î²=.02, 95% CI 0.01-0.02; P=.001), while lockdown was indirectly associated with mental health through increased social support and maladaptive cognition among pregnant women (B=.03; Î²=.03, 95% CI 0.02-0.03; P=.001). Multigroup analyses revealed that the use of social media for obtaining health information and the means of using prenatal care services were significant moderators of the model paths. Our findings provide epidemiological evidence for the importance of integrating mental health care and eHealth into the planning and implementation of control measure policies. The observed social and cognitive mechanisms and moderators in this study are modifiable, and they can inform the design of evidence-based mental health promotion among pregnant women.","Yang, Song, Wu, Mo, Di, Wang, Lau, Wang",https://doi.org/10.2196/24495,20210128.0,anxiety; depression; eHealth; lockdown; pregnant women; quarantine; Adult; Anxiety; COVID-19; China; Cognition; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Female; Humans; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pregnancy; Pregnant Women; Prenatal Care; Quarantine; Suicidal Ideation; Surveys and Questionnaires; Telemedicine,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
178,"The effect of Emotional Freedom Techniques on nurses' stress, anxiety, and burnout levels during the COVID-19 pandemic: A randomized controlled trial","Infectious disease outbreaks pose psychological challenges to the general population, and especially to healthcare workers. Nurses who work with COVID-19 patients are particularly vulnerable to emotions such as fear and anxiety, due to fatigue, discomfort, and helplessness related to their high intensity work. This study aims to investigate the efficacy of a brief online form of Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT) in the prevention of stress, anxiety, and burnout in nurses involved in the treatment of COVID patients. The study is a randomized controlled trial. It complies with the guidelines prescribed by the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) checklist. It was conducted in a COVID-19 department at a university hospital in Turkey. We recruited nurses who care for patients infected with COVID-19 and randomly allocated them into an intervention group (nÂ =Â 35) and a no-treatment control group (nÂ =Â 37). The intervention group received one guided online group EFT session. Reductions in stress (p &lt; .001), anxiety (p &lt; .001), and burnout (p &lt; .001) reached high levels of statistical significance for the intervention group. The control group showed no statistically significant changes on these measures (p &gt; .05).

179,&quot;Staying at home&quot; to tackle COVID-19 pandemic: rhetoric or reality? Cross-cutting analysis of nine population groups vulnerable to homelessness in Japan,"Although the &quot;stay-at-home&quot; order is advocated against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the lives of individuals lacking adequate housing are threatened. We developed a framework to assess various populations with unstable housing in terms of socio-economic consequences of COVID-19, risk of COVID-19 infection and progression, existing/urgent measures, and remaining challenges. Within the framework, nine groups vulnerable to homelessness in Japan were classified into (i) &quot;people without accommodation,&quot; (ii) &quot;people living in temporary or crisis accommodation,&quot; and (iii) populations that include &quot;people living in severely inadequate and insecure accommodation.&quot; The assessment revealed that &quot;staying at home&quot; was physically and practically unattainable across groups. The study identified specific institutional, social, and cultural challenges apart from the common economic crisis, whereas the utilization of social welfare was low. Findings suggest that the rapid increase of groups classified as &quot;(i)&quot; and &quot;(ii)&quot; should be addressed by engaging stakeholders to enhance the availability and accessibility of social welfare and rescue measures, and to ensure safe and private accommodations for all groups. It is critical to enhance multi-sectoral collaboration in responding to the common and specific vulnerabilities of these population groups from health, socio-economic, and humanitarian perspectives. Under the pandemic, homelessness should be regarded less as a peculiar problem for specific populations but an extension of daily life. The framework can be a reference when planning the comprehensive yet concise assessment of populations with unstable housing in other countries to inform responses to the pandemic.","Fujita, Matsuoka, Kiyohara, Kumakura, Takeda, Goishi, Tarui, Inaba, Nagai, Hachiya, Fujita",https://doi.org/10.1186/s41182-020-00281-0,20201212.0,COVID-19; Homelessness; Staying at home; Vulnerable populations,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
180,Analysis of news media reports of suicides and attempted suicides during the COVID-19 lockdown in India,"Based on previous experience there is justifiable concern about suicidal behaviour and news media reporting of it during COVID-19 pandemic. This study used a systematic search of online news media reports (versions of newspapers, magazine and other digital publications) of suicidal behaviour during India's COVID-19 lockdown and compared it to corresponding dates in 2019. Data was gathered using a uniform search strategy from 56 online news media publications 24 March to 3 May for the years 2019 and 2020 using keywords, suicide, attempted suicide, hangs self and kills self. Demographic variables and methods used for suicide were compared for suicide and attempts between the 2Â years using chi-squared tests (Ï‡<sup>2</sup>). There were online news media reports of 369 cases of suicides and attempted suicides during COVID lockdown vs 220 reports in 2019, a 67.7% increase in online news media reports of suicidal behaviour. Compared to 2019, suicides reported during lockdown were significantly older (30 vs 50Â years, pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.05), men (71.2% vs 58.7%; pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.01), married (77.7% vs 49%; pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.01) and employed (82.9% vs 59.5%; pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.01). During the lockdown, significantly more suicides were by hanging (64.4% vs 42%), while poisoning (8.5% vs 21.5%) and jumping in front of a train (2% vs 9.4%) (pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.05) were significantly reduced. Comparison of COVID and non-COVID groups showed that online news media reports of COVID cases of suicide and attempted suicide were significantly more likely to be men (84.7% vs 60.4%; pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.01), older (31-50Â years 52.9% vs 25.8%; pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.01) employed (91.5% vs 64.3%; pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.01), had poor mental (40.1% vs 20.8%; pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.01) and poor physical health (24.8% vs 7.9%;11.8, pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.01). Increase in online news media reports of suicides and attempts during COVID-19 lockdown may indicate an increase in journalists' awareness about suicide or more sensational media reporting or may be a proxy indicator of a real community increase in suicidal behaviour. It is difficult to attribute changes in demographic profile and methods used only to changes in journalists' reporting behaviour and should be further explored. We therefore call upon the Government of India to urgently release national suicide data to help devise a comprehensive suicide prevention strategy to address COVID-19 suicidal behaviour.","Pathare, Vijayakumar, Fernandes, Shastri, Kapoor, Pandit, Lohumi, Ray, Kulkarni, Korde",https://doi.org/10.1186/s13033-020-00422-2,20201212.0,Attempted suicides; COVID-19; India; Lockdown; Reports; Suicide,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
181,Mental Health and Burnout Syndrome Among Postgraduate Students in Medical and Multidisciplinary Residencies During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Brazil: Protocol for a Prospective Cohort Study,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to high levels of physical, psychological, and social stress among health care professionals, including postgraduate students in medical and multidisciplinary residencies. This stress is associated with the intense fear of occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the virus known to cause COVID-19. These professionals are at risk of developing physical and mental illnesses not only due to the infection but also due to prolonged exposure to multidimensional stress and continued work overload. This study aims to evaluate the prevalence of symptoms suggestive of mental disorders and burnout syndrome and determine the risk factors for burnout among postgraduate students in medical and multidisciplinary residencies in Brazil during the COVID-19 pandemic. For this prospective cohort study with parallel groups, participants were recruited between July and September 2020 to achieve a sample size of at least 1144 participants. Research instruments such as Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale; Patient Health Questionnaire; Brief Resilient Coping Scale; and Oldenburg Burnout Inventory will be used to collect data. Data will be collected in 2 waves: the first wave will include data related to sample characterization and psychosocial evaluation, and the second wave will be launched 12 weeks later and will include an evaluation of the incidence of burnout as well as correlations with the potential predictive factors collected in the first wave. Additionally, we will collect data regarding participants' withdrawal from work. The recruitment took place from July 29 to September 5, 2020. Data analyses for this phase is already in progress. The second phase of the study is also in progress. The final data collection began on December 1, 2020, and it will be completed by December 31, 2020. We believe the findings of this study will help evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health conditions of health professionals in Brazil as well as contribute to the planning and implementation of appropriate measures that can alleviate these mental health challenges.

183,The Impact of Coping Strategies and Perceived Family Support on Depressive and Anxious Symptomatology During the Coronavirus Pandemic (COVID-19) Lockdown,"The coronavirus pandemic represents a severe global crisis, affecting physical, and psychological health. Lockdown rules imposed to counteract the rapid growth of COVID-19, mainly social restrictions, have represented a risk factor for developing depressive and anxious symptoms. The research aims are to explore the effect of coping strategies and perceived social support on depressive and anxious symptomatology during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ninety-six healthy people (46 males, mean age = 39.3; <i>SD</i> = 16.6) completed through on-line platform: Socio-demographic questionnaire, Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (CISS), Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) and Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R), 3 weeks after the imposition of lockdown restrictions. SCL-90-R Depression scores showed significant positive correlation with CISS Emotion (<i>r</i> = 0.85; <i>p</i> = 0.001) and Avoidant (<i>r</i> = 0.34; <i>p</i> = 0.018), a significant negative correlation with MSPSS Family support (<i>r</i> = -0.43; <i>p</i> = 0.003). SCL-90-R Anxiety scores showed a significant positive correlation with CISS Emotion (<i>r</i> = 0.72; <i>p</i> = 0.001) and Avoidant (<i>r</i> = 0.35; <i>p</i> = 0.016). No significant correlations between both CISS Emotion and Avoidant scales with social support emerged. Two Multiple Linear Regression analysis were performed using, respectively, SCL-90-R Depression and Anxiety scores as dependent variables, and the CISS and MSPSS scales, age, and gender as predictors. The first regression model (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.78; adjusted <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.75) revealed CISS Emotion (Î² = 0.83; <i>p</i> = 0.001) and MSPSS Family support (Î² = -0.24; <i>p</i> = 0.004) had a predictive effect on SCL-90-R Depression scores. The second regression model (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.52; adjusted <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.472) revealed that only CISS Emotion (Î² = 0.71; <i>p</i> = 0.001) predicted the SCL-90-R Anxiety scores. In conclusion, during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns, coping focus on emotions seemed to increase anxious and depressive symptoms, probably due to the uncontrollable nature of the stressful event and the high emotional response. Family support which reduces the sense of loneliness had an exclusive role in mitigating depressive symptoms. These results highlight the importance of promoting psychological strategies to improve emotional regulation skills, reducing isolation from family, to prevent mood symptomatology in healthy citizens during large-scale health crises.","Mariani, Renzi, Di Trani, Trabucchi, Danskin, Tambelli",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.587724,20201208.0,COVID-19; anxiety; coping strategies; coronavirus pandemic; depression; perceived support,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

In the matched cohort, individuals discharged to an institution experienced greater physical (62.7% vs 25.5%, P&lt;.001) and mental health (49.0% vs 23.5%, P=.006) deficits than patients discharged home. Marital status (odds ratio, 3.17; P=.011) and physical function deficits (odds ratio, 3.63; P=.025) were associated with an increase odds ratio of discharge to an institution. This research highlights that functional status is a strong predictor for discharge destination to an institution for patients with COVID-19. Patients who were older, in the acute care hospital longer, and with comorbidities were more likely to be discharged to an institution. Rehabilitation is a significant aspect of the health care system for these vulnerable patients. The challenges of adjusting the role of rehabilitation providers and systems during the pandemic needs further exploration. Moreover, additional research is needed to look more closely at the many facets and timing of functional status needs, to shed light in use of interdisciplinary rehabilitation services, and to guide providers and health care systems in facilitating optimal recovery and patient outcomes.","Roberts, Wertheimer, Park, NuÃ±o, Riggs",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apmr.2020.11.005,20210308.0,"COVID-19; Rehabilitation; Academic Medical Centers; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Hospitals, Community; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Patient Discharge; Physical Functional Performance; Propensity Score; Recovery of Function; Registries; Rehabilitation Centers; Retrospective Studies; SARS-CoV-2",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

186,Burnout and Associated Factors Among Health Care Workers in Singapore During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"The strain on health care systems due to the COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased psychological distress among health care workers (HCWs). As this global crisis continues with little signs of abatement, we examine burnout and associated factors among HCWs. Cross-sectional survey study. Doctors, nurses, allied health professionals, administrative, and support staff in 4 public hospitals and 1 primary care service in Singapore 3Â months after COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic. Study questionnaire captured demographic and workplace environment information and comprised 3 validated instruments, namely the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI), Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Multivariate mixed model regression analyses were used to evaluate independent associations of mean OLBI-Disengagement and -Exhaustion scores. Further subgroup analysis was performed among redeployed HCWs. Among 11,286 invited HCWs, 3075 valid responses were received, giving an overall response rate of 27.2%. Mean OLBI scores were 2.38 and 2.50 for Disengagement and Exhaustion, respectively. Burnout thresholds in Disengagement and Exhaustion were met by 79.7% and 75.3% of respondents, respectively. On multivariate regression analysis, Chinese or Malay ethnicity, HADS anxiety or depression scores â‰¥8, shifts lasting â‰¥8Â hours, and being redeployed were significantly associated with higher OLBI mean scores, whereas high SAQ scores were significantly associated with lower scores. Among redeployed HCWs, those redeployed to high-risk areas in a different facility (offsite) had lower burnout scores than those redeployed within their own work facility (onsite). A higher proportion of HCWs redeployed offsite assessed their training to be good or better compared with those redeployed onsite. Every level of the health care workforce is susceptible to high levels of burnout during this pandemic. Modifiable workplace factors include adequate training, avoiding prolonged shifts â‰¥8Â hours, and promoting safe working environments. Mitigating strategies should target every level of the health care workforce, including frontline and nonfrontline staff. Addressing and ameliorating burnout among HCWs should be a key priority for the sustainment of efforts to care for patients in the face of a prolonged pandemic.","Tan, Kanneganti, Lim, Tan, Chua, Tan, Sia, Denning, Goh, Purkayastha, Kinross, Sim, Chan, Ooi",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2020.09.035,20201218.0,"COVID-19; anxiety; burnout; depression; health care workers; pandemic; Adult; Anxiety; Burnout, Professional; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Singapore; Surveys and Questionnaires",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
187,&quot;The psychological impact of COVID-19 on medical education of final year students in Pakistan: A cross-sectional study&quot;,"COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a strong impact on students' wellbeing, with associated uncertainty about the future. We conducted a cross-sectional survey to assess the psychological effects of COVID-19 on the medical education of final year students in Pakistan. We conducted prospective, cross-sectional survey, as a snapshot, from June 07, 2020 till June 16, 2020, among final year medical and dental students. The 20-questions survey questionnaire was based on rating-scale items to focus on psychological symptoms, institutional preparedness for such crisis and confidence in becoming a future doctor. Descriptive statistics were calculated using Multivariate regression analysis. Majority of participants (nâ€¯=â€¯1753/2661, 65.9%) were female. Despite timely closure of institutes, delay in the start of the online teaching (beta coefficient 0.08, P-value 0.02) was significantly correlated with the depressive symptoms. A significant percentage of students (nâ€¯=â€¯1594, 59.9%) wanted a delay in exit exams due to intimidation. A similar proportion of students also lost confidence to be a competent doctor in future which was positively associated with male gender (beta coefficient 0.21, P-valueâ€¯&lt;â€¯0.001). Our study shows that COVID-19 pandemic has brought significant psychological influence on the medical education of final year students. Despite a stressful crisis, final year medical and dental students are still willing to serve the community. In addition to supporting their emotions and psychological wellbeing, stress counselling, and transforming current medical curricula is crucial to pursue ceaseless medical education and to become a safe future doctor.","Dhahri, Arain, Memon, Rao, Mian, Khan, Hafeez, Dhahri, Mustafa, Malhi, Iqbal, Ahmad, Aziz, Arain, Nankani, Hussain, Kausar, Saqlain, Chawla, Azhar, Haneef, Arain, Arain, Shahid, Iqbal, Mughal, Awan, Mehbub, Qiam, Abro, Khattak, Bhatti, Choudhary, Khan, Baqai, Afzal, Dhahri, Dhahri, Ghufran, Umbrin, Shehdio, Shaikh, Dhahri, Memon, Yousufzai, Kumar, Ilyas, Chaudhary, Nawaz, Bilal, Faraz, Chawla, Shaikh",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2020.11.025,20210127.0,,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
188,"Young people, mental health and COVID-19 infection: the canaries we put in the coal mine","The number of people testing positive for Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) in the UK, particularly among young adults, is increasing. We report here on the mental health of young adults and related psychological and behavioural responses to the pandemic and consider the role of these factors in fuelling the increase in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in this group. An online survey was completed during the first six weeks of the first UK-wide lockdown by 3097 respondents, including data for 364 respondents aged 18-24 years. The survey included measures of mental health and indices capturing related psychological and behavioural responses to the pandemic. The mental health of 18- to 24-years-olds in the first 6 weeks of lockdown was significantly poorer than that of older respondents and previously published norms: with 84% reporting symptoms of depression and 72% reporting symptoms of anxiety. Young adults also reported significantly greater loneliness and reduced positive mood, both of which were also associated with greater mental health difficulties. We contend that the combination of mental health, social and economic considerations may have contributed to the rise of COVID-19 infections in young adults, and ascribing blame to this group will not aid our efforts to regain control of the disease.","Jia, Ayling, Chalder, Massey, Broadbent, Morling, Coupland, Vedhara",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2020.10.018,20210101.0,Behaviour; COVID-19; Mental health; Young people; Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior; Anxiety; Anxiety Disorders; COVID-19; Communicable Disease Control; Depression; Female; Humans; Loneliness; Male; Mental Health; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires; United Kingdom; Young Adult,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
189,Predictors of managers' mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic,"This study reports early evidence of managers' mental health and its predictors during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in May 2020. In a sample of 646 managers from 49 countries, 5.3% (32) of managers reached the cut-off levels for disorders in distress (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale-6; K-6), 7.3% (38) experienced anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder-7; GAD-7), and 10.7% (56) had depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9; PHQ-9). Age, relative income, and work status each predicted at least one of the conditions. Managers' 'illegitimate tasks' caused by COVID-19 predicted all three. Particularly noteworthy is the finding that the degree of downsizing an organization experienced during COVID-19 significantly predicted distress, anxiety, and depression for managers at the highest level (board members) only. This study helps identify managers in need of healthcare services as the COVID-19 pandemic affects organizations and their managers around the world. Este estudio informa sobre evidencia temprana en salud mental de los gerentes y sus predictores durante la pandemia de la enfermedad del coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) en mayo de 2020. En una muestra de 646 gerentes de 49 paÃ­ses, el 5.3% (32) de los gerentes alcanzaron niveles de punto de corte para trastornos en angustia (escala de angustia PsicolÃ³gica de Kessler-6; K-6), el 7,3% (38) experimentÃ³ ansiedad (Trastorno de ansiedad generalizado-7; GAD-7) y el 10,7% (56) tenÃ­a depresiÃ³n (Cuestionario de salud del paciente- 9; PHQ-9). La edad, los ingresos relativos y la situaciÃ³n laboral predijeron por si solos al menos una de las condiciones. Las â€˜tareas ilegÃ­timasâ€™ de los gerentes causadas por COVID-19 predijeron las tres. Particularmente digno de menciÃ³n es el hallazgo de que el grado de reducciÃ³n que experimentÃ³ una organizaciÃ³n durante el COVID-19 predijo significativamente angustia, ansiedad y depresiÃ³n solo para los gerentes del mÃ¡s alto nivel (miembros del directorio).

191,A Digital Program (Hope) for People Living With Cancer During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Protocol for a Feasibility Randomized Controlled Trial,"During the COVID-19 lockdown period in the United Kingdom that began on March 23, 2020, more than a quarter of a million people with cancer reported worsening mental health. Help to Overcome Problems Effectively (Hope) is a self-management program for people with cancer, designed to provide support for distress, unmet needs, and poor psychological health. In light of social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic, digital delivery of the Hope Programme has become ever more vital for people with cancer. Previous pre-post studies of the digital Hope Programme have found reduced anxiety and depression and improved well-being for people with cancer. However, evaluation of this evidence has been limited by the lack of a control group in these previous studies. We now present a protocol for a feasibility randomized controlled trial of the digital Hope Programme for people with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. Primary outcomes will be recruitment, dropout, and adherence rates, and estimations of sample and effect size. To detect signals of efficacy, secondary outcomes will be participant mental health and well-being. Participants will be recruited by Macmillan Cancer Support (MCS) through their social media networks. The study will employ a feasibility wait-list randomized controlled trial (RCT) design, with people with cancer being randomized to join the digital Hope Programme immediately (intervention group [IG]) or join a 6-week waiting list (wait-list control group [WLCG]) with a 1:1 allocation ratio. Participants will complete digital measures of depression, anxiety, mental well-being, and confidence in managing their own health. Online questionnaires will be administered preprogram and 6 weeks postprogram. All people who had requested access to the Hope Programme from MCS (N=61) will be invited to participate in the trial. Baseline data collection commenced in April 2020, and the Hope Programme began for the IG in May 2020 and for the WLCG in June 2020. Postprogram data collection was completed by the end of August 2020. This feasibility study will provide data to inform the design of a future definitive trial. Wider-scale provision of the digital Hope Programme has potential to improve the lives of thousands of people with cancer and reduce the burden on health care providers during these unprecedented times.

193,Mental health before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in two longitudinal UK population cohorts,"The COVID-19 pandemic and mitigation measures are likely to have a marked effect on mental health. It is important to use longitudinal data to improve inferences. To quantify the prevalence of depression, anxiety and mental well-being before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, to identify groups at risk of depression and/or anxiety during the pandemic. Data were from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) index generation (n = 2850, mean age 28 years) and parent generation (n = 3720, mean age 59 years), and Generation Scotland (n = 4233, mean age 59 years). Depression was measured with the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire in ALSPAC and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 in Generation Scotland. Anxiety and mental well-being were measured with the Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment-7 and the Short Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale. Depression during the pandemic was similar to pre-pandemic levels in the ALSPAC index generation, but those experiencing anxiety had almost doubled, at 24% (95% CI 23-26%) compared with a pre-pandemic level of 13% (95% CI 12-14%). In both studies, anxiety and depression during the pandemic was greater in younger members, women, those with pre-existing mental/physical health conditions and individuals in socioeconomic adversity, even when controlling for pre-pandemic anxiety and depression. These results provide evidence for increased anxiety in young people that is coincident with the pandemic. Specific groups are at elevated risk of depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is important for planning current mental health provisions and for long-term impact beyond this pandemic.","Kwong, Pearson, Adams, Northstone, Tilling, Smith, Fawns-Ritchie, Bould, Warne, Zammit, Gunnell, Moran, Micali, Reichenberg, Hickman, Rai, Haworth, Campbell, Altschul, Flaig, McIntosh, Lawlor, Porteous, Timpson",https://doi.org/10.1192/bjp.2020.242,20210317.0,ALSPAC; COVID-19; anxiety disorders; depressive disorders; generation Scotland,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
194,Suicidal ideation among Bangladeshi university students early during the COVID-19 pandemic: Prevalence estimates and correlates,"Lockdown, social isolation, and interruption of daily life during the COVID-19 period have impacted many lives. University students are particularly vulnerable to such disruptions and may be particularly disposed to suicidal ideation, potentially creating a new public health crisis. This study aimed to assess suicidal ideation and associated factors among university students in Bangladesh during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted using the Google form (Google survey tool) from April to May 2020. Initially, 3366 respondents voluntarily completed the survey form. Finally, 3331 surveys were included in the final analyses after removing incomplete surveys. The data ware reviewed, rechecked, and analyzed with SPSS (25.0 version) software. A total of 1979 (59.4%) males and 1352 (40.6%) females participated. Respondents were between the ages of 18 to 28Â years (mean age 21.4Â years [SDÂ =Â 1.9]). The prevalence estimate of suicidal ideation was 12.8%. Potential risk factors included less sleep, excess sleep, cigarette smoking, past suicidal thoughts, suicide attempt history, family history of suicidality, depression, anxiety, and stress. Potential protective factors included being male, having lower SES, living in rural areas, regular physical exercise, and satisfactory study. Suicidal ideation was prevalent among Bangladeshi university students during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding the correlates of suicidal ideation may aid to develop targeted strategies to support students during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Tasnim, Islam, Sujan, Sikder, Potenza",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105703,20201215.0,Anxiety; Depression; Stress; Suicidal attempt; Suicidal thoughts,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
195,Mental Health Measurement in a Post Covid-19 World: Psychometric Properties and Invariance of the DASS-21 in Athletes and Non-athletes,"Psychological science faces a call to action researching the implications of the corona virus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. Rapid reviews have reported that maintaining rigorous research standards is a priority for the field, such as ensuring reliable and valid measurement, when investigating people's experience of Covid-19 (O'Connor et al., 2020). However, no research to date has validated a measure mental health symptomology for an athlete population. The current research addresses this gap by examining the internal consistency, factor structure, invariance, and convergent validity of the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21; Lovibond and Lovibond, 1995) in two athlete samples. Participants completed the DASS-21 and sport-specific measures of mental health such as the Profile of Mood States - Depression subscale (POMS-D), Sport Anxiety Scale-2 (SAS-2), Athlete Burnout Questionnaire (ABQ), and Athlete Psychological Strain Questionnaire (APSQ). In sample one (<i>n</i> = 894), results of exploratory structural equation modeling indicated that a three-factor model provided good fit to the data, but a bifactor model provided better fit. Factor loadings indicated minimal misspecification and higher loadings on the general-factor. Invariance testing suggested equivalence across gender, athletic expertise, sport type, and injury status. Further, latent mean differences analyses indicated that females and injured athletes scored higher than male and non-injured athletes on all DASS-21 factors reporting higher mental health symptomology, those with more expertise scored higher on the general-factor and depression and those with less expertise scored higher on anxiety and stress, and no differences between team and individual athletes. In sample two (<i>n</i> = 589), the bifactor structure was replicated. Results largely supported the scales convergent validity with depression predicting POMS-D scores, whereas all three subscales predicted the SAS-2, ABQ, and APSQ scores. Internal consistency was acceptable in both samples. The current work provides initial support for use of the DASS-21 as an operationalisation of mental health symptomology in athletes. Theoretical and practical implications of these results are discussed.","Vaughan, Edwards, MacIntyre",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.590559,20201117.0,anxiety; athletes; depression; mental health; psychometrics; stress,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
196,From &quot;<i>It Has Stopped Our Lives</i>&quot; to &quot;<i>Spending More Time Together Has Strengthened Bonds&quot;</i>: The Varied Experiences of Australian Families During COVID-19,"The present study uses a qualitative approach to understand the impact of COVID-19 on family life. Australian parents of children aged 0-18 years were recruited via social media between April 8 and April 28, 2020, when Australians were experiencing social distancing/isolation measures for the first time. As part of a larger survey, participants were asked to respond via an open-ended question about how COVID-19 had impacted their family. A total of 2,130 parents were included and represented a diverse range of family backgrounds. Inductive template thematic analysis was used to understand patterns of meaning across the texts. Six themes were derived from the data, including &quot;Boredom, depression and suicide: A spectrum of emotion,&quot; &quot;Families are missing the things that keep them healthy,&quot; &quot;Changing family relationships: The push pull of intimacy,&quot; &quot;The unprecedented demands of parenthood,&quot; &quot;The unequal burden of COVID-19,&quot; and &quot;Holding on to positivity.&quot; Overall, the findings demonstrated a breadth of responses. Messages around loss and challenge were predominant, with many families reporting mental health difficulties and strained family relationships. However, not all families were negatively impacted by the restrictions, with some families reporting positive benefits and meaning, including opportunities for strengthening relationships, finding new hobbies, and developing positive characteristics such as appreciation, gratitude, and tolerance.","Evans, Mikocka-Walus, Klas, Olive, Sciberras, Karantzas, Westrupp",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.588667,20201117.0,Australia; COVID-19; family relationships; qualitative study; social restrictions,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
197,Adversity History Predicts Self-Reported Autonomic Reactivity and Mental Health in US Residents During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"<b>Background:</b> The spread of the COVID-19 virus presents an unprecedented event that rapidly introduced widespread life threat, economic destabilization, and social isolation. The human nervous system is tuned to detect safety and danger, integrating body and brain responses via the autonomic nervous system. Shifts in brain-body states toward danger responses can compromise mental health. For those who have experienced prior potentially traumatic events, the autonomic threat response system may be sensitive to new dangers and these threat responses may mediate the association between prior adversity and current mental health. <b>Method:</b> The present study collected survey data from adult U.S. residents (<i>n</i> = 1,666; 68% female; Age <i>M</i> = 46.24, <i>SD</i> = 15.14) recruited through websites, mailing lists, social media, and demographically-targeted sampling collected between March and May 2020. Participants reported on their adversity history, subjective experiences of autonomic reactivity, PTSD and depression symptoms, and intensity of worry related to the COVID-19 pandemic using a combination of standardized questionnaires and questions developed for the study. Formal mediation testing was conducted using path analysis and structural equation modeling. <b>Results:</b> Respondents with prior adversities reported higher levels of destabilized autonomic reactivity, PTSD and depression symptoms, and worry related to COVID-19. Autonomic reactivity mediated the relation between adversity and all mental health variables (standardized indirect effect range for unadjusted models: 0.212-0.340; covariate-adjusted model: 0.183-0.301). <b>Discussion:</b> The data highlight the important role of autonomic regulation as an intervening variable in mediating the impact of adversity on mental health. Because of the important role that autonomic function plays in the expression of mental health vulnerability, brain-body oriented therapies that promote threat response reduction should be investigated as possible therapeutic targets.","Kolacz, Dale, Nix, Roath, Lewis, Porges",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.577728,20201117.0,COVID-19; PTSD; autonomic nervous system; coronavirus; depression; polyvagal theory; trauma; worry,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
198,"Association Between Depression, Health Beliefs, and Face Mask Use During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is associated with increases in psychiatric morbidity, including depression. It is unclear if people with depressive symptoms understand or apply COVID-19 information differently to the general population. Therefore, this study aimed to examine associations between depression, health beliefs, and face mask use during the COVID-19 pandemic among the general population in Hong Kong. This study gathered data from 11,072 Hong Kong adults via an online survey. Respondents self-reported their demographic characteristics, depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), face mask use, and health beliefs about COVID-19. Hierarchical logistic regression was used to identify independent variables associated with depression. The point-prevalence of probable depression was 46.5% (<i>n</i> = 5,150). Respondents reporting higher mask reuse (<i>OR</i> = 1.24, 95%CI 1.17-1.34), wearing masks for self-protection (<i>OR</i> = 1.03 95%CI 1.01-1.06), perceived high susceptibility (<i>OR</i> = 1.15, 95%CI 1.09-1.23), and high severity (<i>OR</i> = 1.33, 95%CI 1.28-1.37) were more likely to report depression. Depression was less likely in those with higher scores for cues to action (<i>OR</i> = 0.82, 95%CI 0.80-0.84), knowledge of COVID-19 (<i>OR</i> = 0.95, 95%CI 0.91-0.99), and self-efficacy to wear mask properly (<i>OR</i> = 0.90 95%CI 0.83-0.98). We identified a high point-prevalence of probable major depression and suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 outbreak in Hong Kong, but this should be viewed with caution due to the convenience sampling method employed. Future studies should recruit a representative probability sample in order to draw more reliable conclusions. The findings highlight that COVID-19 health information may be a protective factor of probable depression and suicidal ideation during the pandemic. Accurate and up-to-date health information should be disseminated to distressed and vulnerable subpopulations, perhaps using digital health technology, and social media platforms to prompt professional help-seeking behavior.","Bressington, Cheung, Lam, Suen, Fong, Ho, Xiang",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.571179,20201117.0,COVID-19; Hong Kong; depression; face mask; health belief model,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
199,COVID-19 and Mental Health-What Do We Know So Far?,"The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic brought several worldwide health, social, and economic disturbances-particularly associated with the imposed confinement measures-that raised concerns about an emerging public mental health crisis. Studies investigating the early mental health impact of the pandemic on general population and vulnerable groups, such as healthcare workers, revealed a high prevalence of stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms, among others, and found several risk and protective factors. Along with these findings, the risk of substance use, suicide, domestic violence, and complicated grief may increase. We further discuss interventions that can be applied at a governmental, institutional, and individual level to minimize the mental health consequences of the pandemic, such as using telehealth to provide remote support or practicing self-care. These interventions should be maintained after the initial outbreak, as current disturbances may impact long-term well-being. We encourage the development of longitudinal studies to assess long-term adaptive responses.","Dos Santos, PicÃ³-PÃ©rez, Morgado",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.565698,20201117.0,COVID-19; anxiety; depression; health services; mental health,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
200,"Self-reported changes in anxiety, depression and suicidality during the COVID-19 lockdown in Greece","There are only a few published empirical data on COVID-19's effects on the mental health. During lockdown, an online questionnaire registered demographic, health data, previous psychiatric history, current anxiety, depression and suicidality, believing in conspiracy theories and other domains. Data from 3399 persons were used (81.08% females; aged 34.02Â Â±Â 9.72 and 18.27% males; aged 36.38Â±10.33). Distress and clinical depression were identified with the use of cut-off and a previously developed algorithm respectively. A post-stratification method was used; descriptive statistics were calculated. Chi-square tests, multiple forward stepwise linear regression analyses and Factorial Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) tested relations among variables. Clinical depression was present in 9.31% of the stratified sample, while 8.5% had severe distress; increased anxiety was present in more than 45%. Suicidal thoughts increased in 10.40% and decreased in 4.42%. Beliefs in conspiracy theories were widely prevalent; at least half of cases were following various misconceptions. A model for the development of depression was created with general health status, previous history of depression, self-harm and suicidal attempts, family responsibility, economic change, and age acting as risk factors, while keeping a daily routine, pursuing religiousness/spirituality, and believing in conspiracy theories acting as protective factors. The model developed here revealed multiple vulnerabilities and an interplay leading from simple anxiety to clinical depression and suicidality through distress. This could be of practical utility since most of these factors are modifiable. Future research, as well as interventions, should focus specifically on them.","Fountoulakis, Apostolidou, Atsiova, Filippidou, Florou, Gousiou, Katsara, Mantzari, Padouva-Markoulaki, Papatriantafyllou, Sacharidi, Tonia, Tsagalidou, Zymara, Prezerakos, Koupidis, Fountoulakis, Chrousos",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.10.061,20210113.0,"COVID-19; Depression; Lockdown; Mental health, conspiracy theories; Suicidality; Adult; Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Female; Greece; Health Status; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Protective Factors; SARS-CoV-2; Self Report; Self-Injurious Behavior; Suicidal Ideation; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

This is a pooled cross-sectional study. Online survey data were analysed from 2000 Japanese adults collected in April and May 2020. Information was obtained on 13 COVID-19 preventive behaviours and anxiety and depressive symptoms using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale and Patient Health Questionnaire-9, respectively. Linear regression analysis was used to examine the associations.

202,Increasing Social Connectedness for Underserved Older Adults Living With Depression: A Pre-Post Evaluation of PEARLS,"To evaluate PEARLS effectiveness for increasing social connectedness among underserved older adults with depression. Multisite, pre-post single-group evaluation. Community-based social service organizations (Nâ€¯=â€¯16) in five U.S. states, purposively sampled for maximum variation of participants and providers. A total of 320 homebound older adults (mean(SD) age 72.9(9.6), 79% female, 44% people of color, 81% low-income, 61% living alone, average four chronic conditions) with clinically significant depression (PHQ-9 mean(SD) 12.7(4.6)). Four to 6 month home-based depression care management model delivered by trained front-line providers. Brief validated social connectedness scales: Duke Social Support Index 10-item (DSSI-10), PROMIS-Social Isolation (6-item), UCLA-Loneliness (3-item); sociodemographic and health measures. At baseline, PEARLS participants overall and with â‰¥1 of the following characteristics were less socially connected: younger (50-64), white, LGBTQ+, not partnered, not caregiving, living alone, financial limitations, chronic conditions, and/or recently hospitalized. Six-months post-PEARLS enrollment, participants significantly increased social interactions and satisfaction with social support (DSSI-10 t[312]â€¯=â€¯5.2, p &lt;0.001); and reduced perceived isolation (PROMIS t[310]â€¯=â€¯6.3, p &lt;0.001); and loneliness (UCLA t[301]â€¯=â€¯3.7, p =0.002), with small to moderate effect sizes (Cohen's d DSSI-10: 0.28, PROMIS-SI: 0.35, UCLA: 0.21). Increased social connectedness was associated with reduced depression. Improvements in social connectedness (except social interactions) persisted during early COVID-19. Being Latino and/or having difficulty paying for basic needs was associated with less improvement in post-PEARLS social connectedness. PEARLS has potential to improve social connectedness among underserved older adults, though additional supports may be needed for persons facing multiple social determinants of health. Further research is needed to establish causality.","Steinman, Parrish, Mayotte, Bravo Acevedo, Torres, Markova, Boddie, Lachenmayr, Montoya, Parker, Conton-Pelaez, Silsby, Snowden",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.10.005,20201117.0,Social isolation; community; depression care management; loneliness; underserved,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
203,Videoconferencing-Based Telemental Health: Important Questions for the COVID-19 Era From Clinical and Patient-Centered Perspectives,"The COVID-19 pandemic has intensified the search for digital approaches in mental health treatment, particularly due to patients and clinicians practicing social distancing. This has resulted in the dramatic growth of videoconferencing-based telemental health (V-TMH) services. It is critical for behavioral health providers and those in the mental health field to understand the implications of V-TMH expansion on the stakeholders who use such services, such as patients and clinicians, to provide the service that addresses both patient and clinical needs. Several key questions arise as a result, such as the following: (1) in what ways does V-TMH affect the practice of psychotherapy (ie, clinical needs), (2) to what extent are ethical and patient-centered concerns warranted in terms of V-TMH services (ie, patient needs), and (3) how do factors related to user experience affect treatment dynamics for both the patient and therapist (ie, patient and clinical needs)? We discuss how behavioral health providers can consider the future delivery of mental health care services based on these questions, which pose strong implications for technological innovation, the adaptation of treatments to new technologies, and training professionals in the delivery of V-TMH services and other digital health interventions.","Chiauzzi, Clayton, Huh-Yoo",https://doi.org/10.2196/24021,20201231.0,COVID-19; ethics; lived experience; mental health; patient-centered; privacy; psychotherapy; telehealth; telemental health; videoconferencing,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
204,Italians on the Age of COVID-19: The Self-Reported Depressive Symptoms Through Web-Based Survey,"The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected the Italian community. The widespread use of quarantine had the desired impact of controlling the epidemic, although it caused many psychological consequences. To date, compliance of the Italian public with voluntary home quarantine has been very high, but little is known about the impact of psychological health on sociodemographic categories during the quarantine. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of depressive symptoms in specific sociodemographic categories during the COVID-19 quarantine lockdown and the potential factors that contribute to, or mitigate, these effects. In the very early stage of the nationwide lockdown, 3,672 quarantined Italian adult residents (65% females, ranging from 18 to 85 years) participated in a web-based cross-sectional survey, including measures of depressive symptoms, which were measured by the Teate depression inventory, and state anxiety levels. The overall prevalence was 27.8% for moderate and 9.3% for severe levels of depressive symptoms. A generalized logistic model was used to identify the factors associated with mental health problems. Among these factors, sociodemographic variables (e.g., sex, age, employment status) and adherence to quarantine guidelines were analyzed. Females, younger people, students, singles, residents in northern Italy, people who were reluctant to adhere to quarantine guidelines, and people less worried about being infected with COVID-19 were at high risk of developing depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 epidemic, also after controlling for state anxiety. These findings showed that public levels of depressive symptoms did not increase the greater likelihood of being infected. Our study suggested that the monitoring of psychological outcomes for outbreaks could identify groups at higher risk of psychological morbidities due to the current pandemic in order to target future psychological interventions for implementation.","Balsamo, Carlucci",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.569276,20201113.0,anxiety; coronavirus disease 2019; depression; mental health; worry,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

207,Emotional impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on healthcare workers in one of the most important infection outbreaks in Europe,"The Covid-19 pandemic has put healthcare professionals around the world in an unprecedented challenge. This may cause some emotional difficulties and mental health problems. The aim of the present study was to analyze the emotional status among the health care workers form the Hospital of Igualada (Barcelona), while they were facing with Covid-19 in one of the most affected regions in all of Europe. A total of 395 participants were included in the study. A cross-sectional assessment was carried out between the months of March and April. Information about anxiety, depression, and stress was gathered. We also collected demographic data and concerning potentially stressful factors. A significant proportion of professionals reported symptoms of anxiety (31.4%) and depression (12.2%) from moderate to severe intensity. Symptoms of acute stress were reported by 14.5% of participants. We performed a regression analysis, which explained the 30% of the variance associated with the degree of emotional distress (RÂ²â€¯=â€¯0.30). The final model reveals that females (or young males), who are working in the frontline as nursing assistants, caretakers or radiology technicians, with the uncertainty of a possible infection, the perception of inadequate protection measures and having experienced the death of a close person by Covid-19, showed a heightened risk of experiencing psychological distress. Coping with the Covid-19 pandemic caused a significant impact on emotional status of healthcare workers involved in this study. La actual pandemia de Covid-19â€¯ha puesto a los profesionales sanitarios de todo el mundo ante un desafÃ­o sin precedentes.

211,A Mental Health Surveillance System for the General Population During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Protocol for a Multiwave Cross-sectional Survey Study,"The COVID-19 outbreak can potentially be categorized as a traumatic event. Public health surveillance is one of the cornerstones of public health practice, and it empowers decision makers to lead and manage public health crises and programs more effectively by providing timely and useful evidence. This paper presents the protocol for a study that aims to identify, track, and monitor trends in the population in Saudi Arabia at risk of major depressive disorders and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study utilizes continuous, cross-sectional, national-level mental health screening via computer-assisted phone interviews, conducted in four waves on a monthly basis (between May and August 2020). Arabic-speaking adults, aged â‰¥18 years, and living in Saudi Arabia were recruited via a random phone list. This surveillance system used the proportional quota sampling technique to achieve an equal distribution of participants, stratified by age and gender, and region, within and across the 13 administrative regions of Saudi Arabia. A sample size of 4056 participants per wave was calculated to achieve enough power to detect changes in mental health status. The questionnaire includes the Arabic version of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to measure depressive symptoms and the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) to measure anxiety. In addition, it will collect data on sociodemographic variables and potential risk factors. Study recruitment began in May 2020. The data analysis was completed in October 2020, and the final report is expected to be published by the end of December 2020. Monitoring the population's mental health status during the COVID-19 pandemic will inform decision makers of any potential deterioration in mental health on a national level and among subgroups, including across regions, age groups, and gender groups. It will allow decision makers to recognize issues and intervene sooner. It will also provide valuable scientific data to help understand the effects of epidemics and pandemics on mental health. As far as we know, this is the only study that attempts to monitor the mental health status of the general population on a monthly basis.

Cross-sectional telephone interview survey. Academic sleep labs. Iranian adults â‰¥ 18 years old with confirmed OSA. Among 275 participants with OSA, 20% (nÂ =Â 55) were suspected to have history of COVID-19 but had no positive test, and 18% (nÂ =Â 51) were in the definite COVID-19 group according to their reported symptoms or confirmed positive test. Having severe OSA (apnea hypopnea index â‰¥ 30) was associated with an increased risk of definite COVID-19, with an odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of 2.31 (0.87-5.55) compared to having mild OSA in definite COVID-19 group. Those not undergoing treatment for OSA had an OR (95% CI) of 2.43 (1.26-4.67) for definite COVID-19 compared to those accepting treatment in definite COVID-19 group. Total sleep times (TSTs) were 354, 340, and 320 minutes in healthy, suspected, and COVID-19 groups, respectively; TST was associated with COVID-19 (P-valueÂ =Â .04).

Total numbers of patients with myocardial infarctions, stroke, appendicitis, and cholecystitis diagnosed decreased. The percentage of visits for mental health symptoms increased. There was an increase in deaths, driven by out-of-hospital mortality. Fewer patients presenting with acute and time-sensitive diagnoses suggests that patients are deferring care. This may be further supported by an increase in out-of-hospital mortality. Understanding which patients are deferring care and why will allow us to develop outreach strategies and ensure that those in need of rapid assessment and treatment will do so, preventing downstream morbidity and mortality.","Walker, Heaton, Monroe, Reichard, Kendall, Mullan, Goyal",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2020.09.019,20201130.0,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; COVID-19; Child; Child, Preschool; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Delivery of Health Care, Integrated; Emergency Service, Hospital; Facilities and Services Utilization; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Middle Aged; Mortality; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; United States; Young Adult",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

217,"Infection, Screening, and Psychological Stress of Health-Care Workers With COVID-19 in a Nonfrontline Clinical Department","The aim of this study was to investigate risk factors and psychological stress of health-care workers (HCWs) with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a nonfrontline clinical department. Data of 2 source patients and all HCWs with infection risk were obtained in a department in Wuhan from January to February 2020. A questionnaire was designed to evaluate psychological stress of COVID-19 on HCWs. The overall infection rate was 4.8% in HCWs. Ten of 25 HCWs who contacted with 2 source patients were diagnosed with confirmed COVID-19 (8/10) and suspected COVID-19 (2/10). Other 2 HCWs were transmitted by other patients or colleagues. Close care behaviors included physical examination (6/12), life nursing (4/12), ward rounds (4/12), endoscopic examination (2/12). Contacts fluctuated from 1 to 24 times and each contact was short (8.1 min Â± 5.6 min). HCWs wore surgical masks (11/12), gloves (7/12), and isolation clothing (3/12) when providing medical care. Most HCWs experienced a mild course with 2 asymptomatic infections, taking 9.8 d and 20.9 d to obtain viral shedding and clinical cure, respectively. Psychological stress included worry (58.3%), anxiety (83.3%), depression (58.3%), and insomnia (58.3%). Close contact with COVID-19 patients and insufficient protection were key risk factors. Precaution measures and psychological support on COVID-19 is urgently required for HCWs.","Wang, Guan, Zhu, Wang, Fang, Wen, Xie, Tian, Li",https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2020.428,20210217.0,COVID-19; health-care worker; nonfrontline; psychological stress; risk factors,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
218,Anxiety of Nurses to support Wuhan in fighting against COVID-19 Epidemic and its Correlation With Work Stress and Self-efficacy,"We aimed to investigate the anxiety of nurses who are supporting Wuhan in fighting against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and explore relevant influencing factors. The COVID-19 outbreak poses a major threat to public health worldwide. Nurses play an important role in this epidemic. However, available data on the mental health among these nurses are limited. A descriptive, cross-sectional survey was performed. An online questionnaire was completed by 200 nurses who went to Wuhan to help to fight against COVID-19 from another province. Data collection tools include the Chinese version of the Stress Overload Scale (SOS), the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES). Descriptive, single-factor correlation and multiple regression analyses were used in exploring related influencing factors. Reporting followed the STROBE guidelines. The scores of SAS, SOS and GSES range from 20 to 80, 22 to 110 and 10 to 40, respectively, and the SAS (31.79Â Â±Â 7.32) and SOS (40.19Â Â±Â 12.92) and GSES scores (24.83Â Â±Â 6.60) were obtained. Anxiety was positively correlated with stress (rÂ =Â .679, pÂ &lt;Â .001) but negatively correlated with self-efficacy (rÂ =Â -.326, pÂ &lt;Â .001). Multiple regression analysis showed that professional qualification, sleep, stress and self-efficacy were the main factors affecting nurse anxiety (pÂ =Â .006, &lt;.001, &lt;.001, .039, respectively). Nurses who are supporting Wuhan in fighting against COVID-19 were under a low level of anxiety. The current study suggests work stress reduction might be a key factor in reducing anxiety and maintaining mental health to support nurses who are fighting against COVID-19 infection.","Mo, Deng, Zhang, Lang, Pang, Liao, Wang, Tao, Huang",https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15549,20210308.0,COVID-2019; Wuhan; anxiety; mental health; nurses; social support; work stress; Adult; Anxiety; COVID-19; China; Cross-Sectional Studies; Epidemics; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Nursing Staff; Occupational Stress; Self Efficacy; Surveys and Questionnaires,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
219,Revising our attitudes towards agonist medications and their diversion in a time of pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic led government regulators to relax prescribing rules for buprenorphine and methadone, the agonist medications that effectively treat opioid use disorder, allowing for take home supplies of up to 28Â days. These changes prioritized the availability of these medications over concerns about their misuse and diversion, and they provided a means for overdose prophylaxis during the highly uncertain conditions of the pandemic. In considering how to capitalize on this shift, research should determine the extent to which increased diversion has occurred as a result, and what the consequences may have been. The shifts also set the stage to consider if methadone can be safely prescribed in primary care settings, and if the monthly injectable formulation of buprenorphine is a suitable alternative to increased supplies of sublingual strips if concerns about diversion persist. The disruptions of the pandemic have caused a surge in overdose deaths, so carefully considering the prophylactic potential of agonist medications, in addition to their role as a treatment, may help us address this mortality crisis.","Del Pozo, Rich",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108139,20201116.0,"Analgesics, Opioid; Buprenorphine; COVID-19; Coronavirus Infections; Drug Overdose; Humans; Methadone; Opiate Substitution Treatment; Opioid-Related Disorders; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Prescription Drug Diversion",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
220,Extraversion Moderates the Relationship Between the Stringency of COVID-19 Protective Measures and Depressive Symptoms,"From the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, psychologists are theorizing that, as compared to introverts, extraverts experience more profound negative social consequences from protective measures (e.g., travel restrictions and bans on public gatherings). As the empirical evidence for this claim is lacking, this study tested the hypothesis that extraversion moderates the relationship between the stringency of COVID-19 protective measures and depressive symptoms. Our results were based on survey data from 93,125 respondents collected in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 20-April 6, 2020) across 47 countries and publicly available data on measure stringency. Findings demonstrate that extraversion moderates the relationship between measure stringency in the early days of the pandemic and depressive symptoms. For introverts, measure stringency has a negative effect on depressive symptoms, while for extraverts, it has a positive, but non-significant effect on depressive symptoms. This study suggests that, although stringent measures generally help people to worry less and feel safer, the lifestyle associated with such measures feels more natural to introverts than to extraverts.","Wijngaards, Sisouw de Zilwa, Burger",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.568907,20201103.0,COVID-19; COVID-19 protective measures; depressive symptoms; extraversion; mental healthâ€”related quality of life,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
221,Mental Health Through the COVID-19 Quarantine: A Growth Curve Analysis on Italian Young Adults,"Health emergencies, such as epidemics, have detrimental and long-lasting consequences on people's mental health, which are higher during the implementation of strict lockdown measures. Despite several recent psychological researches on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic highlighting that young adults represent a high risk category, no studies specifically focused on young adults' mental health status have been carried out yet. This study aimed to assess and monitor Italian young adults' mental health status during the first 4 weeks of lockdown through the use of a longitudinal panel design. Participants (<i>n</i> = 97) provided self-reports in four time intervals (1-week intervals) in 1 month. The Syndromic Scales of Adult Self-Report 18-59 were used to assess the internalizing problems (anxiety/depression, withdrawn, and somatic complaints), externalizing problems (aggressive, rule-breaking, and intrusive behavior), and personal strengths. To determine the time-varying effects of prolonged quarantine, a growth curve modeling will be performed. The results showed an increase in anxiety/depression, withdrawal, somatic complaints, aggressive behavior, rule-breaking behavior, and internalizing and externalizing problems and a decrease in intrusive behavior and personal strengths from T1 to T4. The results contributed to the ongoing debate concerning the psychological impact of the COVID-19 emergency, helping to plan and develop efficient intervention projects able to take care of young adults' mental health in the long term.","Parola, Rossi, Tessitore, Troisi, Mannarini",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.567484,20201103.0,Achenbach adult self-report; coronavirus disease 2019; growth model; internalizing/externalizing problems; mental health; quarantine; young adult,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
222,"Associations of Social Isolation with Anxiety and Depression During the Early COVID-19 Pandemic: A Survey of Older Adults in London, UK","The COVID-19 pandemic is imposing a profound negative impact on the health and wellbeing of societies and individuals, worldwide. One concern is the effect of social isolation as a result of social distancing on the mental health of vulnerable populations, including older people. Within six weeks of lockdown, we initiated the CHARIOT COVID-19 Rapid Response Study, a bespoke survey of cognitively healthy older people living in London, to investigate the impact of COVID-19 and associated social isolation on mental and physical wellbeing. The sample was drawn from CHARIOT, a register of people over 50 who have consented to be contacted for aging related research. A total of 7,127 men and women (mean age=70.7 [SD=7.4]) participated in the baseline survey, May-July 2020. Participants were asked about changes to the 14 components of the Hospital Anxiety Depression scale (HADS) after lockdown was introduced in the UK, on 23<sup>rd</sup> March. A total of 12.8% of participants reported feeling worse on the depression components of HADS (7.8% men and 17.3% women) and 12.3% reported feeling worse on the anxiety components (7.8% men and 16.5% women). Fewer participants reported feeling improved (1.5% for depression and 4.9% for anxiety). Women, younger participants, those single/widowed/divorced, reporting poor sleep, feelings of loneliness and who reported living alone were more likely to indicate feeling worse on both the depression and/or anxiety components of the HADS. There was a significant negative association between subjective loneliness and worsened components of both depression (OR 17.24, 95% CI 13.20, 22.50) and anxiety (OR 10.85, 95% CI 8.39, 14.03). Results may inform targeted interventions and help guide policy recommendations in reducing the effects of social isolation related to the pandemic, and beyond, on the mental health of older people.","Robb, de Jager, Ahmadi-Abhari, Giannakopoulou, Udeh-Momoh, McKeand, Price, Car, Majeed, Ward, Middleton",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.591120,20201103.0,COVID-19; anxiety; depression; loneliness; mental health; older adults; social isolation,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
223,The Effect of COVID-19 on Mental Health and Wellbeing in a Representative Sample of Australian Adults,"There is minimal knowledge about the impact of large-scale epidemics on community mental health, particularly during the acute phase. This gap in knowledge means we are critically ill-equipped to support communities as they face the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to provide data urgently needed to inform government policy and resource allocation now and in other future crises. The study was the first to survey a representative sample from the Australian population at the early acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Depression, anxiety, and psychological wellbeing were measured with well-validated scales (PHQ-9, GAD-7, WHO-5). Using linear regression, we tested for associations between mental health and exposure to COVID-19, impacts of COVID-19 on work and social functioning, and socio-demographic factors. Depression and anxiety symptoms were substantively elevated relative to usual population data, including for individuals with no existing mental health diagnosis. Exposure to COVID-19 had minimal association with mental health outcomes. Recent exposure to the Australian bushfires was also unrelated to depression and anxiety, although bushfire smoke exposure correlated with reduced psychological wellbeing. In contrast, pandemic-induced impairments in work and social functioning were strongly associated with elevated depression and anxiety symptoms, as well as decreased psychological wellbeing. Financial distress due to the pandemic, rather than job loss <i>per se</i>, was also a key correlate of poorer mental health. These findings suggest that minimizing disruption to work and social functioning, and increasing access to mental health services in the community, are important policy goals to minimize pandemic-related impacts on mental health and wellbeing. Innovative and creative strategies are needed to meet these community needs while continuing to enact vital public health strategies to control the spread of COVID-19.","Dawel, Shou, Smithson, Cherbuin, Banfield, Calear, Farrer, Gray, Gulliver, Housen, McCallum, Morse, Murray, Newman, Rodney Harris, Batterham",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.579985,20210208.0,COVID-19; anxiety; bushfire; coronavirus; depression; financial strain; mental health,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
224,Mental Health Outcomes in Perinatal Women During the Remission Phase of COVID-19 in China,"Since the middle of March, the COVID-19 outbreak has been well contained in China. The prevention and control measures for the outbreak have been downgraded to a normalized level. However, until now, the change in level of psychological health amongst perinatal women during the remission phase of the COVID-19 outbreak has not been investigated in China. The aim of this current study was to assess the symptoms of anxiety, depression, insomnia and quality of life (QOL) in perinatal women and to identify potential risk factors associated with these symptoms. This was a cross-sectional, hospital-based survey conducted between March 25<sup>th</sup> till June 5<sup>th</sup>, 2020 in southern China. Convenient sampling method was adopted. Women's anxiety, depression, insomnia symptoms and QOL was examined through standardized measurements. Multivariate logistic regression and Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted for the same. A total of 625 perinatal women completed the study; of them, 195 women (31.2%, 95%CI=27.56%-34.84%) reported anxiety, 120 (19.2%, 95%CI=16.10%-22.30%) reported depression, and 87 (13.9%, 95%CI=11.20%-16.64%) experienced symptoms of insomnia. Previous adverse experiences during pregnancy was a significant risk factor for anxiety (OR=1.628, 95%CI=1.069-2.480, P=0.023), depression (OR=1.853, 95%CI=1.153-2.977, P=0.011), and insomnia (OR=2.160, 95%CI=1.290-3.616, P=0.003). Participants having infected friends/families/colleagues were more likely to report anxiety (OR=2.195, 95%CI=1.245-3.871, P=0.007) and depression (OR=2.666, 95%CI=1.482-4.794, P=0.001). Those women whose regular check-ups were severely interrupted by the COVID-19 were also more likely to experience symptoms of anxiety (OR=2.935, 95%CI=1.701-5.062, P&lt;0.001) and insomnia (OR=2.195, 95%CI=1.098-4.390, P=0.026). The COVID-19 pandemic does affect the mental health and well being of perinatal women. Increased attention should be paid to women who have infected friends/families/colleagues and those with previous adverse experiences during pregnancy. Coping strategies that relieve psychological stress during the COVID-19 outbreak should be provided to prevent adverse outcomes for women and their infants.","Zeng, Li, Sun, Luo, Garg, Liu, Zhang, Zhang",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.571876,20201103.0,COVID-19; China; mental health; perinatal; women,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
225,"Depression and Coping Among COVID-19-Infected Individuals After 10 Days of Mandatory in-Hospital Quarantine, Irbid, Jordan","In-hospital mandatory quarantine of asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19-infected individuals was part of the national control strategy used to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak in Jordan. This study aims to evaluate depression, associated stressors, and various coping methods used among adult quarantined COVID-19-infected individuals. This cross-sectional study included all COVID-19-infected individuals who were obligatorily quarantined at King Abdullah University Hospital, Irbid, Jordan from March 15 to April 20, 2020. Symptoms of depression were assessed using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire after 10 days of quarantine. In addition, several questions regarding the patients' sights with the health-care system, and coping methods were added. Demographic characteristics, clinical presentation, and comorbidities were collected from the medical records. Out of 91 quarantined COVID-19 patients, a total of 66 completed the survey, with a participation rate of 72.5%. The majority were relatively young; the mean Â± SD age was 35.8 Â± 16.2 years (range 18-79), 59.1% were females and 47% were asymptomatic. A considerable proportion of patients (44%) reported symptoms of depression, with 21% were at high risk of major depressive disorder. Depression symptoms were significantly more common among females than males [PHQ-9 score â‰¥10: 13 (92.9%) vs 1 (7.1%), respectively; <i>p</i>=0.004]. The majority of patients (71.2%) reported having problems with health-care services. Insufficient involvement in making treatment decisions was the most commonly reported concern (59.1%). Patients who reported problems in maintaining privacy, reaching out to their physicians, or receiving conflicting information from the medical staff, had more symptoms of depression compared with the satisfied ones (<i>p</i>&lt;0.05). On the other hand, those who were receiving sufficient support from the family, friends, or medical staff during quarantine, were less likely to have depression symptoms (<i>p</i>&lt;0.05). Furthermore, symptoms of depression were less in patients who stayed in touch with others using phone calls, texting, or social media (<i>p</i>=0.024). Symptoms of depression were common among both symptomatic and asymptomatic quarantined COVID-19 patients. The support of family, friends, and medical staff was an essential alleviating factor. Facilitating adequate communication may promote the mental well-being of COVID-19-infected patients and help in reducing the risk of depression during the in-hospital quarantine.","Samrah, Al-Mistarehi, Aleshawi, Khasawneh, Momany, Momany, Abu Za'nouneh, Keelani, Alshorman, Khassawneh",https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S267459,20201030.0,COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; coronavirus; depression; psychological disorder; quarantine,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
226,Behavior of Callers to a Crisis Helpline Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Quantitative Data Analysis,"The World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 to be an international pandemic in March 2020. While numbers of new confirmed cases of the disease and death tolls are rising at an alarming rate on a daily basis, there is concern that the pandemic and the measures taken to counteract it could cause an increase in distress among the public. Hence, there could be an increase in need for emotional support within the population, which is complicated further by the reduction of existing face-to-face mental health services as a result of measures taken to limit the spread of the virus. The objective of this study was to determine whether the COVID-19 pandemic has had any influence on the calls made to Samaritans Ireland, a national crisis helpline within the Republic of Ireland. This study presents an analysis of calls made to Samaritans Ireland in a four-week period before the first confirmed case of COVID-19 (calls=41,648, callers=3752) and calls made to the service within a four-week period after a restrictive lockdown was imposed by the government of the Republic of Ireland (calls=46,043, callers=3147). Statistical analysis was conducted to explore any differences between the duration of calls in the two periods at a global level and at an hourly level. We performed k-means clustering to determine the types of callers who used the helpline based on their helpline call usage behavior and to assess the impact of the pandemic on the caller type usage patterns. The analysis revealed that calls were of a longer duration in the postlockdown period in comparison with the pre-COVID-19 period. There were changes in the behavior of individuals in the cluster types defined by caller behavior, where some caller types tended to make longer calls to the service in the postlockdown period. There were also changes in caller behavior patterns with regard to the time of day of the call; variations were observed in the duration of calls at particular times of day, where average call durations increased in the early hours of the morning. The results of this study highlight the impact of COVID-19 on a national crisis helpline service. Statistical differences were observed in caller behavior between the prelockdown and active lockdown periods. The findings suggest that service users relied on crisis helpline services more during the lockdown period due to an increased sense of isolation, worsening of underlying mental illness due to the pandemic, and reduction or overall removal of access to other support resources. Practical implications and limitations are discussed.","Turkington, Mulvenna, Bond, Ennis, Potts, Moore, Hamra, Morrissey, Isaksen, Scowcroft, O'Neill",https://doi.org/10.2196/22984,20201114.0,COVID-19; caller behavior; clustering; coronavirus; crisis helplines; machine learning; mental health; pandemic,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
227,From adversity to resilience in the COVID-19 era: strengthening mental health systems in the Eastern Mediterranean Region,"The global COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the impact of a major public health emergency on mental health, and the ways that individuals, communities, professionals and systems can react positively to such a crisis. The Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) has substantial experience in mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) in crises, and COVID-19 has driven further innovation to support mental health and well-being. Global and regional guidance has been developed quickly, applying lessons learnt from previous disease outbreaks to respond to the pandemic at a systems level, for different population groups, and for countries of different income levels. Preliminary results from a global rapid assessment survey to assess the impact of COVID-19 on MHPSS services, indicate that 20 of the 22 EMR Member States have MHPSS as integral components of national COVID-19 response plans; one-third have allocated additional funding. However, MHPSS services have been severely impacted by the pandemic, including psychotherapy, psychosocial interventions, community services, and services for children/adolescents. Innovative solutions such as crisis hotlines, tele-consultations, digital self-help platforms, novel approaches to ensure supply of psychotropic medicines, and task sharing/shifting for basic psychosocial support, are being used in many countries to overcome service disruptions and maintain care for those with mental conditions.","Eaton, Rahman, Gater, Saxena, Hammerich, Saeed",https://doi.org/10.26719/2020.26.10.1148,20201116.0,"Africa, Northern; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; Coronavirus Infections; Disasters; Global Health; Health Behavior; Health Promotion; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Mental Health; Mental Health Services; Middle East; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Resilience, Psychological; SARS-CoV-2; Social Determinants of Health; Socioeconomic Factors",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
228,,"Examine the association between news media use frequency during the COVID-19 pandemic and the scale of psychological distress in pregnant women, considering this distress known harmful effects on the fetus development. Pregnant women living in Quebec province (N = 1014) have been recruited in April 2020 through social media, while a state of health emergency was declared. Participants were divided in 4 groups, according to self-reported frequency of news media consulting (little or none; one time a day; several times a day; constant). They filled measures of depressive symptoms, negative affects, post-traumatic stress symptoms and anxiety specific to COVID-19. Instrument scores were grouped under a unique factor of psychological distress. An ANCOVA controlling for age, gestational age, education level, household annual revenue and a diagnosed mental disorder present at the time of participation in study shows that news media exposure frequency is significantly associated with psychological distress severity in pregnant women, during COVID-19 pandemic, F(3,998) = 27.02, p &lt; 0.001, Î·2 partial = 0.08. Given the mean comparisons <i>a posteriori</i>, higher psychological distress rates are found as soon as news media exposure exceeds once a day (effect sizes between 0.38 and 0.81). The more pregnant women report consulting the news media during the COVID-19 pandemic, the more likely they are to exhibit psychological distress.

229,Assessment of mental health outcomes and associated factors among workers in community-based HIV care centers in the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak in Mali,"In Mali, the non-governmental association (NGO) ARCAD SantÃ© PLUS launched the CovidPrev program in response to the COVID-19 outbreak to ensure continuity of HIV care-related activities. This study aimed to identify individual and structural factors associated with mental health disorders (MHD) in the NGO's healthcare workers (HCW) in the early stage of the outbreak. Data were collected between April 6 and 11, 2020 for 135 HCW in ARCAD SantÃ© PLUS's 18 community-based HIV care centers. Outcomes corresponded to the PHQ-9, GAD-7 and ISI instruments for depression, anxiety and insomnia, respectively. A general mixture model with a negative binomial distribution was implemented. Most HCW were men (60.7%) and median age was 40 years IQR[33-46]. Symptoms of depression, anxiety and insomnia were declared by 71.9, 73.3, and 77% participants, respectively. Women were at greater risk of MHD. A lack of personal protection equipment and human resources, especially nurses, was associated with a high risk of MHD. Health policy must place non-front line HCW, including those in NGOs, at the core of the healthcare system response to the COVID-19 outbreak, as they ensure continuity of care for many diseases including HIV. The efficacy of public health strategies depends on the capacity of HCW to fully with and competently perform their duties.","Sagaon-Teyssier, Kamissoko, Yattassaye, Diallo, Rojas Castro, Delabre, Pouradier, Maradan, Bourrelly, CissÃ©, Vidal, KeÃ¯ta, Spire",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hpopen.2020.100017,20201224.0,COVID-19; HIV; Healthcare workers; Mali; Mental health,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
230,Mental health and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic: longitudinal analyses of adults in the UK COVID-19 Mental Health &amp; Wellbeing study,"The effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the population's mental health and well-being are likely to be profound and long lasting. To investigate the trajectory of mental health and well-being during the first 6 weeks of lockdown in adults in the UK. A quota survey design and a sampling frame that permitted recruitment of a national sample was employed. Findings for waves 1 (31 March to 9 April 2020), 2 (10 April to 27 April 2020) and 3 (28 April to 11 May 2020) are reported here. A range of mental health factors was assessed: pre-existing mental health problems, suicide attempts and self-harm, suicidal ideation, depression, anxiety, defeat, entrapment, mental well-being and loneliness. A total of 3077 adults in the UK completed the survey at wave 1. Suicidal ideation increased over time. Symptoms of anxiety, and levels of defeat and entrapment decreased across waves whereas levels of depressive symptoms did not change significantly. Positive well-being also increased. Levels of loneliness did not change significantly over waves. Subgroup analyses showed that women, young people (18-29 years), those from more socially disadvantaged backgrounds and those with pre-existing mental health problems have worse mental health outcomes during the pandemic across most factors. The mental health and well-being of the UK adult population appears to have been affected in the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increasing rates of suicidal thoughts across waves, especially among young adults, are concerning.","O'Connor, Wetherall, Cleare, McClelland, Melson, Niedzwiedz, O'Carroll, O'Connor, Platt, Scowcroft, Watson, Zortea, Ferguson, Robb",https://doi.org/10.1192/bjp.2020.212,20210317.0,COVID-19; depression; general population; mental health; suicidal ideation,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

232,Mental health presentations to Christchurch Hospital Emergency Department during COVID-19 lockdown,"To describe mental health presentations to a tertiary ED in New Zealand during a national COVID-19 lockdown. A retrospective, comparative cohort study in Christchurch Hospital, New Zealand. There was a 3510 (37%)-patient decrease in all presentations to Christchurch Hospital ED during the 5-week COVID-19 lockdown period from 26 March 2020 to 28 April 2020, compared to a 111 (1.2%)-patient decrease in the same time period in the previous year (P &lt;â€‰0.00001). There is usually a seasonal reduction in mental health attendances at this time of year compared to the weeks before. In 2019, there was a 49 (9.8%)-patient reduction in mental health presentations, whereas in 2020 there was a 193 (34%)-patient reduction (P &lt;â€‰0.001). In 2020, the proportion of mental health attendances compared to all ED attendances during the 5-week lockdown period was similar to the 5-week pre-lockdown period (564/9460 vs 371/5950, P =â€‰0.48). The proportion of mental health patients presenting due to overdose increased by 6.5% (158/564 vs 128/371, P =â€‰0.035); those due to self-harm increased by 3.5% (35/564 vs 36/371, P =â€‰0.049). The proportion of mental health presentations due to anxiety, depression and other non-self-harm/overdose complaints decreased by 10% (371/564 vs 207/371, P =â€‰0.002). The proportion of overdoses of paracetamol and ibuprofen increased by 13.4% during lockdown (22/158 vs 35/128, P =â€‰0.005). During the COVID-19 lockdown, both overall ED presentations as well as mental health-related presentations decreased. There was a relative increase in overdoses and self-harm, particularly involving paracetamol and ibuprofen.","Joyce, Richardson, McCombie, Hamilton, Ardagh",https://doi.org/10.1111/1742-6723.13667,20201109.0,COVID-19; emergency department; mental health; overdose; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
233,Higher binding affinity of furin for SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein D614G mutant could be associated with higher SARS-CoV-2 infectivity,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused an exponential rise in death rates and hospitalizations. The aim of this study was to characterize the D614G substitution in the severe acute respiratory syndome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike glycoprotein (S protein), which may affect viral infectivity. The effect of D614G substitution on the structure and thermodynamic stability of the S protein was analyzed with use of DynaMut and SCooP. HDOCK and PRODIGY were used to model furin protease binding to the S protein RRAR cleavage site and calculate binding affinities. Molecular dynamics simulations were used to predict the S protein apo structure, the S protein-furin complex structure, and the free binding energy of the complex. The D614G substitution in the G clade of SARS-CoV-2 strains introduced structural mobility and decreased the thermal stability of the S protein (Î”Î”Gâ€‰=â€‰-0.086â€‰kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>). The substitution resulted in stronger binding affinity (K<sub>d</sub>â€‰=â€‰1.6â€‰Ã—â€‰10<sup>-8</sup>) for furin, which may enhance S protein cleavage. The results were corroborated by molecular dynamics simulations demonstrating higher binding energy of furin and the S protein D614G mutant (-61.9â€‰kcalâ€‰mol<sup>-1</sup> compared with -56.78â€‰kcalâ€‰mol<sup>-1</sup> for wild-type S protein). The D614G substitution in the G clade induced flexibility of the S protein, resulting in increased furin binding, which may enhance S protein cleavage and infiltration of host cells. Therefore, the SARS-CoV-2 D614G substitution may result in a more virulent strain.","Mohammad, Alshawaf, Marafie, Abu-Farha, Abubaker, Al-Mulla",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.10.033,20210216.0,"COVID-19; Furin; G clade; Interatomic binding; Molecular dynamics simulations; S protein; SARS-CoV-2; Thermodynamic stability; COVID-19; Furin; Humans; Mutant Proteins; Protein Binding; SARS-CoV-2; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus; Thermodynamics",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

With public health, social service, and community partners connected through an ongoing academic-community collaborative, we developed and fielded a weekly repeated cross-sectional electronic survey assessing usage of and unmet need for health and social service resources. Using 10 weeks of surveys (April 3-June 11, 2020) by Allegheny County residents, we examined variation in responses by week and by sociodemographic characteristics using chi-square tests. We shared written reports weekly and discussed emerging trends with community partners. Participants ranged from 229 to 1001 per week. Unmet need for at least 1 health or health-related social need resource varied by week, ranging from 55% (95% confidence interval [CI] 50%-59%) of participants in week 2 to 43% (95% CI 37%-49%) of participants in week 9 (P = .006). Increased use of at least 1 resource ranged from 53% (95% CI 47%-58%) of participants in week 3 to 36% (95% CI 31%-42%) in week 9 (P &lt; .001). Unmet need for food and financial assistance peaked early during the stay-at-home order, while unmet need for mental health care rose later. Unmet need for food assistance varied significantly by race and ethnicity and by household prepandemic income. Over half of families with children reported unmet health or social service needs during the first month of a county-wide COVID-19 stay-at-home order. Unmet needs varied with race, ethnicity, and income and with duration of the stay-at-home order.","Ray, Ettinger, Dwarakanath, Mistry, Bey, Chaves-Gnecco, Alston, Ripper, Lavage, Landsittel, Miller",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acap.2020.10.004,20210124.0,children; coronavirus; coronavirus disease 2019; health-related social needs,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
237,Social support and acute stress symptoms (ASSs) during the COVID-19 outbreak: deciphering the roles of psychological needs and sense of control,"<b>Background:</b> A cute stress symptoms (ASSs) are likely to be a common mental health problem in the acute period following the 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) outbreak. To address this risk, substantial social support has been provided to relieve ASSs during the COVID-19 outbreak. However, the effectiveness of these support methods for relieving ASSs has not yet been assessed. <b>Objective:</b> The current study sought to examine the underlying mechanisms by which social support relieves ASSs, among primary and secondary school teachers. <b>Method:</b>Â A sample of 751 primary and secondary school teachers was selected to answer self-reported questionnaires regarding ASSs, social support, psychological needs, and the sense of control. <b>Results:</b> Structural equation modelling revealed that social support had a non-significant direct relationship with ASSs, and a significant indirect relationship with reduced ASSs via the needs for autonomy and relatedness, and via the paths from three types of psychological needs to the sense of control. <b>Conclusion:</b> These findings suggest that social support can play a relieving role in ASSs when the support satisfies individuals' psychological needs and improves their sense of control. To alleviate ASSs among primary and secondary school teachers, more attention should be paid to satisfying their specific psychological needs and improving their sense of control. <b>Antecedentes:</b> Es probable que los sÃ­ntomas de estrÃ©s agudo (SEAs) sean un problema de salud mental frecuente en el periodo agudo que sigue al nuevo brote de neumonÃ­a por coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).

238,Psychosocial Safety Climate of Employees During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Iran: A Policy Analysis,"Iran is among the top 15 countries in the world in terms of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infection rates. The numbers of infections and deaths are still increasing in September 2020. This study aims to investigate the impact of the policies on terminating the quarantine period on the perception of psychosocial safety by employees and workers in Iran. In this study, policy announcements and regulations, media reports, and the results were collected from 2 previously published population surveys that collected employees' views of the government approach to quarantine. The information thus collected was then analyzed using the &quot;What is the Problem Represented (WPR)&quot; approach for data analysis introduced by Carol Bacchi, and focuses on the question, &quot;What effects are produced by the representation of the problem?&quot; The Iranian Government decided to quarantine people and close most sectors during the New Year holidays in Iran in March 2020. The duration of quarantine was only 2 weeks, and the government then ordered government organizations and industrial companies to reopen. The advantage of a short quarantine period is assumed to be the reinstatement of productivity while the disadvantage is the likely risk of further transmission of the virus. The government approach to and communication about the quarantine period has neglected to consider the psychosocial safety climate of employees, who have to go to their workplaces using buses, subways, or other vehicles, and who are under pressure mentally because of fear of infection, dismissal for non-attendance, and the consequent economic problems. The government approach necessarily impacts on the perceived psychosocial safety climate of employees, and hence influences the causes of work stress. If the psychosocial safety climate is not considered and improved, it may reduce the quality of services and products, and increase accidents.","Seddighi, Dollard, Salmani",https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2020.370,20201125.0,COVID-19; Iran; human resources management; mental health; occupational health; policy analysis; psychosocial safety climate,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
239,The Impact of COVID-19 Stay-At-Home Orders on Health Behaviors in Adults,"Stay-at-home orders in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have forced abrupt changes to daily routines. This study assessed lifestyle changes across different BMI classifications in response to the global pandemic. The online survey targeting adults was distributed in April 2020 and collected information on dietary behaviors, physical activity, and mental health. All questions were presented as &quot;before&quot; and &quot;since&quot; the COVID-19 pandemic. In total, 7,753 participants were included; 32.2% of the sample were individuals with normal weight, 32.1% had overweight, and 34.0% had obesity. During the pandemic, overall scores for healthy eating increased (Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.001), owing to less eating out and increased cooking (Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.001). Sedentary leisure behaviors increased, while time spent in physical activity (absolute time and intensity adjusted) declined (Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.001). Anxiety scores increased 8.78â€‰Â±â€‰0.21 during the pandemic, and the magnitude of increase was significantly greater in people with obesity (Pâ€‰â‰¤â€‰0.01). Weight gain was reported in 27.5% of the total sample compared with 33.4% in participants with obesity. The COVID-19 pandemic has produced significant health effects, well beyond the virus itself. Government mandates together with fear of contracting the virus have significantly impacted lifestyle behaviors alongside declines in mental health. These deleterious impacts have disproportionally affected individuals with obesity.","Flanagan, Beyl, Fearnbach, Altazan, Martin, Redman",https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.23066,20210204.0,Adult; COVID-19; Exercise; Female; Health Behavior; Humans; Life Style; Male; Mental Health; Obesity; Overweight; Quarantine; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
240,COVID-19 pandemic and mental distress in multiple sclerosis: implications for clinical management,"In multiple sclerosis (MS), disease-related factors and dysfunctional coping might favor the development of mental distress induced by COVID-19 containment measures. Aim of this study was exploring the relationship between disability, coping strategies, daily life reorganization and neuropsychiatric symptoms in an Italian MS population during the COVID-19 lockdown, in order to identify potentially modifiable factors that could inform clinical management of mental distress in people with MS. We explored the relationship between mental distress, disability and coping strategies in the Italian MS population under lockdown. Structural equation modeling was applied to information collected via web survey to identify modifiable factors that could account for mental distress. A total of 845 participants (497 with MS and 348 controls) were included in the study. The MS group had higher scores than the control group for depression (PÂ =Â 0.005), but not for anxiety, emotional dyscontrol or sleep disturbances. The structural equation modeling explained 74% of the variance observed in depression score. Within the model, three latent factors were characterized from measured variables: motor disability and cognitive dysfunction contributed to disability (Î²Â =Â 0.509 and Î²Â =Â 0.836; PÂ &lt;Â 0.001); positive attitude and exercise contributed to active attitude (Î²Â =Â 0.386 and Î²Â =Â 0.297; PÂ &lt;Â 0.001); and avoidance, social support and watching television contributed to passive attitude (Î²Â =Â 0.301, Î²Â =Â 0.243 and Î²Â =Â 0.212; PÂ &lt;Â 0.001). With regard to the relationship between latent factors and their influence on depression, disability contributed to passive attitude (Î²Â =Â 0.855; PÂ &lt;Â 0.001), while both passive and active attitude significantly influenced depression (Î²Â =Â 0.729 and Î²Â =Â -0.456; PÂ &lt;Â 0.001). As a practical implication of our model, favoring exercise would enhance active attitude and its positive impact on mental well-being while, at the same time, reducing the negative impact of disability on depression, representing a valuable tool in facing COVID-19-related mental distress.","Costabile, Carotenuto, Lavorgna, Borriello, Moiola, Inglese, Petruzzo, Trojsi, Ianniello, Nozzolillo, Cellerino, Boffa, Rosa, Servillo, Moccia, Bonavita, Filippi, Lanzillo, Brescia Morra, Petracca",https://doi.org/10.1111/ene.14580,20201120.0,COVID-19; coping; depression; exercise; multiple sclerosis,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
241,&quot;Physical Sex Is Over for Now&quot;: Impact of COVID-19 on the Well-Being and Sexual Health of Adolescent Sexual Minority Males in the US,"This study aimed to explore how the COVID-19 pandemic and physical distancing measures have impacted the well-being and sexual health among adolescent sexual minority males (ASMM) during the initial phase of physical distancing mandates in the U.S. From March 27, 2020, to May 8, 2020, U.S. ASMM (NÂ = 151; aged 14-17 years) completed the online baseline survey of a sexual health intervention trial. COVID-19-related closed- and open-ended questions were included. A mixed-methods approach assessed COVID-19-related changes in well-being and sexual health by outness with an accepting guardian. The majority (57%) of participants reported being worried about COVID-19. Almost all (91%) were physically distancing. Participants noted that COVID-19 changed school, home, work, and family life. Participants highlighted that COVID-19 reduced their ability to socialize and had a deleterious effect on their mental health. In the past 3 months, participants reported seeing sexual partners in person less often, masturbating and viewing pornography more often, and sexting and messaging on men-seeking-men websites/phone applications about the same amount.

242,Impact on mental health of the COVID-19 outbreak among community pharmacists during the sanitary lockdown period,"COVID-19 outbreak can impact mental health including health care workers. The aim of this study was to assess the psychological impact of COVID-19 in French community pharmacists. We carried out a postal-based survey to assess the psychological impact of COVID-19 in French owner community pharmacists based on three validated self-report questionnaires: Perceived Stress scale, Impact of Event Scale-revised and Maslach Burnout Inventory. The sample consists of 135 community pharmacists. Twenty-three pharmacists reported significant post-traumatic stress symptoms (17%). High burnout symptoms were found in 33 (25%), 46 (34.9%) and 4 (3%) participants. Females scored higher than males for all questionnaires (P=0.01). This study is the first study which showed the psychological impact of COVID-19 in community pharmacists. Based on validated self-report questionnaires, up to 35% of pharmacists reported psychological disturbances. Interventions to promote psychological well-being of healthcare workers need to be developing.","Lange, Joo, Couette, de Jaegher, Joly, Humbert",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pharma.2020.09.002,20201119.0,"Burnout; COVID-19; Mental health; Pharmaciens; Pharmacists; SantÃ© mentale; Adult; Aged; Betacoronavirus; Burnout, Professional; COVID-19; Community Pharmacy Services; Coronavirus Infections; Depersonalization; Emotions; Female; France; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Occupational Stress; Pandemics; Pharmacists; Pneumonia, Viral; SARS-CoV-2; Self Report; Severity of Illness Index; Sex Distribution; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
243,Virtual Reality Behavioral Activation as an Intervention for Major Depressive Disorder: Case Report,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a global problem with an increasing incidence and prevalence. There has additionally been an increase in depression due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Behavioral activation is considered an evidence-based treatment for MDD. However, there are many barriers that could hinder one's ability to engage in behavioral activation, with COVID-19 &quot;shelter-in-place&quot; and social distancing orders being current and large impediments. Virtual reality (VR) has been successfully used to help treat a variety of mental health conditions, but it has not yet been used as a method of administering behavioral activation to a clinical population. Using VR to engage in behavioral activation could eliminate barriers that pandemic precautions place and help decrease symptoms of depression that are especially exacerbated in these times. The following case report examines the feasibility, acceptability, and tolerability of VR behavioral activation for an adult with MDD during a global pandemic. This participant was part of a larger pilot study, and the case serves as a description of the VR intervention. The participant engaged in a weekly 50-minute psychotherapy Zoom session for 4 weeks, in which a modified behavioral activation protocol was administered using a VR headset to simulate activities. Data on mood ratings, homework compliance, and headset use were obtained from the headset. Acceptability, tolerability, and depression symptoms were obtained using self-report rating scales. The intervention was feasible, acceptable, and tolerable, as reported by this participant. The participant's depressive symptoms decreased by five-points on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 over a month, with a beginning score of 10 (moderate depression) and a final score of 5 (mild depression). The implications of these findings for future research are discussed.

244,Trauma-informed responses in addressing public mental health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic: position paper of the European Society for Traumatic Stress Studies (ESTSS),"The COVID-19 pandemic has changed life in Europe and globally. The pandemic affects both individuals and the broader society across many domains, including physical and psychological health, the economy and general welfare. The measures taken to counteract the pandemic have significantly altered daily life and, along with the threat of contracting the coronavirus and uncertainties surrounding future developments, created a complex system of stressors with a negative impact on public mental health. This paper aims to outline the ESTSS strategy to address mental health issues related to COVID-19 and focuses on (1) trauma-informed policies, (2) capacity building, (3) collaborative research and (4) knowledge-exchange. To facilitate implementation of a trauma-informed approach and appropriate measures, ESTSS has developed a toolkit of recommendations on mental health and psychosocial assistance to be provided during the different phases of crisis and its aftermath. To promote capacity building, ESTSS offers a certification programme based on a curriculum in psychotraumatology and corresponding on-line training to the European community of mental health professionals. To assure evidence-based approaches and methods tailored to current circumstances, ESTSS has initiated a pan-European research project with international cooperation aimed at studying the mental health consequences of the pandemic, with a focus on psychological trauma and other stress-related reactions. To foster knowledge-exchange, the European Journal of Psychotraumatology (EJPT), the official journal of ESTSS, is publishing a special issue on COVID-19. La pandemia de COVID-19 ha cambiado la vida en Europa y en todo el mundo. La pandemia afecta tanto a los individuos como a la sociedad en general en muchos Ã¡mbitos, incluida la salud fÃ­sica y psicolÃ³gica, la economÃ­a y el bienestar general. Las medidas tomadas para contrarrestar la pandemia han alterado significativamente la vida diaria y, junto con la amenaza de contraer el coronavirus y las incertidumbres que rodean los desarrollos futuros, crearon un complejo sistema de estresores con un impacto negativo en la salud mental pÃºblica. En este artÃ­culo se pretende esbozar la estrategia de la ESTSS para abordar los problemas de salud mental relacionados con COVID-19 y se centra en: 1. PolÃ­ticas informadas en trauma, 2. capacitaciÃ³n, 3. investigaciÃ³n colaborativa, 4. e intercambio de conocimientos. Para facilitar la implementaciÃ³n de un enfoque basado en el trauma y las medidas apropiadas, la ESTSS ha desarrollado un conjunto de herramientas de recomendaciones sobre salud mental y asistencia psicosocial que se proporcionarÃ¡ durante las diferentes fases de la crisis y sus consecuencias. Para fomentar la capacitaciÃ³n, la ESTSS ofrece un programa de certificaciÃ³n basado en un plan de estudios en psicotraumatologÃ­a y la formaciÃ³n on-line correspondiente a la comunidad europea de profesionales de la salud mental. Para asegurar enfoques y mÃ©todos basados en la evidencia adaptados a las circunstancias actuales, la ESTSS ha iniciado un proyecto de investigaciÃ³n paneuropeo con cooperaciÃ³n internacional, destinado a estudiar las consecuencias de la pandemia en la salud mental, con enfoque en el trauma psicolÃ³gico y otras reacciones relacionadas con el estrÃ©s. Para fomentar intercambio de conocimiento, la European Journal of Psychotraumatology (EJPT), la revista oficial de ESTSS, publica un nÃºmero especial sobre COVID-19.

246,Risk of Mortality in Elderly Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patients With Mental Health Disorders: A Nationwide Retrospective Study in South Korea,"This study aimed to investigate the different clinical characteristics among elderly coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with and without mental disorders in South Korea and determine if these characteristics have an association with underlying mental disorders causing mortality. A population-based comparative cohort study was conducted using the national claims database. Individuals aged â‰¥65 years with confirmed COVID-19 between January 1, 2020 and April 10, 2020 were assessed. The endpoints for evaluating mortality for all participants were death, 21 days after diagnosis, or April 10, 2020. The risk of mortality associated with mental disorders was estimated using Cox hazards regression. We identified 814 elderly COVID-19 patients (255 [31.3%] with mental disorder and 559 [68.7%] with nonmental disorder). Individuals with mental disorders were found more likely to be older, taking antithrombotic agents, and had diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive lung disease, and urinary tract infections than those without mental disorders. After propensity score stratification, our study included 781 patients in each group (236 [30.2%] with mental disorder and 545 [69.8%] with nonmental disorder). The mental disorder group showed higher mortality rates than the nonmental disorder group (12.7% [30/236] versus 6.8% [37/545]). However, compared to patients without mental disorders, the hazard ratio (HR) for mortality in elderly COVID-19 patients with mental disorders was not statistically significant (HR: 1.57, 95%CI: 0.95-2.56). Although the association between mental disorders in elderly individuals and mortality in COVID-19 is unclear, this study suggests that elderly patients with comorbid conditions and those taking psychiatric medications might be at a higher risk of COVID-19.","Lee, Cho, You, Park, Kim, Lee, Aizenstein, Andreescu, Karim, Hong, Rho, Park, Son",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.09.016,20201130.0,"COVID-19; Elderly; mental disorder; mortality; Aged; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; Cohort Studies; Comorbidity; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Proportional Hazards Models; Republic of Korea; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; SARS-CoV-2",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
247,"Communicable Diseases (Including COVID-19)-Induced Global Depression: Caused by Inadequate Healthcare Expenditures, Population Density, and Mass Panic","Coronavirus (COVID-19) is spreading at an enormous rate and has caused deaths beyond expectations due to a variety of reasons. These include: (i) inadequate healthcare spending causing, for instance, a shortage of protective equipment, testing swabs, masks, surgical gloves, gowns, etc.; (ii) a high population density that causes close physical contact among community members who reside in compact places, hence they are more likely to be exposed to communicable diseases, including coronavirus; and (iii) mass panic due to the fear of experiencing the loss of loved ones, lockdown, and shortage of food. In a given scenario, the study focused on the following key variables: communicable diseases, healthcare expenditures, population density, poverty, economic growth, and COVID-19 dummy variable in a panel of 76 selected countries from 2010 through 2019. The results show that the impact of communicable diseases on economic growth is positive because the infected countries get a reap of economic benefits from other countries in the form of healthcare technologies, knowledge transfers, cash transfers, international loans, aid, etc., to get rid of the diseases. However, the case is different with COVID-19 as it has seized the whole world together in a much shorter period of time and no other countries are able to help others in terms of funding loans, healthcare facilities, or technology transfers. Thus, the impact of COVID-19 in the given study is negatively impacting countries' economic growth that converts into a global depression. The high incidence of poverty and social closeness increases more vulnerable conditions that spread coronavirus across countries. The momentous increase in healthcare expenditures put a burden on countries' national healthcare bills that stretch the depression phase-out of the boundary. The forecasting relationship suggested the negative impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the global economy would last the next 10 years. Unified global healthcare policies, physical distancing, smart lockdowns, and meeting food challenges are largely required to combat the coronavirus pandemic and escape from global depression.","Anser, Yousaf, Khan, Sheikh, Nassani, Abro, Zaman",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.00398,20201006.0,(COVID-19); GMM estimator; communicable diseases; global depression; healthcare expenditures; population density; poverty incidence,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
248,Severe SARS-CoV-2 disease in the context of a NF-ÎºB2 loss-of-function pathogenic variant,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus that emerged recently and has created a global pandemic. Symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been associated with a host of symptoms affecting numerous organ systems, including the lungs, cardiovascular system, kidney, central nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, and skin, among others. Although several risk factors have been identified as related to complications from and severity of COVID-19, much about the virus remains unknown. The host immune response appears to affect the outcome of disease. It is not surprising that patients with intrinsic or secondary immune compromise might be particularly susceptible to complications from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pathogenic loss-of-function or gain-of-function heterozygous variants in nuclear factor-ÎºB2 have been reported to be associated with either a combined immunodeficiency or common variable immunodeficiency phenotype. We evaluated the functional consequence and immunologic phenotype of a novel NFKB2 loss of function variant in a 17-year-old male patient and describe the clinical management of SARS-CoV-2 infection in this context. This patient required a 2-week hospitalization for SARS-CoV-2 infection, including 7 days of mechanical ventilation. We used biologic therapies to avert potentially fatal acute respiratory distress syndrome and treat hyperinflammatory responses. The patient had an immunologic phenotype of B-cell dysregulation with decreased switched memory B cells. Despite the underlying immune dysfunction, he recovered from the infection with intense management. This clinical case exemplifies some of the practical challenges in management of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in the context of underlying immune dysregulation.","Abraham, Marshall, Kuehn, Rueda, Gibbs, Guider, Stewart, Rosenzweig, Wang, Jean, Peeples, King, Hunt, Honegger, Ramilo, Mustillo, Mejias, Ardura, Shimamura",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2020.09.020,20210215.0,"COVID-19; NF-ÎºB; NF-ÎºB pathway; NF-ÎºB2; SARS-CoV-2; immunodeficiency; Adenosine Monophosphate; Adolescent; Alanine; Antibodies, Viral; Antiviral Agents; B-Lymphocytes; COVID-19; Hospitalization; Humans; Interleukin-6; Male; NF-kappa B p52 Subunit; Respiration, Artificial; SARS-CoV-2; Severity of Illness Index",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
249,Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States: Online Survey,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had numerous worldwide effects. In the United States, there have been 8.3 million cases and nearly 222,000 deaths as of October 21, 2020. Based on previous studies of mental health during outbreaks, the mental health of the population will be negatively affected in the aftermath of this pandemic. The long-term nature of this pandemic may lead to unforeseen mental health outcomes and/or unexpected relationships between demographic factors and mental health outcomes. This research focused on assessing the mental health status of adults in the United States during the early weeks of an unfolding pandemic. Data was collected from English-speaking adults from early April to early June 2020 using an online survey. The final convenience sample included 1083 US residents. The 71-item survey consisted of demographic questions, mental health and well-being measures, a coping mechanisms checklist, and questions about COVID-19-specific concerns. Hierarchical multivariable logistic regression was used to explore associations among demographic variables and mental health outcomes. Hierarchical linear regression was conducted to examine associations among demographic variables, COVID-19-specific concerns, and mental health and well-being outcomes. Approximately 50% (536/1076) of the US sample was aged â‰¥45 years. Most of the sample was White (1013/1054, 96%), non-Hispanic (985/1058, 93%), and female (884/1073, 82%). Participants reported high rates of depression (295/1034, 29%), anxiety (342/1007, 34%), and stress (773/1058, 73%). Older individuals were less likely to report depressive symptomology (OR 0.78, P&lt;.001) and anxiety symptomology (OR 0.72, P&lt;.001); in addition, they had lower stress scores (-0.15 points, SE 0.01, P&lt;.001) and increased well-being scores (1.86 points, SE 0.22, P&lt;.001). Individuals who were no longer working due to COVID-19 were 2.25 times more likely to report symptoms of depression (P=.02), had a 0.51-point increase in stress (SE 0.17, P=.02), and a 3.9-point decrease in well-being scores (SE 1.49, P=.009) compared to individuals who were working remotely before and after COVID-19. Individuals who had partial or no insurance coverage were 2-3 times more likely to report depressive symptomology compared to individuals with full coverage (P=.02 and P=.01, respectively). Individuals who were on Medicare/Medicaid and individuals with no coverage were 1.97 and 4.48 times more likely to report moderate or severe anxiety, respectively (P=.03 and P=.01, respectively). Financial and food access concerns were significantly and positively related to depression, anxiety, and stress (all P&lt;.05), and significantly negatively related to well-being (both P&lt;.001). Economy, illness, and death concerns were significantly positively related to overall stress scores (all P&lt;.05). Our findings suggest that many US residents are experiencing high stress, depressive, and anxiety symptomatology, especially those who are underinsured, uninsured, or unemployed. Longitudinal investigation of these variables is recommended. Health practitioners may provide opportunities to allay concerns or offer coping techniques to individuals in need of mental health care. These messages should be shared in person and through practice websites and social media.","Jewell, Farewell, Welton-Mitchell, Lee-Winn, Walls, Leiferman",https://doi.org/10.2196/22043,20201101.0,COVID-19; anxiety; depression; mental health; pandemic; stress; well-being,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

251,"A repeated cross-sectional survey assessing university students' stress, depression, anxiety, and suicidality in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland","The time of widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases can lead to elevated stress and mental health problems among all persons affected, and in particular those sub-groups of the population that are at an increased risk of mental health problems. One such vulnerable group constitutes university students. The aim of this study is to assess stress, depression, anxiety, and suicidality among different groups of university students (medical, psychology, and other). Using a repeated cross-sectional study design, we collected survey data among a large sample of 7228 university students from Poland (mean age = 22.78, s.d. = 4.40; 81% female). Data were collected in five waves, during the first 2 months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe (March and April 2020). The results demonstrate a significant increase in depression levels as the pandemic was progressing. We also found that female students scored significantly higher than male students on depression, anxiety, and stress. Psychology students recorded the lowest scores on depression and anxiety. Young adult students (aged 18-24 years) had more symptoms of depression, anxiety, and suicidality than adult students (â©¾25 years). These results provide insights into stress and mental health among university students during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings can be used for a more effective identification of students who may struggle during next stages of the pandemic and future crises.","Debowska, Horeczy, Boduszek, Dolinski",https://doi.org/10.1017/S003329172000392X,20201020.0,Anxiety; COVID-19 pandemic; depression; stress; suicidality; university students,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
252,[Psychological effects during the COVID-19 outbreak in Argentina],"After the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak, global measures were implemented with the aim of containing its progression. On March 20, 2020, the mandatory preventive quarantine began in Argentina. As a result of these events, previous studies conducted in the framework of this pandemic in China, have shown psychological consequences. The aim of this study is to explore, through a self-administered electronic survey, attitudes and fears regarding COVID-19, the development of depressive symptoms and the pattern of alcohol consumption among the argentinian population during quarantine (n = 759). As a result, we observed that fear of COVID-19 was greater in 55 to 59 years old people, with an abrupt drop above 70; that depressed mood and the increased of alcohol consumption were more frequent in youngest subjects, and that depressed mood was also frequent among subjects who lost their jobs during quarantine. Finally, we observed an elevated degree of agreement with the quarantine measure, even in some people who suffered a decrease in their income greater than 80% during quarantine. These results are useful for obtaining information about risk groups, enabling specific preventive and therapeutic strategies could be designed. Luego de que la OrganizaciÃ³n Mundial de la Salud (OMS) declarara la pandemia por el nuevo coronavirus (COVID-19), se implementaron medidas a nivel mundial con el objetivo de contener su progresiÃ³n. El 20 de marzo de 2020 se iniciÃ³ el confinamiento preventivo obligatorio en Argentina. Estudios realizados en el marco de esta pandemia en China, han evidenciado consecuencias psicolÃ³gicas como resultado del temor al contagio y de las medidas de aislamiento. El objetivo del presente estudio es explorar a travÃ©s de una encuesta autoadministrada por vÃ­a electrÃ³nica, actitudes y temores frente al COVID-19, la presencia de sintomatologÃ­a depresiva y el patrÃ³n de consumo de alcohol de la poblaciÃ³n argentina durante el confinamiento (n = 759). Como resultado, observamos que el temor al COVID-19 fue mayor en las personas de entre 55 y 59 aÃ±os, con un descenso abrupto en los mayores de 70; que el Ã¡nimo depresivo y el incremento en el consumo de alcohol fueron mÃ¡s frecuentes en los mÃ¡s jÃ³venes y que el estado de Ã¡nimo depresivo mostrÃ³ una frecuencia mayor en quienes perdieron el empleo durante el confinamiento. Finalmente, observamos que el grado de acuerdo de los participantes con la medida de confinamiento fue superior al 90% incluso en aquellas personas que sufrieron una disminuciÃ³n de sus ingresos mayor al 80% durante la cuarentena. Los resultados de este estudio brindan informaciÃ³n sobre grupos de riesgo para el desarrollo de sÃ­ntomas psicopatolÃ³gicos.

253,Management of psychiatric conditions and delirium during the COVID-19 pandemic across continents: lessons learned and recommendations,"With the uncertainties of COVID-19, people infected with coronavirus present with diverse psychiatric presentations. Some institutions have had to manage their patients with existing protocols, others have had to create them. In this article we aimed to report the challenges and good practices in the management of psychiatric conditions and delirium coexisting with COVID-19 across continents. Early Career Psychiatrists (ECPs) from across five continents were approached to share their experiences on the management of psychiatric conditions in patients with COVID-19 during the current pandemic. We collected information about the experiences from sixteen countries. Commonalities were similar psychiatric presentations and poor preparedness across countries. Differences were varying adjustments made in the management of psychiatric conditions coexisting with COVID-19 and different innovations. Good practices which can be adopted by other countries are novel approaches such as telepsychiatry, proactive consultation-liaison units and enhanced community services targeted at circumventing challenges faced when providing mental health services. These findings highlight the need for global preparedness in the mental health sector during outbreaks of infectious diseases, and the need for concerted efforts targeted at global and locally sensitive adaptation of existing protocols and the development of new guidelines for the management of psychiatric conditions for the present pandemic and subsequent occurrences.","Ojeahere, de Filippis, Ransing, Karaliuniene, Ullah, BytyÃ§i, Abbass, Kilic, Nahidi, Hayatudeen, Nagendrappa, Shoib, Jatchavala, Larnaout, Maiti, Ogunnubi, El Hayek, Bizri, Schuh Teixeira, Pereira-Sanchez, Pinto da Costa",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2020.100147,20201216.0,COVID-19; Coronavirus; Delirium; Early career psychiatrists (ECPs); Management; Psychiatric conditions,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
254,Health Anxiety and Mental Health Outcome During COVID-19 Lockdown in Italy: The Mediating and Moderating Roles of Psychological Flexibility,"The COVID-19 emergency has severely affected the Italian population. During a pandemic, those with high health anxiety are at risk of adverse mental health outcomes, including peritraumatic distress and mood disturbance. No prior research has explored the role of psychological flexibility in protecting people at high risk of poorer mental health impacts due to health anxiety during a pandemic. Psychological flexibility is the cornerstone of psychological health and resiliency. According to acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), it involves behaving consistently with one's chosen values even in the presence of emotional and mental discomfort. This study examined the mediating and moderating roles of psychological flexibility in the link between trait health anxiety and three mental health outcomes: COVID-19 peritraumatic distress, anxiety, and depression. We hypothesized that higher psychological flexibility would decrease the negative impacts of trait health anxiety on mental health outcomes. During the mandatory national lockdown (<i>M</i> = 35.70 days, <i>SD</i> = 8.41), 944 Italian adults (75.5% female, <i>M</i> = 38.86 years, <i>SD</i> = 13.20) completed an online survey consisting of standardized measures of psychological flexibility, trait health anxiety, COVID-19 distress, anxiety, and depression. Results indicated that psychological flexibility did not moderate the link between trait health anxiety and mental health outcomes. Rather, greater psychological flexibility mediated decreases in the adverse effects of trait health anxiety on COVID-19 distress, anxiety, and depression. In particular, two psychological flexibility processes, observing unhelpful thoughts rather than taking them literally (defusion) and values-based action (committed action), mediated decreases in the negative effects of trait health anxiety on all mental health outcomes. In contrast, the psychological flexibility process acceptance, which involves openness to inner discomfort, mediated increases in negative mental health outcomes. Overall, the combination of these processes mitigated the detrimental impacts of trait health anxiety on mental health during the emergency mandatory COVID-19 nationwide lockdown. Consistent with the ACT conceptualization of psychological flexibility, findings suggest embracing (rather than avoiding) inner discomfort and observing associated unhelpful thoughts, while also engaging in values-based action, increases resilience during adversity. Evidenced-based large-scale online public health interventions that target psychological flexibility in those experiencing health anxiety in the context of a pandemic are urgently needed. Many empirically-based ACT interventions are suited for this purpose.","Landi, Pakenham, Boccolini, Grandi, Tossani",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.02195,20201001.0,COVID-19; anxiety; depression; health anxiety; pandemic; psychological flexibility; quarantine,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
255,Effects of the lockdown on the mental health of the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy: Results from the COMET collaborative network,"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is an unprecedented traumatic event influencing the healthcare, economic, and social welfare systems worldwide. In order to slow the infection rates, lockdown has been implemented almost everywhere. Italy, one of the countries most severely affected, entered the &quot;lockdown&quot; on March 8, 2020. The COvid Mental hEalth Trial (COMET) network includes 10 Italian university sites and the National Institute of Health. The whole study has three different phases. The first phase includes an online survey conducted between March and May 2020 in the Italian population. Recruitment took place through email invitation letters, social media, mailing lists of universities, national medical associations, and associations of stakeholders (e.g., associations of users/carers). In order to evaluate the impact of lockdown on depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms, multivariate linear regression models were performed, weighted for the propensity score. The final sample consisted of 20,720 participants. Among them, 12.4% of respondents (NÂ =Â 2,555) reported severe or extremely severe levels of depressive symptoms, 17.6% (NÂ =Â 3,627) of anxiety symptoms and 41.6% (NÂ =Â 8,619) reported to feel at least moderately stressed by the situation at the DASS-21.According to the multivariate regression models, the depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms significantly worsened from the week April 9-15 to the week April 30 to May 4 (pÂ &lt;Â 0.0001). Moreover, female respondents and people with pre-existing mental health problems were at higher risk of developing severe depression and anxiety symptoms (pÂ &lt;Â 0.0001). Although physical isolation and lockdown represent essential public health measures for containing the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, they are a serious threat for mental health and well-being of the general population. As an integral part of COVID-19 response, mental health needs should be addressed.","Fiorillo, Sampogna, Giallonardo, Del Vecchio, Luciano, Albert, Carmassi, CarrÃ , Cirulli, Dell'Osso, Nanni, Pompili, Sani, Tortorella, Volpe",https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2020.89,20201021.0,"Anxiety; COVID-19; depression; lockdown; pandemic; stress; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Italy; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; SARS-CoV-2; Stress, Psychological; Universities; Young Adult",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
256,The potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on child growth and development: a systematic review,"This was a systematic review of studies that examined the impact of epidemics or social restriction on mental and developmental health in parents and children/adolescents. The PubMed, WHO COVID-19, and SciELO databases were searched on March 15, 2020, and on April 25, 2020, filtering for children (0-18 years) and humans. The tools used to mitigate the threat of a pandemic such as COVID-19 may very well threaten child growth and development. These tools - such as social restrictions, shutdowns, and school closures - contribute to stress in parents and children and can become risk factors that threaten child growth and development and may compromise the Sustainable Development Goals. The studies reviewed suggest that epidemics can lead to high levels of stress in parents and children, which begin with concerns about children becoming infected. These studies describe several potential mental and emotional consequences of epidemics such as COVID-19, H1N1, AIDS, and Ebola: severe anxiety or depression among parents and acute stress disorder, post-traumatic stress, anxiety disorders, and depression among children. These data can be related to adverse childhood experiences and elevated risk of toxic stress. The more adverse experiences, the greater the risk of developmental delays and health problems in adulthood, such as cognitive impairment, substance abuse, depression, and non-communicable diseases. Information about the impact of epidemics on parents and children is relevant to policy makers to aid them in developing strategies to help families cope with epidemic/pandemic-driven adversity and ensure their children's healthy development.","AraÃºjo, Veloso, Souza, Azevedo, Tarro",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jped.2020.08.008,20210110.0,COVID-19; Child development; Coronavirus; SARS-COV2; Sustainable development goals; Toxic stress,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

This was a survey study consisting of a 23-point questionnaire. The study involved surgical trainees that had been redeployed to the (ICU) across all hospitals in London during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey was sent to 90 surgical trainees who were between postgraduate years 2 to 4. Trainees in specialty training programs (&gt;5 years after graduation) were not included. Thirty-two trainees responded to the questionnaire and were included in the study results. All respondents spent between 4 and 8 weeks working in ICU. Prior to redeployment, 78% of participants had previous experience of ICU or an affiliated specialty, and &gt;90% had attended at least 1 educational course with relevance to ICU. There were statistically significant increases in confidence performing central venous cannulation and peripheral arterial catheterisation (p &lt; 0.05). With regards to clinical skills, respondents reported feeling more confident managing ventilated patients, patients on noninvasive ventilation, dialysis, and circulatory failure patients after working in ICU. Respondents (97%) felt that the experience would be beneficial to their future careers but 53% felt the redeployment had a negative impact on their mental health. Redeployment of surgical trainees to ICU led to increased confidence in a number of technical and nontechnical skills. However, proactive interventions are needed for training surgeons with regard to their psychological wellbeing in these extraordinary circumstances and to improve workforce planning for future pandemics.","Payne, Rahman, Bullingham, Vamadeva, Alfa-Wali",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsurg.2020.09.009,20201001.0,COVID-19; Pandemic; Surgical training; Wellbeing; Workforce,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

260,Hidden scars: the impact of violence and the COVID-19 pandemic on children's mental health,"More than 1 billion children are exposed to violence every year. The devastating immediate and long-term impact of violence on the mental health of children is well established. Despite commitments made by the international community to end violence against children and support their mental health, there has been a serious lack of investment and capacity to provide quality, rights-based, culturally appropriate mental health care globally. The arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic has magnified these challenges. This article outlines how the risk of children experiencing violence has increased and how the pandemic has weakened the capacity of child protection and mental health services to respond. The article argues for child protection, mental health and other core services to be prioritized during and after the pandemic. A failure to do so will undermine the international community's ability to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 and to fulfil its obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.",Maalla M'jid,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13034-020-00340-8,20200928.0,COVID-19 pandemic; Child rights; Mental health; Sustainable development goals; Violence against children,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

262,[Immunopsychiatry and SARS-CoV-2Â pandemic: Links and possible consequences],"The SARS-CoV-2 (or COVID-19) pandemic has been propagating since December 2019, inducing a drastic increase in the prevalence of anxious and depressive disorders in the general population. Psychological trauma can partly explain these disorders. However, since psychiatric disorders also have an immuno-inflammatory component, the direct effects of the virus on the host's immune system, with a marked inflammatory response, but also the secondary inflammation to these psychosocial stressors, may cause the apparition or the worsening of psychiatric disorders. We describe here the probable immunopsychiatric consequences of the SARS-CoV-2Â pandemic, to delineate possible screening actions and care that could be planned. Data from previous pandemics, and existing data on the psychopathological consequences of the SARS-CoV-2Â pandemic, allowed us to review the possible immunopsychiatric consequences of the SARS-CoV-2Â pandemic, on the gestational environment, with the risk of consecutive neurodevelopmental disorders for the fetus on one hand, on the children and adults directly infected being at increased risks of psychiatric disorders on the other hand. As in previous pandemics, the activation of the immune system due to psychological stress and/or to infection during pregnancy, might lead to an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders for the fetus (schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders). Furthermore, in individuals exposed to psychological trauma and/or infected by the virus, the risk of psychiatric disorders, especially mood disorders, is probably increased. In this context, preventive measures and specialized care are necessary. Thus, it is important to propose a close follow-up to the individuals who have been infected by the virus, in order to set up the earliest care possible. Likewise, in pregnant women, screening of mood disorders during the pregnancy or the postpartum period must be facilitated. The follow-up of the babies born during the pandemic must be strengthened to screen and care for possible neurodevelopmental disorders.","Daaboul, Tamouza, Leboyer",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.07.002,20201001.0,Autism spectrum disorders; Immunopsychiatrie; Immunopsychiatry; Mood disorders; SARS-CoV-2; Schizophrenia; SchizophrÃ©nie; Troubles de lâ€™humeur; Troubles du spectre de lâ€™autisme,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
263,Self-Reported Compliance With Personal Preventive Measures Among Chinese Factory Workers at the Beginning of Work Resumption Following the COVID-19 Outbreak: Cross-Sectional Survey Study,"Maintaining compliance with personal preventive measures is important to achieve a balance of COVID-19 pandemic control and work resumption. The aim of this study was to investigate self-reported compliance with four personal measures to prevent COVID-19 among a sample of factory workers in Shenzhen, China, at the beginning of work resumption in China following the COVID-19 outbreak. These preventive measures included consistent wearing of face masks in public spaces (the workplace and other public settings); sanitizing hands using soap, liquid soap, or alcohol-based hand sanitizer after returning from public spaces or touching public installations and equipment; avoiding social and meal gatherings; and avoiding crowded places. The participants were adult factory workers who had resumed work in Shenzhen, China. A stratified two-stage cluster sampling design was used. We randomly selected 14 factories that had resumed work. All full-time employees aged â‰¥18 years who had resumed work in these factories were invited to complete a web-based survey. Out of 4158 workers who had resumed work in these factories, 3035 (73.0%) completed the web-based survey from March 1 to 14, 2020. Multilevel logistic regression models were fitted. Among the 3035 participants, 2938 (96.8%) and 2996 (98.7%) reported always wearing a face mask in the workplace and in other public settings, respectively, in the past month. However, frequencies of self-reported sanitizing hands (2152/3035, 70.9%), avoiding social and meal gatherings (2225/3035, 73.3%), and avoiding crowded places (1997/3035, 65.8%) were relatively low. At the individual level, knowledge about COVID-19 (adjusted odds ratios [AORs] from 1.16, CI 1.10-1.24, to 1.29, CI 1.21-1.37), perceived risk (AORs from 0.58, CI 0.50-0.68, to 0.85, CI 0.72-0.99) and severity (AOR 1.05, CI 1.01-1.09, and AOR 1.07, CI 1.03-1.11) of COVID-19, perceived effectiveness of preventive measures by the individual (AORs from 1.05, CI 1.00-1.10, to 1.09, CI 1.04-1.13), organization (AOR 1.30, CI 1.20-1.41), and government (AORs from 1.14, CI 1.04-1.25, to 1.21, CI 1.02-1.42), perceived preparedness for a potential outbreak after work resumption (AORs from 1.10, CI 1.00-1.21, to 1.50, CI 1.36-1.64), and depressive symptoms (AORs from 0.93, CI 0.91-0.94, to 0.96, CI 0.92-0.99) were associated with self-reported compliance with at least one personal preventive measure. At the interpersonal level, exposure to COVID-19-specific information through official media channels (AOR 1.08, CI 1.04-1.11) and face-to-face communication (AOR 0.90, CI 0.83-0.98) were associated with self-reported sanitizing of hands. The number of preventive measures implemented in the workplace was positively associated with self-reported compliance with all four preventive measures (AORs from 1.30, CI 1.08-1.57, to 1.63, CI 1.45-1.84).

264,A rapid review investigating the potential impact of a pandemic on the mental health of young people aged 12-25 years,"In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a pandemic. Adolescence and early adulthood are peak times for the onset of mental health difficulties. Exposure to a pandemic during this vulnerable developmental period places young people at significant risk of negative psychological experiences. The objective of this research was to summarise existing evidence on the potential impact of a pandemic on the mental health of 12-25 year olds. A rapid review of the published peer-reviewed literature, published between 1985 and 2020, using PsycINFO (Proquest) and Medline (Proquest) was conducted. Narrative synthesis was used across studies to identify key themes and concepts. This review found 3,359 papers, which was reduced to 12 papers for data extraction. Results regarding the prevalence of psychological difficulties in youth were mixed, with some studies finding this group experience heightened distress during an infectious disease outbreak, and others finding no age differences or higher distress among adults. Gender, coping, self-reported physical health and adoption of precautionary measures appear to play a role in moderating the psychological impact of an infectious disease outbreak. Most studies were conducted after the peak of an epidemic/pandemic or in the recovery period. More longitudinal research with young people, particularly adolescents in the general population, before and during the early stages of an infectious disease outbreak is needed to obtain a clear understanding of how best to support young people during these events.","O'Reilly, Tibbs, Booth, Doyle, McKeague, Moore",https://doi.org/10.1017/ipm.2020.106,20201207.0,COVID-19; Coronavirus; epidemic; infectious disease outbreak; pandemic; rapid review; youth mental health,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

This research aimed to explore the effect of adverse childhood experience (ACE) on suicide ideation in young cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Self-reported questionnaires analyzed the mediating effects of sleep quality, anxiety symptoms, and inflammatory conditions between ACE and suicide ideation. A total of 197 young cancer patients (age 18-40) completed questionnaires and a blood test. Correlation analysis and structural equation model were used to explore the relationships between ACE, sleep quality, anxiety symptom, serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and suicide ideation. The mediating roles of sleep quality, anxiety symptoms, and CRP levels on the influence of ACE on suicide ideation were explored. ACE was positively related to anxiety symptoms, CRP levels, and suicide ideation, and negatively related to sleep quality. Anxiety symptoms and CRP levels were positively related to suicide ideation, while sleep quality was negatively related to suicide ideation. Anxiety symptoms were positively related to CRP levels but negatively related to sleep quality. From these results, we found ACE affected suicide ideation directly and was mediated by roles sleep quality, anxiety symptom and CRP. ACE not only directly affected suicide ideation but also affected suicide ideation through sleep quality, anxiety symptoms, and inflammatory conditions in young cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, targeted intervention and help for cancer patients from the perspective of ACE should be put into practice.","Yang, Xiao, Li, Yang",https://doi.org/10.2147/RMHP.S266269,20200928.0,adverse childhood experience; anxiety symptom; coronavirus disease 2019; psychosocial oncology; sleep quality; suicide ideation,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

268,Evaluating the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic: perceived risk of COVID-19 infection and childhood trauma predict adult depressive symptoms in urban South Africa,"South Africa's national lockdown introduced serious threats to public mental health in a society where one in three individuals develops a psychiatric disorder during their life. We aimed to evaluate the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic using a mixed-methods design. This longitudinal study drew from a preexisting sample of 957 adults living in Soweto, a major township near Johannesburg. Psychological assessments were administered across two waves between August 2019 and March 2020 and during the first 6 weeks of the lockdown (late March-early May 2020). Interviews on COVID-19 experiences were administered in the second wave. Multiple regression models examined relationships between perceived COVID-19 risk and depression. Full data on perceived COVID-19 risk, depression, and covariates were available in 221 adults. In total, 14.5% of adults were at risk for depression. Higher perceived COVID-19 risk predicted greater depressive symptoms (p &lt; 0.001), particularly among adults with histories of childhood trauma, though this effect was marginally significant (p = 0.063). Adults were about two times more likely to experience significant depressive symptoms for every one unit increase in perceived COVID-19 risk (p = 0.021; 95% CI 1.10-3.39). Qualitative data identified potent experiences of anxiety, financial insecurity, fear of infection, and rumination. Higher perceived risk of COVID-19 infection is associated with greater depressive symptoms during the first 6 weeks of quarantine. High rates of severe mental illness and low availability of mental healthcare amidst COVID-19 emphasize the need for immediate and accessible psychological resources.","Kim, Nyengerai, Mendenhall",https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291720003414,20201001.0,COVID-19; South Africa; childhood trauma; depression; risk perception,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
269,Evaluation of anxiety and depression in patients with morphea taking immunosuppressive drugs during the COVID-19 pandemic,"During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, individuals especially those with chronic diseases face various problems like psychological distress. To evaluate anxiety and depression among morphea patients taking immunosuppressants compared with controls during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this case-control study, electronic data of 42 eligible morphea patients and 42 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects were extracted. All participants were asked about adherence to the health protocols and the symptoms of COVID-19. To investigate anxiety and depression, we provided the participants with an online version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) Questionnaire. In this standard questionnaire, a score â‰¥ 11 represents a significant psychological disorder. The two groups did not differ significantly in the mean HADS-Anxiety (HADS-A) and HADS-Depression (HADS-D) scores (<i>p</i>=Â .08 and <i>p</i>=Â .79, respectively). HADS-A and HADS-D scores were â‰¥ 11 in 16.67% and 11.90% of the patients, respectively. Among the morphea patients, those with sleeping problems during COVID-19 had a significantly higher mean HADS-D score (<i>p</i>=Â .048). Notably, 21.43% of patients discontinued their treatment due to fear of COVID-19 and experienced disease recurrence. Adherence to health protocols was higher in patients compared with controls. The rate of COVID-19 occurrence was not significantly different between the groups. Although there was no significant difference in anxiety and depression between the groups, it is recommended to provide psychiatric counseling opportunities to morphea patients to improve treatment outcomes during this pandemic.","Shahidi Dadras, Ahmadzadeh, Younespour, Abdollahimajd",https://doi.org/10.1080/09546634.2020.1819528,20201001.0,Anxiety; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; coronavirus disease 2019; depression; immunosuppressive treatment,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
270,"&quot;It's about how much we can do, and not how little we can get away with&quot;: Coronavirus-related legislative changes for social care in the United Kingdom","The coronavirus pandemic, referred to here as Covid-19, has brought into sharp focus the increasing divergence of devolved legislation and its implementation in the United Kingdom. One such instance is the emergency health and social care legislation and guidance introduced by the United Kingdom Central Government and the devolved Governments of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland in response to this pandemic. We provide a summary, comparison and discussion of these proposed and actual changes with a particular focus on the impact on adult social care and safeguarding of the rights of citizens. To begin, a summary and comparison of the relevant changes, or potential changes, to mental health, mental capacity and adult social care law across the four jurisdictions is provided. Next, we critique the suggested and actual changes and in so doing consider the immediate and longer term implications for adult social care, including mental health and mental capacity, at the time of publication.several core themes emerged: concerns around process and scrutiny; concerns about possible changes to the workforce and last, the possible threat on the ability to safeguard human rights. It has been shown that, ordinarily, legislative provisions across the jurisdictions of the UK are different, save for Wales (which shares most of its mental health law provisions with England). Such divergence is also mirrored in the way in which the suggested emergency changes could be implemented. Aside from this, there is also a wider concern about a lack of parity of esteem between social care and health care, a concern which is common to all. What is interesting is that the introduction of CVA 2020 forced a comparison to be made between the four UK nations which also shines a spotlight on how citizens can anticipate receipt of services.","Vicary, Stone, McCusker, Davidson, Spencer-Lane",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijlp.2020.101601,20201021.0,"Adult social care; Coronavirus act (Scotland) 2020; Coronavirus act 2020; Covid-19; Law; Mental capacity; Mental health; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; Commitment of Mentally Ill; Coronavirus Infections; Health Care Reform; Humans; Legislation, Medical; Mental Competency; Mental Disorders; Mental Health Services; Northern Ireland; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; SARS-CoV-2; United Kingdom",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
271,Mental health in the era of COVID-19: prevalence of psychiatric disorders in a cohort of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes during the social distancing,"In patients with diabetes, the prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms is about two to four times greater than in the general population. The association between diabetes and mental health disorders could be exacerbated in a stressful environment, and psychological distress could increase depressive symptoms and cause adverse diabetes outcomes. To assess the prevalence of mental health disorders in patients with diabetes during the social distancing period due to COVID-19 pandemic. This is a cross-sectional study developed to assess the impact of social distancing on a cohort of adults with type 1 (nâ€‰=â€‰52) and type 2 diabetes (nâ€‰=â€‰68) in Brazil. Inclusion criteria involved having an HbA1c test collected in the past 3Â months and having a valid telephone number in electronic medical records. The primary outcome was the prevalence of minor psychiatric disorders, assessed by survey (SRQ-20). Secondary outcomes included the prevalence of diabetes related emotional distress, eating and sleeping disorders, all assessed by validated surveys at the moment of the study. Statistical analyses included unpaired <i>t</i>-test for continuous variables and <i>Ï‡</i><sup>2</sup> test for categorical variables. Overall (nâ€‰=â€‰120), participants had a mean age of 54.8â€‰Â±â€‰14.4Â years-old, and HbA1c of 9.0â€‰Â±â€‰1.6% (75â€‰Â±â€‰17.5Â mmol/mol); 93% of patients showed signs of current mental suffering based on the surveys measured. Almost 43% of patients showed evidence of significant psychological distress, with a significant greater tendency in patients with type 2 diabetes. The presence of diabetes related emotional distress was found in 29.2% of patients; eating disorders in 75.8%; and moderate/severe sleeping disorders in 77.5%. We found a high prevalence of evidence of psychological distress among patients with diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic and this highlights the need for mental health access and support for patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.","Alessi, de Oliveira, Franco, Brino do Amaral, Becker, Knijnik, Kobe, de Carvalho, Telo, Schaan, Telo",https://doi.org/10.1186/s13098-020-00584-6,20200928.0,COVID-19 pandemic; Diabetes mellitus; Mental health; Quarantine; Social distancing,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

We used the depression-anxiety-stress scale and self-designed questionnaire on professional pride, intention to work in the front-line and the extent of family support. Medical students from 4 medical schools in Fujian and Hunan were investigated. Their mental health status, professional pride and first-line work willingness with different characteristics were compared, and the influential factors for professional pride and first-line work willingness were analyzed. A total of 266 valid questionnaires were collected. During the pandemic, there were significant differences in the proportion of depressed students among different college and universities, majors and stages (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05), and the professional pride was significantly different (<i>P</i>&lt;0.001). Medical students with different mental health status showed significant differences in professional pride (<i>P</i>&lt;0.01). Marriage, pressure and extent of family support were the influential factors for their professional pride (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05). The latter two were also influential factors for their intention to work in the front-line (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05). During the pandemic, students from college and nursing have relatively better mental health and higher professional pride. The professional pride is low in medical students who married, with abnormal stress or low family support. The intention to work in front-line is decreased in students with abnormal stress or low family support. <b>ç›®çš„</b>: äº†è§£2019å† çŠ¶ç—…æ¯’ç—…å¤§æµè¡ŒæœŸé—´åŒ»å­¦ç”Ÿçš„å¿ƒç†å¥åº·ã€èŒä¸šè‡ªè±ªæ„Ÿä¸Žä¸€çº¿å·¥ä½œæ„æ„¿ï¼Œä¸ºè¿›è¡Œå¿ƒç†å¹²é¢„æä¾›å‚è€ƒã€‚<b>æ–¹æ³•</b>: é‡‡ç”¨æŠ‘éƒ-ç„¦è™‘-åŽ‹åŠ›é‡è¡¨å’Œè‡ªè¡Œè®¾è®¡çš„å…³äºŽèŒä¸šè‡ªè±ªæ„Ÿã€ä¸€çº¿å·¥ä½œæ„æ„¿å’Œå®¶äººæ”¯æŒç¨‹åº¦çš„è°ƒæŸ¥é—®å·ï¼Œé€šè¿‡é—®å·æ˜Ÿå¹³å°å¯¹ç¦å»ºã€æ¹–å—4æ‰€åŒ»å­¦é™¢æ ¡çš„åŒ»å­¦ç”Ÿè¿›è¡Œè°ƒæŸ¥ï¼Œæ¯”è¾ƒä¸åŒç‰¹å¾çš„åŒ»å­¦ç”Ÿçš„å¿ƒç†å¥åº·çŠ¶å†µã€èŒä¸šè‡ªè±ªæ„Ÿå’Œä¸€çº¿å·¥ä½œæ„æ„¿ï¼Œå¹¶åˆ†æžèŒä¸šè‡ªè±ªæ„Ÿä¸Žä¸€çº¿å·¥ä½œæ„æ„¿çš„å½±å“å› ç´ ã€‚<b>ç»“æžœ</b>: å›žæ”¶æœ‰æ•ˆé—®å·266ä»½ã€‚ç–«æƒ…æœŸé—´ä¸åŒé™¢æ ¡ã€ä¸“ä¸šã€é˜¶æ®µåŒ»å­¦ç”Ÿå‘ç”ŸæŠ‘éƒçš„æ¯”ä¾‹å’ŒèŒä¸šè‡ªè±ªæ„Ÿå·®å¼‚æœ‰ç»Ÿè®¡å­¦æ„ä¹‰(åˆ†åˆ«<i>P</i>&lt;0.05ï¼Œ<i>P</i>&lt;0.001)ï¼Œä¸åŒå¿ƒç†å¥åº·çŠ¶å†µçš„åŒ»å­¦ç”ŸèŒä¸šè‡ªè±ªæ„Ÿå·®å¼‚æœ‰ç»Ÿè®¡å­¦æ„ä¹‰(<i>P</i>&lt;0.01)ï¼Œå©šå§»ã€åŽ‹åŠ›ã€å®¶äººæ”¯æŒç¨‹åº¦æ˜¯åŒ»å­¦ç”ŸèŒä¸šè‡ªè±ªæ„Ÿçš„å½±å“å› ç´ (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05)ï¼ŒåŽä¸¤è€…ä¹Ÿæ˜¯åŒ»å­¦ç”Ÿä¸€çº¿å·¥ä½œæ„æ„¿çš„å½±å“å› ç´ (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05)ã€‚<b>ç»“è®º</b>: ç–«æƒ…æœŸé—´å¤§ä¸“é™¢æ ¡ã€æŠ¤ç†ä¸“ä¸šåŒ»å­¦ç”Ÿå¿ƒç†å¥åº·çŠ¶å†µè¾ƒå¥½ï¼ŒèŒä¸šè‡ªè±ªæ„Ÿè¾ƒé«˜ï¼Œå·²å©šã€åŽ‹åŠ›å¼‚å¸¸ã€å®¶äººæ”¯æŒç¨‹åº¦ä½Žçš„åŒ»å­¦ç”ŸèŒä¸šè‡ªè±ªæ„Ÿè¾ƒä½Žï¼ŒåŽ‹åŠ›å¼‚å¸¸ã€å®¶äººæ”¯æŒç¨‹åº¦ä½Žçš„åŒ»å­¦ç”Ÿä¸€çº¿å·¥ä½œæ„æ„¿ä¸‹é™ã€‚.","Zhan, Sun, Xie, Wen, Fu",https://doi.org/10.11817/j.issn.1672-7347.2020.200440,20200908.0,"coronavirus disease 2019; intention to work in front-line; medical students; mental health; professional pride; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; China; Coronavirus Infections; Family; Humans; Intention; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Professionalism; SARS-CoV-2; Social Support; Stress, Psychological; Students, Medical; Surveys and Questionnaires",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

Using star platform of questionnaire, the staff in the general hospital were investigated via Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS-21), Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS) and Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ). The influential factors were discussed by descriptive analysis, rank sum test, single factor analysis, correlation analysis and multiple factors binary logistic regression analysis. A total of 2 060 valid questionnaires were collected. The negative emotions of nurses and cleaners were the most obvious. The depression scores, anxiety scores and stress scores for nurses and cleaners were 5.06Â±7.47, 6.36Â±7.84, 9.75Â±8.65, and 6.72Â±8.84, 4.51Â±6.56, 9.69Â±9.56, respectively. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis showed that staff types, education levels, job status, economic situation and concerns on the supplies of protective goods were the main influential factors for depression; staff types, contacting status with infected patients, economic situation, concerns on the supplies of protective goods, history of disease were the main influential factors for anxiety; contacting status with infected patients, economic situation, concerns on the supplies of protective goods were the main influential factors for stress. There are differences in psychological characteristics among different groups of staff in the general hospital under the outbreak.

A view from psychiatry,"Some authors have suggested that the emergence of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, and the subsequent pandemic has meant that the constructs of pathological anxiety and depression are meaningless owing to widespread anxiety and depressive symptoms. This paper examines what is required to make a diagnosis of a depressive or anxiety disorder and how this may differ from fleeting symptomatology in response to specific situations or stimuli. All people experience the emotions of both anxiety and depression, but far fewer have a persistent anxiety or depressive syndrome which interferes with their quality of life and functioning. The pandemic and its issues are then discussed, and existing studies examining the reactions of people living through the pandemic are presented.

As a result of the rapid increase in confirmed cases and deaths, population and health personnel, have experienced psychological problems, such as anxiety, depression, and stress. Although scientific information on COVID-19 is constantly increasing, it mainly focuses on genetic, epidemiological aspects, and public health measures, leaving aside possible effects on mental health. In order to summarize the current evidence, we present a narrative review of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. So far, the presence of anxiety, depression, and stress has been reported mostly in general population. Nonetheless, mental health issues have also been reported in health care workers, especially among female professionals, nurses, and those who work directly with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19. In efforts to reduce the spread of the disease, attention should be paid to the diagnosis and treatment of mental health issues.

277,Rapid response to crisis: Health system lessons from the active period of COVID-19,"This paper outlines the need for a health systems approach and rapid response strategy for gathering information necessary for policy decisions during pandemics and similar crises. It suggests a new framework for assessing the phases of the pandemic. The paper draws its information and conclusions from a rapid synthesis and translation process (RSTP) of a series of webinars and online discussions from the Pandemic-Mental Health International Network (Pan-MHIN) - policy experts from across 16 locations in Australia, Denmark, Italy, Spain, Taiwan, the UK and the USA. While the initial focus of this research was on mental health, COVID-19 has raised much broader issues and questions for health planners. We identified gaps affecting the capacity to respond effectively and quickly, including in relation to system indicators, the inadequacy of the prior classification of the phases of the pandemic, the absences of a healthcare ecosystem approach, and the quick shift to digital technologies. The strengths and weaknesses of COVID-19 responses across different systems, services, sites and countries been identified and compared, including both low and high impacted areas. There is an urgent need for managerial epidemiology based on healthcare ecosystem research encompassing multidisciplinary teams, visualization tools and decision analytics for rapid response. Policy and healthcare context played a key role in the response to COVID-19. Its severity, the containment measures and the societal response varied greatly across sites and countries. Understanding this variation is vital to assess the impact of COVID-19 in specific areas such as ageing or mental health.","Salvador-Carulla, Rosenberg, Mendoza, Tabatabaei-Jafari",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hlpt.2020.08.011,20210110.0,COVID-19; Health planning; Health systems research; Information systems,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
278,COVID-19 Racism and Mental Health in Chinese American Families,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has fueled xenophobia against Chinese Americans. We examined the rates of 6 types of COVID-19 racism and racial discrimination experienced by Chinese American parents and youth and the associations with their mental health. We recruited a population-based sample of Chinese American families to participate in this self-reported survey study conducted from March 14, 2020, to May 31, 2020. Eligible parent participants identified as ethnically/racially Chinese, lived in the United States, and had a 4- to 18-year-old child; their eligible children were 10 to 18 years old. The sample included 543 Chinese American parents (mean [SD] age, 43.44 [6.47] years; 425 mothers [78.3%]), and their children (<i>N</i> = 230; mean [SD] age, 13.83 [2.53] years; 111 girls [48.3%]). Nearly half of parents and youth reported being directly targeted by COVID-19 racial discrimination online (parents: 172 [31.7%]; youth: 105 [45.7%]) and/or in person (parents: 276 [50.9%]; youth: 115 [50.2%]). A total of 417 (76.8%) parents and 176 (76.5%) youth reported at least 1 incident of COVID-19 vicarious racial discrimination online and/or in person (parents: 481 [88.5%]; youth: 211 [91.9%]).

The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Peritraumatic Dissociative Experience Questionnaire were used. Factors independently associated with reported symptoms of mental health disorders were identified.<b>Measurements and Main Results:</b> The response rate was 67%, with 1,058 respondents (median age 33 yr; 71% women; 68% nursing staff). The prevalence of symptoms of anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic dissociation was 50.4%, 30.4%, and 32%, respectively, with the highest rates in nurses. By multivariable analysis, male sex was independently associated with lower prevalence of symptoms of anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic dissociation (odds ratio of 0.58 [95% confidence interval, 0.42-0.79], 0.57 [95% confidence interval, 0.39-0.82], and 0.49 [95% confidence interval, 0.34-0.72], respectively). HCPs working in non-university-affiliated hospitals and nursing assistants were at high risk of symptoms of anxiety and peritraumatic dissociation. Importantly, we identified the following six modifiable determinants of symptoms of mental health disorders: fear of being infected, inability to rest, inability to care for family, struggling with difficult emotions, regret about the restrictions in visitation policies, and witnessing hasty end-of-life decisions.<b>Conclusions:</b> HCPs experience high levels of psychological burden during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hospitals, ICU directors, and ICU staff must devise strategies to overcome the modifiable determinants of adverse mental illness symptoms.","Azoulay, Cariou, Bruneel, Demoule, Kouatchet, Reuter, Souppart, Combes, Klouche, Argaud, Barbier, Jourdain, Reignier, Papazian, Guidet, GÃ©ri, Resche-Rigon, Guisset, LabbÃ©, MÃ©garbane, Van Der Meersch, Guitton, Friedman, Pochard, Darmon, Kentish-Barnes",https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.202006-2568OC,20201125.0,"ICU; anxiety; coronavirus; depression; pneumonia; Adult; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; Coronavirus Infections; Critical Care; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Female; France; Health Personnel; Humans; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prevalence; SARS-CoV-2; Stress Disorders, Traumatic; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
281,Psychological distress among health care professionals of the three COVID-19 most affected Regions in Cameroon: Prevalence and associated factors,"The present study aimed to assess the prevalence of symptoms of anxiety and depression among health professionals in the three most affected regions in Cameroon. The study was a descriptive cross-sectional type. Participants were health care professionals working in the three chosen regions of Cameroon. The non_probability convinient sample technique and that of the snowball were valued via a web questionnaire. The non-exhaustive sample size was 292. The diagnosis of anxiety and depression was made by the HAD (Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale). The prevalence of symptoms of anxiety ranging from mild to severe and those of depression were 42.20% and 43.50% respectively. Anxiety symptoms were associated with the age of the participants (<i>P</i>Â =Â 0.006), fear of contamination (<i>P</i>Â =Â 0.019), fear of death (<i>P</i>Â =Â 0.000), and depressive symptoms associated to the fear of death (<i>P</i>Â =Â 0.000). Les auteurs rapportent que le secteur mÃ©dical est classÃ© Ã un plus grand risque de contracter le COVID-19Â et de le propager potentiellement Ã dâ€™autres. Le nombre sans cesse croissant de cas confirmÃ©s et suspects, la pression dans les soins, lâ€™Ã©puisement des Ã©quipements de protection individuelle et le manque de mÃ©dicaments spÃ©cifiques peuvent contribuer Ã un vÃ©cu anxio-dÃ©pressif significatif. La prÃ©sente Ã©tude sâ€™est donnÃ©e pour ambition dâ€™Ã©valuer la prÃ©valence des symptÃ´mes de lâ€™anxiÃ©tÃ© et de la dÃ©pression chez les professionnels de santÃ© dans les trois RÃ©gions les plus concernÃ©es au Cameroun. Le choix des trois RÃ©gions du Cameroun se justifie non seulement par le fait quâ€™elles totalisent 95,8Â % des cas de coronavirus au pays depuis le dÃ©but de la pandÃ©mie, mais aussi parce quâ€™elles disposent de plus de la moitiÃ© des personnels de santÃ© (56Â %). Il sâ€™agit dâ€™une Ã©tude transversale, descriptive et analytique. Les participants sont des professionnels de la santÃ© en service dans les RÃ©gions du Centre, Littoral et de lâ€™Ouest du Cameroun. La mÃ©thode dâ€™Ã©chantillonnage non probabiliste de convenance couplÃ©e Ã celle de boule de neige via un web questionnaire a Ã©tÃ© adoptÃ©e.

Ã€ la fin de cette pÃ©riode, la taille de lâ€™Ã©chantillon non exhaustive Ã©tait de 292Â professionnels. Le diagnostic de lâ€™Ã©tat anxio-dÃ©pressive Ã©tait posÃ© via lâ€™Ã©chelle de HAD (Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale). Dans le HAD, chaque rÃ©ponse cotÃ©e Ã©value de maniÃ¨re semi-quantitative lâ€™intensitÃ© du symptÃ´me au cours de la semaine Ã©coulÃ©e. Un score total est obtenu ainsi que des scores aux deux sous-Ã©chellesÂ : le score maximal est de 42Â pour lâ€™Ã©chelle globale et de 21Â pour chacune des sous-Ã©chelles. Le coefficient alpha de Cronbach est de 0,70Â pour la dÃ©pression et de 0,74Â pour lâ€™anxiÃ©tÃ©.

A total of 857 LGB people in Hong Kong participated in a community-based survey study. Over one-fourth of them met the criteria for probable clinical depression (31.5%) and generalized anxiety disorder (27.9%). Besides general stressors, we identified sexual minority-specific stressors during the pandemic. 4.2% of the participants indicated that they had frequently experienced family conflict related to sexual orientation. One-third responded that they had largely reduced connection to the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender plus (LGBT+) community (34.7%). The results showed that sexual minority-specific COVID-19-related stressors explained significant variance in depressive and anxiety symptoms, above and beyond the contribution of general COVID-19-related stressors. Since LGB people are particularly vulnerable to poor mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, LGB people-targeting organizations need to understand more about family, space, and privacy concerns in order to provide better support, and LGB safe spaces and shelters may be needed as a policy response.","Suen, Chan, Wong",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113365,20201013.0,"COVID-19; Hong Kong; anxiety; depression; sexual minorities; Adult; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; Bisexuality; COVID-19; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Homosexuality, Female; Homosexuality, Male; Hong Kong; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Psychological Distress; SARS-CoV-2; Sexual Behavior; Sexual and Gender Minorities; Social Stigma; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
283,Sleep quality and mental health in the context of COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown in Morocco,"The lockdown of COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) is associated with several stressful factors that can negatively affect peoples' sleep quality and mental health. We conducted this study to evaluate sleep disorders and psychological impact associated with the spread of the COVID-19 and the lockdown on the Moroccan population. We also aimed to study the effects of respondents' beliefs and attitudes about sleep on sleep disorders, anxiety-related symptoms, and depressive symptoms. We used a questionnaire enclosing respondents' sociodemographic information, five psychological and behavioral tests including Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep (DBAS-16), Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) test. Our results highlighted widespread false beliefs about sleep and the prevalence of sleep disorders, anxiety, and depression-related symptoms within the Moroccan population. Nearly 82.3% of respondents revealed false beliefs about sleep. Furthermore, we confirmed a strong positive correlation between knowledge and attitudes about sleep and the prevalence of sleep disorders, anxiety, and depression-related symptoms. However, we found no significant difference in the prevalence of sleep and psychological disorders, between healthcare workers and other professions workers. Our study revealed a high prevalence of sleep disorders, anxiety, and depressive symptoms in the Moroccan population during the COVID-19 lockdown period. Moreover, false beliefs on sleep understanding were prevalent and were presenting a risk factor leading to sleep disorders, anxiety, and depressive symptoms.","Janati Idrissi, Lamkaddem, Benouajjit, Ben El Bouaazzaoui, El Houari, Alami, Labyad, Chahidi, Benjelloun, Rabhi, Kissani, Zarhbouch, Ouazzani, Kadiri, Alouane, Elbiaze, Boujraf, El Fakir, Souirti",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2020.07.045,20201016.0,"Anxiety; COVID-19; Depressive symptoms; Insomnia; Mental health; Morocco; Sleep knowledge; Sleep quality; Adult; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Morocco; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; SARS-CoV-2; Sleep Wake Disorders; Social Isolation; Surveys and Questionnaires",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

This is particularly disconcerting regarding children and adolescents, who rely on the ability to play to meet developmental milestones and who require more exercise than adults. Youth populations have been significantly disrupted by school closures and home confinement and are in developmental periods that overlap with the emergence of serious mental illness. Therefore, it is important to consider the mental health consequences for youths, and also explore ways to combat sedentary activity for this vulnerable population.","Mittal, Firth, Kimhy",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaac.2020.08.003,20201119.0,"Adolescent; COVID-19; Child; Coronavirus Infections; Exercise; Humans; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Sedentary Behavior",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

286,Is the psychological impact of exposure to COVID-19 stronger in adolescents with pre-pandemic maltreatment experiences? A survey of rural Chinese adolescents,"Since the COVID-19 outbreak at the end of 2019, it has evolved into a global pandemic with tremendous mental health impact besides the threats to people's physical health. The aims were to examine whether exposure to COVID-19 predicts elevated levels of anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms and whether pre-pandemic maltreatment experiences exacerbate this impact on mental health in adolescents. The survey was conducted online from February 8 st to February 27th, 2020, and the questionnaires were distributed and retrieved through a web-based platform. This study includes a total of 6196 subjects, aged range from 11 to 18 years old. Several multivariable linear regressions were used to analyse the data. The largest variance in PTSS and anxiety problems was explained by ACEs, with more pre-pandemic maltreatment experiences predicting more PTSS (effect size beta = 0.16âˆ¼0.27), and more anxiety (effect size beta = 0.32âˆ¼0.47). Experienced or subjective fear of exposure to COVID-19 predicted statistically significant variance in PTSS and anxiety, and standardized betas ranged from 0.04 to 0.09. Participants who had adverse childhood experiences and had experienced exposure to COVID-19 showed elevated PTSS. After pre-pandemic maltreatment experiences the impact of exposure to COVID-19 on mental health may be stronger. Scars from the past seem to be vulnerabilities during societal upheaval. We therefore suggest that when exposed to COVID-19 rural adolescents should get prioritized professional family support and mental health counseling in particular when they have experienced family abuse and neglect in childhood, even though such support is more difficult to organize in rural areas.","Guo, Fu, Liu, Zhang, Wang, van IJzendoorn",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2020.104667,20210111.0,"ACEs; Adolescents; Anxiety; Covid-19; Maltreatment; PTSS; Adolescent; Adverse Childhood Experiences; Anxiety; COVID-19; Child; Child Abuse; China; Female; Humans; Linear Models; Male; Pandemics; Psychology, Adolescent; Rural Population; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Surveys and Questionnaires",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

The central nervous system, endocrine system, and immune system are complex interacting systems. Cortisol has been implicated as the cause of a wide range of mental and physical health disorders; however, the impact of cortisol on outcomes in patients with COVID-19 is not clear. The current study enrolled patients with COVID-19 (onset of disease within 7 days of the first symptom) to evaluate the serum concentration of cortisol and levels of anxiety and depression using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to investigate a possible relationship between cortisol, depression, and anxiety levels and outcomes of patients with COVID-19. A total of 30 patients with COVID-19 were studied. The levels of cortisol and HADS score in patients who died of Covid-19 were significantly higher in comparison with surviving patients (P&lt;0.017 and P&lt;0.001 respectively). We also found that the HADS score was positively correlated with serum cortisol levels (r= 0.842, P=0.004). Our findings showed that stress and anxiety are associated with patients' outcomes.

288,"Stress, Anxiety, and Depression Levels Among Healthcare Staff During the COVID-19 Epidemic","In the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, medical staff Are in direct contact with the patients and experience high work pressure. Direct contact with the patients could create some psychological problems in this group. Thus, the prevalence of such problems must be investigated in them. The present study aimed to determine the level of stress, anxiety, and depression among the healthcare staff in Zanjan City, Iran, during the COVID-19 epidemic. This descriptive study has a cross-sectional design. The Sample of the study population consisted of 535 Staff healthcare members of Vali-e-Asr Hospital in Zanjan City, Iran. A sample of 200 of medical staff was randomly selected to participate in the present study. The required data were collected using the electronic version of Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS) tool. Descriptive statistics, as well as the inferential statistics (the Pearson correlation coefficient, Spearman correlation coefficient, Phi, and Cramer's correlation tests), were used to analyze the obtained data in SPSS. The mean age of the study participants was 40.60 years. The mean values of depression, anxiety, and stress in study samples were 6.27, 5.38, and 8.41, respectively. There was a significant relation between gender and variables of depression, anxiety, and stress. There was also an inverse relationship between stress and variables of educational level and age (P&lt;0/05). We found that our sample reported a normal degree of Depression, anxiety, and stress.

289,Hâ€³ITâ€³ting the Barriers for Exercising during Social Isolation,"Aerobic exercise is traditionally recommended to improve general health and prevent many non-communicable diseases. However, the measures adopted to control the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak culminated with closing of exercise facilities and fitness centers and, as a primary consequence, impaired aerobic exercise practice. This contributed to an increase in risk factors associated with physical inactivity such as insulin resistance, high blood pressure, low-grade inflammation, weight gain, and mental health problems. The scenario is worrisome, and it is important to propose alternatives for exercise practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interval training (IT) emerges as an exercise mode that might be feasible, low-cost, and potentially safe to be performed in many different places. IT consists of interspersing relative brief bouts of high-intensity exercise with recovery periods and promotes similar or greater health benefits when compared to moderate-intensity continuous exercise. Among the different types of IT, sprint interval training and &quot;Tabata protocols&quot; might be particularly useful during social isolation. These protocols can be controlled and performed without the need of complex equipment and can be adapted to different places, including domestic environments. In this article, we present variations of IT as possible alternatives to cope physical inactivity during COVID-19 pandemics with a focus on its practical applications. The protocols suggested can be performed without the need of specialized equipment or facilities, in a time-efficient manner, and aiming to prevent detraining or even improve physical fitness and general health.","Souza, Coswig, de Lira, Gentil",https://doi.org/10.3390/biology9090245,20201027.0,COVID-19; aerobic exercise; calisthenics; high-intensity interval training; immunity; intermittent exercise,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

A quantitative/qualitative cross-sectional survey was used among adults currently enrolled in health-related research (Nâ€‰=â€‰250; 85% women;â€‰&gt;â€‰50% currently enrolled in behavioral weight loss intervention). COVID-19 was perceived as a severe threat by most (62.3%). Related to COVID-19, 29.6% of participants reported moderate/severe symptoms of anxiety/depression, and 68.4% reported moderate/severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology, with women more likely to demonstrate moderate/severe anxiety/depression (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.047) and PTSD symptomatology (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.028) relative to men. Those with moderate/severe levels of anxiety/depression (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0154) and distress (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0330) were more likely to report a decreased desire to participate in research. Among those in behavioral interventions, individuals perceiving COVID-19 as a moderate/severe threat or experiencing moderate/severe depression or PTSD symptomatology were 4 to 19 times more likely to report that COVID-19 affected their ability to adhere to behavioral recommendations. Qualitative analysis identified four themes describing COVID-19's impact on research experiences: transition, remote intervention delivery, ability to adhere to program goals, and research participation interest. These data suggest that participants engaged in health-related research perceive COVID-19 as a significant threat, affecting mental health, desire to participate in research, and ability to adhere to intervention recommendations.","Cardel, Manasse, Krukowski, Ross, Shakour, Miller, Lemas, Hong",https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.23016,20201204.0,"Adult; Anxiety; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Research Subjects; SARS-CoV-2; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

292,[Adaptations of an outpatient Dialectical Behavioral Therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic and consequences of the confinement on patients with borderline personality disorder],"The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the accessibility of psychotherapy for particularly vulnerable patients during the period of confinement in the French-speaking part of Switzerland. We had to adapt our usual therapeutic programs. We illustrate this approach in an outpatient program of dialectical behavioral therapy for patients with borderline personality disorder. Each week the individual therapies took place by videoconference or phone. The skills training group was held individually by videoconference or phone and was supported by an online skills training program. Patients filled out their diary cards online. Intersession contact with the therapist remained available as usual and we could organize team consultation. The aim of this study is to describe how a sample of our patients experienced the period of confinement. We compared the experiences of seven patients suffering from borderline personality disorder during two periods: eight weeks prior to confinement, and during the eight weeks of confinement. We analyzed their daily diary cards (<i>n</i>Â =Â 426) and their weekly frequency of problem behaviors (<i>n</i>Â =Â 69). We performed multilevel analyses to take into account the hierarchical structure of the data and the autocorrelation of observations. The seven patients were predominantly female (85.7Â %) and had an average age of 35.1 (11.5) years. Measurements prior to the start of the pandemic indicated on average severe depression (Beck Depression Inventory, mÂ =Â 30.9 [10.0]) and marked hopelessness (Beck Hopelessness Scale, mÂ =Â 15.0 [5.0]). Analysis of the daily diary cards indicated that the confinement period significantly predicted a decrease in feelings of shame or guilt, fear and tension. At the same time, however, there was an increase in distress. Weekly monitoring of problem behaviors showed a decrease in binge-eating behaviors and a trend towards a decrease in alcohol consumption during confinement. Despite the small number of patients included, two types of repeated measurements indicated convergent results, with some improvements during confinement: a decrease of the feelings of fear, shame or guilt, and tension, and a decrease of the frequency of binge-eating behaviors. The decreased pace of daily social and professional life may explain these improvements. The diminution of the above-mentioned feelings as triggers for addictive and compulsive behaviors may also account for the improvements regarding binge-eating. However, they also experienced an increased distress that may reflect the loneliness experienced during this period. The pre-pandemic development of computerized tools that were already familiar to patients greatly facilitated the necessary adaptations to maintain an intensive therapeutic setting during the confinement.

Disease enforced lockdowns are known to cause heightened levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. Our study aimed to investigate the immediate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic enforced lockdown on mental health and quality of life among general population aged 18Â years and to identify various coping strategies used under lockdown. An online survey was conducted between 1st of April-10th of May, 2020; using a validated questionnaire based on DASS-42, employing a snowball sampling technique. A total of 418 responses from 16 different countries were received. The respondents had a high level of depression and anxiety scores, which were significantly different among genders. Also, participants from developing countries-India and Pakistan had severe depression while as participants from India, Pakistan and Kingdom of Saudi Arabia had severe anxiety. We also found that among the various coping strategies, (a) watching television for entertainment, (b) social networking, (c) listening to music, (d) sleeping, (e) doing mundane house chores like cleaning, washing, etc. (f) eating well, and (g) clearing/finishing thepiled-up work were ranked among the most utilized coping strategies by all participants.

The interview focuses on the impact of remote working during the coronavirus epidemic, starting with the question of whether an effective therapeutic process can occur without physical co-presence. Isaacs Russell shares her immediate thoughts about the virtually overnight changes to our practice that came with the epidemic, and the work of the American Psychoanalytic Association's Covid-19 Advisory Team, on which she sits. Her responses are informed by recent cross-disciplinary and neuropsychological research on the digital age. She considers what happens to free association, evenly suspended attention and reverie when working by phone or online; the loss of the consulting room as a containing physical space for both clinician and patient; the relationship between place and time; and whether (and how) we can maintain a focus on transference and countertransference in the presence of the threat of death. The interview ends with her thoughts on whether we should assume that the landscape of analytic therapy will be permanently altered by Covid-19, and with her hope that general awareness of the impact of trauma on our mental health has been raised.",Isaacs Russell,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjp.12581,20200928.0,COVIDâ€19; PANDEMIC; PRESENCE; PSYCHOANALYSIS; PSYCHOTHERAPY; REMOTE THERAPY; SCREEN RELATIONS; TECHNOLOGY,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
297,"[PSYCOVID-19, psychological support device in the fields of mental health, somatic and medico-social]","In December 2019 the World Health Organization (WHO) recorded the first cases of an infectious disease that appeared in China in November of the same year. Generated by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV2, it is quickly named COVID-19 for COronaVirus Infectious Disease 2019. The spread of this unknown disease will soon have worldwide consequences: the contagiousness of the virus is extremely high and potentially lethal. In France, the population initially reacted with disbelief until the disease reached Europe and the first cases appeared on French territory, at the end of January. A few weeks later, on 16 March 2020, President Macron declared the country &quot;at war&quot; against COVID-19. The next day the population was placed in lockdown. At the present time, the country's activity is at a standstill. Schools, businesses and shops are closed. The French citizens are astounded. They suddenly have to face fear: fear of falling ill or that a close relative may fall ill, fear of being locked up and experiencing restrictions of liberties, fear of economic precariousness. And, above all, fear of uncertainty. In order to prevent the mental consequences of this crisis, psychological support units have been created with urgency at national scale. These units are intended to support the healthcare professionals as well as the patients and more broadly, the general population. The unit responsible for the department of Gironde has been set up quickly, over the weekend of March 21, 2020. The COVIDPSY33 listening unit has thus been created in Bordeaux by the Charles Perrens Hospital with support from the Agence RÃ©gionale de SantÃ© Nouvelle-Aquitaine (ARS). Simultaneously, the PSYCOVID-19 unit was created. This additional unit works in collaboration with the COVIDPSY33 platform and offers psychological assistance to the general population and caregivers in the sectors of Bordeaux Rive Droite, Bordeaux Gare, Rives de Garonne, Rives d'Arcins and Sud Gironde. It thus covers an area equivalent to approximately half of Gironde, the largest department in metropolitan France.

298,"[General sanitary containment during the Coronavirus epidemic: Medico-psychological consequences in general population, caregivers, and subjects suffering previously from mental disorders (Retrospective on the repercussions of lethal mass risks, scientific models of collective confinement, first clinical observations, implementation of countermeasures and innovative therapeutic strategies)]","The situation we are currently experiencing is unprecedented. Declaring a state of health emergency in order to curb a frightening epidemic, the authorities have decreed the home confinement of the majority of the population of our country for several weeks. In a few days, innumerable questions arise for very diverse spaces: epidemiological, immunological, sociological, information scientists, medical, administrative, political, etc. We propose a reflection intended to describe the psychological risks, to clarify the disorders found, and to discuss the means to take care of them in the duration. We base our thinking on a review of the literature confronted with our current clinical experience, including concerning the possibilities of dematerialised medico-psychological monitoring. We recall the collective repercussions of emerging lethal mass risks, and in particular viral infectious agents, before approaching the existing scientific models of collective confinement according to military operations in war zones, polar wintering missions and aerospace conquest. It appears that for the study of a global containment, somewhat studied during previous pandemics, the conceptions of stress reaction and psychodynamic adaptation prove to be relevant. We detail the psychological consequences of confinement on individual mental health and their countermeasures according to three population typologies: general population, population of caregivers on the front line against the epidemic, and population of subjects already suffering from mental illness or seeing their disorders reappear. We also refer to works in social cognitive psychology explaining how, in an anxiety-provoking situation, reasoning can be biased and lead to choices that ultimately prove to be not very rational, in the opinion of those who made them. The current situation in the health sector is favourable in this, as evidenced by the &quot;debate on chloroquine&quot; widely reported in the media and on social networks, opposing conclusions most often decided on the basis of beliefs on contrary to evidence based medicine. The psychological repercussions of confinement appear conditioned by the multiple forms that it can take: voluntary or suffered, more or less prolonged, spent at home or in another place, lived in individual isolation or in a small community, associated other stressors and/or traumatic factors, etc. The home confinement of a population across a country has never been assessed. This experience seems to us to confront our society as a whole with the taboo of death, which is imposed, death more and more evaded as the &quot;Western man&quot; tries to move away from his terrestrial origins. In this sense, psychotraumatic type repercussions are to be prevented. In order to face multiple challenges, the healthcare system has adapted with, in particular, the development of the use of the Internet for the provision of information intended to better experience confinement, or even the generalisation of e-psychotherapy asking as many questions as it provides answers. These intricacies of computer techniques in the area of psychotherapy, techniques with which we had some questioning, became established as quickly as the virus: the task of clinicians and researchers to measure the issues and the consequences. Public health programs could emerge on the model of those already existing in order to manage well-known chronic endemic disorders: protection against the effects of an unbalanced diet associated with a sedentary lifestyle, fight against smoking and alcoholism, prevention of self-aggressive behaviour, etc. We will also need to support the caregivers who have been on the front line and who will emerge tested from this pandemic: depending on the sustainability of the action capacities of our healthcare system to return to its nominal state and also perhaps, so that it can face consequences resulting from other crises, especially social ones.","AuxÃ©mÃ©ry, Tarquinio",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2020.06.001,20200918.0,Confinement; Coronavirus; Epidemiology; Online psychotherapy; Psychopathology; Reaction to stress; Sociopathology,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

Afterward, a questionnaire was developed based on OFGD findings. An online survey was conducted amongst college students in Bangladesh using a purposive sampling technique. Results show that &quot;e-Learning crack-up&quot; perception has a significant positive impact on student's psychological distress, and fear of academic year loss is the crucial factor that is responsible for psychological distress during COVID-19 lockdown. This study can provide an understanding of how &quot;e-Learning crack-up&quot; and &quot;Fear of academic year loss&quot; influence college students' mental health.

The outbreak has been continuing to heavily impact the mental health of people. Developing key strategies to prevent mental illnesses is extremely important for the well-being of people. A survey conducted during the last week of March 2020 showed that 72% of Americans felt that their lives were impacted by the outbreak, which was a 32% increase from the survey conducted only 2Â weeks earlier. The results show a positive correlation between COVID-19 infections/casualties and growing public concern. These observations suggest possible increase in mental health illnesses in United States as a consequence of the pandemic. The authors review a recently published model on COVID-19 related fear among the people. The fear of being infected or dying from the disease is one of the most significant causes of mental health disorders. Loss of employment or the fear of losing employment is another major concern leading to mental illnesses. Several unique strategies to prevent or mitigate mental illnesses are discussed.","Bhattacharjee, Acharya",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11126-020-09836-0,20201105.0,"Anxiety disorder; COVID-19; Mental health; Pandemic; Prevention strategies; Adaptation, Psychological; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; Coronavirus Infections; Employment; Fear; Humans; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; SARS-CoV-2; United States",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

Obstetricians and Gynaecologists reported significantly higher rates of both Major Depressive Disorder (versus, p = 0.023) and Generalised Anxiety Disorder (versus, p = 0.044) as compared to the UK-wide estimates. Sub-group analysis showed that anxiety was more common amongst female doctors as compared to males (versus, p = 0.047). Although the prevalence of GAD was higher amongst registrars compared to their Consultant and/or Senior House Officer counterparts, this was not statistically significant. Respondents felt that the most significant factor for work-related changes to mental health was keeping up to date with frequently changing guidelines and protocols related to COVID-19. Only of respondents felt able to talk to colleagues about their mental health. Key findings include the high prevalence of mental health conditions amongst doctors, demonstration of the persistent taboo that mental health carries within the speciality and the key contributory factors to poor mental health. Further work should be done to assess if changes to the way new and updating guidelines, protocols and pathways are disseminated reduces the impact on the mental health of doctors.

Public protective behaviors and perception play crucial roles in controlling the spread of illness and psychological status. We conducted a cross-sectional online survey in the hardest-hit Hubei province and other areas in China affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. Questions about their basic information, the perception of the COVID-19 outbreak, recent preventive or avoidance behaviors, and self-reported mental health scales including the Patient Health Questionnaire and Self-Rating Anxiety Scale were included. Binary logistic regressions were used to investigate the association between personal variables/perceptions and psychological distress. A total of 6261 people were included in the analysis, with 3613 (57.7%) in Hubei province (1743 in Wuhan). The majority of people have adopted preventive and avoidance behaviors. People from Hubei, with contact history, and people who were infected or whose family members were infected had a much higher prevalence of depression and anxiety. Providing truthful and sufficient information, informing the public about the severity of the disease, and perceptions that the outbreak can be controlled by protective behaviors were associated with lower prevalence of depression and anxiety. Assessing the public response, perception, and psychological burden during the outbreak may help improve public health recommendations and deliver timely psychological intervention. Further research may focus on the psychological status of a specialized group to identify methods of delivery of better support based on public response and psychological demand.","Huang, Liu, Teng, Chen, Zhao, Wang, Wu, Xiao, Wang, Wu",https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa273,20200928.0,COVID-19; anxiety; depression; perceptions; public behavior change,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

Mental health is best ensured by urgently rebuilding the social and economic supports stripped away over the last decade. Governments must pump funds into local authorities to rebuild community services, peer support, mutual aid and local community and voluntary sector organisations.Â Health care organisations must tackle racism and discrimination to ensure genuine equal access to universal health care.Â Government must replace highly conditional benefit systems by something like a universal basic income. All economic and social policies must be subjected to a legally binding mental health audit.Â This may sound unfeasibly expensive, but the social and economic costs, not to mention the costs in personal and community suffering, though often invisible, are far greater.","Rose, Manning, Bentall, Bhui, Burgess, Carr, Cornish, Devakumar, Dowd, Ecks, Faulkner, Ruck Keene, Kirkbride, Knapp, Lovell, Martin, Moncrieff, Parr, Pickersgill, Richardson, Sheard",https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16123.1,20200928.0,BAME; Mental distress; benefit system reform; social disadvantage; universal basic income,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
305,Effect of Common Medications on the Expression of SARS-CoV-2 Entry Receptors in Kidney Tissue,"Besides the respiratory system, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was shown to affect other essential organs such as the kidneys. Early kidney involvement during the course of infection was associated with worse outcomes, which could be attributed to the direct SARS-CoV-2 infection of kidney cells. In this study, the effect of commonly used medications on the expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)2, and TMPRSS2 protein in kidney tissues was evaluated. This was done by in silico analyses of publicly available transcriptomic databases of kidney tissues of rats treated with multiple doses of commonly used medications. Of 59 tested medications, 56% modified ACE2 expression, whereas 24% modified TMPRSS2 expression. ACE2 was increased with only a few of the tested medication groups, namely the renin-angiotensin inhibitors, such as enalapril, antibacterial agents, such as nitrofurantoin, and the proton pump inhibitor, omeprazole. The majority of the other medications decreased ACE2 expression to variable degrees with allopurinol and cisplatin causing the most noticeable downregulation. The expression level of TMPRSS2 was increased with a number of medications, such as diclofenac, furosemide, and dexamethasone, whereas other medications, such as allopurinol, suppressed the expression of this gene. The prolonged exposure to combinations of these medications could regulate the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in a way that may affect kidney susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data presented here suggest that we should be vigilant about the potential effects of commonly used medications on kidney tissue expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2.","Saheb Sharif-Askari, Saheb Sharif-Askari, Alabed, Tayoun, Loney, Uddin, Senok, Al Heialy, Hamoudi, Kashour, Alsheikh-Ali, Hamid, Halwani",https://doi.org/10.1111/cts.12862,20201222.0,"Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2; Animals; COVID-19; Gene Expression Regulation; Kidney; Rats; Receptors, Coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2; Serine Endopeptidases",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

All aspects of training programmes have been affected. Trainees report that reduced caseload, sub-specialty experience, and supervised procedures are impairing learning. Cancelled educational activities, postponed examinations, and altered rotations threaten progression through training. Job prospects and international opportunities are downgraded. Work-related anxieties about provision of personal protective equipment, and risks to self and to colleagues are superimposed on concerns for family and friends and domestic disruption. These seismic changes have had consequences for well-being and mental health. In response, anaesthetists have developed innovations in teaching and trainee support. New technologies support trainer-trainee interactions, with a focus on e-learning. National training bodies and medical regulators that specify training and oversee assessment of trainees and their progression have provided flexibility in their requirements.

307,Prevalence and associated factors of poor sleep quality among Chinese returning workers during the COVID-19 pandemic,"The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is a severe global crisis which has resulted in many public health problems. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of poor sleep quality and its related factors among employees who returned to work during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our online cross-sectional study included 2,410 participants aged â‰¥17 years in Deqing and Taizhou, Zhejiang Province, China from 5th to 14th March 2020. The questionnaire covered information on demographic characteristics, health status, workplace, lifestyle, attitude towards COVID-19, assessment of anxiety, depression and sleep quality. The Chinese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (CPSQI) was administered to measure the poor sleep quality. Poor sleep quality was defined as a global PSQI score&gt;5. Factors associated with sleep quality were analyzed by logistic regression models. In sum near half (49.2%) of 2,410 returning workers were females and the average year of subjects was 36.3Â Â±Â 9.1 years. The overall prevalence of poor sleep quality was 14.9% (95%CI: 13.5%-16.3%). The average score of PSQI was 3.0Â Â±Â 2.5 and average sleep duration was 7.6Â Â±Â 1.2Â h. Independent related factors of poor sleep quality included age older than 24 years, higher education level, negative attitude towards COVID-19 control measures, anxiety and depression. Poor sleep quality was common and there was a shorter sleep duration among returning workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Possible risk factors identified from this study may be of great importance in developing proper intervention for the targeted population to improve the sleep health during the COVID-19 public health emergency.","Yang, Zhu, Yang, Lin, Chen, Zhao, Fu",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2020.06.034,20200925.0,"COVID-19; China; Occupational population; Pittsburgh sleep quality index; Poor sleep quality; Adolescent; Adult; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; China; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prevalence; SARS-CoV-2; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders; Surveys and Questionnaires; Workplace; Young Adult",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
308,COVID-19 lockdown in people with severe mental disorders in Spain: Do they have a specific psychological reaction compared with other mental disorders and healthy controls?,"The COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown restrictions could have adverse consequences for patients with severe mental disorders (SMD). Here, we aim to compare the early psychological impact (depression, anxiety, and stress responses, intrusive and avoidant thoughts, and coping strategies) on people with SMD (nâ€¯=â€¯125) compared with two control groups: common mental disorders (CMD, nâ€¯=â€¯250) and healthy controls (HC, nâ€¯=â€¯250). An anonymous online questionnaire using a snowball sampling method was conducted from March 19-26, 2020 and included sociodemographic and clinical data along with the DASS-21 and IES scales. We performed descriptive and bivariate analyses and multinomial and linear regression models. People with SMD had higher anxiety, stress, and depression responses than HC, but lower scores than CMD in all domains. Most people with SMD (87.2%) were able to enjoy free time, although control groups had higher percentages. After controlling for confounding factors, anxiety was the only significant psychological domain with lower scores in HC than people with SMD (ORâ€¯=â€¯0.721; 95% CI: 0.579-0.898). In the SMD group, higher anxiety was associated with being single (betaâ€¯=â€¯0.144), having COVID-19 symptoms (betaâ€¯=â€¯0.146), and a higher score on the stress subscale of DASS-21 (betaâ€¯=â€¯0.538); whereas being able to enjoy free time was a protective factor (betaâ€¯=â€¯-0.244). Our results showed that patients with SMD reacted to the pandemic and the lockdown restrictions with higher anxiety levels than the general public, and suggesting this domain could be a criterion for early intervention strategies and closer follow-up.","GonzÃ¡lez-Blanco, Dal Santo, GarcÃ­a-Ãlvarez, de la Fuente-TomÃ¡s, Moya Lacasa, Paniagua, SÃ¡iz, GarcÃ­a-Portilla, Bobes",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.schres.2020.07.018,20201211.0,"Anxiety; Bipolar disorder; COVID-19; Pandemics; Psychological distress; Psychosis; Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Anxiety; Anxiety Disorders; Avoidance Learning; Bipolar Disorder; COVID-19; Case-Control Studies; Communicable Disease Control; Depression; Depressive Disorder; Employment; Family; Female; Humans; Income; Linear Models; Male; Marital Status; Mental Disorders; Middle Aged; Protective Factors; Psychological Distress; Psychotic Disorders; Risk Factors; Spain; Stress, Psychological",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
309,Surgical Education in the Time of COVID: Understanding the Early Response of Surgical Training Programs to the Novel Coronavirus Pandemic,"Describe the early impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on general surgery residency training nationwide. A 31-question electronic survey was distributed to general surgery program directors. Qualitative data underwent iterative coding analysis. Quantitative data were evaluated with summary statistics and bivariate analyses. Eighty-four residency programs (33.6% response rate) with representation across US geographic regions, program affiliations, and sizes. Widespread changes were observed in the surgical training environment. One hundred percent of programs reduced the number of residents on rounds and 95.2% reduced the size of their in-hospital resident workforce; on average, daytime staffing decreased by nearly half. With telehealth clinics (90.5%) and remote inpatient consults (26.2%), both clinical care and resident didactics (86.9%) were increasingly virtual, with similar impact across all program demographics. Conversely, availability of some wellness initiatives was significantly higher among university programs than independent programs, including childcare (51.2% vs 6.7%), housing (41.9% vs 13.3%), and virtual mental health services (83.7% vs 53.3%). Changes in clinical care delivery dramatically reduced in face-to-face learning opportunities for surgical trainees during the COVID-19 pandemic. While this effect had equal impact across all program types, sizes, and geographies, the same cannot be said for wellness initiatives. Though all programs initiated some strategies to protect resident health, the disparity between university programs and independent programs may be cause for action.","White, Shaughnessy, Esposito, Slade, Korah, Yoo",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsurg.2020.07.036,20210305.0,"COVID-19; coronavirus; general surgery; graduate medical education; resident wellness; virtual education; COVID-19; Education, Medical, Graduate; General Surgery; Humans; Internship and Residency; Pandemics; Personnel Staffing and Scheduling; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires; United States",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
310,COVID-19 and Parent-Child Psychological Well-being,"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 has changed American society in ways that are difficult to capture in a timely manner. With this study, we take advantage of daily survey data collected before and after the crisis started to investigate the hypothesis that the crisis has worsened parents' and children's psychological well-being. We also examine the extent of crisis-related hardships and evaluate the hypothesis that the accumulation of hardships will be associated with parent and child psychological well-being. Daily survey data were collected between February 20 and April 27, 2020, from hourly service workers with a young child (aged 2-7) in a large US city (<i>N</i> = 8222 person-days from 645 individuals). A subsample completed a one-time survey about the effects of the crisis fielded between March 23 and April 26 (subsample <i>n</i> = 561). Ordered probit models revealed that the frequency of parent-reported daily negative mood increased significantly since the start of the crisis. Many families have experienced hardships during the crisis, including job loss, income loss, caregiving burden, and illness. Both parents' and children's well-being in the postcrisis period was strongly associated with the number of crisis-related hardships that the family experienced. Consistent with our hypotheses, in families that have experienced multiple hardships related to the coronavirus disease 2019 crisis, both parents' and children's mental health is worse. As the crisis continues to unfold, pediatricians should screen for mental health, with particular attention to children whose families are especially vulnerable to economic and disease aspects of the crisis.","Gassman-Pines, Ananat, Fitz-Henley",https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2020-007294,20201013.0,"Affect; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; Child; Child Care; Child Health; Child, Preschool; Coronavirus Infections; Cost of Illness; Health Surveys; Humans; Income; Mental Health; Pandemics; Parent-Child Relations; Parents; Pneumonia, Viral; SARS-CoV-2; Unemployment; Vulnerable Populations",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
311,Work-Related and Personal Factors Associated With Mental Well-Being During the COVID-19 Response: Survey of Health Care and Other Workers,"The response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has created an unprecedented disruption in work conditions. This study describes the mental health and well-being of workers both with and without clinical exposure to patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The aim of this study is to measure the prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression, work exhaustion, burnout, and decreased well-being among faculty and staff at a university and academic medical center during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and describe work-related and personal factors associated with their mental health and well-being. All faculty, staff, and postdoctoral fellows of a university, including its medical school, were invited in April 2020 to complete an online questionnaire measuring stress, anxiety, depression, work exhaustion, burnout, and decreased well-being. We examined associations between these outcomes and factors including work in high-risk clinical settings and family/home stressors. There were 5550 respondents (overall response rate of 34.3%). Overall, 34% of faculty and 14% of staff (n=915) were providing clinical care, while 61% of faculty and 77% of staff were working from home. Among all workers, anxiety (prevalence ratio 1.37, 95% CI 1.09-1.73), depression (prevalence ratio 1.28, 95% CI 1.03-1.59), and high work exhaustion (prevalence ratio 1.24, 95% CI 1.13-1.36) were independently associated with community or clinical exposure to COVID-19. Poor family-supportive behaviors by supervisors were also associated with these outcomes (prevalence ratio 1.40, 95% CI 1.21-1.62; prevalence ratio 1.69, 95% CI 1.48-1.92; and prevalence ratio 1.54, 95% CI 1.44-1.64, respectively). Age &lt;40 years and a greater number of family/home stressors were also associated with these poorer outcomes. Among the subset of clinicians, caring for patients with COVID-19 and working in high-risk clinical settings were additional risk factors. Our findings suggest that the pandemic has had negative effects on the mental health and well-being of both clinical and nonclinical employees. Mitigating exposure to COVID-19 and increasing supervisor support are modifiable risk factors that may protect mental health and well-being for all workers.","Evanoff, Strickland, Dale, Hayibor, Page, Duncan, Kannampallil, Gray",https://doi.org/10.2196/21366,20200904.0,"COVID-19; coronavirus; health care workers; mental health; occupational health; pandemic; remote work; worker well-being; Adult; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Occupational Diseases; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prevalence; Risk Factors; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

Our objective was to provide an evidence-based commentary on racial/ethnic disparities in social network resources and draw attention to the ways in which disasters differentially affect social networks, with meaningful insight for the ongoing pandemic. We draw upon prior research on social networks and past natural disasters to identify major areas of network inequality. Attention is given to how pre-pandemic racial/ethnic network disparities are exacerbated during the current crisis, with implications for physical and mental health outcomes. Evidence from the literature shows a robust association between strong social networks and physical and mental health outcomes. During times of crisis, access to social networks for older adults is disrupted, particularly for marginalized groups. We document pre-pandemic disparities in social networks resources and offer insight for examining the impact of COVID-19 on disrupting social networks among older adults. Importantly, racial/ethnic disparities in social networks both prior to and as a result of the pandemic intensify existing inequalities and demonstrate the necessity of better understanding social network inequalities for marginalized older adults, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 health crisis.","Gauthier, Smith, GarcÃ­a, Garcia, Thomas",https://doi.org/10.1093/geronb/gbaa117,20210223.0,COVID-19; Racial and ethnic minorities; Social networks; African Americans; Aged; Aging; COVID-19; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Minority Groups; Social Isolation; Social Networking; Socioeconomic Factors; United States,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

SARS-CoV-2 cases and deaths in children are minimal compared to adults, but the pandemic impacts other 'essential' aspects of children's health including child development and the associated areas of paediatric behaviour, mental health, and maltreatment. Alongside the management of severe SARS-CoV-2 cases in emergency rooms and intensive care units, continuing to care for children with developmental disabilities must also be concurrently championed as 'essential' during this crisis. The potentially devastating lifelong effects of the pandemic and isolation on an already vulnerable population demand that action be taken now. Video conferences and phone calls are 'essential' instruments we can use to continue to provide quality care for our patients.","Fung, Ricci",https://doi.org/10.1093/pch/pxaa077,20200928.0, Child behaviour; COVID-19; Child development; Coronavirus; Pandemics,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
315,Psychological Distress and Its Correlates Among COVID-19 Survivors During Early Convalescence Across Age Groups,"To examine the psychological distress and the associated predictor factors of the 2019 corona-virus disease (COVID-19) on survivors in the early convalescence in Shenzhen. A survey questionnaire consisting of post-traumatic stress disorder self-rating scale (PTSD-SS), self-rating depression scale (SDS), and self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) was presented to COVID-19 survivors still in quarantine. Scores of each scale and subscale were dependent variables in the Mann-Whitney test and stepwise regression analysis. A total of 126 subjects were included in the study, the mean scores of PTSD-SS, SDS, and SAS were 45.5 Â± 18.9, 47.3 Â± 13.1, and 43.2 Â± 10.2, respectively, meanwhile, 9 (31.0%), 28 (22.2%), and 48 (38.1%) of the survivors met the cut-score for clinical significant symptoms of stress response, anxiety, and depression, respectively. Infected family members, and postinfection physical discomforts were significantly associated with scores on all three scales. Social support, retirement, and being female had significant associations with the PTSD-SS score. The survivors aged 60 or above experienced less severe stress response symptoms, fewer emotional symptoms of depression, and fewer anxiety symptoms than younger survivors. The occurrence rate of psychological distress among the COVID-19 survivors in early convalescence was high, highlighting the need for all COVID-19 survivors to be screened for psychological distress regularly for timely intervention. The predictors indicated by the current study may help to identify those at high-risk. Besides, the results indicated the older survivors suffered less emotional reactivity and fewer stress response symptoms from infectious diseases than the younger ones.","Cai, Hu, Ekumi, Wang, An, Li, Yuan",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.07.003,20200924.0,"COVID-19; anxiety; depression; older age; psychological distress; stress response; survivors; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; China; Convalescence; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Employment; Family; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Protective Factors; Psychological Distress; Retirement; Risk Factors; SARS-CoV-2; Severity of Illness Index; Sex Factors; Social Support; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Stress, Psychological; Survivors",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

317,Emotional &quot;inflection point&quot; in public health emergencies with the 2019 new coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) in China,"The outbreak of the new coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) in Wuhan, Hubei, has caused very serious consequences and severely affected people's lives and mental health. The outbreak will cause bad emotions such as tension, anxiety, fear, and so on. College students who have returned home from school face infection, isolation, and delay in starting school, and thus, their emotional stress should be observed. This study used self-designed questionnaires and artificial intelligence (AI) to assess and analyze the emotional state of over 30,000 college students during the outbreak period in January (T1) and home quarantine in February (T2). This survey used online questionnaire (www.wjx.cn) to investigate the emotion information of college students. In the T1 survey, the &quot;Typhoon Eye Effect&quot; appeared. College students in Hubei are calmer than those outside Hubei in T1. However, in T2, an emotional &quot;infection point&quot; appeared, there was an &quot;Exposure Effect&quot;, the negative emotions of students in Hubei largely increased and became higher than students outside Hubei. This survey found that there is an emotional &quot;infection point&quot; in February among college students, especially in the Hubei area. College students in Hubei are calmer than those outside Hubei in T1. In contrast, college students in Hubei were more nervous and scared than those outside Hubei in T2. This epidemic has caused the students to experience significant pressure and negative emotions. Therefore, universities and society should pay attention to their emotional adjustment, there are some suggestions such as establish the mental health organizations, test students' emotion status regularly.","Zhang, Cao, Wang, Wang, Lei, Shou, Xie, Huang, Luo, Luo, Bian, Zhang, Xiao",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.07.097,20200909.0,"College students; Emotional â€œinflection pointâ€; New coronavirus pneumonia (NCP); Self-regulation; Adolescent; Anxiety; Artificial Intelligence; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; China; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; Emergencies; Emotions; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Public Health; SARS-CoV-2; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

Participants were 73 community-living older adults with pre-existing MDD (mean age 69 [SD 6]) in Los Angeles, New York, Pittsburgh, and St Louis. During the first 2 months of the pandemic, the authors interviewed participants with a semistructured qualitative interview evaluating access to care, mental health, quality of life, and coping. The authors also assessed depression, anxiety, and suicidality with validated scales and compared scores before and during the pandemic. Five themes from the interviews highlight the experience of older adults with MDD: 1) They are more concerned about the risk of contracting the virus than the risks of isolation. 2) They exhibit resilience to the stress and isolation of physical distancing. 3) Most are not isolated socially, with virtual contact with friends and family. 4) Their quality of life is lower, and they worry their mental health will suffer with continued physical distancing. 5) They are outraged by an inadequate governmental response to the pandemic. Depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation symptom scores did not differ from scores before the pandemic. Most older adults with pre-existing MDD show resilience in the first 2 months of the COVID-19 pandemic but have concerns about the future.

320,Adapting Neurosurgery Practice During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the Indian Subcontinent,"The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has changed the practice of neurosurgery. Significant resources have been dedicated to the disease. The pandemic in the Indian subcontinent, compared with the rest of the world, is relatively delayed. The neurosurgical practice cannot remain unaffected by hugely disruptive measures such as a lockdown. The inevitable increase in COVID infections with the gradual relaxation of lockdown continues to pose a risk for health care providers. Therefore, it is imperative to evaluate whether the pandemic has had a discernible effect on health care providers, especially in terms of practice modifications in private establishments and publicly funded hospitals, the emotional impact on the surgeon, and the influence of social media on the psyche of the surgeon. An online questionnaire-based survey was prepared, with questions related to the COVID-specific themes of precautions taken in outpatient services and operating theaters, the influence of social media, the economic loss incurred, and the perceptible impact of telemedicine and webinars. The links to the survey were mailed to neurosurgeons in private and public practice countrywide. The responses were anonymized to ensure free and unbiased answers to the survey questions. A total of 176 responses were received from across the Indian subcontinent. The median age of respondents was 39 years (range, 32-70 years) and the postresidency experience was 7 years (range, 0-34 years). Respondents were an equitable mix of public and private practitioners. Of respondents, 46% were practicing restricted outpatient services, more in public institutions (PÂ = 0.22) which also had a higher incidence of tele-outpatient services (26% vs. 17%). Wearing surgical masks, N95 masks, and gloves were the most commonly practiced precautionary measures in outpatient services (&gt;60%). Although private practitioners were continuing elective cases (40%), public institutes were more cautious, with only emergency patients being operated on (29%). The greatest fear among all practitioners was passing the infection to their family (75%). Social media were helpful for brainstorming queries and updating practice modifications, but some surgeons admitted to receiving threats on social media platforms (37.5%). Depression and economic losses were palpable for approximately 30% neurosurgeons. The survey highlights the perception of neurosurgeons toward the pandemic and the difference in public-private practice. Suspension of elective procedures, severe curtailment of regular outpatient appointments, drastic modifications of the normal outpatient department/operating room practices, and apprehensions related to inadequacy of safety provided by personal protective equipment use and financial losses of private establishments were some of the visible themes in our survey results. Although telemedicine has not been as widely adopted as expected, online education has been favorably received.","Deora, Mishra, Tripathi, Garg, Tandon, Borkar, Varshney, Raut, Chaurasia, Chandra, Kale",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2020.07.038,20201009.0,"COVID-19; Coronavirus; Neurosurgery; Social media; Academic Medical Centers; Adult; Aged; Ambulatory Care; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Economics; Elective Surgical Procedures; Hospitals, Private; Hospitals, Public; Humans; India; Middle Aged; Neurosurgeons; Neurosurgery; Neurosurgical Procedures; Pandemics; Personal Protective Equipment; Pneumonia, Viral; Professional Practice; SARS-CoV-2; Social Media; Surveys and Questionnaires; Telemedicine",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

Six focal cutting-edge technologies are identified: artificial intelligence, augmented reality, virtual reality, wearable technology, robotics and big data analytics. Our analysis shows research on consumer interaction with cutting-edge technologies is at a nascent stage, and there are several gaps requiring attention. To further advance knowledge, our article offers avenues for future interdisciplinary research addressing implications of consumer interaction with cutting-edge technologies. More specifically, we propose six main areas for future research namely: rethinking consumer behaviour models, identifying behavioural differences among different generations of consumers, understanding how consumers interact with automated services, ethics, privacy and the blackbox, consumer security concerns and consumer interaction with new-age technologies during and after a major global crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2021.106761,20210701.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
322,NO<inf>2</inf> levels as a contributing factor to COVID-19 deaths: The first empirical estimate of threshold values,"This study represents the first empirical estimation of threshold values between nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations and COVID-19-related deaths in France. The concentration of NO2 linked to COVID-19-related deaths in three major French cities were determined using Artificial Neural Networks experiments and a Causal Direction from Dependency (D2C) algorithm. The aim of the study was to evaluate the potential effects of NO2 in spreading the epidemic. The underlying hypothesis is that NO2, as a precursor to secondary particulate matter formation, can foster COVID-19 and make the respiratory system more susceptible to this infection. Three different neural networks for the cities of Paris, Lyon and Marseille were built in this work, followed by the application of an innovative tool of cutting the signal from the inputs to the selected target. The results show that the threshold levels of NO2 connected to COVID-19 range between 15.8 µg/m3 for Lyon, 21.8 µg/m3 for Marseille and 22.9 µg/m3 for Paris, which were significantly lower than the average annual concentration limit of 40 µg/m³ imposed by Directive 2008/50/EC of the European Parliament.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.110663,20210301.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
323,Anxiety and Depression Associated with the Management of COVID-19 Among Healthcare workers in Cameroon,"Objectif La pandémie de la COVID-19 a eu un retentissement important dans le monde, à différents niveaux. La littérature consultée indique que les travailleurs de santé, en première ligne de la riposte, sont généralement ceux qui paient le plus lourd tribu. La présente étude évalue l’importance des symptomatologies anxieuse et dépressive chez ces acteurs de la riposte à la COVID-19, dans le contexte du Cameroun. Méthode La Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) a été mise à contribution pour évaluer les symptomatologies anxieuse et dépressive. La collecte des données a eu recours à la construction d’un web questionnaire sur la plateforme Google Forms. Le lien du questionnaire a été envoyé à des groupes professionnels dans les 10 Régions du pays, au préalable de leur consentement éclairé. Au total, 331 professionnels de santé ont été interrogés sur la période du 05 au 19 avril 2020. Résultats Les résultats montrent un taux important d’anxiété (41,8 %) et de dépression (42,8 %). On observe une plus forte susceptibilité à la dépression chez les sujets jeunes (30-39 ans). La peur de la contamination et la peur de la mort sont des facteurs modulateurs de la dépression et de l’anxiété. La comorbidité anxiété-dépression dans l’échantillon est de 14,73 %. Les taux de prévalence du trouble dépressif majeur et du trouble de l’adaptation dans l’échantillon sont respectivement de 8,2 % et 3,3 %. Les données présentées confirment les tendances enregistrées dans la littérature, concernant l’impact des épidémies mortelles sur la santé mentale des travailleurs de santé. Discussion Les résultats indiquent, comme c’est le cas dans la plupart des travaux consultés dans la littérature, que la pandémie de la Covid 19 affecte de manière importante la santé mentale des travailleurs de santé. Ceci souligne l’urgence de mettre en place un dispositif d’aide et/ou d’accompagnement spécialisé, dans le contexte de l’actuelle pandémie, comme celui des crises sanitaires de même nature. Un tel dispositif n’existe pas au Cameroun, où la réponse de santé mentale reste faible. Conclusion Ces résultats suggèrent que les personnels de santé engagés dans la riposte contre la COVID-19 au Cameroun sont affectés de manière significative dans leur santé mentale. Ce qui souligne la nécessité d’une aide psychologique spécialisée pour le personnel soignant. Objective The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact worldwide, at different levels. The literature consulted indicates that healthcare workers, who are the first to respond, are generally the ones who pay the highest price. The present study assesses the extent of anxious and depressive symptoms among these actors responding to COVID-19, in the context of Cameroon. Method The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to assess anxious and depressive symptoms. Data collection involved the use of a web questionnaire for this purpose through the Google Forms virtual platform. The questionnaire link was sent to professional groups spread throughout Cameroon's ten regions. A total of 331 health professionals were interviewed over the period from April 5 to 19, 2020. Result The results show a high rate of anxiety (41.8%) and depression (42.8%). There is a higher susceptibility to depression in young people (30-39 years). Fear of contamination and fear of death are modulators of depression and anxiety. The anxiety-depression comorbidity in the sample is 14.73%. The prevalence rates of major depressive disorder and adjustment disorder in the sample were 8.2% and 3.3%, respectively. The data presented confirm the trends recorded in the literature regarding the impact of fatal epidemics on the mental health of healthcare workers. Discussion The results indicate, as is the case with most of the work consulted in the literature, that the Covid 19 pandemic is significantly affecting the mental health of healthcare workers. This underlines the urgency of setting up a specialized aid and/or support system, in the context of the current pandemic, such as that of similar health crises. Such a device does not exist in Cameroon, where the mental health response remains weak. Conclusion These results suggest that the healthcare staff involved in the response to COVID-19 in Cameroon are significantly affected in their mental health.

324,Psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with allergic diseases,"Background On March 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic disease. Interactions between allergy-related inflammatory and psychiatric disorders including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been documented. Therefore, those who have pre-existing allergic conditions may have an increased psychiatric reaction to the stresses of the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective Identify the psychological impact of COVID-19 in patients with allergic diseases and determine if these individuals have a greater risk of presenting with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Methods It is a cross-sectional, survey-based study designed to assess the degree of symptoms of depression and the risk of PTSD using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Impact of Event Scale–Revised (IES-R), respectively, in allergic patients. Results A total of 4106 surveys were evaluated; 1656 (40.3%) were patients with allergic disease, and 2450 (59.7%) were non-allergic (control) individuals. Of those with allergies, 76.6% had respiratory allergic disease including asthma and allergic rhinitis. Individuals with allergic disease reported higher scores regarding symptoms of PTSD on the IES-R scale (p = 0.052, OR 1.24 CI 0.99–1.55) as well as a higher depression risk score in the PHQ-9 questionnaire (mean 6.82 vs. 5.28) p = 0.000 z = -8.76. The allergy group presented a higher score in the IES-R questionnaire (mean 25.42 vs. 20.59), being more susceptible to presenting PTSD (p = 0.000, z = -7.774). The individuals with allergic conditions were further divided into subgroups of those with respiratory allergies such as allergic rhinitis and asthma vs those with non-respiratory allergies such as drug and food allergy, urticaria and atopic dermatitis. This subgroup analysis compares respiratory versus non-respiratory allergic patients, with similar results on the IES-R (mean 25.87 vs 23.9) p = 0.0124, z = -1.539. There was no significant difference on intrusion (p = 0.061, z = -1.873) and avoidance (p = 0.767, z = -0.297), but in the hyperarousal subscale, patients with respiratory allergy had higher scores (mean 1.15 vs. 0.99) p = 0.013 z = -2.486. Conclusions Psychological consequences such as depression and reported PTSD are present during the COVID-19 pandemic causing an impact particularly in individuals with allergic diseases. If we acknowledge the impact and how it is affecting our patients, we are able to implement interventions, follow up, and contribute to their overall well-being.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.waojou.2021.100510,20210301.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

El objetivo de esta investigación fue comprobar qué variables de confinamiento o estrés psicológico están relacionadas con el aumento de la sintomatología ansiosa y depresiva en mujeres embarazadas, como consecuencia de la pandemia ocasionada por la COVID-19. Materiales y métodos La muestra estuvo compuesta por 131 mujeres embarazadas que vivieron el confinamiento impuesto por el Gobierno de España el 14 de marzo de 2020. Se recogieron variables sociodemográficas, obstétricas, relacionadas con el confinamiento y variables psicológicas. Resultados El estrés percibido, estrés específico del embarazo, así como el insomnio son variables predictoras en la mayoría de síntomas ansiosos (obsesiones y compulsiones, ansiedad y ansiedad fóbica) y depresivos relacionados con la COVID-19. Conclusiones Es importante destinar futuras intervenciones psicológicas en esta población al control del estrés y monitorización del sueño, ya que estas variables influyen en el incremento de ansiedad y depresión. Background and objectives The appearance of a highly contagious disease forced the confinement of the population in almost all parts of the world, causing an increase in psychological problems, with pregnant women being a particularly vulnerable group to suffer negative consequences. The aim of this research was to check which confinement or psychological stress variables are related to the increase of anxious and depressive symptoms in pregnant women, as a consequence of the pandemic caused by the COVID-19. Materials and methods The sample was composed of 131 pregnant women who experienced the confinement imposed by the Government of Spain on March 14, 2020. Sociodemographic, obstetric, confinement related and psychological variables were collected. Results Perceived stress, pregnancy-specific stress, as well as insomnia are predictive variables in most anxious (obsessions and compulsions, anxiety and phobic anxiety) and depressive symptoms related to COVID-19.

331,Adaptations of an outpatient Dialectical Behavioral Therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic and consequences of the confinement on patients with borderline personality disorder,"Objectif La pandémie due à la COVID-19 a impacté l’accessibilité à la psychothérapie pour des patients particulièrement vulnérables pendant la période de confinement. Nous présentons les adaptations d’un programme de thérapie comportementale dialectique et les conséquences du confinement sur le vécu de patients souffrant d’un trouble de personnalité borderline. Méthode Nous avons, pour sept patients, comparé deux périodes de huit semaines, avant et pendant le confinement. Nous avons analysé leurs cartes journalières (n =426) et le recensement hebdomadaire de la fréquence de leurs comportements problèmes (n =69). Résultats L’analyse des cartes journalières indique que la période de confinement prédit une diminution significative des sentiments de peur, de honte ou culpabilité et de tension mais une augmentation de la détresse. Le suivi hebdomadaire montre une diminution significative des comportements hyperphagiques. Discussion Malgré le petit nombre de patients inclus, cette étude se base sur des échantillonnages d’expérience au quotidien et des mesures hebdomadaires. Ces deux types de mesures répétées indiquent certaines améliorations pendant le confinement, attestant des capacités d’adaptation de ces patients, soutenus par un cadre thérapeutique intensif qui a été maintenu. Background The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the accessibility of psychotherapy for particularly vulnerable patients during the period of confinement in the French-speaking part of Switzerland. We had to adapt our usual therapeutic programs. We illustrate this approach in an outpatient program of dialectical behavioral therapy for patients with borderline personality disorder. Each week the individual therapies took place by videoconference or phone. The skills training group was held individually by videoconference or phone and was supported by an online skills training program. Patients filled out their diary cards online. Intersession contact with the therapist remained available as usual and we could organize team consultation. The aim of this study is to describe how a sample of our patients experienced the period of confinement. Method We compared the experiences of seven patients suffering from borderline personality disorder during two periods: eight weeks prior to confinement, and during the eight weeks of confinement. We analyzed their daily diary cards (n =426) and their weekly frequency of problem behaviors (n =69). We performed multilevel analyses to take into account the hierarchical structure of the data and the autocorrelation of observations. Results The seven patients were predominantly female (85.7 %) and had an average age of 35.1 (11.5) years. Measurements prior to the start of the pandemic indicated on average severe depression (Beck Depression Inventory, m=30.9 [10.0]) and marked hopelessness (Beck Hopelessness Scale, m=15.0 [5.0]). Analysis of the daily diary cards indicated that the confinement period significantly predicted a decrease in feelings of shame or guilt, fear and tension. At the same time, however, there was an increase in distress. Weekly monitoring of problem behaviors showed a decrease in binge-eating behaviors and a trend towards a decrease in alcohol consumption during confinement. Conclusions Despite the small number of patients included, two types of repeated measurements indicated convergent results, with some improvements during confinement: a decrease of the feelings of fear, shame or guilt, and tension, and a decrease of the frequency of binge-eating behaviors. The decreased pace of daily social and professional life may explain these improvements. The diminution of the above-mentioned feelings as triggers for addictive and compulsive behaviors may also account for the improvements regarding binge-eating. However, they also experienced an increased distress that may reflect the loneliness experienced during this period. The pre-pandemic development of computerized tools that were already familiar to patients greatly facilitated the necessary adaptations to maintain an intensive therapeutic setting during the confinement. This may partly explain why these patients were able to adjust the challenges of this period.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2020.08.006,20210201.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

Método Se realizó una búsqueda bibliográfica, sin límite de fecha, en las bases de datos Medline, CINAHL®, PsycINFO®, Scopus y Web of Science™ empleando como palabras clave las siguientes: «emotional management», «health crisis» y «health crisis response». Inicialmente, se identificaron 73 estudios y, tras seleccionarlos según criterios de elegibilidad, se incluyeron 10. Resultados Las principales recomendaciones según la evidencia disponible indican medidas de manejo emocional como ofrecer grupos de apoyo a profesionales, garantizar su no discriminación social, fortalecer su confianza y capacidad de control mediante acciones formativas, así como reforzar el reconocimiento de las enfermeras por parte de la comunidad. Discusión y conclusiones La evidencia acumulada procede de la experiencia ante los brotes epidémicos anteriores por coronavirus SARS-CoV-1 y MERS-CoV. El estrés fue el aspecto más estudiado, en relación con cuestiones como el estigma social, el profesionalismo, la intención de cuidar, el burnout, los conflictos éticos, la ansiedad, la depresión o la culpa.

334,Prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in the pediatric population from the family and community perspective,"Partiendo del informe sobre la situación de la COVID-19 en España, del 3 de abril del 2020, los casos confirmados ascienden a 117.710, de los que 343 tienen una edad inferior a 14 años (< 1%). Es fundamental conocer la especificidad de este proceso en la población infantil, así como las recomendaciones específicas para una adecuada prevención y cuidado de los niños durante la pandemia por la COVID-19. Este artículo tiene como objetivo analizar la evidencia científica sobre las recomendaciones específicas para la atención pediátrica en casos de COVID-19 desde el ámbito familiar y comunitario. Se han seleccionado y analizado las principales recomendaciones y medidas preventivas en los entornos de Atención Primaria de salud y el domicilio desde un enfoque integrador dónde se incluyen los aspectos biopsicosociales del niño durante el confinamiento. La importancia de los cuidados de la infancia frente a la enfermedad radican sobre todo en asegurar las correctas medidas de prevención del contagio por la condición de actuar como posibles portadores durante un período de incubación de hasta 21 días. La recomendación es que los niños participen activamente en las acciones preventivas habituales para la contención de la expansión de la enfermedad. A nivel domiciliario, el aislamiento supone un importante reto para las familias donde se presentan manifestaciones de incertidumbre, miedo e indefensión ante los cambios y entre las recomendaciones se encuentran establecer rutinas orden mediante horarios de actividades y ocio unido a las medidas de higiene. Dada la rapidez con la que se ha producido la pandemia por SARS-CoV-2, existen pocas evidencias del impacto en niños en España por el momento. Es necesario desarrollar estudios específicos sobre prevención y tratamiento en la edad pediátrica para mejorar las recomendaciones disponibles. Based on the report on the situation of COVID-19 in Spain, dated April 3, 2020, the confirmed cases amount to 117,710, of which 343 are under 14 years of age (< 1%). It is essential to know the specificity of this process in the child population, as well the specific recommendations for proper prevention and care of children during the COVID-19 pandemic. The paper aim is to analyze the scientific evidence on the specific recommendations for pediatric care in cases of COVID-19 from the family and community settings. The main recommendations and preventive measures in primary health care settings and at home have been selected and analyzed from an integrative approach that includes the biopsychosocial aspects of the child during confinement. The importance of caring for children in the face of the disease lies above all in ensuring the correct measures for the prevention of contagion due to the condition of acting as possible carriers during an incubation period of up to 21 days. The recommendation is that children actively participate in routine preventive actions to contain the spread of the disease. At the household level, isolation is an important challenge for families where there are manifestations of uncertainty, fear and helplessness in the face of changes and among the recommendations are establishing routines and order through schedules of activities and leisure together with hygiene measures. Given the rapidity with which the COVID-19 pandemic has occurred, there is little evidence at the moment. Research on prevention and treatment in the pediatric age needs to be developed to improve the available recommendations.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enfcli.2020.05.005,20210201.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
335,Smartphone Screen Time: Inaccuracy of self-reports and influence of psychological and contextual factors,"Previous research investigating associations between screen time and various undesirable consequences (e.g., poor mental health) has relied heavily on self-report measures. However, there is debate regarding whether self-reports overestimate or underestimate actual screen time. We used advances in iPhone software to address this question and to investigate the influence of individual difference factors, and COVID-19 lockdown restrictions, on screen time. Participants (N = 267, 18–25 years) completed scales measuring depression, anxiety, smartphone attachment, and estimated their screen time. Thereafter, they shared screenshots of their battery use (BUS) and iPhone screen time (iOS STT) data. Some (n = 24) shared their BUS data again during the COVID-19 lockdown. Whereas the BUS data (10-day average, including two weekends) indicated that self-reports underestimated actual use, the iOS STT data (7-day average) indicated that self-reports overestimated actual use (ps < .007). Smartphone use was heavier over weekends and screen time increased significantly during the lockdown (p = .001). Finally, smartphone attachment mediated the relationship between objective screen time and depression, but not anxiety. We conclude that iPhone tracking features can reliably collect objective screen time data, and that screen time is significantly influenced by both individual difference factors and environmental context.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2020.106616,20210201.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

The aims of this study were to survey aspects related to mental health of pharmaceutical course students considering previous and current contexts. Methods The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21), Impact of Event Scale-Revised, and Brunel Mood Scale were used. DASS-21 was completed pre- and post-pandemic. The validity and reliability of the data were verified. The prevalence (95% CI) of mental health symptoms was estimated. The relationship between the time spent watching/reading the news and mean scales scores was evaluated (Pearson's correlation coefficient). Results The prevalence of depression symptoms in students pre-pandemic was 66.7% (95% CI = 65.3–68.1) and during the pandemic was 81% (95% CI = 79.8–82.2). More than 70% (95% CI = 69.8–72.6) of participants had some psychological impact as a result of the pandemic (mild: 16.7% [95% CI = 15.6–17.8]; moderate: 9.1% [95% CI = 8.2–10]; severe: 45.4% [95% CI = 43.9–46.9]). High values of tension, depressed mood, mental confusion, and anger were observed. There was a significant correlation between the time spent following the news of the pandemic and symptoms of anxiety (r = 0.356; P < .001), stress (r = 0.248; P = .014), hyperarousal (r = 0.322; P = 0.001), and intrusion (r = 0.21; P = .039).

Método Estudio cualitativo exploratorio a través del análisis de ilustraciones realizadas por 71 escolares de 7-8 años de edad. El análisis se llevó a cabo según el marco teórico de Rose. Se realizó análisis descriptivo de los datos sociodemográficos. Resultados Del análisis del contenido emergieron cinco categorías: 1) sentimientos de tristeza y miedo; 2) importancia del núcleo familiar, seguridad y protección; 3) hábitos de vida sedentarios durante el confinamiento; 4) infraestructuras de las viviendas y desigualdades sociales (la vida tras una ventana); y 5) respuesta social, lucha colectiva y de los/las profesionales de la salud. Conclusiones La situación de pandemia de COVID-19 y las medidas estrictas de confinamiento han tenido un importante impacto en la población escolar, que es la que ha vivido las mayores restricciones. La infraestructura del hogar se ha mostrado como un claro diferenciador que ahonda en las desigualdades sociales y el impacto que la situación tiene en los/las escolares.

Conclusiones No hallamos correlación entre los niveles de IL-6, IL-1ß y TNF-a con la puntuación en la GDS. La sintomatología depresiva presenta características similares a las depresiones vasculares. Introduction Rise of central cytokines resulting from infections produces neuronal changes. Covid-19 allows the study of depressive symptoms in sustained stress and its relationship with molecular mechanisms. Objectives To assess correlation between IL-6, IL-1ß and TNF-a and depressive symptoms. Characterize the depressive symptoms present. Methods Observational study. Patients admitted for Covid-19 older than 60 years with a interleukin determination were included. The Yesavage Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) was used, associating each item with a neurotransmitter. Results 27 patients included. We did not find correlation between IL-6 levels and the GDS scale score (rho=0.204; 95% CI -0.192 to 0.543); with IL-1ß levels (rho=-0.126; 95% CI -0.490 to 0.276); nor of TNF-a (rho=-0.033; 95% CI -0.416 to 0.360). 3 patients (11.1%) presented score compatible with depressive disorder.

346,"An insight into the mental health needs of the common public of Tamil Nadu, India, subjected to COVID-19 lockdown, a rare unprecedented crisis","Purpose COVID-19, a major “Public Health Emergencies of International Concern”, had sought greater attention among researchers to study its pathogenesis, associated complications and management. However, there are only few studies that had studied its potential impact on mental health of general public, who are subjected to social distancing, community lockdown and restrictions in their routine activities. Objectives The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of psychological distress and mental health needs among general public in Tamil Nadu subjected to lockdown, social distancing amidst COVID-19 crisis. Tamil Nadu is one of the worst affected states of southern India. Methods A self-administered, web-based application study using “WHO-Self Reported Questionnaire-20”, in bilingual version, both English and Tamil, is used to screen the public for the level of distress. The study is done while the state is under extended lockdown and restricted movement. Key findings A total of 918 respondents participated in the survey and it is found that about more than one third of the respondents (~35%) are under psychological distress. A significant association between younger age group, female gender, unmarried, people with children are found to be under distress. The lockdown had increased the frequency of smoking and quantity of cigarettes among smokers, also has increased the frequency of drinking among alcohol consumers. Of the SRQ-20 items recorded, stress related neurotic symptoms (>70%) was observed more than the depressive mood. About 33% of those scored>7, had suicidal tendency. The districts declared red zones had significantly reported a greater number of respondents under distress. Conclusion Besides effectively mitigating the COVID-19 crisis, in terms of prevention, control and treatment strategies, it is prerogative to effectively manage fear, distress due to the COVID-19 and associated anxiety and depression among the public.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2021.02.013,20210101.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
347,Effect of COVID-19 confinement on the mental status of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus,"Antecedentes y objetivo Las pacientes con lupus eritematoso sistémico (LES) son más vulnerables a presentar mayores niveles de estrés y síntomas psicopatológicos que la población general sana, por lo que el brote de la COVID-19 podría alterar su estado psicológico. El objetivo fue analizar el impacto psicológico de la pandemia y del confinamiento sobre los niveles de estrés y sintomatología psicopatológica en pacientes con LES. Pacientes y método En este estudio transversal se compararon niveles de estrés mediante la Escala de Estrés Percibido y el Inventario de Vulnerabilidad al Estrés, y síntomas psicopatológicos mediante el Inventario de síntomas SCL-90-R, en pacientes con LES durante el período de confinamiento (grupo 1; n=276) con respecto a pacientes con LES evaluadas en un período anterior a la pandemia (grupo 2; n=152). Resultados La comparación entre ambos grupos mostró que existían diferencias estadísticamente significativas en vulnerabilidad al estrés (p<0,0001), depresión (p=0,05), ansiedad (p=0,05), ansiedad fóbica (p<0,0001), sensibilidad interpersonal (p=0,043), y psicoticismo (p=0,023). En estas variables el grupo de pacientes con lupus en confinamiento obtuvo puntuaciones superiores. Conclusiones El confinamiento y la amenaza del brote por COVID-19 ha tenido importantes repercusiones en el estado psicológico de las pacientes con LES, mostrando altos niveles de estrés, ansiedad y depresión. Estos hallazgos muestran su vulnerabilidad ante una alerta de salud pública, y señala la necesidad de realizar un abordaje psicológico de estas pacientes mientras dure el estado de emergencia sanitaria, así como ante posibles rebrotes del virus. Background and objective Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are more vulnerable to higher levels of stress and psychopathological symptoms than the general healthy population. Therefore, the COVID-19 outbreak could alter their psychological state. The objective was to analyze the psychological impact of the pandemic and confinement on stress levels and psychopathological symptoms in patients with SLE. Patients and method In this cross-sectional study, stress levels were compared with the Perceived Stress Scale, the Stress Vulnerability Inventory and psychopathological symptoms of the SCL-90-R Symptom Inventory in patients with SLE during the period of confinement (group 1; n=276) in comparison to patients with SLE evaluated in a period before the pandemic (group 2; n=152). Results The comparison between both groups showed there were statistically significant differences in vulnerability to stress (P <.0001), depression (P =.05), anxiety (P =.05), phobic anxiety (P <.0001), interpersonal sensitivity (P =.043), and psychoticism (P =.023). In these variables, the group of patients with lupus in confinement obtained higher scores. Conclusions The confinement and threat of the COVID-19 outbreak had important repercussions on the psychological state of patients with SLE with high levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. These findings show their vulnerability to a public health alert and indicate the need to carry out a psychological approach to these patients while the state of health emergency lasts as well as to possible outbreaks of the virus.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.medcli.2020.12.004,20210101.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

Nous nous sommes consacrés dans cette étude à évaluer le niveau de l’anxiété à travers la somatisation chez les participants afin de mettre en évidence la différence entre l’anxiété chez le jeune adulte et l’anxiété chez le sujet âgé. Cette étude est une suite à la publication concernant une nouvelle échelle de somatisation. Les analyses statistiques ont été faites sur la même population. Ce travail a été réalisé à l’aide de l’échelle de somatisation sur un échantillon de 235 participants ayant plus de 18 ans. Ces participants étaient des hommes et femmes qui ont été confinés au Maroc lors de la pandémie du SARS-CoV2. Nous avons constaté que les jeunes adultes présentaient une anxiété plus intense que les sujets âgés au cours de cette période de confinement et que les sujets âgés étaient plus nombreux à ressentir de l’anxiété dite « normale » suite à la pandémie du COVID-19. Among the elderly, certain disorders such as depression are difficult to diagnose and have a different aspect from the pathology occurring in young adults. In this study, we set out to assess levels of anxiety via somatization among the participants in order to highlight any differences between anxiety among young adults and anxiety among the elderly. This study is a follow-up to a previously published report on a newly established somatization scale. The statistical analyses were carried out on the same population. This work used the somatization scale on a sample of 235 participants over the age of 18. The participants were men and women who were subjected to lockdown in Morocco during the SARS-CoV2 pandemic.

El objetivo del presente estudio fue analizar el estado emocional de los trabajadores del Hospital de Igualada (Barcelona), mientras se enfrentaban a uno de los focos de contagio más importantes de Europa. Pacientes y métodos Se incluyó a un total de 395 trabajadores. Se realizó una evaluación transversal entre los meses de marzo y abril. Se recogió información sobre síntomas de ansiedad, depresión, estrés. También se recogieron datos demográficos y sobre factores potencialmente estresantes. Resultados Un porcentaje significativo de profesionales reportó síntomas de ansiedad (71,6%) y depresión (60,3%). El 14,5% informó de síntomas de estrés agudo. Se realizó un análisis de regresión que explicó el 30% de la variancia asociada al nivel de malestar emocional (Ry=0,30). Los factores de riesgo asociados a mayor malestar psicológico fueron el hecho de ser mujer (o hombre joven), trabajar como auxiliar de enfermería, celador o técnico de radiología, estar en contacto directo con pacientes Covid-19, no haber realizado la PCR, tener la sensación de no contar con los elementos de protección personales y haber experimentado la muerte de una persona cercana por Covid-19. Conclusiones El afrontamiento inicial de la situación de crisis asociada a la pandemia de Covid-19 tuvo un importante impacto emocional en los profesionales sanitarios analizados. Background and objectives The Covid-19 pandemic has put healthcare professionals around the world in an unprecedented challenge. This may cause some emotional difficulties and mental health problems. The aim of the present study was to analyze the emotional status among the health care workers form the Hospital of Igualada (Barcelona), while they were facing with Covid-19 in one of the most affected regions in all of Europe. Patients and methods A total of 395 participants were included in the study. A cross-sectional assessment was carried out between the months of March and April. Information about anxiety, depression, and stress was gathered. We also collected demographic data and concerning potentially stressful factors. Results A significant proportion of professionals reported symptoms of anxiety (31.4%) and depression (12.2%) from moderate to severe intensity. Symptoms of acute stress were reported by 14.5% of participants. We performed a regression analysis, which explained the 30% of the variance associated with the degree of emotional distress (Ry=0.30). The final model reveals that females (or young males), who are working in the frontline as nursing assistants, caretakers or radiology technicians, with the uncertainty of a possible infection, the perception of inadequate protection measures and having experienced the death of a close person by Covid-19, showed a heightened risk of experiencing psychological distress.

365,Perinatal depressive and anxiety symptoms of pregnant women during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in China,"Background On January 20, 2020, a new coronavirus epidemic with human-to-human transmission was officially declared by the Chinese government, which caused significant public panic in China. In light of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, pregnant women may be particularly vulnerable and in special need for preventive mental health strategies. Thus far, no reports exist to investigate the mental health response of pregnant women to the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. Objective This study aimed to examine the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak on the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms and the corresponding risk factors among pregnant women across China. Study Design A multicenter, cross-sectional study was initiated in early December 2019 to identify mental health concerns in pregnancy using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. This study provided a unique opportunity to compare the mental status of pregnant women before and after the declaration of the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic. A total of 4124 pregnant women during their third trimester from 25 hospitals in 10 provinces across China were examined in this cross-sectional study from January 1, 2020, to February 9, 2020. Of these women, 1285 were assessed after January 20, 2020, when the coronavirus epidemic was publicly declared and 2839 were assessed before this pivotal time point. The internationally recommended Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale was used to assess maternal depression and anxiety symptoms. Prevalence rates and risk factors were compared between the pre- and poststudy groups. Results Pregnant women assessed after the declaration of coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic had significantly higher rates of depressive symptoms (26.0% vs 29.6%, P=.02) than women assessed before the epidemic declaration. These women were also more likely to have thoughts of self-harm (P=.005). The depressive rates were positively associated with the number of newly confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (P=.003), suspected infections (P=.004), and deaths per day (P=.001). Pregnant women who were underweight before pregnancy, primiparous, younger than 35 years, employed full time, in middle income category, and had appropriate living space were at increased risk for developing depressive and anxiety symptoms during the outbreak. Conclusion Major life-threatening public health events such as the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak may increase the risk for mental illness among pregnant women, including thoughts of self-harm. Strategies targeting maternal stress and isolation such as effective risk communication and the provision of psychological first aid may be particularly useful to prevent negative outcomes for women and their fetuses.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.05.009,20200801.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
366,COVID 19–Depression and Neurosurgeons,"Objective The goal of this survey was to determine factors associated with anxiety/depression among neurosurgeons during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods An online survey was performed of neurosurgeons worldwide, conducted over 3 weeks. Depression in neurosurgeons was assessed by Self-Reporting Questionnaire–20. Results A total of 375 responses were received from 52 countries. Among all neurosurgeons, 34% felt tense, 32.5% were unhappy, 25% experienced insomnia, almost 20% had headaches, and 5% had suicidal ideation during the pandemic. Of participants, 14% had a score on Self-Reporting Questionnaire–20 consistent with depression. The likelihood of depression was significantly higher among those who did not receive guidance about self-protection from their institutions (odds ratio [OR], 2.47), those who did not feel safe with provided personal protective equipments (OR, 3.13), and those whose families considered their workplace unsafe (OR, 2.29). Depression was less likely in neurosurgeons who had minor concerns, compared with those with significant health concerns for their families (OR, 0.36). In multivariate analysis after controlling for effects of other covariates, odds of depression were significantly higher among neurosurgeons who did not feel safe with the provided personal protective equipment (OR, 2.43) and who were exposed to a COVID-19–positive colleague (OR, 2.54). Participants who had moderate concerns for their families had lesser odds of anxiety/depression than did those with significant concerns (OR, 0.28). Conclusions Based on the modifiable risk factors of depression in this study, it is recommended that the safety of neurosurgeons be ensured by providing appropriate safety measures for them to regain their confidence and hence reduce the incidence of depression.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2020.06.007,20200801.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

La evidencia de validez con base en la relación con otras variables del CAS fue respaldada por la correlación positiva con la depresión (r = .52, p < .01) y negativa con el bienestar subjetivo (r = -.50, p < .01). Además, la depresión media la relación entre la ansiedad por la COVID-19 y el bienestar subjetivo (valor bootstrap = - .24, IC 95% = - .28, - .20). Conclusión La versión en español del CAS posee evidencias de validez y confiabilidad para medir la ansiedad por la COVID-19 en una muestra de universitarios peruanos. Introduction and objectives COVID-19 has generated negative consequences for people's mental health. This is the case of Peru, one of the Latin American countries most affected by the pandemic. In this sense, the objective of the study was to translate and validate the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) into Spanish. Material and method The participants were 704 university students of health sciences (Mage = 23.39 years, SD = 3.45) who were administered the CAS in Spanish, the Mental Health Inventory-5 and the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 item. The CAS was translated into Spanish using the forward and backward method. Reliability and evidence of validity based on internal structure and relationship with other variables were examined. Results The factor analysis confirmed the one-dimensional factor structure of the CAS (<U+03C7> 2 = 7.62, df = 5, p = .18, <U+03C7> 2 / gl = 1.52, CFI = .99, RMSEA = .03 [90% CI .00, .06]; SRMR = .02, WRMR = .52); In addition, the factor loadings were large and significant (from .68 to .87). The five CAS items showed acceptable corrected total test item correlations (from .64 to .74). Reliability due to internal consistency was good (<U+03C9> = .89; aordinal = .89). The validity evidence based on the relationship with other CAS variables was supported by the positive correlation with depression (r = .52, p < .01) and negative with subjective well-being (r = -.50, p < . 01). Furthermore, depression mediates the relationship between COVID-19 anxiety and subjective well-being (bootstrap value = - .24, 95% CI = - .28, - .20). Conclusion The Spanish version of the CAS has evidence of validity and reliability to measure anxiety by COVID-19 in a sample of Peruvian university students.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anyes.2020.08.001,20200701.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
368,Suicidal behavior in light of COVID-19 outbreak: Clinical challenges and treatment perspectives,"Objectifs La pandémie de COVID-19 touche à ce jour plus de 3 000 000 de personnes à travers le monde et les mesures de prévention ont conduit au confinement de plus de la moitié de l’humanité. La communauté scientifique et les autorités politiques redoutent une épidémie de suicides secondaires à cette crise. L’objectif de cette revue de la littérature est d’analyser l’impact de la pandémie de COVID-19 sur les dimensions du processus suicidaire, son interaction avec les différents facteurs de risque. Nous proposons également des solutions innovantes pour y remédier. Méthodes Nous avons réalisé une revue narrative des articles internationaux traitant des grandes pandémies (COVID-19, SRAS) et de leur influence sur la vulnérabilité suicidaire. Résultats De nombreux facteurs sont susceptibles de majorer l’émergence d’idées de suicide et le passage à l’acte suicidaire au cours de cette crise. La distanciation et le confinement pourraient favoriser un sentiment de déconnexion et la perception d’une douleur sociale chez les individus vulnérables. Certaines populations déjà « à risque suicidaire élevé » pourraient être encore fragilisées par la pandémie actuelle : personnes âgées, personnel médical et individus exposés à une forte précarité économique. Plusieurs solutions innovantes adaptées aux contraintes de la distanciation et du confinement permettront de prévenir le risque suicidaire : outils de santé connectée, protocole VigilanS, thérapie comportementale et cognitive de troisième vague et pratique artistique. Conclusions Il est possible que cette crise inédite exacerbe certaines dimensions du processus suicidaire. Cependant, à l’heure de l’innovation, plusieurs outils de prévention du suicide ont toute leur place dans les nouveaux modes de soins et devront être expérimentés à grande échelle. Objective The COVID-19 pandemic affected today more than 3,000,000 worldwide, and more than half of humanity has been placed in quarantine. The scientific community and the political authorities fear an epidemic of suicide secondary to this crisis. The aim of this review is to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the dimensions of the suicidal process and its interaction with the various risk factors. We also propose innovative strategies to manage suicidal behavior in the context of pandemic. Methods We carried out a narrative review of international publications dealing with major pandemics (COVID-19, SARS) and their influence on suicidal vulnerability. Results Many factors are likely to increase the emergence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts during this crisis. Social distancing and quarantine could increase the feeling of disconnection and the perception of social pain in vulnerable individuals. Some populations at high suicidal risk could be further impacted by the current pandemic: the elderly, medical staff and individuals exposed to economic insecurity. Several innovative tools adapted to the constraints of social distancing and quarantine may prevent suicide risk: e-health, VigilanS, buddhist-derived practices and art engagement. Conclusions This unprecedented crisis may interact with certain dimensions of the suicidal process. However, it is time to innovate. Several suicide prevention tools all have their place in new modes of care and should be tested on a large scale.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.05.001,20200601.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
369,Mental health problems faced by healthcare workers due to the COVID-19 pandemic–A review,"Introduction The spread of novel corona virus (COVID-19) across the globe and the associated morbidity and mortality challenged the nations by several means. One such underrecognized and unaddressed area is the mental health issues medical staff develop during the pandemic. Materials and methods This review aimed to review the literature about mental health problems faced by health care workers (HCW) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Literature search was conducted in the following databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, Embase. All types of articles published in the last 4 months (January 2020-April 2020) which were relevant to the subject of the review were searched. A total of 23 articles were selected by initial screening and 6 articles were included in the final review. Results Review of all the 6 articles showed that current research focused on assessing several aspects of mental health affected in HCW due to COVID-19. Several sociodemographic variables like gender, profession, age, place of work, department of work and psychological variables like poor social support, self-efficacy were associated with increased stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, insomnia in HCW. There is increasing evidence that suggests that COVID-19 can be an independent risk factor for stress in HCW. Conclusion Regular screening of medical personnel involved in treating, diagnosing patients with COVID-19 should be done for evaluating stress, depression and anxiety by using multidisciplinary Psychiatry teams.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102119,20200601.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
370,Psychopathological consequences of confinement,"Les effets psychologiques de l’isolement ont déjà été décrits dans la littérature (expéditions polaires, sous-marins, prison). Néanmoins, l’échelle du confinement mis en œuvre à l’occasion de la pandémie à COVID-19 est inédite. Il nous faut non seulement relire les études publiées, mais aussi anticiper les problèmes psychologiques qui pourraient survenir pendant ou à distance du confinement. Nous avons fait le choix d’aller au-delà de la littérature COVID-19 pour examiner les implications des conséquences connues du confinement : l’ennui, l’isolement social, le stress, le manque de sommeil. L’anxiété, le trouble de stress post-traumatique, la dépression et les conduites suicidaires, les conduites addictives, les violences domestiques sont des effets décrits du confinement, mais les mécanismes d’émergence de ces troubles et leurs interrelations restent à étudier. Par exemple, quels sont les mécanismes d’émergence du trouble de stress post-traumatique dans le cadre du confinement ? Nous rappelons aussi les points de vigilance à garder sur des conséquences telles que les troubles des conduites alimentaires, les hallucinations, curieusement ignorées dans la littérature sur le confinement, alors qu’une vaste littérature fait le lien entre isolement social et hallucinations. Du fait de conséquences psychopathologiques larges, il nous faut partir à la recherche des différents symptômes pour permettre leur prise en charge. Nous résumons rapidement les approches diagnostiques et thérapeutiques déjà mises en place, comme la télémédecine, qui connaît un développement rapide à l’occasion de la crise du COVID-19. The psychological effects of isolation have already been described in the literature (polar expeditions, submarines, prison). Nevertheless, the scale of confinement implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented. In addition to reviewing the published studies, we need to anticipate the psychological problems that could arise during or at a distance from confinement. We have gone beyond the COVID-19 literature in order to examine the implications of the known consequences of confinement, like boredom, social isolation, stress, or sleep deprivation. Anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, suicidal or addictive behaviours, domestic violence are described effects of confinement, but the mechanisms of emergence of these disorders and their interrelationships remain to be studied. For example, what are the mechanisms of emergence of post-traumatic stress disorders in the context of confinement? We also remind the reader of points of vigilance to be kept in mind with regard to eating disorders and hallucinations. Hallucinations are curiously ignored in the literature on confinement, whereas a vast literature links social isolation and hallucinations. Due to the broad psychopathological consequences, we have to look for these various symptoms to manage them. We quickly summarize the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches already in place, such as telemedicine, which is undergoing rapid development during the COVID-19 crisis.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.007,20200601.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

372,Mental health care in French correctional facilities during the Covid-19 pandemic,"Objectif En France, les mesures de confinement ont été accompagnées de dispositions spécifiques pour les prisons : suspension des activités, parloirs et interventions extérieures. Plus de dix mille personnes détenues ont en outre été libérées pour diminuer le taux d’occupation des établissements et limiter la propagation du virus. L’objectif de cet article est de décrire la réorganisation des soins psychiatriques en milieu pénitentiaire en contexte de pandémie de Covid-19 et d’interroger les conséquences du confinement et des libérations anticipées sur la santé mentale des personnes détenues. Méthode Ce travail s’appuie sur une enquête menée en avril 2020 auprès des soignants de 42 unités sanitaires en milieu pénitentiaire et des 9 unités hospitalières spécialement aménagées en France. Une synthèse de la littérature internationale sur la question des soins psychiatriques en milieu pénitentiaire durant l’épidémie de Covid-19 a également été réalisée. Résultats L’épidémie de Covid-19 semble avoir été plutôt contenue dans les prisons françaises au cours de la période de confinement mais le poids des mesures mises en place sur la population carcérale est important. Les 3 niveaux de soins psychiatriques en milieu pénitentiaire ont instauré des mesures spécifiques pour assurer la continuité des soins, accompagner les personnes incarcérées et contenir l’épidémie. Parmi les plus importantes, on note la restriction des consultations, la création de « secteurs Covid », la déprogrammation des hospitalisations non urgentes, le renforcement des mesures d’hygiène et le remaniement des effectifs. Actuellement, les soignants sont principalement confrontés à des sevrages forcés, des symptomatologies anxieuses et des décompensations de troubles psychiatriques chroniques. Certaines libérations anticipées sont aussi très préoccupantes, pouvant entraîner des ruptures de soins, par manque de préparation des relais de prise en charge. Discussion Les remaniements en lien avec le confinement donnent une visibilité accrue au fossé qui sépare la psychiatrie en milieu libre de la psychiatrie en milieu pénitentiaire. Il nous apparaît important de rappeler la vulnérabilité des personnes incarcérées qui doivent impérativement être considérées dans les politiques de santé publique. Objective The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the 11 million people currently incarcerated worldwide is the subject of many concerns. Prisons and jails are filled with people suffering from many preexisting medical conditions increasing the risk of complications. Detainees’ access to medical services is already limited and overcrowding poses a threat of massive contagion. Beyond the health impact of the crisis, the tightening of prison conditions worries. On March 16, 2020, in France, the lockdown measures have been accompanied by specific provisions for prisons: all facilities have suspended visitations, group activities and external interventions. Over 10,000 prisoners have been released to reduce the prison population and the risk of virus propagation. These adjustments had major consequences on the healthcare system in French prisons. The objectives of this article are to describe the reorganization of the three levels of psychiatric care for inmates in France in the context of Covid-19 pandemic and to have a look at the impact of lockdown measures and early releases on mental health of prisoners. Methods This work is based on a survey conducted in April 2020 in France among psychiatric healthcare providers working in 42 ambulatory units for inmates and in the 9 full-time inpatient psychiatric wards exclusively for inmates called “UHSAs” (which stands for “unités hospitalières spécialement aménagées”, and can be translated as “specially equipped hospital units”). A review of the international literature on mental healthcare system for inmates during the Covid-19 epidemic has also been performed. Results The Covid-19 epidemic has been rather contained during the period of confinement in French prisons but the impact of confinement measures on the prison population is significant. The three levels of psychiatric care for inmates have implemented specific measures to ensure continuity of care, to support detainees during Coronavirus lockdown and to prevent an infection's spread. Among the most important are: limitation of medical consultations to serious and urgent cases, creation of “Covid units”, cancellation of voluntary psychiatric hospitalizations, reinforcement of preventive hygiene measures and reshuffling of medical staff. Prolonged confinement has consequences on mental health of detainees. Currently, mental health workers are facing multiple clinical situations such as forced drug and substance withdrawal (linked to difficulties in supplying psychoactive substances), symptoms of anxiety (due to concerns for their own and their relatives’ well-being) and decompensation among patients with severe psychiatric conditions. Early releases from prison may also raise some issues. People recently released from prison are identified as at high risk of death by suicide and drug overdose. The lack of time to provide the necessary link between health services within prisons and health structures outside could have serious consequences, emphasizing the well-known “revolving prison doors” effect. Discussion The current lockdown measures applied in French jails and prisons point out the disparities between psychiatric care for inmates and psychiatric care for general population. Giving the high vulnerability of prison population, public health authorities should pay more attention to health care in prisons.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.05.002,20200601.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
373,Ensuring mental health care during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in France: A narrative review,"Objectif L’absence de préparation du système de soins psychiatriques à l’épidémie de virus SARS-CoV-2 fait redouter fait redouter un scénario pessimiste pour la santé physique et mentale des patients suivis en psychiatrie. L’objectif de cet article est de proposer des éléments de guidance pour réorganiser les soins psychiatriques dans le contexte de pandémie Covid-19. Méthode Les auteurs ont réalisé une synthèse de la littérature internationale combinée au partage des expériences locales françaises. Résultats Les patients souffrant de troubles psychiques semblent particulièrement vulnérables à ce virus et à la pandémie : vulnérabilités liées aux comorbidités médicales, à l’âge, aux troubles cognitifs qui peuvent entraver le respect des consignes de confinement et aux complications psychosociales. Plusieurs initiatives ont été prises pour assurer la continuité des soins et contenir l’épidémie : création en psychiatrie d’unité Covid+ co-supervisée par des médecins généralistes ou internistes, restriction des consultations aux cas sévères et redéploiement des soins en téléconsultation, accompagnement de type case-management pour les sorties précoces ou l’impossibilité d’hospitaliser, accompagnements spécifiques pour les complications psychiques du confinement. Les populations suivies en pédopsychiatrie, en psychiatrie du sujet âgé, en addictologie ou détenues en prison doivent bénéficier d’une attention particulière. Plusieurs questions restent en suspend : la question de l’interaction négative ou positive des traitements sur l’infection SARS-CoV-2, l’épidémiologie de l’infection chez les personnes souffrant de troubles psychiques, leur adaptation à un confinement long. Discussion Une prise de conscience par les décideurs politiques de la grande vulnérabilité de ces populations et des institutions psychiatriques dans cette situation de catastrophe sanitaire est urgente. Objective The lack of ressources and coordination to face the epidemic of coronavirus raises concerns for the health of patients with mental disorders in a country where we keep in memory the dramatic experience of famine in psychiatric hospitals during the Second World War. This article aims at proposing guidance to ensure mental health care during the SARS-CoV epidemy in France. Methods Authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature and local initiatives in France. Results We identified four types of major vulnerabilities in patients suffering from mental disorders during this pandemic: (1) medical comorbidities that are more frequently found in patients suffering from mental disorders (cardiovascular and pulmonary pathologies, diabetes, obesity, etc.) which represent risk factors for severe infections with Covid-19; (2) age (the elderly constituting the population most vulnerable to coronavirus); (3) cognitive and behavioral troubles which can hamper compliance with confinement and hygiene measures and finally and (4) psychosocial vulnerability due to stigmatization and/or socio-economic difficulties. Furthermore, the mental health healthcare system is more vulnerable than other healthcare systems. Current government plans are poorly adapted to psychiatric establishments in a context of major shortage of organizational, material and human resources. In addition, a certain number of structural aspects make the psychiatric institution particularly vulnerable: many beds are closed, wards have a high density of patients, mental health community facilities are closed, medical teams are understaffed and poorly trained to face infectious diseases. We could also face major issues in referring patients with acute mental disorders to intensive care units. To maintain continuity of psychiatric care in this pandemic situation, several directions can be considered, in particular with the creation of Covid+ units. These units are under the dual supervision of a psychiatrist and of an internist/infectious disease specialist; all new entrants should be placed in quarantine for 14 days; the nurse staff should benefit from specific training, from daily medical check-ups and from close psychological support. Family visits would be prohibited and replaced by videoconference. At the end of hospitalization, in particular for the population of patients in compulsory ambulatory care situations, specific case-management should be organized with the possibility of home visits, in order to support them when they get back home and to help them to cope with the experience of confinement, which is at risk to induce recurrences of mental disorders. The total or partial closure of mental health community facilities is particularly disturbing for patients but a regular follow-up is possible with telemedicine and should include the monitoring of the suicide risk and psychoeducation strategies; developing support platforms could also be very helpful in this context. Private psychiatrists have also a crucial role of information with their patients on confinement and barrier measures, but also on measures to prevent the psychological risks inherent to confinement: maintenance of sleep regularity, physical exercise, social interactions, stress management and coping strategies, prevention of addictions, etc. They should also be trained to prevent, detect and treat early warning symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, because their prevalence was high in the regions of China most affected by the pandemic. Discussion French mental healthcare is now in a great and urgent need for reorganization and must also prepare in the coming days and weeks to face an epidemic of emotional disorders due to the containment of the general population.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.03.001,20200601.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

378,Immunopsychiatry and SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: Links and possible consequences,"Objectif La pandémie de SARS-CoV-2 (ou COVID-19) se propage depuis décembre 2019, et a été, comme attendu, accompagnée d’une augmentation drastique de la prévalence des troubles anxieux et dépressifs dans la population générale. Les traumatismes psychologiques peuvent bien sûr, expliquer une partie de ces troubles. Cependant, dans la mesure où les troubles psychiatriques sont également associés à une composante immuno-inflammatoire, les effets directs du virus sur le système immunitaire de l’hôte, avec une réponse inflammatoire marquée, mais également l’inflammation secondaire à ces facteurs de stress psychosociaux, peuvent entraîner l’apparition ou l’aggravation de pathologies psychiatriques. Cet article vise donc à identifier les possibles conséquences immuno-psychiatriques de la pandémie de SARS-CoV-2 qui pourraient être utiles en termes de dépistage et/ou de prise en charge. Méthode Nous nous sommes appuyés sur les données issues des précédentes pandémies et les données existantes à ce jour sur les conséquences psychopathologiques de la pandémie de SARS-CoV-2, pour réaliser une revue de la littérature narrative sur les possibles conséquences immuno-psychiatriques de la pandémie de SARS-CoV-2. Nous avons ciblé l’environnement gestationnel en raison des risques de troubles neuro-développementaux pour le fœtus, d’une part, et les enfants et adultes directement infectés avec les risques de développer des troubles psychiatriques, d’autre part. Résultats Comme durant les précédentes pandémies, l’activation du système immunitaire due au stress et/ou à l’infection pendant la grossesse pourrait conduire à un risque accru de troubles du neuro-développement chez le fœtus (schizophrénie et troubles du spectre de l’autisme). De plus, chez les individus exposés à des traumatismes psychologiques et/ou infectés par le virus, le risque de troubles psychiatriques, notamment de troubles de l’humeur, est probable. Conclusion Dans ce contexte, des mesures de dépistage et de prise en charge dédiées sont indispensables. Il est, de fait, important de proposer aux individus ayant été infectés par le virus, un suivi rapproché afin de mettre en place une prise en charge la plus précoce possible. De même chez les femmes enceintes, le dépistage de troubles de l’humeur pendant la grossesse ou en post-partum doit être facilité. Le suivi des bébés nés pendant la période pandémique doit être renforcé afin de dépister et de prendre en charge d’éventuels troubles du neuro-développement. Objective The SARS-CoV-2 (or COVID-19) pandemic has been propagating since December 2019, inducing a drastic increase in the prevalence of anxious and depressive disorders in the general population. Psychological trauma can partly explain these disorders. However, since psychiatric disorders also have an immuno-inflammatory component, the direct effects of the virus on the host's immune system, with a marked inflammatory response, but also the secondary inflammation to these psychosocial stressors, may cause the apparition or the worsening of psychiatric disorders. We describe here the probable immunopsychiatric consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, to delineate possible screening actions and care that could be planned. Method Data from previous pandemics, and existing data on the psychopathological consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, allowed us to review the possible immunopsychiatric consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, on the gestational environment, with the risk of consecutive neurodevelopmental disorders for the fetus on one hand, on the children and adults directly infected being at increased risks of psychiatric disorders on the other hand. Results As in previous pandemics, the activation of the immune system due to psychological stress and/or to infection during pregnancy, might lead to an increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders for the fetus (schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorders). Furthermore, in individuals exposed to psychological trauma and/or infected by the virus, the risk of psychiatric disorders, especially mood disorders, is probably increased. Conclusion In this context, preventive measures and specialized care are necessary. Thus, it is important to propose a close follow-up to the individuals who have been infected by the virus, in order to set up the earliest care possible. Likewise, in pregnant women, screening of mood disorders during the pregnancy or the postpartum period must be facilitated. The follow-up of the babies born during the pandemic must be strengthened to screen and care for possible neurodevelopmental disorders.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.07.002,20200101.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

En esta situación, el personal sanitario está viviendo altos niveles de estrés por la sobrecarga de trabajo y las condiciones de este. El objetivo del presente estudio fue evaluar los factores que pueden desestabilizar la salud mental de dichos profesionales en nuestro contexto. Materiales y métodos La muestra estuvo compuesta por 421 profesionales de la salud. Los datos se recogieron mediante un cuestionario online que se les envió a través del correo electrónico. Se empleó el DASS-21 para evaluar las variables de ansiedad, estrés y depresión, y la EAI para medir las dificultades con el sueño. Además, se recogieron otras variables descriptivas de la muestra que podrían estar relacionadas con estos niveles de sintomatología psicológica. Resultados Los resultados muestran que la pandemia de la COVID-19ha generado entre el personal sanitario síntomas de estrés, ansiedad, depresión e insomnio, con mayores niveles entre las mujeres y profesionales de más edad. Variables como haber estado en contacto con el virus o el miedo en el trabajo desencadenaron una mayor sintomatología. Conclusiones En esta situación crítica, el colectivo de profesionales se sitúa en primera línea, por lo que está expuesto directamente determinados riesgos y estresores. Esto contribuye a que desarrollen sintomatología psicológica diversa. Consecuentemente, se recomienda ofrecerles ayuda psicológica para reducir el impacto emocional del COVID-19 y asegurar así no solo su salud mental, sino también el adecuado cuidado que dispensan. Introduction After the outbreak of the COVID-19 was considered a global pandemic in March 2020, the state of alarm was declared in Spain. In this situation, health professionals are experiencing high levels of stress due to the overload of work the pandemic is generating and the conditions in which they are working. The aim of this study was to evaluate the factors that can destabilize the mental health of these professionals in our context. Materials and methods The sample was composed of 421 health professionals. The data were gathered by an online questionnaire sent to them by e-mail. The DASS-21 was used to assess anxiety, stress and depression, and the EAI to measure sleep difficulties. In addition, other descriptive variables that could be related to psychological symptomatology were collected from the sample. Results The results show that the COVID-19 pandemic has generated symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression and insomnia among health workers, with higher levels among women and older professionals. Some factors such as having been in contact with the virus or fear at work, triggered greater symptomatology. Conclusions In this critical situation, professionals are in the front line and therefore, are directly exposed to certain risks and stressors. This contributes to the development of diverse psychological symptoms. Consequently, it is recommended to offer them psychological help in order to reduce the emotional impact of the COVID-19, and thus, to ensure not only the mental health of our health professionals, but also the adequate care they provide.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rpsm.2020.05.004,20200101.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

383,"48th SME North American manufacturing research conference, NAMRC 48 (Cancelled due to COVID-19) influence of 3D topography on tribological behavior of grinding wheel","Grinding is extensively used as surface generation process in finishing operations, which makes it imperative that the generated surface adheres closely to strict quality check norms failing which the component will be rejected incurring a loss to the industry. To ensure the intended surface quality falls within tolerances, the grinding wheel plays an important role as an abrasive tool. The finished surface is a direct outcome of grinding wheel topography and its various microscopic interactions with the surface creating a compelling need for in-depth understanding. Study and characterization of grinding wheel topography in the present paper aim to understand the behavior of forces in the contact area. Due to stochastic abrasive grain distribution and quasi-static surface wear, 3-dimensional parameters hold a better physical significance in explaining the nature of microscopic interactions and their impact on the behavior of forces. Experiments are performed in a manner to wear out grinding wheels of the same specification with varying number of passes in an attempt to highlight the influence of varying topography on tribological interactions in the grind zone. The variation in topography at a specific interval of time is captured using a confocal laser scanning microscope and further processed for surface characterization whereas forces are captured using a dynamometer. SEM micrographs are presented to understand the type of wear on the wheel surface. The outcome of present paper enables to understand and report the surface interactions quantified in terms of cutting, ploughing and rubbing whereas surface parameters are characterized as per ISO 25178. The reasoning behind variations during surface interactions was discussed and interpretations were reported.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.080,20200101.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
384,"Multilevel Associations of Daily Skill Use and Effectiveness With Anxiety, Stress, and Depression in a Transdiagnostic Sample Undergoing Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Training","Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is effective at treating disorders of emotion dysregulation. However, it is unclear which mechanisms contribute to these effects. The aim of this study was to characterize the within-person associations of two theoretically relevant mechanisms of change, skill use and skill effectiveness, with anxiety, stress, and depression. Participants (n = 19, Mage = 31.8, 68% female) with a primary anxiety or depressive disorder completed daily reports (N = 1344) of DBT skill use, perceived effectiveness, anxiety, stress, and depression during a 16-session DBT skills training group. DBT skill use increased across treatment, p < .01, but effectiveness did not, p = .64. Within persons, participants used more skills on days with greater stress and anxiety, p < .01, which predicted next-day decreases in stress and anxiety, p = .03. On days when participants reported higher effectiveness, they used more skills than their personal average when experiencing more intense negative affect, p < .01. These results suggest using more skills, especially when used more effectively, is a mechanism by which DBT skills groups address emotional dysfunction for those with transdiagnostic emotional disorders.",Matthew W.

385,Sleeping for Two: Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial of cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia in pregnant women,"Insomnia and sleep disturbances are common in pregnancy and have potentially significant consequences for both maternal and infant health. There is limited research examining the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) during pregnancy. With increased distress and limited access to services during the COVID-19 pandemic, there is also an unprecedented need for telehealth delivery of treatment programs for pregnant women. The primary aim of the trial is to evaluate the impact of in-person or telehealth cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) versus a treatment as usual (TAU) control group in reducing symptoms of insomnia experienced in pregnancy. We hypothesize that participants who receive CBT-I delivered in person or via telehealth will report fewer insomnia symptoms. The secondary aims are to investigate if CBT-I versus TAU increases gestational length and reduces symptoms of depression. We hypothesize that receiving CBT-I will be associated with longer gestational length (as confirmed by public health records) and lower depressive symptoms.",Anna L.

Two participants with major depressive disorder were included in a 30-days observational ecological momentary assessment study just before the lockdown in Montreal, Canada. In both cases, the self-reported depressive symptoms and core affects fluctuated during the lockdown. However, all depressive symptoms were not systematically exacerbated. Among them, significant linear and non-linear temporal patterns have been identified. For case 1, the lockdown period did not worsen the sleep quality and sleep parameters. The psychomotor retardation, fatigue, appetite loss and level of arousal played a prominent role in the idiographic dynamic symptom networks. These case studies allow a granular understanding of the lockdown effects on depressive symptoms and affective experiences dynamics, and highlight the need for person-centered mental health care to help people with major depressive disorder.",Paquito Bernard et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46114-B73-F26,20200714.0,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; idiographic; sleep; insomnia; covid-19; depressive symptoms,PsyArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
387,Sociodemographic and psychological risk factors for anxiety and depression: Findings from the Covid-19 Health and Adherence Research in Scotland (CHARIS) cross-sectional survey THIS ARTICLE HAS BEEN PEER REVIEWED AND IS NOW AVAILABLE HERE: https://linkspringercom/article/101007/s12529-021-09967-z,"ABSTRACT Background: Investigations about mental health report prevalence rates with fewer studies investigating psychological and social factors influencing mental health during the Covid-19 pandemic. The aims of the study were to: (1) identify sociodemographic groups of the adult population at risk of anxiety and depression, and (2) determine if the following social and psychological risk factors for poor mental health moderated these direct sociodemographic effects: loneliness, social support, risk perception, and illness representations. Methods Cross sectional nationally representative telephone survey in Scotland in June 2020. If available, validated instruments were used for example, Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4) to measure anxiety and depression. Simple linear regressions followed by examination of moderation effect. Results 1006 participants; median age 53 years, 61.4% female, 3.8% in the most deprived and 15.6% in the most affluent areas. Analyses show associations of anxiety and depression with sociodemographic (age, gender, deprivation), social (social support, social isolation, loneliness) and psychological factors (perceived threat and illness representations). Mental health was poorer in younger adults, women and people living in the most deprived areas. Age effects were exaggerated by loneliness and illness representations, gender effects by loneliness and illness representations, and deprivation effects by loneliness, social support, illness representations and perceived threat. In each case, the moderating variables amplified the detrimental effects of the sociodemographic factors. Conclusions These findings confirm the results of previous studies about associations between sociodemographics and adult mental health. Loneliness, lack of social support and thoughts about Covid-19 exaggerated these effects and offer pointers for pre-emptive action.",Gill Hubbard et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461FE-9B3-409,20200911.0,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; public mental health; coronavirus; illness representations; risk perception; loneliness; social support,PsyArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
388,Correlates of Financial Concerns and Symptoms of Depression and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder in Impoverished Urban-dwelling Individuals in Bangladesh During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Face-to-face Interview Findings,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the physical, mental and financial health of many individuals. How substantially marginalized groups like impoverished urban-dwelling individuals are specifically impacted amid this pandemic is poorly understood. The present study aimed to investigate correlates of financial concerns and symptoms of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during the COVID-19 pandemic among impoverished urban-dwelling individuals residing in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted between August and September 2020 using face-to-face interviews in six disadvantaged neighborhoods (“slums”) in Dhaka. Individuals were interviewed using a structured questionnaire consisting of questions assessing socio-demographics, lifestyle, financial well-being relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, depression, and PTSD. Results: A total of 435 individuals (male=54.7%; mean age=45.0±12.0 years; age range=18-85 years) participated. Most (96.3%) reported that their household income decreased due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Associated factors included female gender, primary education, jobless, food scarcity, and depression. Depression symptoms were linked to female gender, being jobless, being divorced, living in a joint family, excessive sleep, and smoking. Low incomes, excessive sleep, joblessness, and food scarcity were positively associated with PTSD symptoms. In contrast, less sleep appeared protective against PTSD. Limitations: Potential limitations included cross-sectional study design and limited sample size. Conclusions: Public health initiatives, in particular mental health services, should be introduced to mitigate against psychological and financial effects of the pandemic on impoverished urban-dwelling individuals in Bangladesh.",Saiful Islam et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46157-0D3-AD5,20201108.0,PsyArXiv|Psychiatry,PsyArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

Using an online survey, we collected data on healthcare workers’ perception regarding COVID-19 exposure in a work unit. Workers’ depression, insomnia, and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Insomnia Severity Index, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale, respectively. Work-related stress and anxiety in response to the viral epidemic were measured using the Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemic-9 (SAVE-9) scale. We found that work-related stress and anxiety in response to the viral epidemic was associated with female sex, perception of the workplace as being dangerous, and depressive symptoms. Unhealthy behaviors, such as smoking and drinking as coping behaviors during the pandemic, were associated with male sex, young age, depression, and insomnia.

390,"Change in mental and physical health, and social relationships, during highly restrictive lockdown in the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from Australia","Background. A novel coronavirus first reported in Wuhan City in China in 2019 (COVID-19) developed into a global pandemic throughout 2020. Many countries around the world implemented strict social distancing policies to curb the spread of the virus. In this study we aimed to examine potential change in mental/physical health and social relationships during a highly restrictive COVID-19 lockdown period in Australia during April 2020. Methods. Our survey (n = 1599) included questions about concerns, social behaviour, perceived change in relationship quality, social media use, frequency of exercise, physical health, and mental health during COVID-19 lockdown (April, 2020). Results. When estimating their mental health for the previous year 13% of participants reported more negative than positive emotion, whereas this increased to 41% when participants reflected on their time during COVID-19 lockdown. A substantial proportion (39-54%) of participants reported deterioration in mental health, physical health, financial situation, and work productivity. However, most of these participants reported 'somewhat' rather than 'a lot' of deterioration, and many others reported 'no change' (40-50%) or even 'improvement' (6-17%). Therefore, the psychological toll on Australians may not have been as large as other parts of the world with greater COVID-19 infection rates. Even less impact was apparent for social relationships (~68% reported 'no change') as participants compensated for decreased face-to-face interaction via increased technology-mediated interaction. Our findings highlight how technology-mediated communication can allow people to adequately maintain social relationships during an extreme lockdown event.",Shane L.

391,COVID-19 and Student Well-being: Stress and Mental Health during Return-to-School,"Students have been multiply impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic: threats to their own and their family’s health, the closure of schools, and pivoting to online learning in March 2020, a long summer of physical distancing, and then the challenge of returning to school in fall 2020. As damaging as the physical health effects of a global pandemic are, much has been speculated about the “second wave” of mental health crises, particularly for school-aged children and adolescents. Yet, few studies have asked students about their experiences during the pandemic. The present study engaged with over two thousand (N = 2,310; 1288 female; Mage = 14.5) 12-18-year-old Alberta students during their first few weeks of return-to-school in fall 2020. Students completed an online survey that asked about their perceptions of COVID-19, their fall return-to-school experiences (84.9% returned in-person), their self-reported pandemic-related stress, and their behaviour, affect, and cognitive functioning in the first few weeks of September. The majority of students (84.9%) returned to school in person. Students reported moderate and equal concern for their health, family confinement, and maintaining social contact. Student stress levels were also above critical thresholds for 25 percent of the sample, and females and older adolescents (age 15-18 years) generally reported higher stress indicators as compared to males and younger (age 12-14 years) adolescents. Multivariate analysis showed that stress indicators were positively and significantly correlated with self-reported behavioural concerns (i.e., conduct problems, negative affect, and cognitive/inattention), and that stress arousal (e.g., sleep problems, hypervigilance) accounted for significant variance in behavioural concerns. Results are discussed in the context of how schools can provide both universal responses to students during COVID-19 knowing that most students are coping well, while some may require more targeted strategies to address stress arousal and heightened negative affect.",Kelly Dean Schwartz et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461F2-F8B-128,20201215.0,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Educational Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|School Psychology,PsyArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
392,The Benefits of Living with Close Others: A Longitudinal Examination of Mental Health Before and During a Global Stressor,"For better or worse, the people we live with may exert a powerful influence on our mental health, perhaps especially during times of stress. The COVID-19 pandemic—a large-scale stressor that prompted health recommendations to stay home to reduce disease spread—provided a unique opportunity to examine how the people we share our homes with may shape our mental health. A seven-wave longitudinal study assessed mental health month-to-month before and during the pandemic (February through September, 2020) in two diverse samples of U.S. adults (N=656; N=544). Pre-registered analyses demonstrated that people living with close others (children and/or romantic partners) experienced better well-being, before and during the pandemic’s first six months. These groups also experienced unique increases in ill-being during the pandemic’s onset, but parents’ ill-being also recovered more quickly.

393,A Perspective on Mature Gratitude as a Way of Coping with COVID-19,"Aim and Method: This perspective searches presents evidence of mature gratitude as a way of coping with the threats and boundaries of COVID-19. This narrative, non-systematic review will be based on studies from the COVID-19 period in association with more general literature on the characteristics of mature gratitude related to good mental health. Results: The results from the literature suggest that a confrontation with our existential vulnerability during a pandemic is not only a crisis but also an opportunity to view our lives in a different way. Mature gratitude, as proposed in this perspective, can help us in coping with the threats and boundaries that are part of our lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This time of crisis gives us the opportunity to self-reflect on our current life and plans for the future and to reframe them through a positive lens which can encourage individuals to actively strengthen their psychological resilience and coping skills. Conclusion: Cultivating an attitude of mature gratitude through actions of kindness, expressing being thankful for life and God, and enjoying all the small things in life helps in coping with the current threats of COVID-19 and building lifelong resilience for the future Knowledge about these associations can help psychologists, counselors, and coaches to support people who experience psychological issues due to the current pandemic and all crises to come.",Lilian Jans-Beken,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46133-92B-5AA,20201125.0,"PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Narrative Research; clinical psychology; virtues; character strengths; corona; positive psychology",PsyArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
394,The Psychological Impact of Threat & Lockdown During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"This study aimed to investigate the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health, particularly the effects of perceived threat and lockdown measures, and to elucidate individual and social factors exacerbating or mitigating its negative effects, particularly sense of control. An online survey was completed by participants (N=8,229) recruited from 79 countries. In line with pre-registered hypotheses, participants showed elevated levels of anxiety and depression worldwide. This poor mental health was predicted by perceived threat. The effect of threat on depression was further moderated by social isolation, but there was no effect of sense of control. Sense of control was low overall, and was predicted negatively by maladaptive coping, but positively by adaptive coping and the perception that the government is dealing with the outbreak. Social isolation increased with quarantine duration, but was mitigated by frequent communication with close ones. Engaging in individual actions to avoid contracting the virus was associated with higher anxiety, except when done professionally. We suggest that the psychological detrimental effects of the pandemic can be alleviated by individual actions such as maintaining frequent social contact and adaptive coping, and by governmental actions which demonstrate support in a public health crisis. Citizens and governments can work together to adapt better to restrictive but necessary measures during the current and future pandemics.",Valerie Van Mulukom et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/4617A-B65-F7C,20200722.0,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; government; sense of control; psychological well-being; lockdown; quarantine; anxiety; covid-19; survey; psychology; coronavirus; social isolation; depression; mental health,PsyArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
395,"‘Stressed, uncomfortable, vulnerable, neglected’: a qualitative study of the psychological and social impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on UK frontline keyworkers","Aims: Non-healthcare keyworkers face distinct occupational vulnerabilities that have received little consideration within broader debates about ‘essential’ work and psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study was therefore to explore the impact of the pandemic on the working lives and mental health and wellbeing of non-healthcare keyworkers in the UK. Methods: In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 23 participants employed in a range of non-healthcare keyworker occupations, including transport, retail, education, postal services and the police force. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed using a reflexive thematic approach. Results: Keyworkers experienced adverse psychological effects during the COVID-19 pandemic, including fears of COVID-19 exposure, contagion and subsequent transmission to others, especially their families. These concerns were often experienced in the context of multiple exposure risks, including insufficient PPE and a lack of workplace mitigation practices. Keyworkers also described multiple work-related challenges, including increased workload, a lack of public and organisational recognition and feelings of disempowerment. Conclusion: In efforts to reduce psychosocial concerns among non-healthcare keyworkers, there is a need for appropriate support during the COVID-19 pandemic and in preparation for other infections (e.g. seasonal influenza) in the future.

396,Decline in rate of divorce and separation filings in Denmark in 2020 compared to previous years,"The radical changes to everyday life brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and the closure of non-family social spheres in particular may have impacted marriage dynamics. We provide evidence on the monthly rates of initiation of divorce and separation filings in Denmark for the period 2016-2020 to examine how filing behavior changed during 2020 compared to the four previous years. Because filing rates precedes a divorce, rates reflect more precise the temporal dynamic of divorce initiation. Rates of initiation of divorce filings declined in 2020 to the lowest level in the period 2016-2020. On average, monthly rates in 2020 were 7 percent lower than 2019 rates and 20 percent lower than 2016 rates.

397,“My Husband Thinks I’m Crazy”: COVID-19-Related Conflict in Couples with Young Children,"Objective: We examine how disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic are creating conflicts for couples with young children. Background: National polls suggest that COVID-19 has led to increased conflict for couples in the U.S. Although scholars have not examined the source of these new conflicts, pre-pandemic research suggests that pandemic-related disruptions may create conflicts around paid work and parenting, economic security, politics, and health decision-making. Method: This study uses the Pandemic Parenting Study, a mixed-methods study of Southern Indiana mothers, conducted April-May 2020, and involving surveys (N=139), diary entries (N=104), and in-depth interviews (N=65). We examine mothers’ reports of pandemic-related changes in their frustrations with their partners and how those changes vary with the disruptions couples have experienced during the pandemic. We then use qualitative data to understand how pandemic-related disruptions are generating conflicts for couples and what consequences those conflicts have. Results: A substantial minority of mothers (39%) report pandemic-related increases in their frustrations with their partners. These frustrations are particularly common among mothers whose partners are (reportedly) providing insufficient support with pandemic parenting or dismissing mothers’ concerns about COVID-19. Mothers blame themselves for these conflicts and feel responsible for reducing them, including by leaving the workforce, beginning use of antidepressants, or ignoring their own concerns about COVID-19. Conclusion: The pandemic has exacerbated longstanding sources of conflict (related to partners’ insufficient support with parenting) and created new sources of conflict (related to partners’ dismissals of mothers’ concerns about COVID-19), with serious implications for mothers, families, and public health.",Jessica Mccrory Calarco et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46176-680-C96,20201009.0,SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family; relationships; work-family; family; conflict; health; decision-making; covid-19; parenthood,SocArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
398,How Does COVID-19 impact Students with Disabilities/Health Concerns?,"The impact of COVID-19 on students has been enormous, with an increase in worries about fiscal and physical health, a rapid shift to online learning, and increased isolation. In addition to these changes, students with disabilities/health concerns may face accessibility problems with online learning or communication tools, and their stress may be compounded by additional risks such as financial stress or pre-existing conditions. To our knowledge, no one has looked specifically at the impact of COVID-19 on students with disabilities/health concerns. In this paper, we present data from a survey of 147 students with and without disabilities collected in late March to early April of 2020 to assess the impact of COVID-19 on these students' education and mental health. Our findings show that students with disabilities/health concerns were more concerned about classes going online than their peers without disabilities. In addition, students with disabilities/health concerns also reported that they have experienced more COVID-19 related adversities compared to their peers without disabilities/health concerns. We argue that students with disabilities/health concerns in higher education need confidence in the accessibility of the online learning tools that are becoming increasingly prevalent in higher education not only because of COVID-19 but also more generally. In addition, educational technologies will be more accessible if they consider the learning context, and are designed to provide a supportive, calm, and connecting learning environment.","Zhang, Han; Nurius, Paula; Sefidgar, Yasaman; Morris, Margaret; Balasubramanian, Sreenithi; Brown, Jennifer; Dey, Anind K.; Kuehn, Kevin; Riskin, Eve; Xu, Xuhai; Mankoff, Jen",https://doi.org/nan,20200511.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
399,"Robot art, in the eye of the beholder?: Personalization through self-disclosure facilitates visual communication of emotions in representational art","Socially assistive robots could help to support people's well-being in contexts such as art therapy where human therapists are scarce, by making art such as paintings together with people in a way that is emotionally contingent and creative. However, current art-making robots are typically either contingent, controlled as a tool by a human artist, or creative, programmed to paint independently, possibly because some complex and idiosyncratic concepts related to art, such as emotion and creativity, are not yet well understood. For example, the role of personalized taste in forming beauty evaluations has been studied in empirical aesthetics, but how to generate art that appears to an individual to express certain emotions such as happiness or sadness is less clear. In the current article, a collaborative prototyping/Wizard of Oz approach was used to explore generic robot art-making strategies and personalization of art via an open-ended emotion profile intended to identify tricky concepts. As a result of conducting an exploratory user study, participants indicated some preference for a robot art-making strategy involving""visual metaphors""to balance exogenous and endogenous components, and personalized representational sketches were reported to convey emotion more clearly than generic sketches. The article closes by discussing personalized abstract art as well as suggestions for richer art-making strategies and user models. Thus, the main conceptual advance of the current work lies in suggesting how an interactive robot can visually express emotions through personalized art; the general aim is that this could help to inform next steps in this promising area and facilitate technological acceptance of robots in everyday human environments.","Cooney, Martin",https://doi.org/nan,20200508.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
400,What are We Depressed about When We Talk about COVID19: Mental Health Analysis on Tweets Using Natural Language Processing,"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) recently has affected human life to a great extent. Besides direct physical and economic threats, the pandemic also indirectly impact people's mental health conditions, which can be overwhelming but difficult to measure. The problem may come from various reasons such as unemployment status, stay-at-home policy, fear for the virus, and so forth. In this work, we focus on applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze tweets in terms of mental health. We trained deep models that classify each tweet into the following emotions: anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise and trust. We build the EmoCT (Emotion-Covid19-Tweet) dataset for the training purpose by manually labeling 1,000 English tweets. Furthermore, we propose and compare two methods to find out the reasons that are causing sadness and fear.","Li, Irene; Li, Yixin; Li, Tianxiao; Alvarez-Napagao, Sergio; Garcia, Dario",https://doi.org/nan,20200422.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

In addition to supporting the original adolescent resilience chatbot, the architecture has been reused to create a 3-week 'stress-detox' intervention for undergraduates, and subsequently for a chatbot to support young people with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, with all three systems having been used in field trials. The Headstrong architecture illustrates the feasibility of creating a domain-focused authoring environment in the context of e-therapy that supports non-technical expert input and rapid deployment.","Holt-Quick, Chester; Warren, Jim; Stasiak, Karolina; Williams, Ruth; Christie, Grant; Hetrick, Sarah; Hopkins, Sarah; Cargo, Tania; Merry, Sally",https://doi.org/nan,20200515.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
403,Visualising COVID-19 Research,"The world has seen in 2020 an unprecedented global outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, a new strain of coronavirus, causing the COVID-19 pandemic, and radically changing our lives and work conditions. Many scientists are working tirelessly to find a treatment and a possible vaccine. Furthermore, governments, scientific institutions and companies are acting quickly to make resources available, including funds and the opening of large-volume data repositories, to accelerate innovation and discovery aimed at solving this pandemic. In this paper, we develop a novel automated theme-based visualisation method, combining advanced data modelling of large corpora, information mapping and trend analysis, to provide a top-down and bottom-up browsing and search interface for quick discovery of topics and research resources. We apply this method on two recently released publications datasets (Dimensions' COVID-19 dataset and the Allen Institute for AI's CORD-19). The results reveal intriguing information including increased efforts in topics such as social distancing; cross-domain initiatives (e.g. mental health and education); evolving research in medical topics; and the unfolding trajectory of the virus in different territories through publications. The results also demonstrate the need to quickly and automatically enable search and browsing of large corpora. We believe our methodology will improve future large volume visualisation and discovery systems but also hope our visualisation interfaces will currently aid scientists, researchers, and the general public to tackle the numerous issues in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bras, Pierre Le; Gharavi, Azimeh; Robb, David A.; Vidal, Ana F.; Padilla, Stefano; Chantler, Mike J.",https://doi.org/nan,20200513.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

The published academic literature that is written in English and available for access on online databases was reviewed to develop key take-aways and a framework for discussing how to enhance people's well-being in the COVID-19 lockdown. Interaction with other players in virtual communities has been found to have a positive influence on the mental health of those suffering from a lack of societal connection. A framework for further research has also been developed that focuses on the critical situation of the COVID-19 lockdown,as this is an urgent topic with a huge impact on our health.Some gaming service providers have been proactive in redesigning game programming to be suitable for the lockdown situation, and this enables players to enjoy physical activities even at home.","Oe, Hiroko",https://doi.org/nan,20200501.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

These negative emotions are strengthened due to the obligatory lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Previous research indicates association among the use of social media, university satisfaction, and the aforementioned emotions. We report findings from 248 international undergraduates in The Netherlands, all students at the International School of Business. Our results indicate strong correlations between anxiety, loneliness, and COVID-19-related stress with university satisfaction together with social capital.

406,"Universal Masking is Urgent in the COVID-19 Pandemic: SEIR and Agent Based Models, Empirical Validation, Policy Recommendations","We present two models for the COVID-19 pandemic predicting the impact of universal face mask wearing upon the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus--one employing a stochastic dynamic network based compartmental SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) approach, and the other employing individual ABM (agent-based modelling) Monte Carlo simulation--indicating (1) significant impact under (near) universal masking when at least 80% of a population is wearing masks, versus minimal impact when only 50% or less of the population is wearing masks, and (2) significant impact when universal masking is adopted early, by Day 50 of a regional outbreak, versus minimal impact when universal masking is adopted late. These effects hold even at the lower filtering rates of homemade masks. To validate these theoretical models, we compare their predictions against a new empirical data set we have collected that includes whether regions have universal masking cultures or policies, their daily case growth rates, and their percentage reduction from peak daily case growth rates. Results show a near perfect correlation between early universal masking and successful suppression of daily case growth rates and/or reduction from peak daily case growth rates, as predicted by our theoretical simulations. Our theoretical and empirical results argue for urgent implementation of universal masking. As governments plan how to exit societal lockdowns, it is emerging as a key NPI; a""mouth-and-nose lockdown""is far more sustainable than a""full body lockdown"", on economic, social, and mental health axes. An interactive visualization of the ABM simulation is at http://dek.ai/masks4all. We recommend immediate mask wearing recommendations, official guidelines for correct use, and awareness campaigns to shift masking mindsets away from pure self-protection, towards aspirational goals of responsibly protecting one's community.","Kai, De; Goldstein, Guy-Philippe; Morgunov, Alexey; Nangalia, Vishal; Rotkirch, Anna",https://doi.org/nan,20200422.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18

We collected 22 million Twitter messages related to the COVID-19 pandemic using a list of 25 hashtags such as""coronavirus,""""COVID-19,""""quarantine""from March 1 to April 21 in 2020. We used a machine learning approach, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to identify popular unigram, bigrams, salient topics and themes, and sentiments in the collected Tweets. Popular unigrams included""virus,""""lockdown,""and""quarantine.""Popular bigrams included""COVID-19,""""stay home,""""corona virus,""""social distancing,""and""new cases.""We identified 13 discussion topics and categorized them into different themes, such as""Measures to slow the spread of COVID-19,""""Quarantine and shelter-in-place order in the U.S.,""""COVID-19 in New York,""""Virus misinformation and fake news,""""A need for a vaccine to stop the spread,""""Protest against the lockdown,""and""Coronavirus new cases and deaths.""The dominant sentiments for the spread of coronavirus were anticipation that measures that can be taken, followed by a mixed feeling of trust, anger, and fear for different topics. The public revealed a significant feeling of fear when they discussed the coronavirus new cases and deaths. The study concludes that Twitter continues to be an essential source for infodemiology study by tracking rapidly evolving public sentiment and measuring public interests and concerns. Already emerged pandemic fear, stigma, and mental health concerns may continue to influence public trust when there occurs a second wave of COVID-19 or a new surge of the imminent pandemic. Hearing and reacting to real concerns from the public can enhance trust between the healthcare systems and the public as well as prepare for a future public health emergency.","Xue, Jia; Chen, Junxiang; Hu, Ran; Chen, Chen; Zheng, ChengDa; Zhu, Tingshao",https://doi.org/nan,20200526.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
408,"Phylogenetic analyses of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 reflected the several routes of introduction to Taiwan, the United States, and Japan","Worldwide Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is disrupting in the economy and anxiety of people. The public anxiety has increased the psychological burden on government and healthcare professionals, resulting in a government worker suicide in Japan. The terrified people are asking the government for border measures. However, are border measures possible for this virus? By analyzing 48 almost complete virus genome sequences, we found out that the viruses that invaded Taiwan, the United States, and Japan were introduced independently. We identified thirteen parsimony-informative sites and three groups (CTC, TCC, and TCT). Viruses found outside China did not form a monophyletic clade, opposite to previous study. These results suggest the difficulty of implementing effective border measures against this virus.","Matsuda, Tomoko; Suzuki, Hikoyu; Ogata, Norichika",https://doi.org/nan,20200220.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
409,Detection and Estimation of Local Signals,"We study the maximum score statistic to detect and estimate local signals in the form of change-points in the level, slope, or other property of a sequence of observations, and to segment the sequence when there appear to be multiple changes. We find that when observations are serially dependent, the change-points can lead to upwardly biased estimates of autocorrelations, resulting in a sometimes serious loss of power. Examples involving temperature variations, the level of atmospheric greenhouse gases, suicide rates and daily incidence of COVID-19 illustrate the general theory.","Fang, Xiao; Siegmund, David",https://doi.org/nan,20200417.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
410,Symptom extraction from the narratives of personal experiences with COVID-19 on Reddit,"Social media discussion of COVID-19 provides a rich source of information into how the virus affects people's lives that is qualitatively different from traditional public health datasets. In particular, when individuals self-report their experiences over the course of the virus on social media, it can allow for identification of the emotions each stage of symptoms engenders in the patient. Posts to the Reddit forum r/COVID19Positive contain first-hand accounts from COVID-19 positive patients, giving insight into personal struggles with the virus. These posts often feature a temporal structure indicating the number of days after developing symptoms the text refers to. Using topic modelling and sentiment analysis, we quantify the change in discussion of COVID-19 throughout individuals' experiences for the first 14 days since symptom onset. Discourse on early symptoms such as fever, cough, and sore throat was concentrated towards the beginning of the posts, while language indicating breathing issues peaked around ten days. Some conversation around critical cases was also identified and appeared at a roughly constant rate. We identified two clear clusters of positive and negative emotions associated with the evolution of these symptoms and mapped their relationships. Our results provide a perspective on the patient experience of COVID-19 that complements other medical data streams and can potentially reveal when mental health issues might appear.","Murray, Curtis; Mitchell, Lewis; Tuke, Jonathan; Mackay, Mark",https://doi.org/nan,20200521.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
411,Covid-19 et remaniement des défenses contre la dépression chez les soignants en Ehpad,"Résumé Les réponses des Ehpad à la pandémie et au confinement actuel révèlent et amplifient les défenses habituelles des soignants contre la dépression. Le fait que le danger de mort et l’obligation d’enfermer les résidents viennent de l’extérieur, et le maniement permanent des mesures de protection physique ne suppriment pas le sentiment d’inutilité et l’angoisse de mort qu’ils tolèrent ou évitent d’ordinaire. L’auteur montre qu’ils ajoutent au contraire à leur inquiétude et par conséquent à leur besoin de parole et d’écoute. Summary The responses of nursing homes to the present pandemic and lock-down reveal and amplify the usual defensive mechanisms deployed by professional caregivers against depression. The danger of death and the need to confine the residents, both coming from the outside world, and the permanent management of physical protective measures do not remove the feeling of uselessness and the anxiety of death that the nursing staff habitually tolerates or avoids. On the contrary, these aspects add to caregivers’ need to talk and be listened to.","Charazac, P.

412,What does social distancing mean for patients in forensic mental health settings?,"Governments across the globe have called for social distancing measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Secure settings will not be able to comply with these strictly, nor will they have the same recourse to the novel and creative solutions the general population does. Activities have been restricted in quality, quantity and scope; transfers and discharges have been halted and patient progress put on pause. Understanding how and what ways these restrictions will affect patients is crucial. This is especially salient given that large numbers of the general population have reported heightened mental health burden in recent surveys. However, it is not yet clear how and in what ways the COVID-19 restrictions will affect the mental health of patients in secure care. Past research investigating patients experiences of restrictions on autonomy in secure care that were present before the pandemic can be helpful here. Studies suggest that patient experience restrictions in care in myriad subjective ways. These include limitations on family contact, outside leave, and making hot drinks but also more profoundly on their autonomy, sense of self, and personhood. Quantitative studies have found correlations between experiences of restrictiveness and ward atmosphere, quality of life, suicidal ideation, depression and general psychological state in this patient group. This paper suggests how we can use past research exploring patient expereinces of restrictive interventions to guide the implementation of social distancing measures in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Tomlin, Dr Jack",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsiml.2020.100018,20200428.0,,Elsevier; PMC; WHO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
413,"Enfermement carcéral, confinement socio-sanitaire et moyens d’évasionDanser sa peine et au-delà…","Abstract Jail incarceration and social confinement due to a sanitary stay-at-home law against the ongoing covid-19 pandemic are compared through the introduction of dance workshops for imprisoned women charged with long sentences, then followed by an outside performance Soul Kitchen. The whole experience, organized by a famous contemporary choreographer Angelin Preljocaj, is filmed by Valérie Müller, producing Danser sa peine (To dance her sentence / her sorrow), nominated for an award. The sessions are planned: two hours and a half, 2 times a week, for four months, no technique required. A group of five women starts with ordinary easy functional movements, gaining in innovative and expressive qualities, spatial perceptions, feelings and interpersonal interactions, leaded by A. Preljocaj in a helpful and empathic mood. At the same time, he discovers the cooking authorization in their jail cell. The relevant results shift into a dynamic successful piece Soul Kitchen (2019) performed in town (Dance Festival in Montpellier, south of France) with dancing and cooking occurrences on stage. It makes sense, specially about self-esteem, body image and positive opinion from the audience. The women’s physical and psychological states linked with a long lack of space and sensitivity… move to a better self-balance and feelings of well-being. In a similar state of mind, the French confined population – youth to elderly–try to find different and imaginative strategies at home as moving in a restrictive area, enjoying family cooking… through trainings provided by Internet, looking for reducing anxiety, depressive disorders and other social problems.

414,Panique et pandémie: revue de la littérature sur les liens entre le trouble panique et l'épidémie à SARS-CoV-2,"Résumé L’état de panique associé à la pandémie liée au SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) incite à s’interroger sur les troubles anxieux que cette situation pourrait générer ou aggraver. Si la littérature a déjà fourni des projections généralistes en la matière, les données concrètes concernent à ce stage davantage le trouble de stress post-traumatique et le trouble obsessionnel compulsif, tandis que quelques évaluations s’intéressent au cadre nosographie du trouble anxieux généralisé. Le trouble panique ne se voit que peu ou pas cité et l’évocation de la « panique », au sens social, la supplante largement. Bien que d’une légitimité clinique encore débattue, le trouble panique qualifié de « respiratoire » pourrait se voir augmenter en nombre et/ou être intensifié chez les patients qui en présentent déjà. D’éventuelles situations co-morbides entre un tel trouble et la COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) doivent inciter à certaines précautions en matière de prescriptions médicamenteuses, notamment en lien avec les traitements, ou situations, sources d’hypokaliémie : (i) le salbutamol, source potentielle de surconsommation, notamment chez les patients anxieux, (ii) l’infection par le SARS-CoV-2 et plus encore en cas de diarrhées et/ou vomissements. L’hypokaliémie est associée à un risque accru de torsade de pointe, il convient donc également d’être prudent en matière de prescription de psychotropes à risque : comme avec le citalopram et l’escitalopram, des antidépresseurs indiqués dans le trouble panique, ou encore l’hydroxyzine, à visée anxiolytique. Ces données sont de nature à resituer l’importance de la prise en considération du trouble panique dans le cadre de la pandémie en cours. Abstract Although the ‘panic’ word has been abundantly linked to the SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) pandemic in the press, in the scientific literature very few studies have considered whether the current epidemic could predispose to the onset or the aggravation of panic attacks or panic disorder. Indeed, most studies thus far have focused on the risk of increase and aggravation of other psychiatric disorders as a consequence of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Yet, risk of onset or aggravation of panic disorder, especially the subtype with prominent respiratory symptoms, which is characterized by a fear response conditioning to interoceptive sensations (e.g., respiratory), and hypervigilance to these interoceptive signals, could be expected in the current situation. Indeed, respiratory symptoms, such as coughs and dyspnea, are among the most commonly associated with the SARS-CoV-2 (59-82 % and 31-55 %, respectively), and respiratory symptoms are associated with a poor illness prognosis. Hence given that some etiological and maintenance factors associated with panic disorder – i.e., fear conditioning to abnormal breathing patterns attributable or not to the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), as well as hypervigilance towards breathing abnormalities – are supposedly more prevalent, one could expect an increased risk of panic disorder onset or aggravation following the COVID-19 epidemic in people who were affected by the virus, but also those who were not. In people with the comorbidity (i.e., panic disorder or panic attacks and the COVID-19), it is particularly important to be aware of the risk of hypokalemia in specific at-risk situations or prescriptions. For instance, in the case of salbutamol prescription, which might be overly used in patients with anxiety disorders and COVID-19, or in patients presenting with diarrhea and vomiting. Hypokalemia is associated with an increased risk of torsade de pointe, thus caution is required when prescribing specific psychotropic drugs, such as the antidepressants citalopram and escitalopram, which are first-line treatments for panic disorder, but also hydroxyzine, aiming at anxiety reduction. The results reviewed here highlight the importance of considering and further investigating the impact of the current pandemic on the diagnosis and treatment of panic disorder (alone or comorbid with the COVID-19).","Javelot, H; Weiner, L",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.05.010,20200521.0,,Elsevier; PMC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,,,,False,False,False,,2021-03-18
