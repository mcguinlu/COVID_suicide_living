20,Psychological and Ocular Surface State of Ophthalmologists and Ophthalmic Nurses Working With Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019,"Importance: The influence on the psychology and ocular surface of ophthalmologists and ophthalmic nurses in Wuhan, China, during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is not yet fully understood. Objective: To characterize mental state and ocular surface state of ophthalmologists and ophthalmic nurses in Wuhan, China, and similar areas during the COVID-19 outbreak. Design, Setting, and Participants: This survey study assessed ophthalmologists and ophthalmic nurses in Wuhan, China, and Jiangxi, China, a province approximately 300 km south of Wuhan. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Van Dream Anxiety Scale, and the Ocular Surface Disease Index were used to conduct questionnaire surveys via a messaging and social media app. Main Outcomes and Measures: Mean scores from the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (0-10 points), the Van Dream Anxiety Scale (0-100 points), and the Ocular Surface Disease Index (0-100 points). Results: Of 126 individuals, there were 42 ophthalmologists (33.3%) and 21 ophthalmic nurses (16.7%) from Wuhan and 42 ophthalmologists (33.3%) and 21 nurses (16.7%) from Jiangxi. The mean (SD) age of ophthalmologists was 36.1 (7.6) years in Wuhan and 41.2 (8.8) years in Jiangxi. For ophthalmic nurses, the mean (SD) age was 35.2 (7.4) years in Wuhan and 33.4 (7.9) years in Jiangxi. The response rate for ophthalmologists was 90.3% (84 of 93) and for nurses was 91.3% (42 of 46). The participation rate of ophthalmologists and nurses in Wuhan was 0.06% (42 of 70â<U+0080>¯000) and 0.07% (21 of 30â<U+0080>¯000), respectively; the participation rate in Jiangxi was 0.06% (42 of 70â<U+0080>¯000; 21 of 35â<U+0080>¯000) for both groups. In Wuhan, the mean (SD) Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (anxiety and depression were counted as separate scores), Van Dream Anxiety Scale, and the Ocular Surface Disease Index scores were 6.90 (2.30), 7.38 (2.19), 24.52 (5.86), and 43.90 (3.74), respectively, in ophthalmologists and 8.67 (3.04), 9.38 (2.64), 21.48 (6.15), and 40.05 (6.67), respectively, in ophthalmic nurses. In Jiangxi, these scores were 5.67 (2.89), 4.90 (3.15), 12.76 (7.27), and 38.79 (7.78), respectively, in ophthalmologists and 4.67 (3.20), 4.33 (3.23), 10.10 (7.62), and 41.52 (5.92), respectively, in ophthalmic nurses. The difference (95% CI) between the 2 regions for these scores in ophthalmologists was 2.48 (95% CI, 1.30-3.65), 11.76 (95% CI, 8.90-14.63), 5.12 (95% CI, 2.45-7.79), and 5.12 (95% CI, 2.47-7.77), respectively, and in ophthalmic nurses was 4.16 (95% CI, 2.05-5.95), 5.05 (95% CI, 3.21-6.89), 11.38 (95% CI, 7.06-15.70), and -1.48 (95% CI, -5.41 to 2.25), respectively. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that ophthalmologists and ophthalmic nurses in Wuhan experienced more anxiety and depression and reported greater ocular surface abnormalities than counterparts outside of Wuhan, but the wide CIs preclude concluding confidently that there were differences.","Shao, Yi; Zhang, Wei",https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2020.2289,,Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JAMA Ophthalmol;2020 Jul 09.; Publication details: JAMA Ophthalmol;2020 Jul 09.; Publication type: article,WHO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-14

In this observational retrospective study, the patients of our Obesity Unit were invited to answer to a 12-question multiple-choice questionnaire relative to weight changes, working activity, exercise, dietary habits, and conditions potentially impacting on nutritional choices. A multivariate regression analysis was performed to evaluate the associations among weight/BMI changes and the analyzed variables. A total of 150 subjects (91.5%) completed the questionnaire. Mean self-reported weight gain was &#8776;1.5 kg (p < 0.001). Lower exercise, self-reported boredom/solitude, anxiety/depression, enhanced eating, consumption of snacks, unhealthy foods, cereals, and sweets were correlated with a significantly higher weight gain. Multiple regression analyses showed that increased education (inversely, ß = -1.15; 95%CI -2.13, -0.17, p = 0.022), self-reported anxiety/depression (ß = 1.61; 0.53, 2.69, p = 0.004), and not consuming healthy foods (ß = 1.48; 0.19, 2.77, p = 0.026) were significantly associated with increased weight gain. The estimated direct effect of self-reported anxiety/depression on weight was 2.07 kg (1.07, 3.07, p < 0.001). Individuals with obesity significantly gained weight 1 month after the beginning of the quarantine. The adverse mental burden linked to the COVID-19 pandemic was greatly associated with increased weight gain.","Pellegrini, Marianna; Ponzo, Valentina; Rosato, Rosalba; Scumaci, Elena; Goitre, Ilaria; Benso, Andrea; Belcastro, Sara; Crespi, Chiara; De Michieli, Franco; Ghigo, Ezio; Broglio, Fabio; Bo, Simona",https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu12072016,,Country: CH; SUÍÇA; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Nutrients;12(7)2020 Jul 07.; Publication details: Nutrients;12(7)2020 Jul 07.; Publication type: article,WHO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-14
22,"Another invisible enemy indoors: COVID-19, human health, the home, and United States indoor air policy","After the emergence of the respiratory virus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), many exposure and environmental health scientists promptly recognized the potentially catastrophic public health ramifications of concurrent infectious and air pollution-mediated disease. Nevertheless, much of this attention has been focused on outdoor interactions. Each year, 3.8 million people worldwide prematurely die from illnesses attributable to indoor air. Hence, poor household indoor air quality is a long-standing public health issue with even greater relevance now that many individuals are spending more time at home. At present, the Environmental Protection Agency does not regulate indoor air, and state-level legislation has resulted in a patchwork of national coverage. Here, we describe common sources of indoor air pollution, the health impacts of indoor pollutants, and populations disparately impacted by COVID-19 and poor indoor air quality. Furthermore, we detail the need for better legislation that promotes the integrity of the indoor air environment, and what individuals can do to personally protect themselves as we await more comprehensive indoor air legislation.","Nwanaji-Enwerem, Jamaji C; Allen, Joseph G; Beamer, Paloma I",https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41370-020-0247-x,,Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Expo Sci Environ Epidemiol;2020 Jul 08.; Publication details: J Expo Sci Environ Epidemiol;2020 Jul 08.; Publication type: article,WHO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-14
23,“I feel like death on legs”: COVID-19 isolation and mental health,"This study investigates the personal and collective responses to COVID-19, as it is described in personal stories and newspaper reports and examines the social and economic impact of the pandemic on different societies  Although some studies have been done on the impact of COVID-19, these studies focus on epidemiology, the importance of language diversity and reflections on the pandemic  None of the studies so far have focused specifically on the impact the coronavirus has had on different societies because of the global lockdown and restrictions on people’s movements  This study attempts to address this gap in the literature by focusing on how the language used in personal stories and newspaper reports reveal the impact of COVID-19 on different societies by investigating how self-isolation and lockdown measures is leading to mental health breakdown in individuals and affecting wider social and economic collapse  Prior literature (Gortner and Pennebaker, 2003) suggests that the media generally parallel society’s psychological response to traumatic events making newspapers an important collective resource similar to personal stories  The scale of the pandemic is such that it has been likened to a situation of war  In this climate, where the response to the pandemic is analogous to fighting a war, it was interesting to see what effect the enforced lockdown has on people’s mental health well-being and what priorities the media focus on  Smith, Anderson-Hanley, Langrock, and Compas (2005) have shown that language use in descriptions of traumatic experiences can shed insight into successful and unsuccessful coping strategies  I have therefore chosen to look at two different countries, Sri Lanka and Britain in order to investigate the following research questions: (1) Is self-isolation due to COVID-19 having an effect on mental health in Britain? And (2) What are the priorities of different countries during the crisis as evident in newspaper reports? To answer these two research questions, I have collected a small corpus of personal stories from Britain and two small corpora of newspaper reports from Britain and Sri Lanka over a span of one month  The data was analysed using corpus linguistics methodology such as keyword analysis of the two newspaper reports using AntConc (Anthony, 2019) and the personal stories were analysed using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) (Pennebaker, 2015)  The findings from LIWC shows that the enforced self-isolation is leading to mental health breakdown but that there are also positive emotions of the desire to help and solidarity with others  The analysis of the news reports show that Britain’s priorities are centered on the government’s handling of the crisis and the economy whereas Sri Lankan newspapers focus on educating people about the dangers of COVID-19","Herat, Manel",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssaho.2020.100042,,Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Social Sciences & Humanities Open;2020.; Publication details: Social Sciences & Humanities Open;2020.; Publication type: article,WHO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-14
24,"PSYCOVID-19, psychological support device in the fields of mental health, somatic and medico-social; PSYCOVID-19, dispositif de soutien psychologique dans les champs de la santé mentale, du somatique et du médico-social","In December 2019 the World Health Organization (WHO) recorded the first cases of an infectious disease that appeared in China in November of the same year. Generated by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV2, it is quickly named COVID-19 for COronaVirus Infectious Disease 2019. The spread of this unknown disease will soon have worldwide consequences: the contagiousness of the virus is extremely high and potentially lethal. In France, the population initially reacted with disbelief until the disease reached Europe and the first cases appeared on French territory, at the end of January. A few weeks later, on 16 March 2020, President Macron declared the country “at war” against COVID-19. The next day the population was placed in lockdown. At the present time, the country's activity is at a standstill. Schools, businesses and shops are closed. The French citizens are astounded. They suddenly have to face fear: fear of falling ill or that a close relative may fall ill, fear of being locked up and experiencing restrictions of liberties, fear of economic precariousness. And, above all, fear of uncertainty. In order to prevent the mental consequences of this crisis, psychological support units have been created with urgency at national scale. These units are intended to support the healthcare professionals as well as the patients and more broadly, the general population. The unit responsible for the department of Gironde has been set up quickly, over the weekend of March 21, 2020. The COVIDPSY33 listening unit has thus been created in Bordeaux by the Charles Perrens Hospital with support from the Agence Régionale de Santé Nouvelle-Aquitaine (ARS). Simultaneously, the PSYCOVID-19 unit was created. This additional unit works in collaboration with the COVIDPSY33 platform and offers psychological assistance to the general population and caregivers in the sectors of Bordeaux Rive Droite, Bordeaux Gare, Rives de Garonne, Rives d'Arcins and Sud Gironde. It thus covers an area equivalent to approximately half of Gironde, the largest department in metropolitan France.

Since the containment precautions also concern sport-related activities, home workout remained the only possibility to play sports and stay active during the pandemic. The present study aimed to examine changes in the physical activity levels during self-quarantine in Italy, and the impact of exercise on psychological health. A total of 2974 Italian subjects has completed an online survey, but only 2524 subjects resulted eligible for this study. The questionnaire measured the total weekly physical activity energy expenditure before and during quarantine (i.e. the sum of walking, moderate-intensity physical activities, and vigorous-intensity physical activities) in Metabolic Equivalent Task minutes per week (MET–min/wk) using an adapted version of International Physical Activity Questionnaire and their psychological well-being using the Psychological General Well Being Index. Of the 2524 Italian subjects included in the study, 1426 were females (56.4%) and 1098 males (43.6%). Total physical activity significantly decreased between before and during COVID-19 pandemic (Mean: 2429 vs. 1577 MET–min/wk, ****p &lt; 0.0001), in all age groups and especially in men (Female, mean: 1994 vs. 1443 MET–min/wk, ****p &lt; 0.0001; Male, mean: 2998 vs. 1754 MET–min/wk, ****p &lt; 0.0001). Furthermore, a significant positive correlation was found between the variation of physical activity and mental well-being (r = 0.07541, ***p = 0.0002), suggesting that the reduction of total physical activity had a profoundly negative impact on psychological health and well-being of population. Based on this scientific evidence, maintaining a regular exercise routine is a key strategy for physical and mental health during a forced rest period like the current coronavirus emergency.","Maugeri, Grazia; Castrogiovanni, Paola; Battaglia, Giuseppe; Pippi, Roberto; D'Agata, Velia; Palma, Antonio; Di Rosa, Michelino; Musumeci, Giuseppe",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e04315,,Database: ELSEVIER; Publication details: Heliyon;6(6)20200601.; Publication details: Heliyon;6(6)20200601.; Publication type: article,WHO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-14

29,[Telepsychiatry in adults and adolescents: a useful tool against CoViD-19],"CoViD-19 is a disease caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), originated from China in December 2019. In March 2020, CoViD-19 was declared a pandemic, having spread all over the word. The psychological impact of CoViD-19 disease must be recognized alongside the physical symptoms for all those affected. Furhermore quarantine for coronavirus has serious psychological side effects, such as depression and anxiety that are more likely to occur and worsen. Furhermore quarantine reduces the availability of psychiatric and psychological interventions. The evidence base for telepsychiatry is growing in adults and adolescents. A growing body of literature suggests that use of telepsychiatry to provide mental health services has the potential to remove geographic barriers between patients and providers and improves quality care. It has increased the volume of patients that physicians can reach and diagnose, as well as allowing them to treat patients.","Prisco, Prisco, Donnarumma",https://doi.org/10.1701/3407.33923,20200713.0,,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-14
30,Belief in Conspiracy Theory about COVID-19 Predicts Mental Health and Well-being: A Study of Healthcare Staff in Ecuador,"Social media are becoming hotbeds of conspiracy theories, which aim to give resolute explanations on the cause of COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, no research has investigated whether individuals' belief in conspiracy theory about COVID-19 is associated with mental health and well-being issues. This association enables an assessable channel to identify and reach people with mental health and well-being issues during the pandemic. We aim to provide the first evidence of belief in conspiracy theory regarding the COVID-19 virus as a predictor of the mental health and well-being of healthcare workers. We conducted a survey of 252 healthcare workers in Ecuador from April 10 to May 2, 2020. We analyzed the data of distress and anxiety caseness with logistic regression and life and job satisfaction with linear regression. Among the sampled healthcare workers in Ecuador, 24.2% believed that the virus was developed intentionally in a lab; 32.54% experienced distress disorder, and 28.17% had anxiety disorder. Compared to healthcare workers who were not sure where the virus originated, those who believed the virus was developed intentionally in a lab were more likely to have distress disorder and anxiety disorder and had lower levels of job satisfaction and life satisfaction. This paper identifies belief in a COVID-19 conspiracy theory as an important predictor of distress, anxiety, and job and life satisfaction of healthcare workers. It enables mental health services to better target and help mentally vulnerable healthcare workers during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Chen, Zhang, Jahanshahi, Alvarez-Risco, Dai, Li, Ibarra",https://doi.org/10.2196/20737,20200713.0,,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-14
31,COVID-19 and telepsychiatry: an evidence-based guidance for clinicians,"COVID-19 presents unique challenges in healthcare, including mental health care provision. Telepsychiatry can provide an alternative to face to face assessment and can also be used creatively with other technologies to enhance care, but clinicians and patients may feel underconfident about embracing this new way of working. The aim was to produce an open access, easy-to-consult and reliable source of information and guidance about telepsychiatry and COVID-19 using an evidence-based approach. We systematically searched existing English language guidelines and websites for information on telepsychiatry in the context of COVID-19 up to and including May 2020. We used broad search criteria and included pre-COVID-19 guidelines and also other digital mental health topics where relevant. We summarised the data we extracted as answers to specific clinical questions. Findings from this study are presented as both a short practical checklist for clinicians and a detailed table with a full summary of all the guidelines. The summary tables are also available on an open access webpage (https://oxfordhealthbrc.nihr.ac.uk/our-work/oxppl/table-5-digital-technologies-and-telepsychiatry/) which is regularly updated. These findings reflect the strong evidence base for the use of telepsychiatry and include guidelines for many of the common concerns expressed by clinicians about practical implementation, technology, information governance and safety. Guidelines across countries differ significantly, with UK guidelines more conservative and focussed on practical implementation, and US guidelines more expansive and detailed. Guidelines on possible combination with other digital technologies such as apps, for example from the FDA, NHS Apps Library and NICE are less detailed. Several key areas were not represented. Whilst some special populations such as child and adolescent, older adult and cultural issues are specifically included, important populations such as learning disabilities, psychosis, personality disorder and eating disorders, which may present particular challenges for telepsychiatry, are not. In addition, initial consultation and follow-up sessions are not clearly distinguished. Finally, a hybrid model of care (combining telepsychiatry with other technologies and in-person care) is not explicitly covered by the existing guidelines. We produced a comprehensive synthesis of guidance answering a wide range of clinical questions in telepsychiatry. This meets the urgent need for practical information for both clinicians and health care organisations who are rapidly adapting to the pandemic and implementing remote consultation. It reflects variations across countries and can be used as a basis for organisational change in the short and longer term. Providing easily accessible guidance is a first step, but will need cultural change to implement, as clinicians start to view telepsychiatry not just as a replacement, but as a parallel and complimentary form of delivering therapy, with its own advantages and benefits as well as restrictions. A combination or hybrid approach can be the most successful approach in the new world of mental health post-COVID-19 and guidance will need to expand to encompass the use of telepsychiatry in conjunction with other in-person and digital technologies, and also its use across all psychiatric disorders, not just those who are the first to access and engage with remote treatment.","Smith, Ostinelli, Macdonald, Cipriani",https://doi.org/10.2196/21108,20200713.0,,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-14

Data on the mental health status of these individuals during the current pandemic is sparse, and their current mental health needs unclear. We characterised COVID-19 related lifestyle changes, primary concerns and psychological distress in n=1292 respondents self-reporting a mood disorder (either bipolar disorder or depressive disorder) and n=3167 respondents without any reported mental disorder from the COLLATE (COvid-19 and you: mentaL heaLth in AusTralia now survEy) project; an Australian national survey launched on April 1<sup>st</sup> 2020. Psychological distress was heightened in the mood disorder group compared to the group with no mental disorder, with stress and depression further elevated in respondents with bipolar disorder compared to those with depressive disorder; and men with bipolar disorder having even higher levels of depression than women with bipolar disorder. Respondents with bipolar disorder were particularly concerned about financial issues associated with COVID-19 compared to those with depressive disorder and those with no mental disorder. Adverse changes to lifestyle behaviours were more prevalent in respondents with a mood disorder and linked to higher levels of distress. Mood disorder was self-reported and was not clinically verified. Current psychological distress levels are elevated in individuals with mood disorder and are associated with maladaptive situational and lifestyle changes occurring in response to COVID-19.","Van Rheenen, Meyer, Neill, Phillipou, Tan, Toh, Rossell",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.037,20200713.0,Alcohol use; Bipolar disorder; Coronavirus; Exercise; Major depressive disorder; sleep,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-14

The measure assesses 4 symptom areas, 2 each of internalizing and externalizing symptoms-Depression, Anxiety, Rule-Breaking, and Substance Use-and an optional scale on Isolation at School. A total of 2,444 students from 2 high schools completed the WBI, the Youth Self-Report (YSR), and other related measures. Alpha coefficients showed acceptable internal consistency, with values for the 5 WBI subscales at .83, .84, .78, .79, and .74, respectively. Both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated consistent factorial validity. Correlations with corresponding YSR subscales indicated good convergent and discriminant validity. The WBI Substance Use and Isolation at School subscales, similarly, had high correlations with subscales from preexisting measures. Criterion-related validity was indicated in significant correlations between WBI subscales and conceptually related dimensions of close relationships. Also examined was the percentage of youth falling above clinical cutoffs on both the WBI and YSR, and findings demonstrated high concurrent validity. Collectively, results suggest the promise of the WBI as a brief, psychometrically sound measure to assess the adjustment of adolescents, along with perceptions of school climate that can be modified toward fostering their overall well-being.

34,Job Insecurity and Financial Concern during the COVID-19 Pandemic are Associated with Worse Mental Health,"To determine whether job insecurity due to COVID-19 and financial concern were associated with worse mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants (Nâ€Š=â€Š474 employed U.S. individuals) completed an online survey from April 6-12, 2020. Linear regressions were used to examine factors associated with mental health. After accounting for demographic characteristics, health status, other COVID-19 experiences, and anxiety symptoms, greater job insecurity due to COVID-19 was related to greater depressive symptoms. Conversely, after accounting for covariates and depressive symptoms, greater financial concern was related to greater anxiety symptoms. Further, greater job insecurity was indirectly related to greater anxiety symptoms due to greater financial concern. Findings suggest that employers should aim to reduce job insecurity and financial concern among employees during the COVID-19 pandemic to address the associated mental health consequences.","Wilson, Lee, Fitzgerald, Oosterhoff, Sevi, Shook",https://doi.org/10.1097/JOM.0000000000001962,20200713.0,,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-14
35,Responding to Health Care Professionals' Mental Health Needs During COVID-19 Through the Rapid Implementation of Project ECHO,"The COVID-19 pandemic can cause significant mental health distress amongst health care professionals (HCPs). We describe the psychological needs of HCPs during COVID-19 and the implementation of Project ECHO Coping with COVID (ECHO-CWC) to help HCPs' manage COVID-19 distress. We used an established rapid implementation approach to accelerate the development and delivery of ECHO-CWC to address the emerging needs of HCPs. Participants' needs were identified using a 10-question survey of participants' perceived risk of COVID-19 and a 5-item self-efficacy measure. Implementation outcomes consisted of participant engagement and session satisfaction scores using a 5-point Likert scale. 426 participants registered for ECHO-CWC. Needs assessment data (n=129) showed that most participants' reported feeling increased stress at work (84.5%), fear of infecting others (75.2%), and fear of falling ill (70.5%) from COVID-19, yet most participants accepted the risk associated with work during this time (59.7%). Participants were highly satisfied with the initial five sessions (mean=4.26). HCPs reported the greatest concern with fears of infection and infecting others during the acute phase of the pandemic. Using an iterative curriculum design approach and existing implementation frameworks, the ECHO tele-education model can be rapidly mobilized to address HCPs mental health needs during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sockalingam, Clarkin, Serhal, Pereira, Crawford",https://doi.org/10.1097/CEH.0000000000000311,20200713.0,,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-14
36,Tobacco smoking cessation in mental health services during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Tobacco smoking is more prevalent among people who experience mental illness. It is therefore a prominent issue for psychiatric inpatient units. The COVID-19 pandemic has meant that many psychiatric inpatient units are no longer granting leave and outdoor smoking breaks, prompting the question of whether to allow tobacco smoking or enforce smoking bans in mental health services. There is currently mixed evidence that tobacco smoking is associated with a higher risk of developing COVID-19 and poorer outcomes for COVID-19 cases, potentially due to current small sample sizes. Considering the benefits of smoking cessation in this vulnerable population, the current pandemic should be used as an opportunity to further enforce smoking cessation in mental health facilities and encourage nicotine replacement therapy alongside cessation counseling.","Seiler, Swamy, Xiao, Yun",https://doi.org/10.1080/10550887.2020.1791379,20200713.0,COVID-19; Tobacco; smoking,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-14
37,Is the mental health of young students and their family members affected during the quarantine period? Evidence from the COVID-19 pandemic in Albania,"The use of quarantine method has a significant impact on mental health status. This study aimed to assess the levels of depression among bachelor and master university students (nurses/midwives) and their family members' during the quarantine period of COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Vlora University, Albania. Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used. Institutional e-mails of all active students were used for their recruitment. In total, 863 students and 249 family members participated in the study. The mean PHQ-9 score was 6.220 (SD=5.803) and 6.280 (SD=5.857) for students and family members, respectively. Being unsatisfied with COVID-19 prevention measures, beliefs that COVID-19 infection and quarantine process can cause problems on their health status were the key factors for students to be screened positive for mental problems in multiple regression analysis. For parents, the last two factors were found to contribute significantly. Our findings indicate that quarantine measures have a significant impact on the levels of depression among both university students and their family members. Broader population studies are necessary to safeguard these results. Provision of mental health services during the quarantine period is of paramount significance. Mental health first aid trainingand support could benefit both students and their parents significantly. Additionally, follow up services after the end of quarantine are recommended.","Mechili, Saliaj, Kamberi, Girvalaki, Peto, Patelarou, Bucaj, Patelarou",https://doi.org/10.1111/jpm.12672,20200713.0,COVID-19; PHQ-9; depression; family members; quarantine; university students,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-14
38,"Increased generalized anxiety, depression and distress during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study in Germany","Since the first cases of the novel coronavirus disease SARS-CoV-2 were reported in December 2019 in China, the virus has spread in most countries. The aim of the present study was to assess initial data on the mental health burden of the German public during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Germany and collected complete datasets from 15Â 704 German residents aged 18Â years and over. Besides demographics, generalized anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-2) and psychological distress (DT) were assessed. Furthermore, COVID-19-related fear, trust in governmental actions to face COVID-19 and the subjective level of information regarding COVID-19 were covered. Significantly increased symptoms were highly prevalent in all dimensions: generalized anxiety (44.9%), depression (14.3%), psychological distress (65.2%) and COVID-19-related fear (59%). Females and younger people reported higher mental burden. Trust in governmental actions to face COVID-19 and the subjective level of information regarding COVID-19 are negatively associated with mental health burden. However, the subjective level of information regarding COVID-19 is positively associated with increased COVID-19-related fear. The provision of appropriate psychological interventions for those in need and the provision of transparency and comprehensible information are crucial during the current pandemic.","BÃ¤uerle, Teufel, Musche, WeismÃ¼ller, Kohler, Hetkamp, DÃ¶rrie, Schweda, Skoda",https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdaa106,20200713.0,COVID-19; COVID-19-related fear; depression; generalized anxiety; mental health,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-14

40,Lessons from dermatology about inflammatory responses in Covid-19,"The SARS-Cov-2 is a single-stranded RNA virus composed of 16 non-structural proteins (NSP 1-16) with specific roles in the replication of coronaviruses. NSP3 has the property to block host innate immune response and to promote cytokine expression. NSP5 can inhibit interferon (IFN) signalling and NSP16 prevents MAD5 recognition, depressing the innate immunity. Dendritic cells, monocytes, and macrophages are the first cell lineage against viruses' infections. The IFN type I is the danger signal for the human body during this clinical setting. Protective immune responses to viral infection are initiated by innate immune sensors that survey extracellular and intracellular space for foreign nucleic acids. In Covid-19 the pathogenesis is not yet fully understood, but viral and host factors seem to play a key role. Important points in severe Covid-19 are characterized by an upregulated innate immune response, hypercoagulopathy state, pulmonary tissue damage, neurological and/or gastrointestinal tract involvement, and fatal outcome in severe cases of macrophage activation syndrome, which produce a 'cytokine storm'. These systemic conditions share polymorphous cutaneous lesions where innate immune system is involved in the histopathological findings with acute respiratory distress syndrome, hypercoagulability, hyperferritinemia, increased serum levels of D-dimer, lactic dehydrogenase, reactive-C-protein and serum A amyloid. It is described that several polymorphous cutaneous lesions similar to erythema pernio, urticarial rashes, diffuse or disseminated erythema, livedo racemosa, blue toe syndrome, retiform purpura, vesicles lesions, and purpuric exanthema or exanthema with clinical aspects of symmetrical drug-related intertriginous and flexural exanthema.

41,"Risk factors for psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel: Loneliness, age, gender, and health status play an important role","Research on the psychological toll of the COVID-19 pandemic is being conducted in various countries. This study aimed to examine risk factors for mental health problems among Israeli adults during this crisis. A total of 204 participants took part in the study. They completed self-report questionnaires assessing perceived stress, anxiety, quality of life, and various questions related to quarantine, pre-existing health issues, and worries related to the virus. The study took place during the last two weeks of March 2020. The majority of participants reported relatively high levels of perceived stress and corona-related worries, but low levels of anxiety. Female gender, younger age, corona-related loneliness, and pre-existing chronic illness were all related to higher levels of psychological distress and lower levels of quality of life. While considering the preliminary nature of these results, the current study highlights risk factors for psychological distress in light of the corona pandemic. Attention should be given to sociodemographic variables that were identified as related to psychological distress, as well as to the important role of loneliness, when screening and treating people during this crisis.

44,Psychological Impact and Associated Factors During the Initial Stage of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic Among the General Population in Spain,"The outbreak of COVID-19 in Spain started at the end of February. By 9th April 2020 Spain was the second country in confirmed cases and in deaths. On March 14, 2020, the Spanish Government declared the state of alarm to limit viral transmission. During such state, citizens must stay confined at home with few justified exceptions. This whole situation drastically changed the life of the population, which can cause a wide range of psychosocial impacts. This study explored the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the general adult population (<i>N</i> = 3055) during the first stages of the outbreak in Spain, as well as their anxiety, stress and depression levels. We also examined the extent to which the following variables were associated to participants' mental health: (1) demographics; (2) degree of concern about the pandemic; (3) environmental conditions during the home confinement, (4) changes in daily life as a consequence of the pandemic; (5) contact with the COVID-19 disease; (6) actual and perceived severity of the crisis; (7) information about the COVID-19, (8) perceived health status and (9) leisure activities conducted within the last 24 h. Our results show that Spanish consider the current COVID-19 health crisis as fairly severe, and the majority felt that the COVID-19 crisis had greatly impacted on their daily life, including changes in their daily routines and cancelation of important activities. About 36% of the participants reported moderate to severe psychological impact, 25% showed mild to severe levels of anxiety, 41% reported depressive symptoms, and 41% felt stressed. Women, young, and those who that lost their job during the health crisis showed the strongest negative psychological symptoms. What worried Spaniards the most was the likelihood of suffering an economic crisis derived from the pandemic. We found factors associated with better mental health, such as being satisfied with the information received about the health crisis, conducting leisure activities, and the perception of being in good health. These findings can be used to design psychological interventions to help coping with COVID-19 pandemic, both in Spain and other countries.","RodrÃ­guez-Rey, Garrido-Hernansaiz, Collado",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01540,20200713.0,COVID-19; anxiety; depression; pandemic; psychological crisis intervention; psychological impact; stress,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-14

47,Special ambulatory gynecologic considerations in the era of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and implications for future practice,"The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has altered medical practice in unprecedented ways. Although much of the emphasis in obstetrics and gynecology to date has been on the as yet uncertain effects of coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnancy and on changes to surgical management, the pandemic has broad implications for ambulatory gynecologic care. In this article, we review important ambulatory gynecologic topics such as safety and mental health, reproductive life planning, sexually transmitted infections, and routine screening for breast and cervical cancer. For each topic, we review how care may be modified during the pandemic, provide recommendations when possible on how to ensure continued access to comprehensive healthcare at this time, and discuss ways that future practice may change. Social distancing requirements may place patients at higher risk for intimate partner violence and mental health concerns, threaten continued access to contraception and abortion services, affect prepregnancy planning, interrupt routine screening for breast and cervical cancer, increase risk of sexually transmitted infection acquisition and decrease access to treatment, and exacerbate already underlying racial and minority disparities in care and health outcomes. We advocate for increased use of telemedicine services with increased screening for intimate partner violence and depression using validated questionnaires. Appointments for long-acting contraceptive insertions can be prioritized. Easier access to patient-controlled injectable contraception and pharmacist-provided hormonal contraception can be facilitated. Reproductive healthcare access can be ensured through reducing needs for ultrasonography and laboratory testing for certain eligible patients desiring abortion and conducting phone follow-up for medication abortions. Priority for in-person appointments should be given to patients with sexually transmitted infection symptoms, particularly if at risk for complications, while also offering expedited partner therapy. Although routine mammography screening and cervical cancer screening may be safely delayed, we discuss society guideline recommendations for higher-risk populations. There may be an increasing role for patient-collected human papillomavirus self-samples using new cervical cancer screening guidelines that can be expanded considering the pandemic situation. Although the pandemic has strained our healthcare system, it also affords ambulatory clinicians with opportunities to expand care to vulnerable populations in ways that were previously underutilized to improve health equity.","Cohen, Powell, Coleman, Keller, Livingston, Anderson",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.06.006,20200713.0,abortion; cervical cancer screening; contraception; coronavirus disease 2019; health equity; intimate partner violence; reproductive healthcare access; telemedicine,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-14
48,COVID 19-Depression and Neurosurgeons,"The goal of this survey was to determine factors associated with anxiety/depression among neurosurgeons during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. An online survey was performed of neurosurgeons worldwide, conducted over 3 weeks. Depression in neurosurgeons was assessed by Self-Reporting Questionnaire-20. A total of 375 responses were received from 52 countries. Among all neurosurgeons, 34% felt tense, 32.5% were unhappy, 25% experienced insomnia, almost 20% had headaches, and 5% had suicidal ideation during the pandemic. Of participants, 14% had a score on Self-Reporting Questionnaire-20 consistent with depression. The likelihood of depression was significantly higher among those who did not receive guidance about self-protection from their institutions (odds ratio [OR], 2.47), those who did not feel safe with provided personal protective equipments (OR, 3.13), and those whose families considered their workplace unsafe (OR, 2.29). Depression was less likely in neurosurgeons who had minor concerns, compared with those with significant health concerns for their families (OR, 0.36). In multivariate analysis after controlling for effects of other covariates, odds of depression were significantly higher among neurosurgeons who did not feel safe with the provided personal protective equipment (OR, 2.43) and who were exposed to a COVID-19-positive colleague (OR, 2.54). Participants who had moderate concerns for their families had lesser odds of anxiety/depression than did those with significant concerns (OR,Â 0.28). Based on the modifiable risk factors of depression in this study, it is recommended that the safety of neurosurgeons be ensured by providing appropriate safety measures for them to regain their confidence and hence reduce the incidence of depression.","Sharif, Amin, Hafiz, Benzel, Peev, Dahlan, Enchev, Pereira, Vaishya",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2020.06.007,20200621.0,COVID-19; Depression in neurosurgeons; Depression in surgeons; Depression scale; Depression/anxiety; Global neurosurgery; Health care workers; PPE; Pandemic; Safety; Social media,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-14

52,Perinatal depressive and anxiety symptoms of pregnant women during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in China,"On January 20, 2020, a new coronavirus epidemic with human-to-human transmission was officially declared by the Chinese government, which caused significant public panic in China. In light of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, pregnant women may be particularly vulnerable and in special need for preventive mental health strategies. Thus far, no reports exist to investigate the mental health response of pregnant women to the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. This study aimed to examine the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak on the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms and the corresponding risk factors among pregnant women across China. A multicenter, cross-sectional study was initiated in early December 2019 to identify mental health concerns in pregnancy using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. This study provided a unique opportunity to compare the mental status of pregnant women before and after the declaration of the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic. A total of 4124 pregnant women during their third trimester from 25 hospitals in 10 provinces across China were examined in this cross-sectional study from January 1, 2020, to February 9, 2020. Of these women, 1285 were assessed after January 20, 2020, when the coronavirus epidemic was publicly declared and 2839 were assessed before this pivotal time point. The internationally recommended Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale was used to assess maternal depression and anxiety symptoms. Prevalence rates and risk factors were compared between the pre- and poststudy groups. Pregnant women assessed after the declaration of coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic had significantly higher rates of depressive symptoms (26.0% vs 29.6%, P=.02) than women assessed before the epidemic declaration. These women were also more likely to have thoughts of self-harm (P=.005). The depressive rates were positively associated with the number of newly confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (P=.003), suspected infections (P=.004), and deaths per day (P=.001). Pregnant women who were underweight before pregnancy, primiparous, younger than 35 years, employed full time, in middle income category, and had appropriate living space were at increased risk for developing depressive and anxiety symptoms during the outbreak. Major life-threatening public health events such as the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak may increase the risk for mental illness among pregnant women, including thoughts of self-harm. Strategies targeting maternal stress and isolation such as effective risk communication and the provision of psychological first aid may be particularly useful to prevent negative outcomes for women and their fetuses.","Wu, Zhang, Liu, Duan, Li, Fan, Li, Chen, Xu, Li, Guo, Wang, Li, Li, Zhang, You, Li, Yang, Tao, Xu, Lao, Wen, Zhou, Wang, Chen, Meng, Zhai, Ye, Zhong, Yang, Zhang, Zhang, Wu, Chen, Dennis, Huang",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.05.009,20200712.0,COVID-19; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; perinatal anxiety; perinatal depression,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-14
53,Principles of mental health care during the COVID-19 pandemic,"We describe the basic principles of mental health care during the COVID-19 pandemic that should be endorsed by the mental health professional associations and incorporated in the health strategies for the management of the COVID-19 pandemic. The main principle is that there should be no substantial differences in the provision of health care for COVID-19 between persons with pre-existing mental health disorders and the ones without previous disorders. Subsequently, the organization of the health care should reflect that as well. These principles should (a) prevent the possible effects of stigmatizing attitudes toward mental health issues, possibly leading to potentially deleterious situations, such as psychiatric patients being treated (even temporarily) separately from other patients, in psychiatric facilities, where the staff is not equipped and trained adequately for the management of COVID-19; (b) highlight the fact that patients with mental health disorders are at greater risk for developing serious complications of COVID-19 infection due to other factors-they often smoke and have comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, all associated with higher morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 infection; (c) highlight that measures should be taken to minimize the risk of the spread of infection in psychiatric wards/institutions; (d) provide a general framework for the reorganization of mental health services toward the provision of services for persons in need, including frontline medical workers and patients with COVID-19 without previous mental health problems as well as for persons with pre-existing mental health problems under new circumstances of pandemic.","Kuzman, Curkovic, Wasserman",https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2020.54,20200608.0,"COVID-19; mental health; organization; public health; stigma; Coronavirus Infections; Health Personnel; Humans; Mental Disorders; Mental Health Services; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Stereotyping",PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-14

This pandemic has proven to be a challenge given that there is no immediate cure, no vaccine is currently available and medications or treatments being used are still undergoing clinical trials. There have already been examples of self-medication and overdose. Clearly, there is a need to further define the efficacy of treatments used in the management of COVID-19. This evidence needs to be backed by large randomised-controlled clinical trials.

Doctors experience high levels of work stress even under normal circumstances, but many would be reluctant to disclose mental health difficulties or seek help for them, with stigma an often-cited reason. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis places additional pressure on doctors and on the healthcare system in general and research shows that such pressure brings a greater risk of psychological distress for doctors. For this reason, we argue that the authorities and healthcare executives must show strong leadership and support for doctors and their families during the COVID-19 outbreak and call for efforts to reduce mental health stigma in clinical workplaces. This can be facilitated by deliberately adding â€˜healthcare staff mental health support processâ€™ as an ongoing agenda item to high-level management planning meetings.","Galbraith, Boyda, McFeeters, Hassan",https://doi.org/10.1192/bjb.2020.44,20200701.0,COVID-19; coronavirus; doctors; healthcare professionals; mental health,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-14

One such underrecognized and unaddressed area is the mental health issues medical staff develop during the pandemic. This review aimed to review the literature about mental health problems faced by health care workers (HCW) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Literature search was conducted in the following databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, Embase. All types of articles published in the last 4 months (January 2020-April 2020) which were relevant to the subject of the review were searched. A total of 23 articles were selected by initial screening and 6 articles were included in the final review. Review of all the 6 articles showed that current research focused on assessing several aspects of mental health affected in HCW due to COVID-19. Several sociodemographic variables like gender, profession, age, place of work, department of work and psychological variables like poor social support, self-efficacy were associated with increased stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, insomnia in HCW. There is increasing evidence that suggests that COVID-19 can be an independent risk factor for stress in HCW. Regular screening of medical personnel involved in treating, diagnosing patients with COVID-19 should be done for evaluating stress, depression and anxiety by using multidisciplinary Psychiatry teams.","Spoorthy, Pratapa, Mahant",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102119,20200605.0,COVID-19; Health care workers; Psychological; Stress,PubMed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-14

L’objectif de cet article est de proposer des éléments de guidance pour réorganiser les soins psychiatriques dans le contexte de pandémie Covid-19. Méthode Les auteurs ont réalisé une synthèse de la littérature internationale combinée au partage des expériences locales françaises. Résultats Les patients souffrant de troubles psychiques semblent particulièrement vulnérables à ce virus et à la pandémie : vulnérabilités liées aux comorbidités médicales, à l’âge, aux troubles cognitifs qui peuvent entraver le respect des consignes de confinement et aux complications psychosociales. Plusieurs initiatives ont été prises pour assurer la continuité des soins et contenir l’épidémie : création en psychiatrie d’unité Covid+ co-supervisée par des médecins généralistes ou internistes, restriction des consultations aux cas sévères et redéploiement des soins en téléconsultation, accompagnement de type case-management pour les sorties précoces ou l’impossibilité d’hospitaliser, accompagnements spécifiques pour les complications psychiques du confinement. Les populations suivies en pédopsychiatrie, en psychiatrie du sujet âgé, en addictologie ou détenues en prison doivent bénéficier d’une attention particulière. Plusieurs questions restent en suspend : la question de l’interaction négative ou positive des traitements sur l’infection SARS-CoV-2, l’épidémiologie de l’infection chez les personnes souffrant de troubles psychiques, leur adaptation à un confinement long. Discussion Une prise de conscience par les décideurs politiques de la grande vulnérabilité de ces populations et des institutions psychiatriques dans cette situation de catastrophe sanitaire est urgente. Abstract Objective The lack of ressources and coordination to face the epidemic of coronavirus raises concerns for the health of patients with mental disorders in a country where we keep in memory the dramatic experience of famine in psychiatric hospitals during the Second World War. This article aims at proposing guidance to ensure mental health care during the SARS-CoV epidemy in France. Methods Authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature and local initiatives in France. Results We identified four types of major vulnerabilities in patients suffering from mental disorders during this pandemic: (1) medical comorbidities that are more frequently found in patients suffering from mental disorders (cardiovascular and pulmonary pathologies, diabetes, obesity, etc.) which represent risk factors for severe infections with Covid-19; (2) age (the elderly constituting the population most vulnerable to coronavirus); (3) cognitive and behavioral troubles which can hamper compliance with confinement and hygiene measures and finally and (4) psychosocial vulnerability due to stigmatization and/or socio-economic difficulties. Furthermore, the mental health healthcare system is more vulnerable than other healthcare systems. Current government plans are poorly adapted to psychiatric establishments in a context of major shortage of organizational, material and human resources. In addition, a certain number of structural aspects make the psychiatric institution particularly vulnerable: many beds are closed, wards have a high density of patients, mental health community facilities are closed, medical teams are understaffed and poorly trained to face infectious diseases. We could also face major issues in referring patients with acute mental disorders to intensive care units. To maintain continuity of psychiatric care in this pandemic situation, several directions can be considered, in particular with the creation of Covid+ units. These units are under the dual supervision of a psychiatrist and of an internist/infectious disease specialist; all new entrants should be placed in quarantine for 14 days; the nurse staff should benefit from specific training, from daily medical check-ups and from close psychological support. Family visits would be prohibited and replaced by videoconference. At the end of hospitalization, in particular for the population of patients in compulsory ambulatory care situations, specific case-management should be organized with the possibility of home visits, in order to support them when they get back home and to help them to cope with the experience of confinement, which is at risk to induce recurrences of mental disorders. The total or partial closure of mental health community facilities is particularly disturbing for patients but a regular follow-up is possible with telemedicine and should include the monitoring of the suicide risk and psychoeducation strategies; developing support platforms could also be very helpful in this context. Private psychiatrists have also a crucial role of information with their patients on confinement and barrier measures, but also on measures to prevent the psychological risks inherent to confinement: maintenance of sleep regularity, physical exercise, social interactions, stress management and coping strategies, prevention of addictions, etc. They should also be trained to prevent, detect and treat early warning symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, because their prevalence was high in the regions of China most affected by the pandemic. Discussion French mental healthcare is now in a great and urgent need for reorganization and must also prepare in the coming days and weeks to face an epidemic of emotional disorders due to the containment of the general population.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.03.001,20200101.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-14

El objetivo del presente estudio fue evaluar los factores que pueden desestabilizar la salud mental de dichos profesionales en nuestro contexto. Materiales y métodos La muestra estuvo compuesta por 421 profesionales de la salud. Los datos se recogieron mediante un cuestionario online que se les envió a través del correo electrónico. Se empleó el DASS-21 para evaluar las variables de ansiedad, estrés y depresión, y la EAI para medir las dificultades con el sueño. Además, se recogieron otras variables descriptivas de la muestra que podrían estar relacionadas con estos niveles de sintomatología psicológica. Resultados Los resultados muestran que la pandemia de la COVID-19ha generado entre el personal sanitario síntomas de estrés, ansiedad, depresión e insomnio, con mayores niveles entre las mujeres y profesionales de más edad. Variables como haber estado en contacto con el virus o el miedo en el trabajo desencadenaron una mayor sintomatología. Conclusiones En esta situación crítica, el colectivo de profesionales se sitúa en primera línea, por lo que está expuesto directamente determinados riesgos y estresores. Esto contribuye a que desarrollen sintomatología psicológica diversa. Consecuentemente, se recomienda ofrecerles ayuda psicológica para reducir el impacto emocional del COVID-19 y asegurar así no solo su salud mental, sino también el adecuado cuidado que dispensan. Abstract Introduction After the outbreak of the COVID-19 was considered a global pandemic in March 2020, the state of alarm was declared in Spain. In this situation, health professionals are experiencing high levels of stress due to the overload of work the pandemic is generating and the conditions in which they are working. The aim of this study was to evaluate the factors that can destabilize the mental health of these professionals in our context. Materials and methods The sample was composed of 421 health professionals. The data were gathered by an online questionnaire sent to them by e-mail. The DASS-21 was used to assess anxiety, stress and depression, and the EAI to measure sleep difficulties. In addition, other descriptive variables that could be related to psychological symptomatology were collected from the sample. Results The results show that the COVID-19 pandemic has generated symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression and insomnia among health workers, with higher levels among women and older professionals. Some factors such as having been in contact with the virus or fear at work, triggered greater symptomatology. Conclusions In this critical situation, professionals are in the front line and therefore, are directly exposed to certain risks and stressors. This contributes to the development of diverse psychological symptoms. Consequently, it is recommended to offer them psychological help in order to reduce the emotional impact of the COVID-19, and thus, to ensure not only the mental health of our health professionals, but also the adequate care they provide.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rpsm.2020.05.004,20200101.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-14
63,Psychopathological consequences of confinement,"Résumé Les effets psychologiques de l’isolement ont déjà été décrits dans la littérature (expéditions polaires, sous-marins, prison). Néanmoins, l’échelle du confinement mis en œuvre à l’occasion de la pandémie à COVID-19 est inédite. Il nous faut non seulement relire les études publiées, mais aussi anticiper les problèmes psychologiques qui pourraient survenir pendant ou à distance du confinement. Nous avons fait le choix d’aller au-delà de la littérature COVID-19 pour examiner les implications des conséquences connues du confinement : l’ennui, l’isolement social, le stress, le manque de sommeil. L’anxiété, le trouble de stress post-traumatique, la dépression et les conduites suicidaires, les conduites addictives, les violences domestiques sont des effets décrits du confinement, mais les mécanismes d’émergence de ces troubles et leurs interrelations restent à étudier. Par exemple, quels sont les mécanismes d’émergence du trouble de stress post-traumatique dans le cadre du confinement ? Nous rappelons aussi les points de vigilance à garder sur des conséquences telles que les troubles des conduites alimentaires, les hallucinations, curieusement ignorées dans la littérature sur le confinement, alors qu’une vaste littérature fait le lien entre isolement social et hallucinations. Du fait de conséquences psychopathologiques larges, il nous faut partir à la recherche des différents symptômes pour permettre leur prise en charge. Nous résumons rapidement les approches diagnostiques et thérapeutiques déjà mises en place, comme la télémédecine, qui connaît un développement rapide à l’occasion de la crise du COVID-19. Abstract The psychological effects of isolation have already been described in the literature (polar expeditions, submarines, prison). Nevertheless, the scale of confinement implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented. In addition to reviewing the published studies, we need to anticipate the psychological problems that could arise during or at a distance from confinement. We have gone beyond the COVID-19 literature in order to examine the implications of the known consequences of confinement, like boredom, social isolation, stress, or sleep deprivation. Anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, suicidal or addictive behaviours, domestic violence are described effects of confinement, but the mechanisms of emergence of these disorders and their interrelationships remain to be studied. For example, what are the mechanisms of emergence of post-traumatic stress disorders in the context of confinement? We also remind the reader of points of vigilance to be kept in mind with regard to eating disorders and hallucinations. Hallucinations are curiously ignored in the literature on confinement, whereas a vast literature links social isolation and hallucinations. Due to the broad psychopathological consequences, we have to look for these various symptoms to manage them. We quickly summarize the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches already in place, such as telemedicine, which is undergoing rapid development during the COVID-19 crisis.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.007,20200101.0,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-14
64,Natural language processing reveals vulnerable mental health support groups and heightened health anxiety on Reddit during COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic is exerting a devastating impact on mental health, but it is not clear how people with different types of mental health problems were differentially impacted as the initial wave of cases hit. We leverage natural language processing to characterize linguistic changes in fifteen of the world's largest mental health support groups (e.g., r/schizophrenia, r/SuicideWatch) found on the website Reddit, along with other non-mental health groups (e.g., r/PersonalFinance, r/conspiracy). We create the Reddit Mental Health Dataset containing posts from 826,961 unique users spanning 28 Reddit groups from 2018 to 2020. We then analyze trends from 90 text-derived features such as isolation and economic stress. We find that support groups related to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, eating disorders, and anxiety showed the most negative semantic change during the pandemic out of all mental health groups and were the same groups that became most similar linguistically to the health anxiety support group as COVID-19 spread. Health anxiety emerged as a general theme across Reddit through independent supervised and unsupervised machine learning analyses. We uncover patterns of how specific mental health problems manifest in language and highlight different types of concerns and at-risk online users that require clinical attention. We demonstrate that textual analysis is sensitive to capture mental health complaints as they arise in real time and thus may have utility during the ongoing pandemic and other world-changing events.",Daniel Mark Low et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/461EF-7EF-7C1,20200713.0,"PsyArXiv|Engineering Psychology; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Bipolar and Related Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Psychotic Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics|Computational Linguistics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods|Computational Modeling; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods|Statistical Methods; psychiatry; covid-19; health anxiety; natural language processing; adhd; mental health; reddit; machine learning; eating disorders",PsyArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-14

66,Mechanisms of COVID-19 Mental Health Burden,"New Zealand's COVID-19 lockdown in March and April 2020 was among the world's most stringent. Similar to other countries, New Zealand's lockdown occurred amidst pervasive health and economic uncertainties. However, New Zealanders experienced comparatively less psychological distress. To test theories of pandemic distress mitigation, we use national longitudinal responses with pre-COVID-19 baselines and systematically quantify psychological distress trajectories within the same individuals during the lockdown (pre-COVID-19 = 2018/2019; stringent-lockdown = March/April 2020; N = 940). Most distress indicators were minimally elevated. However, there was a three-fold increase in feelings of worthlessness. Neither satisfaction with the government, nor business-satisfaction, nor a sense of neighbourhood community were effective distress defences. Perceived social-belonging and health-satisfaction mitigated feelings of worthlessness. A silver lining was a relief from feelings of effort, which social-belonging fostered. That social-belonging and health satisfaction could quell serious distress among those low in government confidence, low in business satisfaction, and low neighbourhood community proves that distress mitigation is possible without shifting a population's general political, economic, and civic attitudes. Protection of income and containment of infectious disease threat reduces mental health burdens. Though feelings of worthlessness surge during lockdown, such feelings attenuate from interpersonal belonging with people one already knows.",Joseph Bulbulia et al.,https://share.osf.io/preprint/46163-B20-33A,20200623.0,PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods|Statistical Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Individual Differences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; brms; kessler-6; glmm; bayesian; ordinal; stan; anxiety; longitudinal; covid-19; mental health; employment,PsyArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-14

69,"Le confinement généralisé pendant l’épidémie de Coronavirus: Conséquences médico-psychologiques en populations générales, soignantes, et de sujets souffrant antérieurement de troubles psychiques","Background. – The situation we are currently experiencing is unprecedented. Declaring a state of health emergency in order to curb a frightening epidemic, the authorities have decreed the home confinement of the majority of the population of our country for several weeks. In a few days, innumerable questions arise for very diverse spaces: epidemiological, immunological, sociological, information scientists, medical, administrative, political, etc. Objective. – We propose a reflection intended to describe the psychological risks, to clarify the disorders found and, to discuss the means to take care of them in the duration. Material and methods. – We base our thinking on a review of the literature confronted with our current clinical experience, including concerning the possibilities of dematerialized medico-psychological monitoring. Results. – We recall the collective repercussions of emerging lethal mass risks, and in particular viral infectious agents, before approaching the existing scientific models of collective confinement according to military operations in hostile zones, polar wintering missions and aerospace conquest. It appears that for the study of a global containment, somewhat studied during previous pandemics, the conceptions of stress reaction and psychodynamic adaptation prove to be relevant. We detail the psychological consequences of confinement on individual mental health and their countermeasures according to three population typologies: general population, population of caregivers on the front line against the epidemic, and population of subjects already suffering from mental illness or seeing their disorders reappear. We also refer to works in social cognitive psychology explaining how, in an anxiety-provoking situation, reasoning can be biased and lead to choices that ultimately prove to be not very rational, in the opinion of those who made them. The current situation in the health sector is favorable in this, as evidenced by the ""debate on chloroquine"" widely reported in the media and on social networks, opposing conclusions most often decided on the basis of beliefs on contrary to evidence based medicine. Discussion. – The psychological repercussions of confinement appear conditioned by the multiple forms that it can take: voluntary or suffered, more or less prolonged, spent at home or in another place, lived in individual isolation or in a small community, associated other stressors and/or traumatic factors, etc. The home confinement of a population across a country has never been assessed. This experience seems to us to confront our society as a whole with the taboo of death which is imposed, death more and more evaded as the ""Western man"" tries to move away from his terrestrial origins. In this sense, psychotraumatic type repercussions are to be prevented. In order to face multiple challenges, the healthcare system has adapted with, in particular, the development of the use of the Internet for the provision of information intended to better experience confinement, or even the generalization of psychotherapy remotely asking as many questions as it provides answers. These intricacies of computer techniques in the area of psychotherapy, techniques with which we had some mistrust, became established as quickly as the virus: the task of clinicians and researchers to measure the issues and the consequences. Conclusion. – Public health programs could emerge on the model of those already existing in order to manage well-known chronic endemic disorders: protection against the effects of an unbalanced diet associated with a sedentary lifestyle, fight against smoking and alcoholism, prevention of self-aggressive behavior, etc. We will also need to support the caregivers who have been on the front line and who will emerge tested from this pandemic: will depend on the sustainability of the action capacities of our healthcare system to return to its nominal state and also perhaps, so that it can face other crises, especially social ones.","Auxéméry, Yann; Tarquinio, Cyril",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2020.06.001,20200605.0,,PMC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-14

In addition to these changes, students with disabilities/health concerns may face accessibility problems with online learning or communication tools, and their stress may be compounded by additional risks such as financial stress or pre-existing conditions. To our knowledge, no one has looked specifically at the impact of COVID-19 on students with disabilities/health concerns. In this paper, we present data from a survey of 147 students with and without disabilities collected in late March to early April of 2020 to assess the impact of COVID-19 on these students' education and mental health. Our findings show that students with disabilities/health concerns were more concerned about classes going online than their peers without disabilities. In addition, students with disabilities/health concerns also reported that they have experienced more COVID-19 related adversities compared to their peers without disabilities/health concerns. We argue that students with disabilities/health concerns in higher education need confidence in the accessibility of the online learning tools that are becoming increasingly prevalent in higher education not only because of COVID-19 but also more generally. In addition, educational technologies will be more accessible if they consider the learning context, and are designed to provide a supportive, calm, and connecting learning environment.","Zhang, Han; Nurius, Paula; Sefidgar, Yasaman; Morris, Margaret; Balasubramanian, Sreenithi; Brown, Jennifer; Dey, Anind K.; Kuehn, Kevin; Riskin, Eve; Xu, Xuhai; Mankoff, Jen",https://doi.org/nan,20200511.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-14
73,Examination of community sentiment dynamics due to covid-19 pandemic: a case study from Australia,"The outbreak of the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused unprecedented impacts to people's daily life around the world. Various measures and policies such as lock-down and social-distancing are implemented by governments to combat the disease during the pandemic period. These measures and policies as well as virus itself may cause different mental health issues to people such as depression, anxiety, sadness, etc. In this paper, we exploit the massive text data posted by Twitter users to analyse the sentiment dynamics of people living in the state of New South Wales (NSW) in Australia during the pandemic period. Different from the existing work that mostly focuses the country-level and static sentiment analysis, we analyse the sentiment dynamics at the fine-grained local government areas (LGAs). Based on the analysis of around 94 million tweets that posted by around 183 thousand users located at different LGAs in NSW in five months, we found that people in NSW showed an overall positive sentimental polarity and the COVID-19 pandemic decreased the overall positive sentimental polarity during the pandemic period. The fine-grained analysis of sentiment in LGAs found that despite the dominant positive sentiment most of days during the study period, some LGAs experienced significant sentiment changes from positive to negative. This study also analysed the sentimental dynamics delivered by the hot topics in Twitter such as government policies (e.g. the Australia's JobKeeper program, lock-down, social-distancing) as well as the focused social events (e.g. the Ruby Princess Cruise). The results showed that the policies and events did affect people's overall sentiment, and they affected people's overall sentiment differently at different stages.","Zhou, Jianlong; Yang, Shuiqiao; Xiao, Chun; Chen, Fang",https://doi.org/nan,20200622.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-14

We designed and implemented the COVID-19 public opinion monitoring system based on time series thermal new word mining. A new word structure discovery scheme based on the timing explosion of network topics and a Chinese sentiment analysis method for the COVID-19 public opinion environment is proposed. Establish a""Scrapy-Redis-Bloomfilter""distributed crawler framework to collect data. The system can judge the positive and negative emotions of the reviewer based on the comments, and can also reflect the depth of the seven emotions such as Hopeful, Happy, and Depressed. Finally, we improved the sentiment discriminant model of this system and compared the sentiment discriminant error of COVID-19 related comments with the Jiagu deep learning model. The results show that our model has better generalization ability and smaller discriminant error. We designed a large data visualization screen, which can clearly show the trend of public emotions, the proportion of various emotion categories, keywords, hot topics, etc., and fully and intuitively reflect the development of public opinion.","Zhang, Yixian; Chen, Jieren; Liu, Boyi; Yang, Yifan; Li, Haocheng; Zheng, Xinyi; Chen, Xi; Ren, Tenglong; Xiong, Naixue",https://doi.org/nan,20200523.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-14
75,"Robot art, in the eye of the beholder?: Personalization through self-disclosure facilitates visual communication of emotions in representational art","Socially assistive robots could help to support people's well-being in contexts such as art therapy where human therapists are scarce, by making art such as paintings together with people in a way that is emotionally contingent and creative. However, current art-making robots are typically either contingent, controlled as a tool by a human artist, or creative, programmed to paint independently, possibly because some complex and idiosyncratic concepts related to art, such as emotion and creativity, are not yet well understood. For example, the role of personalized taste in forming beauty evaluations has been studied in empirical aesthetics, but how to generate art that appears to an individual to express certain emotions such as happiness or sadness is less clear. In the current article, a collaborative prototyping/Wizard of Oz approach was used to explore generic robot art-making strategies and personalization of art via an open-ended emotion profile intended to identify tricky concepts. As a result of conducting an exploratory user study, participants indicated some preference for a robot art-making strategy involving""visual metaphors""to balance exogenous and endogenous components, and personalized representational sketches were reported to convey emotion more clearly than generic sketches. The article closes by discussing personalized abstract art as well as suggestions for richer art-making strategies and user models. Thus, the main conceptual advance of the current work lies in suggesting how an interactive robot can visually express emotions through personalized art; the general aim is that this could help to inform next steps in this promising area and facilitate technological acceptance of robots in everyday human environments.","Cooney, Martin",https://doi.org/nan,20200508.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-14
76,What are We Depressed about When We Talk about COVID19: Mental Health Analysis on Tweets Using Natural Language Processing,"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) recently has affected human life to a great extent. Besides direct physical and economic threats, the pandemic also indirectly impact people's mental health conditions, which can be overwhelming but difficult to measure. The problem may come from various reasons such as unemployment status, stay-at-home policy, fear for the virus, and so forth. In this work, we focus on applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze tweets in terms of mental health. We trained deep models that classify each tweet into the following emotions: anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise and trust. We build the EmoCT (Emotion-Covid19-Tweet) dataset for the training purpose by manually labeling 1,000 English tweets. Furthermore, we propose and compare two methods to find out the reasons that are causing sadness and fear.","Li, Irene; Li, Yixin; Li, Tianxiao; Alvarez-Napagao, Sergio; Garcia-Gasulla, Dario; Suzumura, Toyotaro",https://doi.org/nan,20200422.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-14

We analyze 4 million Twitter messages related to the COVID-19 pandemic using a list of 25 hashtags such as""coronavirus,""""COVID-19,""""quarantine""from March 1 to April 21 in 2020. We use a machine learning approach, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to identify popular unigram, bigrams, salient topics and themes, and sentiments in the collected Tweets. Popular unigrams include""virus,""""lockdown,""and""quarantine.""Popular bigrams include""COVID-19,""""stay home,""""corona virus,""""social distancing,""and""new cases.""We identify 13 discussion topics and categorize them into five different themes, such as""public health measures to slow the spread of COVID-19,""""social stigma associated with COVID-19,""""coronavirus news cases and deaths,""""COVID-19 in the United States,""and""coronavirus cases in the rest of the world"". Across all identified topics, the dominant sentiments for the spread of coronavirus are anticipation that measures that can be taken, followed by a mixed feeling of trust, anger, and fear for different topics. The public reveals a significant feeling of fear when they discuss the coronavirus new cases and deaths than other topics. The study shows that Twitter data and machine learning approaches can be leveraged for infodemiology study by studying the evolving public discussions and sentiments during the COVID-19. Real-time monitoring and assessment of the Twitter discussion and concerns can be promising for public health emergency responses and planning. Already emerged pandemic fear, stigma, and mental health concerns may continue to influence public trust when there occurs a second wave of COVID-19 or a new surge of the imminent pandemic.","Xue, Jia; Chen, Junxiang; Hu, Ran; Chen, Chen; Zheng, ChengDa; Liu, Xiaoqian; Zhu, Tingshao",https://doi.org/nan,20200526.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-14

In the UK and Ireland, online community support initiatives (OCSIs) have emerged to help people manage their lives. Yet, little is known about how people engaged with these or whether they influenced subsequent mood. We conducted surveys to explore how people in the UK and Ireland engaged with OCSIs, and found that 70% did so to offer support (e.g. to provide company). Those who did so reported feeling significantly calmer afterwards, those who engaged for general concerns (e.g. in response to anti-social behaviour) reported feeling significantly more anxious afterwards, but there was no difference in reported mood for those who engaged for other reasons (e.g. to share experiences or views). Thus, engaging with an OCSI for altruistic purposes might help to make people feel calmer.","Elphick, Camilla; Stuart, Avelie; Philpot, Richard; Walkington, Zoe; Frumkin, Lara; Zhang, Min; Levine, Mark; Price, Blaine; Pike, Graham; Nuseibeh, Bashar; Bandara, Arosha",https://doi.org/nan,20200612.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-14

While lockdowns may help to contain the spread of the virus, it is possible that substantial damage to population well-being will result. This study relies on Google Trends data and tests whether the lockdowns implemented in Europe and America led to changes in well-being related topic search terms. Using different methods to evaluate the causal effects of lockdown, we find a substantial increase in the search intensity for boredom in Europe and the US. We also found a significant increase in searches for loneliness, worry and sadness, while searches for stress, suicide and divorce on the contrary fell.

As part of a developing an ecosystem of e-screening and e-therapy tools for New Zealand young people, a dialog agent, Headstrong, has been designed to promote resilience with methods grounded in cognitive behavioral therapy and positive psychology. This paper describes the architecture underlying the chatbot. The architecture supports a range of over 20 activities delivered in a 4-week program by relatable personas. The architecture provides a visual authoring interface to its content management system. In addition to supporting the original adolescent resilience chatbot, the architecture has been reused to create a 3-week 'stress-detox' intervention for undergraduates, and subsequently for a chatbot to support young people with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, with all three systems having been used in field trials. The Headstrong architecture illustrates the feasibility of creating a domain-focused authoring environment in the context of e-therapy that supports non-technical expert input and rapid deployment.","Holt-Quick, Chester; Warren, Jim; Stasiak, Karolina; Williams, Ruth; Christie, Grant; Hetrick, Sarah; Hopkins, Sarah; Cargo, Tania; Merry, Sally",https://doi.org/nan,20200515.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-14

Many scientists are working tirelessly to find a treatment and a possible vaccine. Furthermore, governments, scientific institutions and companies are acting quickly to make resources available, including funds and the opening of large-volume data repositories, to accelerate innovation and discovery aimed at solving this pandemic. In this paper, we develop a novel automated theme-based visualisation method, combining advanced data modelling of large corpora, information mapping and trend analysis, to provide a top-down and bottom-up browsing and search interface for quick discovery of topics and research resources. We apply this method on two recently released publications datasets (Dimensions' COVID-19 dataset and the Allen Institute for AI's CORD-19). The results reveal intriguing information including increased efforts in topics such as social distancing; cross-domain initiatives (e.g. mental health and education); evolving research in medical topics; and the unfolding trajectory of the virus in different territories through publications. The results also demonstrate the need to quickly and automatically enable search and browsing of large corpora. We believe our methodology will improve future large volume visualisation and discovery systems but also hope our visualisation interfaces will currently aid scientists, researchers, and the general public to tackle the numerous issues in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bras, Pierre Le; Gharavi, Azimeh; Robb, David A.; Vidal, Ana F.; Padilla, Stefano; Chantler, Mike J.",https://doi.org/nan,20200513.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-14

84,"Universal Masking is Urgent in the COVID-19 Pandemic: SEIR and Agent Based Models, Empirical Validation, Policy Recommendations","We present two models for the COVID-19 pandemic predicting the impact of universal face mask wearing upon the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus--one employing a stochastic dynamic network based compartmental SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) approach, and the other employing individual ABM (agent-based modelling) Monte Carlo simulation--indicating (1) significant impact under (near) universal masking when at least 80% of a population is wearing masks, versus minimal impact when only 50% or less of the population is wearing masks, and (2) significant impact when universal masking is adopted early, by Day 50 of a regional outbreak, versus minimal impact when universal masking is adopted late. These effects hold even at the lower filtering rates of homemade masks. To validate these theoretical models, we compare their predictions against a new empirical data set we have collected that includes whether regions have universal masking cultures or policies, their daily case growth rates, and their percentage reduction from peak daily case growth rates. Results show a near perfect correlation between early universal masking and successful suppression of daily case growth rates and/or reduction from peak daily case growth rates, as predicted by our theoretical simulations. Our theoretical and empirical results argue for urgent implementation of universal masking. As governments plan how to exit societal lockdowns, it is emerging as a key NPI; a""mouth-and-nose lockdown""is far more sustainable than a""full body lockdown"", on economic, social, and mental health axes. An interactive visualization of the ABM simulation is at http://dek.ai/masks4all.

86,Inf-Net: Automatic COVID-19 Lung Infection Segmentation from CT Images,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread globally in early 2020, causing the world to face an existential health crisis. Automated detection of lung infections from computed tomography (CT) images offers a great potential to augment the traditional healthcare strategy for tackling COVID-19. However, segmenting infected regions from CT slices faces several challenges, including high variation in infection characteristics, and low intensity contrast between infections and normal tissues. Further, collecting a large amount of data is impractical within a short time period, inhibiting the training of a deep model. To address these challenges, a novel COVID-19 Lung Infection Segmentation Deep Network (Inf-Net) is proposed to automatically identify infected regions from chest CT slices. In our Inf-Net, a parallel partial decoder is used to aggregate the high-level features and generate a global map. Then, the implicit reverse attention and explicit edge-attention are utilized to model the boundaries and enhance the representations. Moreover, to alleviate the shortage of labeled data, we present a semi-supervised segmentation framework based on a randomly selected propagation strategy, which only requires a few labeled images and leverages primarily unlabeled data. Our semi-supervised framework can improve the learning ability and achieve a higher performance. Extensive experiments on our COVID-SemiSeg and real CT volumes demonstrate that the proposed Inf-Net outperforms most cutting-edge segmentation models and advances the state-of-the-art performance.","Fan, Deng-Ping; Zhou, Tao; Ji, Ge-Peng; Zhou, Yi; Chen, Geng; Fu, Huazhu; Shen, Jianbing; Shao, Ling",https://doi.org/nan,20200422.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-14

COVID-19 has largely impacted on our societies through both direct and indirect effects transmitted by the policy measures to counter the spread of viruses. We quantitatively analysed the multifaceted impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our societies including people's mobility, health, and social behaviour changes. People's mobility has changed significantly due to the implementation of travel restriction and quarantine measurements. Indeed, the physical distance has widened at international (cross-border), national and regional level. At international level, due to the travel restrictions, the number of international flights has plunged overall at around 88 percent during March. In particular, the number of flights connecting Europe dropped drastically in mid of March after the United States announced travel restrictions to Europe and the EU and participating countries agreed to close borders, at 84 percent decline compared to March 10th. Similarly, we examined the impacts of quarantine measures in the major city: Tokyo (Japan), New York City (the United States), and Barcelona (Spain). Within all three cities, we found the significant decline in traffic volume. We also identified the increased concern for mental health through the analysis of posts on social networking services such as Twitter and Instagram. Notably, in the beginning of April 2020, the number of post with #depression on Instagram doubled, which might reflect the rise in mental health awareness among Instagram users. Besides, we identified the changes in a wide range of people's social behaviors, as well as economic impacts through the analysis of Instagram data and primary survey data.","Garcia-Gasulla, Dario; Napagao, Sergio Alvarez; Li, Irene; Maruyama, Hiroshi; Kanezashi, Hiroki; P'erez-Arnal, Raquel; Miyoshi, Kunihiko; Ishii, Euma; Suzuki, Keita; Shiba, Sayaka; Kurokawa, Mariko; Kanzawa, Yuta; Nakagawa, Naomi; Hanai, Masatoshi; Li, Yixin; Li, Tianxiao",https://doi.org/nan,20200610.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-14

Impact from COVID-19 will likely affect treatment arms equally, so analyses of adverse events from controlled data can, to a large extent, remain unchanged. However, interpretation of summaries from uncontrolled data (summaries that include open-label extension data) will require even more caution than usual. Special consideration will be needed for safety topics of interest, especially events expected to have a higher incidence due to a COVID-19 infection or due to quarantine or travel restrictions (e.g., depression).

In particular, when individuals self-report their experiences over the course of the virus on social media, it can allow for identification of the emotions each stage of symptoms engenders in the patient. Posts to the Reddit forum r/COVID19Positive contain first-hand accounts from COVID-19 positive patients, giving insight into personal struggles with the virus. These posts often feature a temporal structure indicating the number of days after developing symptoms the text refers to. Using topic modelling and sentiment analysis, we quantify the change in discussion of COVID-19 throughout individuals' experiences for the first 14 days since symptom onset. Discourse on early symptoms such as fever, cough, and sore throat was concentrated towards the beginning of the posts, while language indicating breathing issues peaked around ten days. Some conversation around critical cases was also identified and appeared at a roughly constant rate. We identified two clear clusters of positive and negative emotions associated with the evolution of these symptoms and mapped their relationships. Our results provide a perspective on the patient experience of COVID-19 that complements other medical data streams and can potentially reveal when mental health issues might appear.","Murray, Curtis; Mitchell, Lewis; Tuke, Jonathan; Mackay, Mark",https://doi.org/nan,20200521.0,,ArXiv,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-14

Activities have been restricted in quality, quantity and scope; transfers and discharges have been halted and patient progress put on pause. Understanding how and what ways these restrictions will affect patients is crucial. This is especially salient given that large numbers of the general population have reported heightened mental health burden in recent surveys. However, it is not yet clear how and in what ways the COVID-19 restrictions will affect the mental health of patients in secure care. Past research investigating patients experiences of restrictions on autonomy in secure care that were present before the pandemic can be helpful here. Studies suggest that patient experience restrictions in care in myriad subjective ways. These include limitations on family contact, outside leave, and making hot drinks but also more profoundly on their autonomy, sense of self, and personhood. Quantitative studies have found correlations between experiences of restrictiveness and ward atmosphere, quality of life, suicidal ideation, depression and general psychological state in this patient group. This paper suggests how we can use past research exploring patient expereinces of restrictive interventions to guide the implementation of social distancing measures in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Tomlin, Dr Jack",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsiml.2020.100018,20200428.0,,Elsevier; PMC; WHO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,False,False,,2020-07-14
95,Covid-19 et remaniement des défenses contre la dépression chez les soignants en Ehpad,"Résumé Les réponses des Ehpad à la pandémie et au confinement actuel révèlent et amplifient les défenses habituelles des soignants contre la dépression. Le fait que le danger de mort et l’obligation d’enfermer les résidents viennent de l’extérieur, et le maniement permanent des mesures de protection physique ne suppriment pas le sentiment d’inutilité et l’angoisse de mort qu’ils tolèrent ou évitent d’ordinaire. L’auteur montre qu’ils ajoutent au contraire à leur inquiétude et par conséquent à leur besoin de parole et d’écoute. Summary The responses of nursing homes to the present pandemic and lock-down reveal and amplify the usual defensive mechanisms deployed by professional caregivers against depression. The danger of death and the need to confine the residents, both coming from the outside world, and the permanent management of physical protective measures do not remove the feeling of uselessness and the anxiety of death that the nursing staff habitually tolerates or avoids. On the contrary, these aspects add to caregivers’ need to talk and be listened to.","Charazac, P.
