"Understanding Inequalities in Mental Health by Family Structure during COVID-19 Lockdowns: Evidence from the UK Household Longitudinal Study","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic increased psychiatric distress and impacts differed by family structure. We aimed to identify mechanisms contributing to these inequalities. Methods: Survey data were from the UK Household Longitudinal Study. Psychiatric distress (GHQ-12) was measured in April 2020 (first UK lockdown; n=10,516), and January 2021 (lockdown re-introduced following eased restrictions; n=6,893). Pre-lockdown family structure comprised partner status and presence of children (<16 years). Mediating mechanisms included: active employment, financial strain, childcare/home-schooling, caring, and loneliness. Monte Carlo g-computation simulations were used to adjust for confounding and estimate total effects and decompositions into: controlled direct effects (effects if the mediator was absent), and portions eliminated (PE; representing differential exposure and vulnerability to the mediator). Results: In January 2021, after adjustment, we estimated increased risk of distress among couples with children compared to couples with no children (RR: 1.48; 95% CI: 1.15-1.82), largely because of childcare/home-schooling (PE RR: 1.32; 95% CI: 1.00-1.64). Single respondents without children also had increased risk of distress compared to couples with no children (RR: 1.55; 95% CI: 1.27-1.83), and the largest PE was for loneliness (RR: 1.16; 95% CI: 1.05-1.27), though financial strain contributed (RR: 1.05; 95% CI: 0.99-1.12). Single parents demonstrated the highest levels of distress, but confounder adjustment suggested uncertain effects with wide confidence intervals. Findings were similar in April 2020 and when stratified by sex. Conclusions: Access to childcare/schooling, financial security and social connection are important mechanisms that need addressing to avoid widening mental health inequalities during public health crises.","Michael J Green; Peter Craig; Evangelia Demou; Srinivasa Vittal Katikireddi; Alastair H Leyland; Anna Pearce","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.10.27.22281616","20221030","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-31","",40039,""
"The relative contribution of COVID-19 infection versus COVID-19 related occupational stressors to insomnia in healthcare workers","Abstract Objective/Background: Healthcare workers have experienced high rates of psychiatric symptom burden and occupational attrition during the COVID-19 pandemic. Identifying contributory factors can inform prevention and mitigation measures. Here, we explore the potential contributions of occupational stressors vs COVID-19 infection to insomnia symptoms in US healthcare workers. Patients/Methods: An online self-report survey was collected between September 2020 and July 2022 from N=594 US healthcare workers, with longitudinal follow-up up to 9 months. Assessments included the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), and a 13-item scale assessing COVID-19 related occupational stressors. Results: Insomnia was common (45% of participants reported at least moderate and 9.2% reported severe symptoms at one or more timepoint) and significantly associated with difficulty completing work-related tasks, increased likelihood of occupational attrition, and thoughts of suicide or self-harm (all p<.0001). In multivariable regression with age, gender, and family COVID-19 history as covariates, past two-week COVID-related occupational stressors, peak COVID-related occupational stressors, and personal history of COVID-19 infection were all significantly related to past two-week ISI scores (Beta=1.7+/-0.14SE, Beta=0.08+/-0.03, and Beta=0.69+/-0.22 respectively). Although similar results were found for the PCL-5, when ISI and PCL-5 items were separated by factor, COVID-19 infection was significantly related only to the factor consisting of sleep-related items. Conclusions: Both recent occupational stress and personal history of COVID-19 infection were significantly associated with insomnia in healthcare workers. These results suggest that both addressing occupational stressors and reducing rate of COVID-19 infection are important to protect healthcare workers and the healthcare workforce.","Rebecca Cappel Hendrickson; Catherine A McCall; Aaron F Rosser; Kathleen F Pagulayan; Bernard P Chang; Ellen D Sano; Ronald G Thomas; Murray A Raskind","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.10.27.22281582","20221030","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-31","",40040,""
"The impact of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions on physical activity and mental health status of Iranian people","Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious disease caused by acute respiratory syndrome that can negatively impact physical activity as well as mental health of people in the world. Since Iran is one of the countries deeply affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions on physical activity behaviours, as well as on mental health indicators among Iranian people. In this cross-sectional study, 335 participants were included (155 males, mean ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°30.06Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°14.58Ã‚Â years). Participants were selected through the convenience sampling from different parts of Iran mainly through virtual social networks and filled out an electronic questionnaire in the form of Google Form online survey measuring physical activity behaviours (The International Physical Activity Questionnaire; IPAQ; Short Form) and two mental health indicators-self-esteem (Rosenberg self-esteem scale) and social physical anxiety (7-items socialÃ‚Â physiqueÃ‚Â anxiety scale). The questionnaires were provided to the participants in the spring of 2021 for 15Ã‚Â days and they were asked to answer it in two periods before the outbreak of coronavirus (winter 2020) and the period during the outbreak of coronavirus (spring 2021). The results showed that participants reported significant differences from before to during the pandemic in all three variables of physical activity (significant decreases), self-esteem (significant decreases), and social physical anxiety (significant increases) regardless of participants' gender. The results of correlation test between changes in physical activity and changes in mental health indicators showed that COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted self-esteem and social physical anxiety. However, we have not found any significant association of physical activity's change with social physical anxiety or self-esteem's changes before and during the pandemic. The findings of the present study indicate a detrimental effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the physical activity and mental health among Iranian people. Public policies aiming to buffer the negative impact on COVID-19 Iranians' health are urgently needed.","Saemi, Nobari, Badicu, Ghazizadeh, Pashabadi, Imani, Clemente, Silva, Afrash","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13102-022-00584-1","20221030","COVID-19; Iran; Physical activity; Self-esteem; Social physical anxiety","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-31","",40041,""
"The Effects of the Unified Protocol and Unified Protocol Skills on Loneliness in the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background: Loneliness is a significant public health concern with no established first-line intervention although modular, transdiagnostic, cognitive-behavioral interventions, such as the Unified Protocol (UP), are promising candidates. The UP contains skill modules to target anxiety, depression, and related conditions, although it is unclear if the UP can reduce loneliness and if UP skill use contributes to these reductions. Methods: Using data from the first-stage randomization of a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial, we tested whether the UP led to reductions in loneliness and whether specific dimensions of UP skill use predicted session-to-session changes in loneliness. Participants (N = 70; Mage = 33.74, 67% female, 74% white) completed six sessions of core UP modules, reporting how frequently they felt lonely and used UP skills before each session. Using hierarchical linear modeling, we examined the trajectory of change in loneliness and disaggregated between- from within-person variability to test session-to-session effects of skill use. Results: Loneliness significantly decreased during treatment with the UP. Using more UP skills than oneâ€™s personal average, but not frequency of skill use, predicted session-to-session decreases in loneliness. Conclusions: Therapists may be encouraged to guide patients toward using a large quantity of different skills to specifically address loneliness.","Matthew W.
