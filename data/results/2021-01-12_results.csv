"The willingness to adopt m-Health among Chinese parents during the COVID-19 outbreakÃ¯Â¼<U+009A>Cross-Sectional Questionnaire Study","BACKGROUND: Parental involvement in m-health to consult with medical professionals appears to be prevalent in China with rapid development in Internet. More parents with busy jobs choose m-health without time limitation. During the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, m-Health can assist with health promotion, directions for medication usage and disease diagnosis via online chat and video consultation without contacting others. To our knowledge, no studies have been performed to explore the role of m-health in parents' attitudes towards child health at home during COVID-19 outbreak. OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to identify the associated factors of willingness to adopt m-Health among Chinese parents during the COVID-19 outbreak, and to explore the correlation between the frequency of adopting m-Health and parents' attitudes towards child health at home. METHODS: Chinese parents were asked to complete an online survey from 25th January to 15th February, 2020. The questionnaire comprised of two parts with a total of sixteen items, including parents' demographic variables and attitudes towards child health at home. By multivariate logistic regression we explored factors associated with parents' willingness to adopt m-Health during the COVID-19 outbreak. Pearson chi-square test was used to reveal the correlation between the frequency of adopting m-Health and parents' attitudes towards child health at home. RESULTS: A total of 254 parents enrolled, from which 202 out 254 (79.5%) were willing to adopt m-Health during the COVID-19 outbreak. Parents' age ((adjusted OR (AOR): 8.114(95% CI: 1.471 to 44.764)), parents' interest in the COVID-19 pandemic (AOR: 8.753(95% CI: 2.009 to 38.127); AOR: 22.194(95% CI: 5.509 to 89.411)), the source to recommend m-Health (AOR: 4.257(95% CI: 1.439 to 12.596)), presence of chronic disease in children (AOR: 20.844(95% CI: 4.600 to 94.443)), parents' duration of daily internet use (AOR: 6.487(95% CI: 1.870 to 22.495); AOR: 8.766(95% CI: 1.883 to 40.804)), and adoption of m-Health before the COVID-19 outbreak (AOR: 3.413(95% CI: 1.234 to 9.444)) were significantly correlated with parents' willingness to adopt m-Health during the COVID-19 outbreak. The frequency of m-health usage among parents was correlated with their behaviors in regards to hand-washing (2=18.967, P=.004), mask-wearing (2=45.364, P< .001), frequency of leaving the home (2=16.767, P=.01), room disinfection and ventilation (2=19.515, P=.003), temperature checking (2=17.47, P=.007), and mental health-care of children (2=63.810, P< .001) during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: We found various objective factors to be associated with parents' willingness to adopt m-Health during the COVID-19 outbreak. Overall, parents' willingness to adopt m-Health was high. The frequency of m-health usage among parents was correlated with their attitudes towards child health at home. The option of m-Health to patients at home during the COVID-19 outbreak would be beneficial for education and improvement in self-management of child health at home.","Yang, Siyu; Chen, Yijing; Zhou, Leshan; Huang, Yuting; Dai, Jiahui","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/23155","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Mhealth Uhealth;2020 Dec 23.; Publication details: JMIR Mhealth Uhealth;2020 Dec 23.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-12","",9239,""

"Adverse effects of COVID-19-related lockdown on pain, physical activity and psychological well-being in people with chronic pain","Countries across the world imposed lockdown restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic  It has been proposed that lockdown conditions, including social and physical distancing measures, may disproportionately impact those living with chronic pain and require rapid adaptation to treatment and care strategies  Using an online methodology, we investigated how lockdown restrictions in the United Kingdom impacted individuals with chronic pain (N=431) relative to a healthy control group (N =88)  Data were collected during the most stringent period of lockdown in the United Kingdom (mid-April to early-May 2020)  In accordance with the fear-avoidance model, we hypothesised lockdown-related increases in pain and psychological distress, which would be mediated by levels of pain catastrophising  Responses indicated that people with chronic pain perceived increased pain severity, compared to their estimation of typical pain levels prior to lockdown (p &lt;  001)  They were also more adversely affected by lockdown conditions compared to pain-free individuals, demonstrating greater self-perceived increases in anxiety and depressed mood, increased loneliness and reduced levels of physical exercise (p  001)  Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that pain catastrophising was an important factor relating to the extent of self-perceived increases in pain severity during lockdown (beta= 27, p &lt; 001) and also mediated the relationship between decreased mood and pain  Perceived decreases in levels of physical exercise also related to perceptions of increased pain (beta= 15, p &lt;  001)  Interestingly, levels of pain intensity (measured at two time points at pre and during lockdown) in a subgroup (N=85) did not demonstrate a significant change  However, individuals in this subgroup stilt reported self-perceived pain increases during lockdown, which were also predicted by baseline levels of pain catastrophising  Overall, the findings indicate that people with chronic pain suffer adverse effects of lockdown including self-perceived increases in their pain  Remote pain management provision to target reduction of pain catastrophising and increase health behaviours including physical activity could be beneficial for this vulnerable population","Fallon, N.; Brown, C.; Twiddy, H.; Brian, E.; Frank, B.; Nurmikko, T.; Stancak, A.","https://doi.org/10.1177/2049463720973703","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: British Journal of Pain;: 12, 2020.; Publication details: British Journal of Pain;: 12, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-12","",9246,""

"Massachusetts Justice Community Opioid Innovation Network (MassJCOIN)","A major driver of the U S  opioid crisis is limited access to effective medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) that reduce overdose risks  Traditionally, jails and prisons in the U S  have not initiated or maintained MOUD for incarcerated individuals with OUD prior to their return to the community, which places them at high risk for fatal overdose  A 2018 law (Chapter 208) made Massachusetts (MA) the first state to mandate that five county jails deliver all FDA-approved MOUDs (naltrexone [NTX], buprenorphine [BUP], and methadone)  Chapter 208 established a 4-year pilot program to expand access to all FDA-approved forms of MOUD at five jails, with two more MA jails voluntarily joining this initiative  The law stipulates that MOUD be continued for individuals receiving it prior to detention and be initiated prior to release among sentenced individuals where appropriate  The jails must also facilitate continuation of MOUD in the community on release  The Massachusetts Justice Community Opioid Innovation Network (MassJCOIN) partnered with these seven diverse jails, the MA Department of Public Health, and community treatment providers to conduct a Type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation study of Chapter 208  We will: (1) Perform a longitudinal treatment outcome study among incarcerated individuals with OUD who receive NTX, BUP, methadone, or no MOUD in jail to examine postrelease MOUD initiation, engagement, and retention, as well as fatal and nonfatal opioid overdose and recidivism;(2) Conduct an implementation study to understand systemic and contextual factors that facilitate and impede delivery of MOUDs in jail and community care coordination, and strategies that optimize MOUD delivery in jail and for coordinating care with community partners;(3) Calculate the cost to the correctional system of implementing MOUD in jail, and conduct an economic evaluation from state policy-maker and societal perspectives to compare the value of MOUD prior to release from jail to no MOUD among matched controls  MassJCOIN made significant progress during its first six months until the COVID-19 pandemic began in March 2020  Participating jail sites restricted access for nonessential personnel, established other COVID-19 mitigation policies, and modified MOUD programming  MassJCOIN adapted research activities to this new reality in an effort to document and account for the impacts of COVID-19 in relation to each aim  The goal remains to produce findings with direct implications for policy and practice for OUD in criminal justice settings","Evans, Elizabeth A.; Stopka, Thomas J.; Pivovarova, Ekaterina, Murphy, Sean M.; Taxman, Faye S.; Ferguson, Warren J.; Bernson, Dana, Santelices, Claudia, McCollister, Kathryn E.; Hoskinson, Randall, Lincoln, Thomas, Friedmann, Peter D.; Coppinger, Sheriff Kevin F.; Faro, Jason, Donelan, Sheriff Christopher J.; Hayes, Edmond, Cocchi, Sheriff Nicholas, Lyman, Martha, Lincoln, Thomas, Cahillane, Sheriff Patrick J.; Cady, Melinda, Koutoujian, Sheriff Peter J.; Siddiqi, Kashif, Lee, Dan, McDermott, Sheriff Jerome P.; Flynn, Tara, Sica, Erika, Tompkins, Sheriff Steven W.; Steinberg, Rachelle, Bernadeau-Alexandre, Marjorie","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108275","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment;: 108275, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment;: 108275, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-12","",9252,""

The concentration of NO2 linked to COVID-19-related deaths in three major French cities were determined using Artificial Neural Networks experiments and a Causal Direction from Dependency (D2C) algorithm. The aim of the study was to evaluate the potential effects of NO2 in spreading the epidemic. The underlying hypothesis is that NO2, as a precursor to secondary particulate matter formation, can foster COVID-19 and make the respiratory system more susceptible to this infection. Three different neural networks for the cities of Paris, Lyon and Marseille were built in this work, followed by the application of an innovative tool of cutting the signal from the inputs to the selected target. The results show that the threshold levels of NO2 connected to COVID-19 range between 15.8 Âµg/m3 for Lyon, 21.8 Âµg/m3 for Marseille and 22.9 Âµg/m3 for Paris, which were significantly lower than the average annual concentration limit of 40 Âµg/mÂ³ imposed by Directive 2008/50/EC of the European Parliament.","Mele, Marco; Magazzino, Cosimo; Schneider, Nicolas; Strezov, Vladimir","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.110663","","Country: NL; HOLANDA; NETHERLANDS; PAISES BAJOS; THE NETHERLANDS; HOLLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Environ Res;: 110663, 2021 Jan 05.; Publication details: Environ Res;: 110663, 2021 Jan 05.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-12","",9264,""

"Prevalence and risk factors for delirium in critically ill patients with COVID-19 (COVID-D): a multicentre cohort study","To date, 750Ã¢â‚¬Ë†000 patients with COVID-19 worldwide have required mechanical ventilation and thus are at high risk of acute brain dysfunction (coma and delirium). We aimed to investigate the prevalence of delirium and coma, and risk factors for delirium in critically ill patients with COVID-19, to aid the development of strategies to mitigate delirium and associated sequelae. This multicentre cohort study included 69 adult intensive care units (ICUs), across 14 countries. We included all patients (aged Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years) admitted to participating ICUs with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection before April 28, 2020. Patients who were moribund or had life-support measures withdrawn within 24 h of ICU admission, prisoners, patients with pre-existing mental illness, neurodegenerative disorders, congenital or acquired brain damage, hepatic coma, drug overdose, suicide attempt, or those who were blind or deaf were excluded. We collected de-identified data from electronic health records on patient demographics, delirium and coma assessments, and management strategies for a 21-day period. Additional data on ventilator support, ICU length of stay, and vital status was collected for a 28-day period. The primary outcome was to determine the prevalence of delirium and coma and to investigate any associated risk factors associated with development of delirium the next day. We also investigated predictors of number of days alive without delirium or coma. These outcomes were investigated using multivariable regression. Between Jan 20 and April 28, 2020, 4530 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to 69 ICUs, of whom 2088 patients were included in the study cohort. The median age of patients was 64 years (IQR 54 to 71) with a median Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II of 40Ã‚Â·0 (30Ã‚Â·0 to 53Ã‚Â·0). 1397 (66Ã‚Â·9%) of 2088 patients were invasively mechanically ventilated on the day of ICU admission and 1827 (87Ã‚Â·5%) were invasively mechanical ventilated at some point during hospitalisation. Infusion with sedatives while on mechanical ventilation was common: 1337 (64Ã‚Â·0%) of 2088 patients were given benzodiazepines for a median of 7Ã‚Â·0 days (4Ã‚Â·0 to 12Ã‚Â·0) and 1481 (70Ã‚Â·9%) were given propofol for a median of 7Ã‚Â·0 days (4Ã‚Â·0 to 11Ã‚Â·0). Median Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale score while on invasive mechanical ventilation was -4 (-5 to -3). 1704 (81Ã‚Â·6%) of 2088 patients were comatose for a median of 10Ã‚Â·0 days (6Ã‚Â·0 to 15Ã‚Â·0) and 1147 (54Ã‚Â·9%) were delirious for a median of 3Ã‚Â·0 days (2Ã‚Â·0 to 6Ã‚Â·0). Mechanical ventilation, use of restraints, and benzodiazepine, opioid, and vasopressor infusions, and antipsychotics were each associated with a higher risk of delirium the next day (all pÃ¢â€°Â¤0Ã‚Â·04), whereas family visitation (in person or virtual) was associated with a lower risk of delirium (p&lt;0Ã‚Â·0001). During the 21-day study period, patients were alive without delirium or coma for a median of 5Ã‚Â·0 days (0Ã‚Â·0 to 14Ã‚Â·0). At baseline, older age, higher SAPS II scores, male sex, smoking or alcohol abuse, use of vasopressors on day 1, and invasive mechanical ventilation on day 1 were independently associated with fewer days alive and free of delirium and coma (all p&lt;0Ã‚Â·01). 601 (28Ã‚Â·8%) of 2088 patients died within 28 days of admission, with most of those deaths occurring in the ICU. Acute brain dysfunction was highly prevalent and prolonged in critically ill patients with COVID-19.

"6-month consequences of COVID-19 in patients discharged from hospital: a cohort study","The long-term health consequences of COVID-19 remain largely unclear. The aim of this study was to describe the long-term health consequences of patients with COVID-19 who have been discharged from hospital and investigate the associated risk factors, in particular disease severity. We did an ambidirectional cohort study of patients with confirmed COVID-19 who had been discharged from Jin Yin-tan Hospital (Wuhan, China) between Jan 7, 2020, and May 29, 2020. Patients who died before follow-up, patients for whom follow-up would be difficult because of psychotic disorders, dementia, or re-admission to hospital, those who were unable to move freely due to concomitant osteoarthropathy or immobile before or after discharge due to diseases such as stroke or pulmonary embolism, those who declined to participate, those who could not be contacted, and those living outside of Wuhan or in nursing or welfare homes were all excluded. All patients were interviewed with a series of questionnaires for evaluation of symptoms and health-related quality of life, underwent physical examinations and a 6-min walking test, and received blood tests. A stratified sampling procedure was used to sample patients according to their highest seven-category scale during their hospital stay as 3, 4, and 5-6, to receive pulmonary function test, high resolution CT of the chest, and ultrasonography. Enrolled patients who had participated in the Lopinavir Trial for Suppression of SARS-CoV-2 in China received severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antibody tests. Multivariable adjusted linear or logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between disease severity and long-term health consequences. In total, 1733 of 2469 discharged patients with COVID-19 were enrolled after 736 were excluded. Patients had a median age of 57Ã‚Â·0 (IQR 47Ã‚Â·0-65Ã‚Â·0) years and 897 (52%) were men. The follow-up study was done from June 16, to Sept 3, 2020, and the median follow-up time after symptom onset was 186Ã‚Â·0 (175Ã‚Â·0-199Ã‚Â·0) days. Fatigue or muscle weakness (63%, 1038 of 1655) and sleep difficulties (26%, 437 of 1655) were the most common symptoms. Anxiety or depression was reported among 23% (367 of 1617) of patients. The proportions of median 6-min walking distance less than the lower limit of the normal range were 24% for those at severity scale 3, 22% for severity scale 4, and 29% for severity scale 5-6. The corresponding proportions of patients with diffusion impairment were 22% for severity scale 3, 29% for scale 4, and 56% for scale 5-6, and median CT scores were 3Ã‚Â·0 (IQR 2Ã‚Â·0-5Ã‚Â·0) for severity scale 3, 4Ã‚Â·0 (3Ã‚Â·0-5Ã‚Â·0) for scale 4, and 5Ã‚Â·0 (4Ã‚Â·0-6Ã‚Â·0) for scale 5-6. After multivariable adjustment, patients showed an odds ratio (OR) 1Ã‚Â·61 (95% CI 0Ã‚Â·80-3Ã‚Â·25) for scale 4 versus scale 3 and 4Ã‚Â·60 (1Ã‚Â·85-11Ã‚Â·48) for scale 5-6 versus scale 3 for diffusion impairment; OR 0Ã‚Â·88 (0Ã‚Â·66-1Ã‚Â·17) for scale 4 versus scale 3 and OR 1Ã‚Â·77 (1Ã‚Â·05-2Ã‚Â·97) for scale 5-6 versus scale 3 for anxiety or depression, and OR 0Ã‚Â·74 (0Ã‚Â·58-0Ã‚Â·96) for scale 4 versus scale 3 and 2Ã‚Â·69 (1Ã‚Â·46-4Ã‚Â·96) for scale 5-6 versus scale 3 for fatigue or muscle weakness. Of 94 patients with blood antibodies tested at follow-up, the seropositivity (96Ã‚Â·2% vs 58Ã‚Â·5%) and median titres (19Ã‚Â·0 vs 10Ã‚Â·0) of the neutralising antibodies were significantly lower compared with at the acute phase. 107 of 822 participants without acute kidney injury and with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 90 mL/min per 1Ã‚Â·73 m<sup>2</sup> or more at acute phase had eGFR less than 90 mL/min per 1Ã‚Â·73 m<sup>2</sup> at follow-up. At 6 months after acute infection, COVID-19 survivors were mainly troubled with fatigue or muscle weakness, sleep difficulties, and anxiety or depression. Patients who were more severely ill during their hospital stay had more severe impaired pulmonary diffusion capacities and abnormal chest imaging manifestations, and are the main target population for intervention of long-term recovery.

"Is Europe facing an opioid epidemic: what does European Monitoring Data tell us?","This paper addresses the question of whether Europe is facing an opioid epidemic and utilises data from the European monitoring system on opioid use, harms and availability, to help assess the situation. Data sources covering the last decade on overdose deaths, drug treatment entrants and drug-related emergencies suggest that the health burden associated with opioid use is mostly related to the consumption of heroin - and to a lesser extent diverted opioid substitution treatment medications - and that it is primarily affecting an ageing cohort of vulnerable users, with little evidence of an increase in initiation. While opioid-related deaths are currently at much lower levels than in the US, they still represent a large preventable health burden with differences across EU countries. There is also increasing concern related to the high availability of heroin, illicitly produced synthetic opioids and diverted opioid pain medications on the European drugs market. Trends in the latter categories are poorly monitored and we may miss signs of emerging problems. Moreover, the economic recession following the COVID-19 pandemic has a potential to lead to resurgence in opioid use and harms.","Seyler, Giraudon, Noor, Mounteney, Griffiths","https://doi.org/10.1002/ejp.1728","20210111","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-12","",9268,""
"The psychological effects of COVID-19 on hospital workers at the beginning of the outbreak with a large disease cluster on the Diamond Princess cruise ship","The aim of the present study was to investigate the psychological effects of the COVID-19 outbreak and associated factors on hospital workers at the beginning of the outbreak with a large disease cluster on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. This cross-sectional, survey-based study collected demographic data, mental health measurements, and stress-related questionnaires from workers in 2 hospitals in Yokohama, Japan, from March 23, 2020, to April 6, 2020. The prevalence rates of general psychological distress and event-related distress were assessed using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and the 22-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), respectively. Exploratory factor analysis was conducted on the 26-item stress-related questionnaires. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mental health outcomes for workers both at high- and low-risk for infection of COVID-19. A questionnaire was distributed to 4133 hospital workers, and 2697 (65.3%) valid questionnaires were used for analyses. Overall, 536 (20.0%) were high-risk workers, 944 (35.0%) of all hospital workers showed general distress, and 189 (7.0%) demonstrated event-related distress. Multivariable logistic regression analyses revealed that 'Feeling of being isolated and discriminated' was associated with both the general and event-related distress for both the high- and low-risk workers. In this survey, not only high-risk workers but also low-risk workers in the hospitals admitting COVID-19 patients reported experiencing psychological distress at the beginning of the outbreak.","Ide, Asami, Suda, Yoshimi, Fujita, Nomoto, Roppongi, Hino, Takahashi, Watanabe, Shimada, Hamasaki, Endo, Kaneko, Suzuki, Kubota, Saigusa, Kato, Odawara, Nakajima, Takeuchi, Goto, Aihara, Hishimoto","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245294","20210111","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-12","",9269,""
"Why the COVID-19 pandemic is a traumatic stressor","The COVID-19 pandemic does not fit into prevailing Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) models, or diagnostic criteria, yet emerging research shows traumatic stress symptoms as a result of this ongoing global stressor. Current pathogenic event models focus on past, and largely direct, trauma exposure to certain kinds of life-threatening events. Yet, traumatic stress reactions to future, indirect trauma exposure, and non-Criterion A events exist, suggesting COVID-19 is also a traumatic stressor which could lead to PTSD symptomology. To examine this idea, we asked a sample of online participants (N = 1,040), in five western countries, to indicate the COVID-19 events they had been directly exposed to, events they anticipated would happen in the future, and other forms of indirect exposure such as through media coverage. We then asked participants to complete the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-5, adapted to measure pre/peri/post-traumatic reactions in relation to COVID-19. We also measured general emotional reactions (e.g., angry, anxious, helpless), well-being, psychosocial functioning, and depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms. We found participants had PTSD-like symptoms for events that had not happened and when participants had been directly (e.g., contact with virus) or indirectly exposed to COVID-19 (e.g., via media). Moreover, 13.2% of our sample were likely PTSD-positive, despite types of COVID-19 &quot;exposure&quot; (e.g., lockdown) not fitting DSM-5 criteria. The emotional impact of &quot;worst&quot; experienced/anticipated events best predicted PTSD-like symptoms. Taken together, our findings support emerging research that COVID-19 can be understood as a traumatic stressor event capable of eliciting PTSD-like responses and exacerbating other related mental health problems (e.g., anxiety, depression, psychosocial functioning, etc.). Our findings add to existing literature supporting a pathogenic event memory model of traumatic stress.","Bridgland, Moeck, Green, Swain, Nayda, Matson, Hutchison, Takarangi","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0240146","20210111","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-12","",9270,""

"Heart up! RCT protocol to increase physical activity in cardiac patients who report hopelessness: Amended for the COVID-19 pandemic","Hopelessness is associated with decreased physical activity (PA) and increased adverse events and death in patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD). Rates of PA in patients with IHD continue to be low in both hospital-based cardiac rehabilitation and home settings. While researchers have investigated strategies to increase PA among patients with IHD, interventions to promote PA specifically in IHD patients who report hopelessness are lacking. We describe the protocol for a NIH-funded randomized controlled trial designed to establish the effectiveness of a 6-week intervention (Heart Up!) to promote increased PA in IHD patients who report hopelessness. Participants (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°225) are randomized to one of three groups: (1) motivational social support (MSS) from a nurse, (2) MSS from a nurse plus significant other support (SOS), or (3) attention control. Aims are to: (1) test the effectiveness of 6 weeks of MSS and MSS with SOS on increasing mean minutes per day of moderate to vigorous PA; (2) determine the effects of change in moderate to vigorous PA on hopelessness; and (3) determine if perceived social support and motivation (exercise self-regulation) mediate the effects of the intervention on PA. A total of 69 participants have been enrolled to date. The protocol has been consistently and accurately used by research personnel. We address the protocol challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic and steps taken to maintain fidelity to the intervention. Findings from this study could transform care for IHD patients who report hopelessness by promoting self-management of important PA goals that can contribute to better health outcomes.","Dunn, Robbins, Tintle, Collins, Bronas, Goodyke, Luong, Gutierrez-Kapheim, DeVon","https://doi.org/10.1002/nur.22106","20210111","COVID-19; cardiac; hopelessness; physical activity; research protocol","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-12","",9273,""
"The impact of long-term opioid use on the risk and severity of COVID-19","Based on evidence of the immunosuppressive effects of chronic opioids, long-term users of prescription and illicit opioids comprise an unrecognized but growing population of Americans with compromised immune function and respiratory depression who may be at high risk of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19)-related hospitalization, prolonged ICU stay, adverse events, and death. This perspective is of broad clinical and public health importance because the US has the highest population of long-term users of prescription opioids, a sequel of a decade-long practice of opioid overprescribing in the US. For long-term opioid users who are hospitalized for COVID-19, clinicians face clinical challenges arising from the suppressive effects of opioids on the respiratory and immune functions, as well as the potential for adverse drug-drug interaction when opioids have to be continued in long-term users. More research is needed to further understand the association of long-term opioid use and susceptibility to COVID-19 and other emerging infections.","Shah, Kuo, Baillargeon, Raji","https://doi.org/10.5055/jom.2020.0597","20210111","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-12","",9274,""

"Resource-Based Internet Intervention (Med-Stress) to Improve Well-Being Among Medical Professionals: Randomized Controlled Trial","Medical professionals are exposed to multiple and often excessive demands in their work environment. Low-intensity internet interventions allow them to benefit from psychological support even when institutional help is not available. Focusing on enhancing psychological resources-self-efficacy and perceived social support-makes an intervention relevant for various occupations within the medical profession. Previously, these resources were found to operate both individually or sequentially with self-efficacy either preceding social support (cultivation process) or following it (enabling process). The objective of this randomized controlled trial is to compare the efficacy of 4 variants of Med-Stress, a self-guided internet intervention that aims to improve the multifaceted well-being of medical professionals. This study was conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants (N=1240) were recruited mainly via media campaigns and social media targeted ads. They were assigned to 1 of the following 4 groups: experimental condition reflecting the cultivation process, experimental condition reflecting the enabling process, active comparator enhancing only self-efficacy, and active comparator enhancing only perceived social support. Outcomes included 5 facets of well-being: job stress, job burnout, work engagement, depression, and job-related traumatic stress. Measurements were taken on the web at baseline (time 1), immediately after intervention (time 2), and at a 6-month follow-up (time 3). To analyze the data, linear mixed effects models were used on the intention-to-treat sample. The trial was partially blinded as the information about the duration of the trial, which was different for experimental and control conditions, was public. At time 2, job stress was lower in the condition reflecting the cultivation process than in the one enhancing social support only (d=-0.21), and at time 3, participants in that experimental condition reported the lowest job stress when compared with all 3 remaining study groups (ds between -0.24 and -0.41). For job-related traumatic stress, we found a significant difference between study groups only at time 3: stress was lower in the experimental condition in which self-efficacy was enhanced first than in the active comparator enhancing solely social support (d=-0.24). The same result was found for work engagement (d=-0.20), which means that it was lower in exactly the same condition that was found beneficial for stress relief. There were no differences between study conditions for burnout and depression neither at time 2 nor at time 3. There was a high dropout in the study (1023/1240, 82.50% at posttest), reflecting the pragmatic nature of this trial. The Med-Stress internet intervention improves some components of well-being-most notably job stress-when activities are completed in a specific sequence. The decrease in work engagement could support the notion of dark side of this phenomenon, but further research is needed.

High rates of obesity and medical comorbidities are common. Population-based studies have identified high-risk groups in the event of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including those with problems such as obesity, lung disease and immune-compromising conditions. Structured assessment tools exist to ascertain the risk of adverse outcome in the event of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To assess risk of adverse outcome in the event of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a complete population of forensic psychiatry patients using structured assessment tools. All patients of a national forensic mental health service (n = 141) were rated for risk of adverse outcome in the event of SARS-CoV-2 infection, using two structured tools, the COVID-Age tool and the COVID-Risk tool. We found high rates of relevant physical comorbidities. Mean chronological age was 45.5 years (s.d. = 11.4, median 44.1), mean score on the COVID-Age tool was 59.1 years (s.d. = 19.4, median 58.0), mean difference was 13.6 years (s.d. = 15.6), paired t = 10.9, d.f. = 140, P &lt; 0.001.

"The paradoxical effect of COVID-19 outbreak on loneliness","As in previous periods of quarantine, lockdown confinement measures dictated to control SARS-CoV-2 would be expected to negatively affect mental health. We investigated the immediate effects (over a 10 day period) of a strict nationwide stay-at-home order imposed in Spain, one of the countries most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Focusing our analysis on the feelings of loneliness, we obtained our measures within a social context characterised by strong and continuous public and governmental support for increasing social bonds and cooperation in order to face the common public threat. Leveraging data from the Barcelona Brain Health Initiative, a prospective population-based study cohort, the short UCLA Loneliness Scale was administered to 1604 participants 2 years and 1 year before the stay-at-home lockdown and repeated, on average, 10 days after the official confinement order issued by the Spanish government. Ratings of loneliness remained stable during the 2 years before lockdown; however, they decreased significantly during the early stages of home confinement. This effect was particularly significant for the item 'feeling excluded from others' and was also observed among individuals who were confined alone. Overall, the results suggest that gestures and manifestations of appreciation by people for the labour and efforts of certain individuals, along with official campaigns designed to promote feelings of inclusion and belonging, may have beneficial effects on feelings of loneliness, a negative emotional state strongly regarded as a risk factor for impaired mental and general health status. Further assessments during the later stages of home confinement are now warranted.","BartrÃƒÂ©s-Faz, MaciÃƒÂ , Cattaneo, BorrÃƒÂ s, Tarrero, Solana, Tormos, Pascual-Leone","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2020.163","20210111","Psychological testing; community mental health teams; psychosocial interventions; rating scales; social functioning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-12","",9278,""

Targeted interventions are required to address worsening child neurodevelopmental disability, mental health symptoms and poor diet, sleep and exercise patterns. Improved access to telehealth services is indicated, as is further research on barriers and enablers of effective telehealth services.","Masi, Mendoza Diaz, Tully, Azim, Woolfenden, Efron, Eapen","https://doi.org/10.1111/jpc.15285","20210111","child well-being; family health; neurodevelopmental disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-12","",9281,""
"An outbreak of xenophobia: Perceived discrimination and anxiety in Chinese American college students before and during the COVID-19 pandemic","Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, reports of xenophobic and racist incidents directed at Chinese Americans have escalated. The present study adds further understanding to potential psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic by comparing self-reported questionnaire data from two groups of Chinese students attending a public university in western United States: the group who participated in the study before the outbreak of COVID-19 (Pre-COVID, NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 134), and the group who participated at the beginning (during-COVID, NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 64). The aim of the study was to: (a) compare mean differences in perceived discrimination and anxiety between the two groups, (b) test whether COVID-19 moderated the link between perceived discrimination and anxiety, and (c) examine whether media exposure portraying Chinese individuals negatively mediated relations between COVID-19 and discrimination. Results showed that the During-COVID group reported higher perceived discrimination and anxiety than the Pre-COVID group. The link between perceived discrimination and anxiety was stronger for the During-COVID group. Mediation analyses suggested that negative Chinese media exposure partly accounted for the group difference in perceived discrimination. Results suggest that future studies on the psychosocial implications of the COVID-19 pandemic should consider the role of discrimination in understanding the mental health of Chinese American college students.","Haft, Zhou","https://doi.org/10.1002/ijop.12740","20210111","Anxiety; Covid-19 pandemic; Discrimination; Media exposure; Minority stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-12","",9282,""
"Post-lockdown depression and anxiety in the USA during the COVID-19 pandemic","The mental health impact of the pandemic after the initial lockdowns has not been well studied in the USA. Thus, the purpose of this study was to conduct a comprehensive and systematic national assessment of the prevalence of depression and anxiety in the adult US population. A multi-item, valid and reliable questionnaire was deployed online via mTurk and social media sites to recruit adult US participants in the general population across the USA. A total of 1978 individuals participated in the study, where the majority were: females (51%), whites (74%), non-Hispanic (81%), married (56%), employed full time (68%) and with a bachelor's degree or higher (78%). The prevalence of depression (39%), anxiety (42%) and psychological distress (39%) were computed from the PHQ-4 scale. In multiple regression analyses, depression, anxiety and psychological distress burden (assessed by PHQ-4 scale) was predicted significantly based on race, ethnicity, age, having children at home, employment as a healthcare worker, annual household income and area of residence. Males were more likely to have depression, and females were more likely to have anxiety symptoms. Given the high prevalence of depression and anxiety, interdisciplinary and multisectoral approaches are recommended in the USA along with population-based interventions on mental health improvement.","Khubchandani, Sharma, Webb, Wiblishauser, Bowman","https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdaa250","20210111","mental health; social determinants; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-12","",9283,""
"Community-Level Prevention of Childhood Maltreatment: Next Steps in a World with COVID-19","Maltreatment of children continues to be a major public health concern, with high social, economic and health burdens. Rates vary by a number of factors that can be categorized into different levels of the social ecology. Research and theory in this field point to the importance of community-level factors that can contribute to either risk or prevention of child maltreatment. The COVID-19 pandemic context creates additional risks and concerns related to child maltreatment and exacerbates risk factors that existed before: e.g., families and communities are in much worsened states of poverty, unemployment, and food insecurity; losses and grief are affecting mental health; and limitations and safety concerns are affecting in-person child protection work and more. Central to recovery from this pandemic will be the mobilization of community-level resources and the building back up of the social fabric that can support vulnerable children and caregivers. Key to this mobilization will be a better intersectional understanding of structural inequities in the child welfare system and in our communities. Efforts to dismantle structural biases and discrimination are critical to provide safety and support for families and vital for effective child maltreatment prevention. In this context, we discuss the state of the science of community-level prevention of childhood maltreatment, highlighting evidence-based community-level prevention programs and how these types of efforts may be impacted by the current COVID-19 global pandemic.","Molnar, Scoglio, Beardslee","https://doi.org/10.1007/s42448-020-00064-4","20210111","COVID; Child maltreatment; Community-level; Prevention","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-12","",9284,""
"Case Report: Famotidine for Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in COVID-19","Famotidine is of interest as a possible treatment for COVID-19, with effects on disease-related symptoms and survival reported in observational and retrospective studies, as well as <i>in silico</i> predictions of binding to potential SARS-CoV-2 drug targets. Published studies of famotidine for COVID-19 have focused on acute illness, and none have reported on neuropsychiatric symptoms. This case study reports on an 18-year-old man who sought psychiatric treatment for depression and anxiety, disruptive interpersonal conflicts, and impairments in attention and motivation following mildly symptomatic illness with COVID-19. The neuropsychiatric symptoms, which had been present for 16 weeks at the time of the initial evaluation represented a significant departure from the patient's previous behavioral baseline. The patient had no prior psychiatric history preceding his illness with COVID-19, and no history of any prior treatment with psychopharmacological medications. Famotidine 20 mg twice daily administered orally was begun without any additional medications. At 1-week follow-up the patient was much improved. Improvement was sustained through 12 weeks of follow-up during which the patient continued to take famotidine without apparent side effects. With progression of the COVID-19 pandemic it has become evident that persistent disease-related symptoms may follow acute COVID-19 and may include neuropsychiatric symptoms. Controlled clinical research on famotidine for COVID-19 should follow, as well as the development of valid and reliable research diagnostic criteria to define and operationalize the features of a putative COVID-19 neuropsychiatric residual.","Alper","https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2020.614393","20210111","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; anxiety; cognitive; depression; famotidine (FAM); neuroinflammation; psychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-12","",9285,""
"Risk Assessment and Crisis Intervention for Youth in a Time of Telehealth","For the last decade, there has been growing concern regarding the rising rates of youth engagement in self-injury and suicide. The worldwide outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has elevated these concerns due to increased risk factors pertaining to social, family, economic, and health stressors, in addition to changes to typical routines and support systems. Unfortunately, there are many barriers to at-risk youth being able to access evidence-based mental health services including cost, lack of trained providers, transportation issues, and physical distancing due to the pandemic. Providing school-based prevention and intervention programs that promote social, emotional, and behavioral well-being helps to address many of these barriers. This article highlights important considerations to providing these services in a school-based telehealth modality. Symptom clusters that put youth at risk of harm to self are described. Best practice therapeutic modalities that can be disseminated in a school-based telehealth modality, such as cognitive behavior therapy, dialectical behavior therapy, and mindfulness-based approaches, are reviewed. Although there is growing empirical literature for these school-based prevention and intervention approaches, additional research is needed to determine how to best support at-risk youth remotely.","Holland, Hawks, Morelli, Khan","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40688-020-00341-6","20210111","Risk assessment; School-based intervention; Self-directed violence; Suicide; Telehealth; Youth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-12","",9286,""

"Factors associated with the psychological status during the Coronavirus pandemic, baseline data from an Iranian Province","TheÃ‚Â 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is threatening public health in many ways. The psychological situation of individuals is important and limited data is available from Iran. In this study, we aimed to illustrate the psychological distress of the general population and evaluate the factors affecting it. An online cross-sectional survey was conducted from 29<sup>th</sup> to 31<sup>st</sup> March 2020 in South Khorasan province, affected later than other parts of the country. We included sociodemographic questions, Hospital Anxiety, and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire, and questions addressing various symptoms and diseases. Most questions had multiple choices to select from and some were open questions. Univariate and multivariate analysis in SPSS software was used to find significant relationships. A total of 844 responses were collected, of which 788 records were included in the analysis. The mean age of responders was 36.61Ã‚Â±10.97 (age range: 18-88) and 484 (61.4%) of them were females. The mean scores in the anxiety and depression subscale of the HADS questionnaire were 7.01Ã‚Â±3.68 and 6.72Ã‚Â±3.71 respectively. Experiencing cardiovascular and COVID-19 related symptoms was significantly associated with a higher number of individuals having abnormal anxiety and depression results (p&lt;0.001). Widowed individuals, females, and those experiencing the above-stated symptoms showed a significant association with increased anxiety and depression in multivariate analysis.

"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Health-Related Quality of Life, Anxiety, and Training Among Young Gastroenterologists in Romania","The novel COVID-19 infection has spread all over the world and is still generating a lot of issues at different levels. There is a lack of control in disease early diagnosis and rapid evolution, which impacts both the medical and the economic system. Young gastroenterologists should adapt to overcome current difficulties and continue their life and general training. This is a multi-center national study, which aims to assess the general perspective of young gastroenterologists (residents and young specialists) from six university centers in Romania regarding their current training and the psychological effect the pandemic has on their life and job. An online survey with 58 items was distributed using Google Forms, and quality of life and anxiety were assessed. The validated instruments 15D (for assessing the health-related quality of life) and endler multidimensional anxiety scales (EMAS-for assessing anxiety) were used. All analyses were performed using SPSS 25. Of the 174 gastroenterologists approached, 96 (response rate of 55%) responded. A majority of the respondents were residents in gastroenterology (64%), and 40.6% were male. The pandemic influenced the number of examined patients as well as young gastroenterologists' endoscopy training. Health-related quality of life was negatively associated with the level of anxiety generated by the cognitive component of anxiety as a state, the new and ambiguity of the state, and how threatened the respondent felt. The level of anxiety was moderate (median = 51), and no difference was found between the physicians working in a designated hospital or not. General caution should be considered for young gastroenterologists' training, and continuous observation should be done to ensure better mental health on the current evolution. These findings would need to be verified in larger-sample studies and in different types of specialties.","Ungureanu, Vladut, Bende, Sandru, Tocia, Turcu-Stiolica, Groza, Balan, Turcu-Stiolica","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.579177","20210111","15D instrument; COVID-19; EMAS; anxiety; quality of life; young gastroenterologists","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-12","",9290,""
"Risk Factors Underlying COVID-19 Lockdown-Induced Mental Distress","Recent reports suggest that the COVID-19 lockdown resulted in changes in mental health, however, potential age-related changes and risk factors remain unknown. We measured COVID-19 lockdown-induced stress levels and the severity of depressive symptoms prior to and during the COVID-19 lockdown in different age groups and then searched for potential risk factors in a well-characterized general population-based sample. A total of 715 participants were tested for mental distress and related risk factors at two time-points, baseline testing prior to COVID-19 and follow-up testing during COVID-19, using a battery of validated psychological tests including the Perceived Stress Scale and the Patient Health Questionnaire. Longitudinal measurements revealed that the prevalence of moderate to high stress and the severity of depressive symptoms increased 1.4- and 5.5-fold, respectively, during the COVID-19 lockdown. This surge in mental distress was more severe in women, but was present in all age groups with the older age group exhibiting, cross-sectionally, the lowest levels of mental distress prior to and during the lockdown. Illness perception, personality characteristics such as a feeling of loneliness, and several lifestyle components were found to be associated with a significant increase in mental distress. The observed changes in mental health and the identified potential risk factors underlying these changes provide critical data justifying timely and public emergency-tailored preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic mental health interventions, which should be integrated into future public health policies globally.","NovotnÃƒÂ½, Gonzalez-Rivas, KunzovÃƒÂ¡, SkladanÃƒÂ¡, PospÃƒÂ­Ã…Â¡ilovÃƒÂ¡, PolcrovÃƒÂ¡, Medina-Inojosa, Lopez-Jimenez, Geda, Stokin","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.603014","20210111","COVID-19; depressive symptoms; feeling of loneliness; risk factors; stress levels","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-12","",9291,""
"Assessment of Depression Severity During Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic Among the Palestinian Population: A Growing Concern and an Immediate Consideration","<b>Background:</b> Aggressive quarantine and lockdown measures were implemented as protective public health actions during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Assessing the psychological effects associated with these measures is an important attempt to inform local policymakers in an early stage. Yet little is known about these effects, specifically depression, among the Palestinians. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and predictors of depression among the Palestinian community during this pandemic. <b>Materials and methods:</b> A cross-sectional web-based survey throughout social media (Facebook and Instagram) was carried out using an anonymous online questionnaire. The validated and standardized depression, anxiety, and stress scale (DASS) was used to measure depression severity. A snowball technique recruiting the general public living in Palestine was conducted. Data were collected between 6 and 16 April 2020, which corresponded to the middle interval of strict massive lockdown in Palestine on 22 March to 5 May 2020. Multinomial logistic regression model was developed to predict depression severity. <b>Results:</b> About 2,819 respondents filled out the questionnaire. Depression prevalence was (57.5%; <i>n</i> = 1,621). Out of them, 66% had mild/moderate severity, and 34% had severe/extremely severe degree. Depression severity was negatively associated with age {mild/moderate degree [OR (95% CI) = 0.98 (0.97-0.99)] and severe/extremely severe [OR (95% CI) = 0.96 (0.94-0.97)]} degrees compared with normal degree. Males were significantly less likely to have higher depression than females {mild/moderate degree [OR (95% CI) = 0.69 (0.57-0.85)] and severe/extremely severe [OR (95% CI) = 0.52 (0.40-0.86)]} degree. However, those who reported having inadequate food supply and lesser monthly incomes were more likely to have a higher degree of depression as compared with normal degree. Single persons were significantly more likely to have mild/moderate depression than those in a relationship [OR (95% CI) = 1.31 (1.05-1.64)]. <b>Conclusions:</b> High depression prevalence (57.5%) among the Palestinian community during the COVID-19 pandemic is a growing public health concern. It is essential to provide psychological counseling and treatment during and after the pandemic for the targeted people at high risk (young age/female gender) who were affected psychologically.

"Moving Toward Telehealth Surveillance Services for Toddlers at Risk for Autism During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Since 2016, the project &quot;Early Bird Diagnostic Protocol for Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD)&quot; funded by the Italian Ministry of Health has been operative at IRCCS Fondazione Stella Maris (FSM), Pisa (IT), with the main aim of developing early age-specific diagnostic protocols by longitudinally enrolling two different populations at risk for ASD: (i) toddlers with older siblings with ASD (FR) and (ii) toddlers referred by a child psychiatrist or pediatrician for suspected ASD (CR). On January 30, 2020, when the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), 136 patients (85 FR; 51 CR; 93 males; 43 females) had been enrolled in the project with 324 completed time points and 64 still missing. Considering both the huge psychological burden on families with toddlers at risk for ASD during the lockdown and the longitudinal studies reporting the positive &quot;surveillance effect&quot; in terms of a better outcome in at-risk toddlers, our priority has been to maintain regular contact and support to enrolled families. To do this, the research team, being authorized for smart-working research activities, has set up a detailed remote surveillance protocol (RSP). The RSP includes three online interviews and one online video registration of parent-child play. In the current community case study, the authors report the telehealth procedure and discuss possible future directions in developing remote assessment and new evaluation modalities for ecological parent-child play video recordings in at-risk populations.

"Occupational Stress and Mental Health: A Comparison Between Frontline Medical Staff and Non-frontline Medical Staff During the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease Outbreak","<b>Background:</b> During an epidemic, both frontline and non-frontline medical staff endure stressful work circumstances that render their mental health a major public health concern. This study aims at investigating and comparing the prevalence and severity of mental health symptoms (i.e., anxiety, depression and insomnia) between frontline medical staff and non-frontline medical staff during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. It also seeks to evaluate the association of their mental health with occupational stress. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional study was conducted in Wenzhou, China from 2020 February 16th to 2020 March 2th. A total of 524 medical staff responded to the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire, the Insomnia Severity Index, the Occupational stress Questionnaire, and a demographic data form. Data were principally analyzed with logistic regression. <b>Results:</b> Of the 524 participants, 31.3% reported depression, 41.2% reported anxiety, and 39.3% reported insomnia. Compared with the citizens during the COVID-19 epidemic, medical staff experienced higher level of anxiety, depression and insomnia, especially the frontline medical staff. Furthermore, male, married medical staff with poorer physical health reported lower mental health. Frontline medical staff endorsed higher self-reported occupational stress, especially higher occupational hazards, than non-frontline medical staff. In addition, four indicators on occupational stress (working intensity, working time, working difficulty and working risk) were correlated positively with mental health symptoms. Regression analyses found a significant association between occupational stress and mental health symptoms in both frontline and non-frontline medical staff during COVID-19 outbreak. <b>Conclusion:</b> The results indicated that during the COVID-19 epidemic, medical staff experienced higher levels of anxiety, depression and insomnia than citizens, and their occupational stress had positive effects on their psychological distress.

Its rapid transmission, unpredicted mortality rate, and the uncertainty surrounding its transmission method have evoked additional fear and anxiety. Nonetheless, to the best of our knowledge, no prior study has explored PTSD prevalence three months after the start of the quarantine procedures in Saudi Arabia nor has examined PTSD prevalence by three different methods. This observational cross-sectional study aimed to identify the prevalence, severity, and influencing factors of PTSD in different regions of Saudi Arabia three months after the onset of the quarantine procedures related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Through the month of June 2020, 1374 people (49.05% men and 50.95% women) completed a 35-item, 10-minute online. The prevalence of PTSD was measured using PCL-S (specific for COVID-19) that assesses the 17 symptoms of PTSD. Resilience was measured using 2-items Arabic version of the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale 2 (CD-RISC 2). We calculated the prevalence by three methods, namely, PTSD cut-off score, criteria, and combined, and the prevalence was 22.63%, 24.8%, and 19.6%, respectively. Female participants showed higher prevalence than male. As well, participants who were either tested positive or suspected of having been infected with COVID-19 showed higher PTSD prevalence. Higher resilience was associated with lower PTSD prevalence. This was the first study to report PTSD prevalence by three differential methods three months after the onset of the quarantine procedures related to the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia.

"The Design and Implementation of a Heart Disease Reversal Program in the Veterans Health Administration: Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in the US, and the number of people with cardiovascular disease (CVD) is rising. CVD is more prevalent among military veterans than nonveterans, and veteran status is associated with higher risk of incident heart disease after controlling for socioeconomic status, other medical diseases, depression, and lifestyle. Many patients seeking care in the Veterans Health Administration, including those who undergo cardiac catheterization, meet the criteria for multimorbidity (defined as Ã¢â€°Â¥ 2 chronic diseases). The Heart Disease Reversal Program (HDRP) is a novel interdisciplinary, multicomponent lifestyle program at the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Sacramento VA Medical Center. This program is a streamlined adaptation of behavioral/lifestyle interventions aimed at promoting partial reversal (regression) of atherosclerotic heart disease and achievement of comprehensive cardiovascular risk reduction. HDRP was developed and implemented within a VA behavioral medicine clinic and successfully adapted for delivery through videoconferencing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patient satisfaction survey data indicate a very high level of patient acceptability. We found direct-to-patient clinical outreach an effective method for launching a disease reversal program. Beyond the clinical benefits to patients, there is significant value and benefit added to the health care system by offering an intervention within the disease reversal paradigm. Efforts of the health care team to reverse a disease can be considered the highest aim of medicine and health care.","Yiaslas, Sood, Ono, Rogers-Soeder, Kitazono, Embree, Spann, Caputo, Taylor, Schaefer","https://doi.org/10.12788/fp.0074","20210111","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-12","",9296,""

Anxiety sensitivity (AS), reflecting fear of anxiety-related physical sensations, may be particularly important to understand COVID-19 mental health effects among Latinx individuals in South America (Argentina). Past work suggests that Latinx individuals report greater somatization of mental health symptoms, and AS has been specifically linked to greater mental health symptoms. Yet, to date, no work has examined AS as a vulnerability factor for the negative mental health effects of COVID-19. Therefore, the current manuscript examined the association of AS with COVID-19 worry, functional impairment, anxiety, and symptom severity across two samples of adults in Argentina: a community sample (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°105, <i>M</i><sub> <i>age</i> </sub> Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°38.58, <i>SD</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°14.07, 69.5% female) and a clinical sample comprised of individuals with an anxiety disorder (<i>nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=</i>Ã‚Â 99, <i>M</i><sub> <i>age</i> </sub> Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°34.99, <i>SD</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°10.83, 66.7% female). Results from the current study provide support for AS as a potential vulnerability factor for COVID-19-related mental health problems across both samples, and these effects were evident over and above the variance accounted for by age, sex, pre-existing medical conditions, and COVID-19 exposure. These data identify AS as a potential intervention target to reduce COVID-19 mental health burden among adults in Argentina.","Rogers, Bogiaizian, Salazar, Solari, Garey, Fogle, Schmidt, Zvolensky","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10608-020-10194-1","20210111","Anxiety sensitivity; COVID-19; Latinx; Mental health; South America","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-12","",9298,""
"Remote learning and students' mental health during the Covid-19 pandemic: A mixed-method enquiry","The disruption caused by Covid-19 in the educational sector may last longer than originally predicted. To better understand the current situation, this article analyses the mental health status of university students during the pandemic and investigates the learning conditions needed to support students. The sample included 557 undergraduate students who took part in an online survey. Overall, the students reported coping well during lockdown but indicated that lecturers were challenged by distance teaching, which created some stress for the students.","Lischer, Safi, Dickson","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11125-020-09530-w","20210111","Covid-19; Mental health; Remote learning; Stress; Switzerland","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-12","",9299,""
"[Effect of confinement during COVID-19 outbreak on sleep quality in Galicia]","Stressful situations may have a negative effect on population's mental health, including impaired sleep quality. Thus, we analysed the effect on sleep during the confinement due to the COVID-19 outbreak, in a Galicia population sample, measuring subjective sleep satisfaction, and insomnia intensity and incidence. Through an adapted questionnaire from the Cuestionario Oviedo de SueÃƒÂ±o, distributed telematically and printed, using a convenience sampling in Galicia, we compared sleep situation, before and during the first two weeks of confinement for COVID-19. We compared the results of the questionnaire before and during confinement with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and McNemar's test. In 451 analysed subjects, there was about half point decrease in sleep satisfaction (in a 1 to 7 scale), three points increase in insomnia score (9 to 45 scale) and an increase from 23.1 to 36.3% in the insomnia incidence (p&lt;0.001 for all the comparisons). There existed less affectation in the insomnia incidence in elderly above 65 years (from 21.7 to 26.1%, p=1) and in subjects that telecommuted (unchanged 28.1% incidence, p=1). In a post-hoc analysis of a health workers subgroup, sleep affectation was similar to that of others workers. Confinement situation in COVID-19 outbreak context in our environment has caused important alterations in the population's sleep quality, increasing the symptoms and incidence of insomnia. Las situaciones de estrÃƒÂ©s pueden tener repercusiones sobre la salud mental de la poblaciÃƒÂ³n, que pueden incluir alteraciones en la calidad del sueÃƒÂ±o. Por ello analizamos el efecto sobre el sueÃƒÂ±o durante el confinamiento por la pandemia del COVID-19 en una muestra de poblaciÃƒÂ³n espaÃƒÂ±ola, midiendo la satisfacciÃƒÂ³n subjetiva con el sueÃƒÂ±o, y la intensidad e incidencia de insomnio. Mediante un cuestionario adaptado a partir del Cuestionario Oviedo de SueÃƒÂ±o, distribuido de forma telemÃƒÂ¡tica e impresa, a travÃƒÂ©s de un muestreo de conveniencia en Galicia, se comparÃƒÂ³ la situaciÃƒÂ³n del sueÃƒÂ±o en la poblaciÃƒÂ³n, antes y durante los primeros quince dÃƒÂ­as del confinamiento por el COVID-19. La comparaciÃƒÂ³n de los resultados del cuestionario antes y durante el confinamiento se realizÃƒÂ³ con la prueba de rangos con signo de Wilcoxon y el test de McNemar. En los 451 sujetos analizados, se encontrÃƒÂ³ una disminuciÃƒÂ³n de medio punto en la satisfacciÃƒÂ³n del sueÃƒÂ±o (en una escala de 1 a 7), un incremento de tres puntos en la puntuaciÃƒÂ³n de insomnio (escala de 9 a 45) y un incremento del 23,1 al 36,3% en la incidencia de insomnio (p&lt;0,001 para todas las comparaciones). ExistiÃƒÂ³ menor afectaciÃƒÂ³n en la incidencia de insomnio en los mayores de 65 aÃƒÂ±os (pasÃƒÂ³ del 21,7 al 26,1%, p=1), y en los sujetos que se encontraban realizando teletrabajo (se mantuvo en el 28,1%, p=1). En un anÃƒÂ¡lisis post-hoc de un subgrupo de personal sanitario, la afectaciÃƒÂ³n del sueÃƒÂ±o fue similar a la de otros trabajadores. La situaciÃƒÂ³n de confinamiento en el contexto de la pandemia del COVID-19 en nuestro entorno ha provocado alteraciones importantes en la calidad del sueÃƒÂ±o de la poblaciÃƒÂ³n, incrementando los sÃƒÂ­ntomas y la incidencia de insomnio.","Diz-Ferreira, DÃƒÂ­az-Vidal, Da Cunha Soares Nicolau, Criado-Santos, AyÃƒÂ¡n, Diz","https://www.google.com/search?q=[Effect+of+confinement+during+COVID-19+outbreak+on+sleep+quality+in+Galicia.]","20210111","COVID-19; Confinement; Insomnia; Mental health; Pandemic; Sleep; Spain","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-12","",9300,""

"Pandemic Grief in Poland: Adaptation of a Measure and its relationship with Social Support and Resilience","Millions of people are mourning the death of a loved to COVID-19. According to previous studies, the circumstances of coronavirus disease-related deaths may lead to dysfunctional grief. The purpose of this study was to introduce the Polish adaptation of the Pandemic Grief Scale (PGS) as well as to assess the relationship between dysfunctional grief due to a COVID-19 death, resilience and perceived social support. The adaptation was carried out on a general population sample of 286 individuals aged 18â€“54 years, with the evaluation being performed on a group comprising 214 people aged 18â€“78 years, who lost a loved one during the pandemic. The Polish version of PGS revealed a single-factor structure with strong internal consistency (a = 0.89). The PGS scores were associated with measures of complicated grief (Inventory of Complicated Grief), depression (Kutcher Adolescent Depression Scale) and lower resilience (Resilience Scale 14), which confirmed the scaleâ€™s convergent validity. No relation between PGS scores and health behaviors (Inventory of Health Behaviors) was observed, which confirmed the scaleâ€™s discriminant validity. The results of the bootstrapping technique revealed that resilience mediates the relationship between perceived social support (Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support) and dysfunctional grief (total mediation). The results of this study suggest the need for practitioners to focus on resilience-enhancing interventions and perceived social support in order to improve mental health in people who lost their loved ones during the new coronavirus pandemic.","Sebastian Skalski et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46205-7D9-04A","20210111","PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; covid-19; resilience; dysfunctional grief; perceived social support; pandemic grief scale","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-12","",9302,""
"Mental Health and Domestic Violence in LGB+ Persons during Lockdown Measures in Belgium","Background: To contain the COVID-19 pandemic, governments worldwide restricted social and physical contact by issuing lockdown and social-distancing measures. Yet, lockdown measures may induce mental health problems and increase the occurrence of domestic violence (DV). We examine mental health and DV in lesbian, gay, bisexual, pansexual and asexual (LGB+) persons under lockdown. Methods: An online self-report questionnaire on relationships, stress and aggression was administered to a non-probabilistic sample of participants living in Belgium. Participants were sampled through national media, social media, and snowballing procedures. Occurrence of DV including psychological, physical and sexual violence, stress, alcohol and drug use, suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, self-harming behaviour, and help-seeking behaviour in LGB+ persons in the period of 13 March â€“ 13 April 2020 are assessed. Results: 383 LGB+ participants were included in the analysis. In addition to high levels of stress, alcohol and drug abuse, suicidal ideation and self-harming behaviour, a third of LGB+ participants reported at least one incident of domestic violence under lockdown. Conclusion: LGB+ persons have been exposed to DV and experienced lower mental health and wellbeing during the lockdown related to the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings highlight the possible need for public health measures and sociocultural changes preventing DV and improving mental health during lockdown in LGB+ persons.","Lotte De Schrijver et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46109-760-C6D","20210111","SocArXiv|Arts and Humanities; SocArXiv|Arts and Humanities|Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies; SocArXiv|Arts and Humanities|Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies|Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Studies; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; intimate partner violence; gender-based violence; quarantine; covid-19; sexual and gender minorities","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-12","",9303,""
