"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health and wellbeing of UK healthcare workers","Background There is an urgent need to understand the psychological impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on UK healthcare workers (HCW). Aims To reveal risk and protective factors associated with poor mental wellbeing of HCW working during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. Method 2773 UK HCWs completed a survey between 22ndApril and 10th May 2020 containing scales measuring anxiety, depression, PTSD, and stress, and questions about roles and COVID-19-related factors including workplace preparation and risk management. Respondents were classified as high or low symptomatic on each mental health scale and logistic regression revealed risk and protective factors associated with each outcome. Change in wellbeing from pre to during COVID-19 was also quantified. Results A large proportion of UK HCW had high mental health symptoms. Fixed risk factors of poor mental health included being female, being frontline, pre-existing mental health diagnoses, and experience of stressful/traumatic events. An additional set of controllable factors also significantly increased risk: PPE availability, workload, lack of COVID-19 preparation and training, and insufficient communication of clinical procedures. Resilience and sharing stress reduced risk, as did ethical support for those making treatment decisions. Allied HCW and managers were at elevated risk of high symptoms particularly PTSD. Wellbeing, especially of frontline workers, had significantly worsened compared to before COVID-19. Conclusions Poor mental wellbeing was prevalent in HCW during the UK COVID-19 response. A number of controllable factors should be targeted, and protective factors promoted, to reduce the detrimental effect of COVID-19 and other pandemics on HCW mental health.","James Gilleen; Aida Santaolalla; Lorena Valdearenas; Clara Salice; Monserrat Fuste","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.23.20218396","20201027","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-27","",6439,""
"Socio-educational Impact and Psychological Distress of Medical Students amid the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Japanese Cross-Sectional Survey","The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected medical education. However, few data are available about medical students' distress during the pandemic. This study aimed to provide details on how medical students had been affected by the pandemic. In this cross-sectional study, 717 medical students participated in the web-based survey. The questions included how their mental status had changed before and after the Japanese nationwide state of emergency (SOE). 65.9% (473/717) participated in the study. 29.8% (141/473) reported concerns about the shift toward online education, mostly because they thought online education could have been ineffective compared with in-person learning. Participant's subjective mental health status significantly worsened after the SOE was lifted (p <.001). Those who had concerns about a shift toward online education had higher odds of having generalized anxiety and being depressed (OR 1.97, 95% CI 1.19 - 3.28), as did those who requested food aid and mental health care resources (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.16 - 3.44; OR 3.56, 95% CI 2.07 - 6.15, respectively). Given our findings, the sudden shift to online education might have overwhelmed medical students. Thus, we recommend educators to inform learners that online learning is non-inferior to in-person learning, which could attenuate potential depression and anxiety.","Yoshito Nishimura; Kanako Ochi; Kazuki Tokumasu; Mikako Obika; Hideharu Hagiya; Hitomi Kataoka; Fumio Otsuka","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.22.20216572","20201027","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-27","",6440,""
"Online information on face masks in Italian and English websites: issues and responsibilities of search engines","Countries have major differences in the acceptance of face mask use for the prevention of COVID-19. We analyzed 450 webpages returned by searching the string 'are face masks dangerous' in Italy, the UK and the USA using three search engines (Bing, Duckduckgo and Google). The majority (64-79%) were pages from news outlets, with few (2-6%) pages from government and public health agencies. Webpages with a positive stance on masks were more frequent in English (50%) than in Italian (36%), and those with a negative stance were more frequent in Italian (28% vs. 19% in English). Google returned the highest number of mask-positive pages and Duckduckgo the lowest. Google also returned the lowest number of pages mentioning conspiracy theories and Duckduckgo the highest. Webpages in Italian scored lower than those in English in transparency (reporting authors, their credentials and backing the information with references). When issues about the use of face masks were analyzed, mask effectiveness was the most discussed followed by hypercapnia (accumulation of carbon dioxide), contraindication in respiratory disease, and hypoxia, with issues related to their contraindications in mental health conditions and disability mentioned by very few pages. This study suggests that: 1) public health agencies should increase their web presence in providing correct information on face masks; 2) search engines should improve the information quality criteria in their ranking; 3) the public should be more informed on issues related to the use of masks and disabilities, mental health and stigma arising for those people who cannot wear masks.","Shaily Meta; Daria Ghezzi; Alessia Catalani; Tania Vanzolini; Pietro Ghezzi","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.23.20218271","20201027","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-27","",6441,""
"Causes of death in mental health service users during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic: South London and Maudsley data from March to June 2020, compared with 2015-2019","The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have had a particularly high impact on the health and wellbeing of people with pre-existing mental disorders. This may include higher than expected mortality rates due to severe infections themselves, due to other comorbidities, or through increased suicide rates during lockdown. However, there has been very little published information to date on causes of death in mental health service users. Taking advantage of a large mental healthcare database linked to death registrations, we describe numbers of deaths within specific underlying-cause-of-death groups for the period from 1st March to 30th June in 2020 and compare these with the same four-month periods in 2015-2019. In past and current service users, there were 2561 deaths in March-June 2020, compared to an average of 1452 for the same months in 2015-19: an excess of 1109. The 708 deaths with COVID-19 as the underlying cause in 2020 accounted for 63.8% of that excess. The remaining excess was accounted for by unnatural/unexplained deaths and by deaths recorded as due to neurodegenerative conditions, with no excess in those attributed to cancer, circulatory disorders, digestive disorders, respiratory disorders, or other disease codes. Of 295 unexplained deaths in 2020 with missing data on cause, 162 (54.9%) were awaiting a formal death notice (i.e. the group that included deaths awaiting a coroner inquest), an excess of 129 compared to the average of previous years, accounting for 11.6% of the excess in total deaths.","Robert Stewart; Amelia Jewell; Matthew Broadbent; Ioannis Bakolis; Jayati Das-Munshi","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.25.20219071","20201027","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-27","",6442,""
"Determinants of psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown measures: a nationwide on-line survey in Greece and Cyprus","Abstract A limited number of studies have investigated the distress during the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown measures in the general population. We studied psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown measures in the general population in Greece and Cyprus. Also, we investigated several demographic, clinical and job characteristics of the participants as possible determinants of distress. Data collection was performed during lockdown measures in Greece and Cyprus (from April 21st to May 4th 2020). All participants provided informed consent to participate in the study. We used the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) to measure the psychological distress in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures. Seventeen point four percent of the participants had overall IES-R score from 24 to 32 indicating that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a clinical concern, while 33.5% had overall IES-R score >32 indicating that PTSD is a probable diagnosis. Females, Cyprus residents, participants that live with elderly people or patients with a chronic disease in home, participants with a mental health disease or/and chronic disease, participants under pharmaceutical treatment, participants that lost their work due to the pandemic and participants that work in hospital experienced greater distress. Also, increased age and decreased educational level was associated with increased distress. Findings suggest that our sample experienced great distress and this distress was affected by several demographic, clinical and job characteristics. Appropriate interventions should be established in order to support psychologically high risk groups and decrease their distress.

"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on remote mental healthcare and prescribing in psychiatry","Objectives: The recent COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted mental healthcare delivery, with many services shifting from in-person to remote patient contact. We investigated the impact of the pandemic on the use of remote consultation and on the prescribing of psychiatric medications. Design and setting: The Clinical Record Interactive Search tool (CRIS) was used to examine de-identified electronic health records (EHRs) of people receiving mental healthcare from the South London and Maudsley (SLaM) NHS Foundation Trust. Data from the period before and after the onset of the pandemic were analysed using linear regression, and visualised using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (LOESS). Participants: All patients receiving care from SLaM between 7th January 2019 and 20th September 2020 (around 37,500 patients per week). Outcome measures: i) The number of clinical contacts (in-person, remote or non-attended) with mental healthcare professionals per week ii) Prescribing of antipsychotic and mood stabiliser medications per week Results: Following the onset of the pandemic, the frequency of in-person contacts was significantly reduced compared to that in the previous year ({beta} coefficient: -5829.6 contacts, 95% CI -6919.5 to -4739.6, p<0.001), while the frequency of remote contacts significantly increased ({beta} coefficient: 3338.5 contacts, 95% CI 3074.4 to 3602.7, p<0.001). Rates of remote consultation were lower in older adults than in working age adults, children and adolescents. Despite this change in the type of patient contact, antipsychotic and mood stabiliser prescribing remained at similar levels. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with a marked increase in remote consultation, particularly among younger patients. However, there was no evidence that this has led to changes in psychiatric prescribing. Nevertheless, further work is needed to ensure that older patients are able to access mental healthcare remotely.","Rashmi Patel; Jessica Irving; Aimee Brinn; Matthew Broadbent; Hitesh Shetty; Megan Pritchard; Johnny Downs; Robert Stewart; Robert Harland; Philip McGuire","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.26.20219576","20201027","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-27","",6444,""
"Economic and social impacts of COVID-19 and public health measures: results from an anonymous online survey in Thailand, Malaysia, the United Kingdom, Italy and Slovenia","In the absence of a vaccine and widely available treatments for COVID-19, governments have relied primarily on non-pharmaceutical interventions to curb the pandemic. To aid understanding of the impact of these public health measures on different social groups we conducted a mixed-methods study in five countries ('SEBCOV' - Social, ethical and behavioural aspects of COVID-19). Here we report the results of the SEBCOV anonymous online survey of adults. Overall, 5,058 respondents from Thailand, Malaysia, the United Kingdom, Italy and Slovenia completed the self-administered survey between May and June 2020. Post-stratification weighting was applied, and associations between categorical variables assessed. Among the five countries, Thai respondents appeared to have been most, and Slovenian respondents least, affected economically. Overall, lower education levels, larger households, having children under 18 in the household, being 65 years or older and having flexible/no income were associated with worse economic impact. Regarding social impact, respondents expressed most concern about their social life, physical health, and mental health and wellbeing. There were large differences between countries in terms of voluntary behavioural change, and in compliance and agreement with COVID-19 restrictions. Overall, self-reported compliance was higher among respondents reporting a high understanding of COVID-19. UK respondents felt able to cope the longest and Thai respondents the shortest with only going out for essential needs or work, with 60% and 26% respectively able to cope with 29 days or longer. Many respondents reported seeing news that seemed fake to them, the proportion varying between countries, and with education level and self-reported levels of understanding of COVID-19. Our data showed that COVID-19 public health measures have uneven economic and social impacts on people from different countries and social groups. Understanding the factors associated with these impacts can help to inform future public health interventions and mitigate their negative consequences on people's lives.","Anne Osterrieder; Giulia Cuman; Wirichada Pan-ngum; Phaik Kin Cheah; Phee-Kheng Cheah; Pimnara Peerawaranun; Margherita Silan; Miha Orazem; Ksenija Perkovic; Urh Groselj; Mira Leonie Schneiders; Tassawan Poomchaichote; Naomi Waithira; Supa-at Asarath; Bhensri Naemiratch; Supanat Ruangkajorn; Lenart Skof; Natinee Kulpijit; Constance R.S.
