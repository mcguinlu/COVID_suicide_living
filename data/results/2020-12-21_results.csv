"Mental health among pregnant women during the pandemic in Sweden, a mixed methods approach using data from the Mom2B mobile application for research","Public health emergencies such as the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic have significant impact on mental health, and have been shown to impact on already prevalent affective disorders during and after pregnancy. The aim of this study was to utilize modern tools to assess depressive and anxiety symptoms, as well as wellbeing and life changes in pregnant women during the pandemic in Sweden, where no lockdown has been in place. Data from the Mom2B, a national ongoing mobile application-based study of pregnant and newly-delivered women were utilized. Participants (n= 1345) filled out self-report screeners of depression, anxiety and wellbeing. Questions about COVID symptoms and effects on life and health care were added from March 2020. Movement data was collected using the phone's GPS sensor. Mood scores were compared with throughout the months of 2020 and to the levels of a previous collected material. Highest levels of depression and anxiety were evident in April and October 2020. Symptoms were higher among those feeling socially isolated, but not for those infected or with symptomatic family members. Wellbeing and mobility were strongly positively correlated and were lowest in April. Women reported on cancelled healthcare appointments and worry about their partners being absent from the delivery. The Mom2B application enabled gathering information at a national level in real-time as the pandemic has been evolving. Levels of perinatal affective symptoms and low wellbeing were elevated compared with previous years as well as with months with fewer cases of SARS-Cov-2. Similar applications can help healthcare providers and governmental bodies to in real time monitor high-risk groups during crises, as well as to adjust measures and the support offered.","Emma Fransson; Maria Karalexi; Mary Kimmel; Emma Brann; Natasa Kollia; Vera van Zoest; Eira Nordling; Fotios C Papadopoulos; Alkistis Skalkidou","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248466","20201220","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-21","",8435,""
"Face covering adherence is positively associated with better mental health and wellbeing: a longitudinal analysis of the CovidLife surveys","Face masks or coverings are effective at reducing airborne infection rates, yet pandemic mitigation measures, including wearing face coverings, have been suggested to contribute to reductions in quality of life and poorer mental health. Longitudinal analyses of more than 11,000 participants across the UK found no association between lower adherence to face covering guidelines and poorer mental health. The opposite appears to be true. Even after controlling for behavioral, social, and psychological confounds, including measures of pre-pandemic mental health, individuals who wore face coverings ""most of the time"" or ""always"" had better mental health and wellbeing than those who did not. These results suggest that wearing face coverings more often will not negatively impact mental health.","Drew M Altschul; Chloe Fawns-Ritchie; Alex Kwong; Louise Hartley; Clifford Nangle; Rachel Edwards; Rebecca Dawson; Christie Levein; Archie Campbell; Robin Flaig; Andrew McIntosh; Ian Deary; Riccardo Marioni; Caroline Hayward; Cathie Sudlow; Elaine Douglas; David Bell; David Porteous","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248477","20201220","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-21","",8436,""
"The impact of the first UK Covid-19 lockdown on carers and people living with low prevalence dementia: results from the Rare Dementia Support survey","Introduction The public health measures imposed to contain Covid-19 during the first UK lockdown resulted in significant changes in the provision of community support and care for people with dementia. People with low prevalence and young-onset dementias often experience non-memory, behavioural or neuropsychiatric symptoms that require specialised support. Objective We explored the impact of the first Covid-19 lockdown on people living with low prevalence and young-onset dementia and their carers in the UK. Method An online survey, including eleven questions about the impact of the lockdown on both the person with dementia and their family caregivers was conducted. Participants were people living with dementia and caregivers who are members of the UK national-reach organisation Rare Dementia Support. Results 184 carers and 24 people with dementia completed the survey. People with dementia experienced worsening of cognitive symptoms (70%), ability to do things (62%) and well-being (57%) according to their carers. Carers also reported a reduction in the support received for caring (55%). 93% of carers of people living in care homes reported a reduction in their ability to provide care. 26% of carers reported changes in the medication of the person with dementia during the lockdown. 74% of people with dementia reported decreased ability to connect with people socially. Conclusions People with dementia experienced a worsening of dementia symptoms, removal of support and increased difficulty to connect with other people socially during the 1st wave of Covid-19. Carers encountered barriers to both receiving and providing support and a decline in their own mental health and well-being.","Aida Suarez Gonzalez; Emma Harding; Nicola Zimmerman; Zoe Hoare; Emilie Brotherhood; Sebastian J Crutch","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.18.20248455","20201220","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-21","",8437,""
"Negative vaccine attitudes and intentions to vaccinate against Covid-19 in relation to smoking status: a population survey of UK adults","Introduction: We examined differences in negative attitudes towards vaccines in general, and intentions to vaccinate against Covid-19 specifically, by smoking status in a large sample of adults in the UK. Method: Data were from 29,148 adults participating in the Covid-19 Social Study in September-October 2020. Linear regression analyses examined associations between smoking status (current/former/never) and four types of general negative vaccine attitudes: mistrust of vaccine benefit, worries about unforeseen effects, concerns about commercial profiteering, and preference for natural immunity. Multinomial logistic regression examined associations between smoking status and uncertainty and unwillingness to be vaccinated for Covid-19. Covariates included sociodemographic characteristics and diagnosed health conditions. Results: Relative to never and former smokers, current smokers reported significantly greater mistrust of vaccine benefit, were more worried about unforeseen future effects, had greater concerns about commercial profiteering, and had a stronger preference for natural immunity (Badjs 0.16-0.36, p<0.001). Current smokers were more likely to be uncertain (27.6% vs. 22.7% of never smokers: RRadj 1.43 [95%CI 1.31-1.56]; vs. 19.3% of former smokers: RRadj 1.55 [1.41-1.73]) or unwilling (21.5% vs. 11.6% of never smokers: RRadj 2.12 [1.91-2.34]; vs. 14.7% of former smokers: RRadj 1.53 [1.37-1.71]) to receive a Covid-19 vaccine. Conclusions: Current smokers hold more negative attitudes towards vaccines in general, and are more likely to be undecided or unwilling to vaccinate against Covid-19, compared with never and former smokers. With a disproportionately high number of smokers belonging to socially clustered and disadvantaged socioeconomic groups, lower vaccine uptake in this group could also exacerbate health inequalities.","Sarah E Jackson; Elise E Paul; Jamie Brown; Andrew Steptoe; Daisy Fancourt","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.17.20248396","20201219","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-21","",8438,""
"History of premorbid depression is a risk factor for COVID-related mortality: Analysis of a retrospective cohort of 1,387 COVID+ patients","Background: The goal of the present work was to examine risk factors for mortality in a 1,387 COVID+ patients admitted to a hospital in Suffolk County, NY. Methods: Data were collated by the hospital epidemiological service for patients admitted from 3/7/2020-9/1/2020. Time until final discharge or death was the outcome. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate time until death among admitted patients. Findings: In total, 99.06% of cases had resolved leading to 1,179 discharges and 211 deaths. Length of stay was significantly longer in those who died as compared to those who did not p=0.007). Of patients who had been discharged (n=1,179), 54 were readmitted and 9 subsequently died. Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression revealed that in addition to older age, male sex, and heart failure, a history of premorbid depression was a risk factor for COVI-19 mortality. Interpretation: While an increasing number of studies have shown effects linking cardiovascular risk factors with increased risk of mortality in COVID+ patients, this study reports that history of depression is a risk factor for COVID mortality.","Sean Clouston; Benjamin J Luft; Edward Sun","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.17.20248362","20201219","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-21","",8439,""
"Fluoxetine pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution suggest a possible role in reducing SARS-CoV-2 titers","Background. Recent in vitro studies have shown fluoxetine inhibits the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) pathogen and one clinical study reported fluoxetine exposure at a median dose of 20mg in patients with the SARS-Cov-2 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had a significantly lower risk of intubation and death. The aim of this study is to conduct in silico population dosing simulations to quantify the percentage of patients achieving a trough level for the effective concentration resulting in 90% inhibition (EC90) of SARS-Cov-2 as reported in Calu-3 human lung cells. Methods. Population pharmacokinetic parameter estimates for a structural one-compartment model with first-order absorption was used to simulate fluoxetine concentration-time data. A population of 1,000 individuals were simulated at standard fluoxetine doses (20mg/day, 40mg/day, and 60mg/day) to estimate the percentage of the patients achieving a trough level for the EC90 SARS-Cov-2 inhibitory concentration at each day throughout a 10-day treatment period. All analyses were conducted via statistical programming in R. Results. Standard fluoxetine antidepressant doses resulted in a range of 79% to 97% of the patient population achieving a trough target plasma concentration of 25.1 ng/ml which translates to lung-tissue distribution coefficient of 60-times higher (EC90 of 4.02 M). At a dose of 40mg per day, at least 85% of patients will reach the trough target EC90 concentration within 3-days. The findings of this pharmacokinetic dosing study corroborate both in vitro and observational clinical study findings showing fluoxetine inhibits the SARS-Cov-2 pathogen at commonly treated doses in the practice of psychiatry.","Andy R Eugene","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.17.20248442","20201219","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-21","",8440,""
"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Education and Wellness of US Pediatric Anesthesiology Fellows","The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused statewide shutdowns of elective surgical activities in March and April of 2020 forcing graduate medical education program directors and their trainees in the United States to quickly adapt to new rules and circumstances. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of the current pandemic on pediatric anesthesiology fellow education and wellness nationally in order to guide creation of optimal support systems for fellows during the ongoing pandemic. A total of 75 out of 184 pediatric anesthesiology fellows (41%) responded to the survey. Major domains identified include reduction of clinical time, financial impact, mental health/wellness effects, and concerns about the overall quality of the fellowship educational experience. Respondents indicated that the pandemic has led to personal quarantine (and/or illness) leave time (21.3%), changes in finances (42.7%) and career opportunities (37.3%), decreased clinical education/experience (28%), and a dissatisfaction with the modified didactic experience (22.7%). In addition, a majority of respondents (97.3%) experienced increased stressors during this pandemic, including worry for family members (80%), stress due to changes in certifying examinations (76%), and fear of contracting COVID-19 from a patient (72%). While the results of this survey are only one snapshot in time during an evolving pandemic, these results highlight important domains where program directors and other departmental leaders might focus limited resources to maximize the educational experiences and overall wellness for pediatric anesthesiology fellows.","Shih, Deer, Lau, Loveland Baptist, Lim, Lockman","https://doi.org/10.1111/pan.14112","20201220","Anesthesiology; Education; Graduate Medical Education; Mental health; Pandemics; Training Programs","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-21","",8441,""
"Psychological impact of COVID-19 on Chinese health-care workers","The outbreak of the 2019-nCoV had dominated headlines throughout the world. The number of infections continued to rise, which had reached 30 thousand at the time of writing this editorial. Because of the high risk of nosocomial transmission, the medical health-care workers might be experiencing significant psychological stress. This descriptive study aimed to identify hospital staff's psychosocial effects associated with working in a hospital environment during the 2019-nCoV outbreak. 57 frontline clinicians working in Wuhan First Hospital and 157 medical training students working in Jiangsu Provincial Peoples Hospital during this outbreak participated in our survey. The questionnaire we adopted included questions regarding the participants' personal well-being, sociodemographic characteristics and the psychological status. 2019-nCoV had psychological impacts both on formal workers and medical students. The psychological effects included sleep disorders, anxiety and depression. There was no significant difference between the group of formal workers and medical students, and nearly 50% of the respondents reported pandemic-related mental disorders. Our study indicated that the high risk of 2019-nCoV exposure caused huge psychological stress on healthcare workers. This finding emphasized the need of promoting psychological crisis intervention for medical personnel during this epidemic disease outbreak. This was a cross sectional study, including 57 frontline clinicians working in Wuhan First Hospital and 157 medical students working in Jiangsu Provincial Peoples Hospital during the 2019-nCoV outbreak. Firstly, we released the online questionnaires among the Wuhan First Hospital first-line staff and collected 57 valid questionnaires on March 4th, 2020. Later, we conducted a survey among young medical students to investigate their psychological change associated with 2019-nCoV and collected 157 valid data.","Ni, Liu, Wu, Jiang, Zhou, Sha","https://doi.org/10.2196/23125","20201220","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-21","",8442,""
"Nanotechnology in pulmonary medicine","Nanotechnology in medicine-nanomedicine-is extensively employed to diagnose, treat, and prevent pulmonary diseases. Over the last few years, this brave new world has made remarkable progress, offering opportunities to address historical clinical challenges in pulmonary diseases including multidrug resistance, adverse side effects of conventional therapeutic agents, novel imaging, and earlier disease detection. Nanomedicine is also being applied to tackle the new emerging infectious diseases, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), influenza A virus subtype H1N1 (A/H1N1), and more recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this review we provide both a historical overview of the application of nanomedicine to respiratory diseases and more recent cutting-edge approaches such as nanoparticle-mediated combination therapies, novel double-targeted nondrug delivery system for targeting, stimuli-responsive nanoparticles, and theranostic imaging in the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary diseases.","Doroudian, O' Neill, Mac Loughlin, Prina-Mello, Volkov, Donnelly","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coph.2020.11.002","20201220","Asthma; COVID- 19; Cystic fibrosis; Lung cancer; Nano carrier; Nanomedicine; Pneumonia; Respiratory disease; Tuberculosis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-21","",8443,""

"The French general population's attitudes toward lockdown against COVID-19: a fragile consensus","In March 2020, as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-Ã¢â‚¬â€°19) pandemic was spreading across the globe, many countries have implemented unprecedented lockdown measures. But how populations did react to these measures? We examined the case of France. Our aims were threefold: assessing some aspects of their impact on French's daily living conditions; investigating their attitudes toward the lockdown; investigating the factors associated with these attitudes. A cross-sectional online survey was carried out 10Ã¢â‚¬â€°days after the nationwide lockdown (from March 27th to March 29th 2020), among a representative sample of the mainland French population aged 18 and over. A quota sampling method was applied to achieve a sample of 1012 respondents. We used a cluster analysis to obtain contrasted attitudinal profiles, and logistic regressions to investigated which factors were associated to these profiles. After 10 days of lockdown, there were already significant consequences regarding respondents' living conditions and mental health. Most respondents supported the current lockdown. However, it appeared as a stopgap measure due to a lack of alternatives, and a large majority acknowledged its heavy drawbacks. We found three contrasted attitudinal profiles: full support (38%), strong but critical support (31%), limited support (31%). Regarding respondents' SES, low-income and low-education respondents were more likely to display critical or limited support to the lockdown, as well as those who reported deteriorated living conditions or psychological distress. In France, the large public support to the lockdown was fragile. First, it was a critical consensus anchored in current controversies and recent social struggles. Second, it was weaker among people with a lows SES, especially since the lockdown have exacerbated preexisting social inequalities.","Peretti-Watel, Verger, Launay, Seror, Cortaredona, Raude, Beck, Legleye, L'Haridon, Ward","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-10048-1","20201219","COVIDÃ¢Ë†â€™Ã¢â‚¬â€°19; France; Lockdown; Socioeconomic factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-21","",8446,""
"Prevalence and correlates of fatigue and its association with quality of life among clinically stable older psychiatric patients during the COVID-19 outbreak: a cross-sectional study","The pattern of fatigue in older psychiatric patients during the COVID-19 outbreak was unknown. This study examined the prevalence of fatigue and its association with overall quality of life (overall QOL) in clinically stable older patients with psychiatric disorders during the COVID-19 outbreak. This was a multicenter, cross-sectional study. Fatigue, depressive symptoms, pain, insomnia symptoms, and overall QOL were assessed with standardized instruments. A total of 1063 patients were recruited. The prevalence of fatigue was 47.1% (95%CI: 44.1-50.1%). An analysis of covariance revealed that overall QOL was significantly lower in patients with fatigue compared to those without (PÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.011). A multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that more severe depressive symptoms (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.15, PÃ‚Â &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), insomnia symptoms (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.08, PÃ‚Â &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and pain (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.43, PÃ‚Â &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) were significantly associated with fatigue.

"Establishing a Theory-Based Multi-Level Approach for Primary Prevention of Mental Disorders in Young People","The increasing prevalence of mental health disorders and psychosocial distress among young people exceeds the capacity of mental health services. Social and systemic factors determine mental health as much as individual factors. To determine how best to address multi-level risk factors, we must first understand the distribution of risk. Previously, we have used psychometric methods applied to two epidemiologically-principled samples of people aged 14-24 to establish a robust, latent common mental distress (CMD) factor of depression and anxiety normally distributed across the population. This was linearly associated with suicidal thoughts and non-suicidal self-harm such that effective interventions to reduce CMD across the whole population could have a greater total benefit than those that focus on the minority with the most severe scores. In a randomised trial of mindfulness interventions in university students (the Mindful Student Study), we demonstrated a population-shift effect whereby the intervention group appeared resilient to a universal stressor. Given these findings, and in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we argue that population-based interventions to reduce CMD are urgently required. To target all types of mental health determinants, these interventions must be multi-level. Careful design and evaluation, interdisciplinary work, and extensive local stakeholder involvement are crucial for these interventions to be effective.","Lo Moro, Soneson, Jones, Galante","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17249445","20201219","adolescents; children; common mental distress; interventions; mental health; mental health disorders; prevention; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-21","",8448,""

"A Cognitive Coping Model of Reinforcement Sensitivity, Emotion Regulation, and Affective Psychopathology: Cross-sectional, Longitudinal and Quasi-Experimental Evidence","Temperamental reinforcement sensitivity predicts affective pathology, with BAS sensitivity negatively predicting depression and BIS sensitivity positively predicting both depression and anxiety. Most clinical research on reinforcement sensitivity, however, neglects the role of cognitive mechanisms in mediating these relationships. The current article presents a cognitive coping model of clinical reinforcement sensitivity wherein the relationship between reinforcement sensitivity and affective pathology is mediated by trait preferences for corollary emotion regulation strategies. In Study 1, participants (N = 593) completed measures of reinforcement sensitivity, positive reappraisal, rumination, depression, and anxiety. Exploratory structural equation modeling found that the only model with a good fit included BAS sensitivity predicting reappraisal and BIS sensitivity negatively predicting it. Reappraisal then negatively predicted depression. BIS sensitivity also predicted rumination, which predicted both depression and anxiety. Study 2a confirmed the model developed in Study 1 with an independent sample (N = 513). It then examined longitudinal relationships with a second assessment 6 months later. The relationship from BIS sensitivity to rumination to depression and anxiety remained significant, as did the relationship between reappraisal and depression. Reinforcement sensitivity, however, did not predict reappraisal. In Study 2b, participants (N = 219) were assessed a third time one year later, at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. During this stressful time, BAS sensitivity did longitudinally predict reappraisal. These studies highlight the role of emotion regulation in mediating the relationship between reinforcement sensitivity and affective pathology, particularly during times of high stress.","Benjamin A Katz et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4612D-253-A07","20201221","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; depression; transdiagnostic; reward sensitivity; covid-19; emotion regulation; reinforcement sensitivity; diathesis stress; punishment sensitivity; anxiety","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-21","",8450,""

The data were collected from 224 Japanese participants (98 females; mean age = 46.56, SD = 13.41) in July 2020. The measures used in this study included the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), Short Grit Scale, and Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale 21 (DASS). The results of mediation analyses revealed significant indirect effects of consistency of interest, a major component of grit, on psychological distress; we also found non-significant indirect effects of perseverance of effort, another major component of grit, on psychological distress. These results suggest that consistency of interest buffers the psychological distress induced by fear of COVID-19. Based on these results, it can be concluded that individuals with higher consistency of interest are less likely to experience worsening of their mental health, even if they experience fear of COVID-19 during the pandemic.","Akihiro Masuyama et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46023-225-D76","20201221","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; covid-19; anixety; depression; pandemic; grit","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-21","",8451,""
