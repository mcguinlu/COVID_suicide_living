"Psychological and functional impact of COVID-19 in long-term care facilities: The COVID-A Study","Objective To analyze the psychological and functional sequelae of the COVID-19 pandemic among older adults living in long term care facilities (LTCFs). Design : Cohort longitudinal study Setting ant participants : 215 residents = 65 years without moderate-to-severe cognitive impairmen, living in five LTCFs in Albacete (Spain). Measurements : Baseline on-site data were collected between March - June 2020 and three-month follow-up between June - September 2020. Symptoms of depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and sleep disturbances were measured as psychological variables. Disability in basic activities of daily living (BADL), ambulation and frailty were assessed as functional variables. Differences were analyzed in relation to level of comorbidity and test positivity for COVID-19. Results : At baseline, residents with COVID-19 presented worse functionality, higher frailty levels and malnutrition risk compared to non-COVID-19 residents. At three-month follow-up, higher rates of clinically significant depressive symptoms (57.7%), anxiety symptoms (29.3%), PTSD symptoms (19.1%) and sleep disturbances (93.0%) were found among residents regardless of COVID status. Thus, among215 residents, 101 (47%) experienced a decline in BADL from baseline to the three-month follow-up (median functional lossÂ =Â 5 points in Barthel Index). In multivariate analyses, COVID-19 statusdid not explain either the functional or the ambulation loss. By contrast, residents with low comorbidity and COVID-19 presented higher PTSD symptoms (effect 2.58;95% CI 0.93 to 4.23) and anxiety symptoms (effect 2.10;95% CI 0.48 to 3.73) compared to the low comorbidity/non-COVID19 group. Conclusions : COVID-19 pandemic was associated, after three-months, with high psychological impact in older adults in LTCFs., specifically with higher post-traumatic stress and anxiety symptoms. Functional decline did not differ in relation to COVID-19 status but could be related to isolation strategies used for pandemic control.","Zamora, Elisa BelÃ©n CortÃ©s, Romero, Marta Mas, Sahuquillo, MarÃ­a Teresa Tabernero, CÃ©spedes, Almudena AvendaÃ±o, AndrÃ©s-Petrel, Fernando, Ballesteros, Cristina GÃ³mez, Alfaro, Victoria SÃ¡nchez-Flor, LÃ³pez-Bru, Rita, LÃ³pez-Utiel, Melisa, Cifuentes, Sara Celaya, Carmona, Laura Plaza, GarcÃ­a, Borja Gil, FernÃ¡ndez-Rius, Ana PÃ©rez, CÃ³rcoles, RubÃ©n Alcantud, GarcÃ­a, BelÃ©n RoldÃ¡n, Rizos, Luis Romero, SÃ¡nchez-Jurado, Pedro Manuel, MÃ¡rquez, Carmen Luengo, VÃ­ctor, Mariano EsbrÃ­, Ortiz, Matilde LeÃ³n, Zafra, Gabriel Ariza, SebastiÃ¡, Elena MartÃ­n, JimÃ©nez, Esther LÃ³pez, Mellinas, Gema Paterna, MartÃ­nez-SÃ¡nchez, Esther, GarcÃ­a, Alicia NoguerÃ³n, GarcÃ­a, MarÃ­a Fe Ruiz, GarcÃ­a-Molina, Rafael, Cazalla, Juan de Dios Estrella, Abizanda, Pedro","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2022.01.007","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: The American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry;2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25872,""
"'I'D LIKE TO GO BACK TO THE TIMES WHEN THERE WAS NO PANDEMIC': THE TEMPORALITY OF THE COVID-19 CRISIS IN THE LIFE OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES","The article considers temporal characteristics of the life experiences of people with disabilities in the conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on an analysis of focused interviews with people who live with disabilities and experience limited mobility, the authors identify the dynamics of perception and assessment of the pandemic impact on everyday life. The effects of the pandemic in its successive waves have led to crucial changes, hindered access to specialized services, social and medical support for people with disabilities. The informants related experiences of a rapid reorganization of life caused by the need to master new rules, norms and meanings that limit life chances, complicate the implementation of mobility and communication, lower the level of subjective well-being, increase inequality and social exclusion. The dynamics of perception of the consequences of the pandemic and ways of coping with new challenges are presented in relation to time characteristics. The authors present the trials faced by children and adults with disabilities and their families, who were forced to rebuild their household structure, family budget, housing space and social environment, in the temporal context of the new pandemic reality. In the narratives, a combination of linearity and cyclicity, multiple temporalities of collected life stories are revealed. Strategies of reorganizing life to maintain living standards and health, such as receiving social services and payments, mastering digital services and inclusion in new solidarity, are highlighted. The issues of social status, physical and mental health of people with disabilities, new forms of inequality and consequences of disability of people due to COVID-19 are problematized.","Yarskaya-Smirnova, V.; Sorokina, N.","https://doi.org/10.17323/727-0634-2021-19-4-651-668","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Journal of Social Policy Studies; 19(4):651-668, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25873,""
"Restless Legs Syndrome Severity in the National RLS Opioid Registry During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Objective/Background No research has yet assessed the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on restless legs syndrome (RLS). We hypothesized that RLS symptom severity would be increased during the COVID-19 pandemic in a sample of patients with diagnosed RLS. Patients/Methods The National RLS Opioid Registry is a longitudinal observational study of patients using opioid medications for treatment of RLS. Questionnaires assessing RLS symptom severity, medication dosages, sleep disturbance, depression, and anxiety are administered at baseline and at recurring 6-month surveys. Survey responses from the outset of the pandemic in April/May 2020 were compared to responses completed by other participants in January/February 2020 (between-subjects analysis), as well as responses by the same participants at baseline, approximately six months later in September 2020 through February 2021, and approximately one year later in March through June 2021 (within-subjects analyses). Results These analyses provide evidence for higher RLS symptom severity scores at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US. Symptom severity scores were still elevated on subsequent questionnaires completed over six months into the pandemic but had returned towards baseline by the spring of 2021. Participants with increases in RLS severity were significantly more likely than others to see increases in sleep disturbance, depression, and anxiety. Conclusions This is the first study demonstrating increased RLS symptom severity during the earliest stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings warrant similar investigations in other patient populations and suggest that clinicians should attend to RLS symptoms during times of socioeconomic and/or political uncertainty.","Wipper, Benjamin, Romero-Gutierrez, Christopher, Winkelman, John","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2022.01.011","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Sleep Medicine;2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25874,""
"Increased incidence of ECG abnormalities in general population during the covid-19 pandemic","Background: To examine influence of COVID-19 pandemic on cardiovascular system in general population, ECG changes during the COVID-19 pandemic period were compared with those before the pandemic period. Methods: Incidence of newly appeared ECG abnormalities (T wave abnormalities and ST-segment depression including minor changes, and abnormal Q wave) was evaluated in subjects 40 to 74 years of age who had 12-lead ECG recording in annual health checkup offered to adult citizens of Moriguchi city, Osaka, Japan in 2019 and 2020. The incidence was compared with that of those who received ECG recording in 2018 and 2019 as the control value before the COVID-19 pandemic. Those with history of cardiovascular disease, any T wave abnormality, any ST-segment depression, abnormal Q wave, left bundle brunch block, or pace-maker rhythm at baseline ECG were excluded. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed adjusted for age, sex, hypertension, current smoking, diabetes, drinking habit and hypercholesterolemia. Results: There were 5,221 (mean age 63Â±10, men 40%) subjects who received ECG recording in 2018 and 2019 and 4,100 (mean age 63Â±10, men 41%) subjects who received ECG recording in 2019 and 2020. The incidence of newly appeared T wave abnormalities was 5.2 %, ST-segment depression was 2.8 % and abnormal Q wave was 1.1 % from 2018 to 2019, whereas the incidence of newly appeared T wave abnormalities was 5.8 %, ST-segment depression was 4.3 % and abnormal Q wave was 1.7 % from 2019 to 2020. The incidence of ST-segment depression (odds ratio (OR)=1.59, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.27 to 1.98, p&lt;0.0001) and that of abnormal Q wave (OR=1.56, 95% CI=1.09 to 2.22, p=0.0149) from 2019 to 2020 was significantly higher compared to that from 2018 to 2019.

"Cross-sectional study on prevalence and consequences of screen time on physical and mental health in children in the era of COVID-19","Background: With the ongoing growth and expansion of digital media and COVID-19 pandemic, children are inclining more and more toward spending time on digital media as compared to outdoor sports, leading to poor physical and mental growth. Developed nations have already set up a screen time guideline which is yet to be established in developing nations. This study was conducted with the objectives of identifying the needs of screen time guidelines and to study the impact of screen time on mental and physical health in children. Aims and Objectives: This study aims to check the screen time in children aged 2â€“18 and find the health consequences both physical and psychological in those children. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study on children aged 2â€“18 years was conducted between 2019 and 2020. Parents were asked to fill a pre-structured questionnaire. Impact on health physical and mental were assessed by pediatrician and psychologist. Results: A total of 155 children were enrolled in the study. Mean child hours in children aged 2â€“5 years, 5â€“10 years, and 10â€“18 years were 4 h, 5.83 h, and 6.29 h on week days and 5.64 h, 5.76 h, and 7.69 h on weekends, respectively. More than one-third of children had age of onset of screen time below 2 years of age. About 70% of children had malnutrition. Only 18% of parents were aware of concept of screen free days. Screen time had negative impact on health (P=0.0001) and on behavior of child (P=0.001). Average increase in screen time during COVID-19 was nearly 3 times the pre-COVID era. Conclusion: This study has paved the way for the need of larger study and development of guidelines on impact of screen time on children in developing nations where screen time guidelines is yet to be set more so in era of COVID 19 pandemic.

"Nursesâ€™ View towards the Use of Robotic during Pandemic COVID-19 in Indonesia: A Qualitative Study","BACKGROUND: Rapid advances in artificial intelligence and robotics have alleviated difficulties for patients, hospitals, and the industry as a whole. However, the health care system is identically human-centered at its core, and many healthcare professions may not be ready to work with robots. Understanding nursesâ€™ views toward robotics can help integrate robotic technologies into future patient care. AIM: This study aimed to explore how nurses view using robotics during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This study used a qualitative descriptive technique to registered nurses who provide direct care to the patients with COVID-19 recruited from two hospitals in Indonesia. Purposive sampling was used to select respondents with criteria of those who had worked for at least 1 year and were willing to participateâ€”the analysis used qualitative content analysis. A total of 20 female nurses with an average age of 32.8 Â± 4.0 years participated in this study. RESULTS: The qualitative findings revealed three themes with nine sub-themes. The three themes were: (1) the use of robotic in nursing care (sub-theme: reducing the risk of COVID-19 transmission, monitoring patients remotely, and helping in providing care);(2) the burden of using robotic in nursing care (sub-theme: digital literacy in nursing care, culture difference in providing care, changing care practice habits, and safety concern;(3) attitude toward robotic in nursing care (sub-theme: negative response). CONCLUSIONS: Robotic is viewed as a beneficial approach to deliver cares to the patients but has several challenges and need adaptation process to change through extensive monitoring. It implies that a strategic plan would have many benefits and limitations, such as nursing care burden, negative attitude, and cultural awareness.","Taryudi, T.; Lindayani, L.; Purnama, H.; Mutiar, A.","https://doi.org/10.3889/oamjms.2022.7645","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Open Access Macedonian Journal of Medical Sciences; 10:14-18, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25877,""
"Mental well-being promotion by Australian community pharmacists: what's happening and what needs to be done?","Objectives This study aimed to explore the range of activities provided by community pharmacists for promoting mental well-being in Australia. Methods An online survey was developed and piloted by 2 community pharmacists, 1 representative from the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia and 11 pharmacy students for content and face validity. Community pharmacists were recruited via direct emails to pharmacy groups and social media between November 2019 and January 2020. Descriptive statistics and chi-squared analyses were conducted. Key findings Data were analysed from 85 pharmacists (of 115 total pharmacy staff respondents). Although 40% reported working in a pharmacy that promoted mental well-being, most (88.2%) were not involved in such activities. However, most respondents (88.0%) identified community pharmacy as a suitable setting to promote mental well-being. Barriers to mental well-being promotion included busy pharmacy environment with competing priorities, a lack of staff training and confidence in discussing mental well-being and stigma associated with mental illness. Conclusions Community pharmacy presents a suitable setting to promote mental well-being. However, pharmacists may not be utilizing their full range of skills and knowledge in promoting a national health priority. This study identified opportunities for increased pharmacist-led promotion of mental well-being, particularly given the emerging mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has highlighted the growing urgency for mental health-friendly health workers across the sector including the community pharmacy workforce to engage consumers about their mental well-being.","Suppiah, V.; Kelly, F.; Watt, O.; Wheeler, A.

"Fear of COVID-19 and Depression, Anxiety, Stress, and PTSD among Syrian Refugee Parents in Canada","Introduction The high frequency of COVID-19 has had an impact on the psychological health of all countries and socioeconomic groups around the world, with refugees suffering the brunt of the burden. The aim was to assess the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and depression, anxiety, stress, and PTSD among Syrian refugee parents residing in the Greater Toronto Area. Methods A convenience sample of 274 Syrian refugee parents residing in Ontario was recruited. Fear of COVID-19 was measured using the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S). Levels of depression, anxiety, stress and PTSD were assessed using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21), and Primary Care PTSD screen (PC-PTSD). Multiple Linear Regression analyses were performed to assess the relationship between FCV-19S and the DASS-21 subscales and PC-PTSD. Results Severe levels of depression, anxiety, and stress were reported by 12.2%, 26.8%, and 9.7% of participants respectively, and 24.1% screened positive for PTSD. FCV-19S was associated with higher levels of stress (ÃŸÂ =Â 0.27, p =0.006), anxiety (ÃŸÂ =Â 0.40, p &lt;0.001), depression (ÃŸÂ =Â 0.32, p =0.001) and PTSD (ÃŸÂ =Â 0.04, p =0.015).

"Intimate Relationships in Times of COVID-19: A Descriptive Study of Belgian Partners and their Perceived Well-Being","How did couples in Belgium cope during the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic? In this study, grounded in relationship science, we investigated in a descriptive manner several factors that could affect how couples perceived individual and relational wellbeing during this time. Specifically, we examined the associations between gender, sexual orientation, parental status, and relationship duration on participants' self-reported individual and relational well-being after the first lockdown (more generally and more specific in response to COVID-19). Additionally, we investigated if relational well-being predicted perceived change in individual well-being from pre-to post-COVID-19 regulations. To test these hypotheses, self-report data was collected during the Summer of 2020 in both the Dutch and French speaking part of Belgium. Data from 679 participants suggested that individual and relational well-being only differed based on parental status (and not by gender nor sexual orientation). Importantly, parents reported lower relational well-being than participants without children, while participants without children reported higher perceived increases in depression. People that had been in a relationship for longer also reported lower relational well-being, but this relationship was explained by other confounding factors. Relational well-being buffered increases in individual distress that people perceived to have occurred pre-COVID-19 regulations to after COVID-19 regulations went into effect. These findings might inform practice and policy for individuals in a romantic relationship during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sels, L.; Verhelst, P.; Galdiolo, S.; Chiarolanza, C.; Gaugue, J.; Randall, A.

"FIRST ADULT PULMONARY CASE OF PRIOR INFECTION OF POLYPORE MUSHROOM IRPEX LACTEUS","TYPE: Case Report TOPIC: Chest Infections INTRODUCTION: Irpex lacteus is a basidiomycete found on decaying wood. Known uses include the saccharification of wheat for ethanol production;decolorization of textile effluent wastewater;and detoxification of effluents from the debittering process of olives. Rarely found to cause a human mycosis, and ours is the first adult pulmonary case that is reported. CASE PRESENTATION: 61 yr old male with Stage 4ae B cell lymphoma and bcl6 amplification s/p RCHOP, presented with recurrent right effusions. The patient yielded 500mL of transudative effusion. No prior COVID infections and he was fully vaccinated. He worked by cutting down wood in the forests. No complaints of hemoptysis, night sweats, or weight loss. PET scan revealed anterior mediastinal calcifications, a large right effusion, and a LLL nodule. The LLL nodule was biopsied, and pathology revealed necrotizing granulomas. Bronchoscopy with EBUS did not reveal granulomas within the mediastinal lymph nodes. BAL from the LLL revealed a fungal culture positive for I. lacteus. The patient did not undergo further treatment for the positive fungal culture. Follow up PET scan did not reveal progression of his lymphoma. DISCUSSION: The two documented cases of I. lacteus were within a 9 yr old with ALL and pulmonary abscess;and a 73 yr old with sarcoidosis and fungal meningitis. Due to his clinical stability, he did not require amphotericin B, as was needed in the two prior cases. CONCLUSIONS: I.lacteus is a rare cause of a human mycosis. Further investigation would be warranted in terms of treatment, as there are so few cases. DISCLOSURE: Nothing to declare.

"Moral distress, emotional impact and coping in intensive care units staff during the outbreack of COVID-19","Background From the beginning, the COVID-19 pandemic increased ICU workloads and created exceptionally difficult ethical dilemmas. ICU staff around the world have been subject to high levels of moral stress, potentially leading to mental health problems. There is only limited evidence on moral distress levels and coping styles among Spanish ICU staff, and how they influenced health professionalsâ€™ mental health during the pandemic. Objectives To assess moral distress, related mental health problems (anxiety and depression), and coping styles among ICU staff during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain. Design: Cross-sectional. Settings and participants: The study setting consisted of ICUs and areas converted into ICUs in public and private hospitals. A total of 434 permanent and temporary ICU staff (reassigned due to the pandemic from other departments to ICUs) answered an online questionnaire between March and June 2020. Methods Sociodemographic and job variables, moral distress, anxiety, depression, and coping mechanisms were anonymously evaluated through a self-reported questionnaire. Descriptive and correlation analyses were conducted, and multivariate linear regression models were developed to explore the predictive ability of moral distress and coping on anxiety and depression. Results Moral distress during the pandemic is determined by situations related to the patient and family, the ICU unit, and resource management of the organisations themselves. ICU staff already reached moderate levels of moral distress, anxiety, and depression during the first wave of the pandemic. Temporary ICU staff (redeployed from other units) obtained higher scores in these variables (p=0.04, p=0.038, and p=0.009, respectively) than permanent ICU staff, as well as in greater intention to leave their current position (p=0.03). This intention was also stronger in health staff working in areas converted into ICUs (45.2%) than in normal ICUs (40.2%) (p=0.02). Moral distress, coupled with primarily avoidance-oriented coping styles, explains 37% (AdR2) of the variance in anxiety and 38% (AdR2) of the variance in depression. Conclusions Our study reveals that the emotional well-being of ICU staff was already at risk during the first wave of the pandemic. The moral distress they experienced was related to anxiety and depression issues, as well as the desire to leave the profession, and should be addressed, not only in permanent ICU staff, but also in temporary ICU staff, redeployed to these units as reinforcement workers.","Romero-GarcÃ­a, Marta, Delgado-Hito, Pilar, GÃ¡lvez-Herrer, Macarena, Antonio Ãngel-Sesmero, JosÃ©, Raquel Velasco-Sanz, Tamara, Benito-Aracil, Llucia, Heras-La Calle, Gabriel","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.iccn.2022.103206","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Intensive and Critical Care Nursing;: 103206, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25884,""
"Factors associated with readmission to the Emergency Department in a cohort of COVID-19 hospitalized patients","Introduction: The aim of this study was to describe the symptomatology and main factors associated with readmission to the Emergency Department (ED) in COVID-19 patients discharged from hospital during the first wave of the pandemic at the San Cecilio University Hospital, Granada, Spain. Methods: An observational longitudinal study was conducted in a cohort of 441 patients admitted to our hospital with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from 1 March to 15 April 2020. Patients were followed up through medical records 6 months after discharge. Sociodemographic, clinical and symptomatologic variables were collected. Descriptive, bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. Results: The mean age of patients in the cohort was 66.4 years (s = 15.3), with 55.1% men. In-hospital mortality was 18.1%. The presence of persistent symptomatology was high (64.5%), especially respiratory (53.2%), systemic (46.3%) and neurological (31.0%). A total of 75 (20.8%) patients were readmitted to the ED during the 6 months following hospital discharge. The main factors associated with readmission to the ED were polymedication (P = 0.031), living in a care home (P = 0.014), fever (P = 0.047), general malaise (P &lt; 0.001), thoracic pain (P &lt; 0.001), headache (P = 0.012), hematological symptoms (P = 0.011), nephrological symptoms (P = 0.047), depressive symptoms (P = 0.009), syncope or hypotension (P = 0.006) and superinfection (P = 0.018). After multivariate adjustment analysis, thoracic pain (OR: 4.45, 95% CI: 1.88- 10.52), general malaise and hematological symptoms (OR: 3.95, 95% CI: 1.12-13.89) remained as risk factors. Conclusions: The presence of persistent symptomatology after hospital discharge in our cohort was common and varied. Polymedication and living in a care home made up the most vulnerable profile of COVID-19 patients for returning to the ED. Thoracic pain, general malaise and hematological symptoms were identified as potential markers of severity, along with others predictors. These findings might be useful for optimizing follow-up strategies. Future studies conducted in other geographical areas are necessary to corroborate our results.

"Impact of COVID-19 on oral health care professionals","Objectives: The aim of this study was to identify the physical, psychological, social, and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the daily lives of oral health professionals in Portugal. Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out in the form of an online questionnaire with 32 questions through Google Forms. The survey's link was shared with oral health professionals in Portugal through institutional e-mail addresses and social networks. Results: The questionnaire obtained 364 responses. Regarding the impact of COVID-19 on clinical practice, 48.1% of professionals reported that the number of work hours decreased, and more than 74% reported a decrease in their monthly income. When asked about the affluence of patients, 43% indicated that it decreased. Approximately 30% of survey takers indicated that the current situation had affected the quality of the treatments carried out. As for the impact of COVID-19 on physical and mental health, the participants reported a considerable increase in tiredness and stress/anxiety levels. The vast majority (74%) admitted that they could not disconnect from work-related stress. Finally, 92.3% are aware and apply the directives for removing personal protective equipment. Conclusions: The present study concluded that the COVID-19 pandemic had a clear psychological, social, physical, and economic impact on oral health professionals in Portugal. Therefore, we believe that national public health institutions must transmit that dental practices are safe environments and create psychological and financial support mechanisms for the most affected professionals.

"OCCUPATIONAL STRESS IN HEALTHCARE WORKERS DURING A COVID-19 PANDEMIC","Healthcare workers experience overwhelming occupational and psycho-emotional stress during COVID-19 pandemic. Occupational stress leads to emotional burnout, can cause anxiety, depression and other psychopathological symptoms, influencing the quality of medical care. Existing situation necessitates to define risk factors, influencing occupational stress in healthcare workers in order to develop ways and methods to overcome it. Aim of the study was to identify socio-psychological factors associated with occupational stress in healthcare workers during the COVID-19 epidemic in Ukraine. Using a specially designed questionnaire, an online survey of 1,100 medical workers was conducted in all regions of Ukraine. Questioning was carried out over three weeks from 30.03.2020 to 21.04.2020, during the period of quarantine. The majority of respondents were female medical workers (79.9%). Age of respondents: up to 30 years - 179 (16.2%), from 31 to 60 - 824 (75.0%), over 60 - 97 (8.8%), among them doctors - 695 (63.1%) 236 nurses (21.5%), more than a third are general practitioners. Direct care for patients with COVID-19 was provided by 170 (15.5%) medical personnel. The analysis of the results of the questionnaire enabled to determine the peculiarities of medical worker's response to the situation in connection with COVID-19 and highlight the emotional and behavioral factors associated with stress that are significant for most respondents. The study answered the questions regarding the perceived risk associated with the spread, contamination and death related to coronavirus. The most significant factors affecting the occurrence of stress in medical workers are identified. Along with this, factors contributing to stress coping have been identified as well. For subsequent statistical processing, all respondents were divided into two groups depending on the severity of the anxiety/fear. Comparison of these groups by socio-demographic indicators was done using the test chi 2. There were no statistically significant differences between groups in all socio-demographic indicators, except for age. That is, only the age factor affected the severity of anxiety/fear among healthcare workers due to COVID-19 (p&lt;0.05). Comparative analysis to assess the severity of stress in groups was performed using the Mann-Whitney U test. Healthcare workers with severe anxiety/fear have a high risk for development of occupational stress during a COVID-19 pandemic (p&lt;0.01). In conclusion, the need for the development and implementation of methods for the prevention of occupational stress in medical workers in the current epidemic situation is substantiated.","Pinchuk, I.

"Admission ECG may predict short-term mortality among adults hospitalized with covid-19 infection","Introduction: Cardiovascular complications of novel SARS-CoV-2 infection remain poorly understood with outcomes limited to index hospitalizations. Methods: This retrospective cohort study included patients with proven COVID-19 who received care at a single hospital network in Massachusetts from March 11, 2020 to May 23, 2020 and received an electrocardiogram (ECG) within 24 hours of hospital presentation. We investigated mortality and cardiovascular complications within 90 days from initial COVID-19 diagnosis. Data were electronically ed and confirmed by manual chart review. Results: A total of 1,744 patients tested positive within the hospital network during the study period. Nearly half of them (49.3%) were hospitalized and 15.5% died within 90 days. A total of 278 patients received an ECG within 24 hours, representing 23.6% of all hospitalized patients. These patients were disproportionately older (38.5 vs 58.1% over the age of 60, p &lt; 0.01), male (49.6 vs 56.2%, p = 0.05), and white (48.1 vs 56.2, p &lt; 0.01). Admission ECGs demonstrating ischemic changes (STelevations, ST-depressions, and T-wave inversions) or new arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation/flutter, bradyarrhythmia, supraventricular tachycardia) were identified among 10.1% and 9.0% of the patients, respectively. Heart failure and cardiomyopathy were rare findings (&lt;1%). After adjusting for age, sex, and past medical history, ischemic changes or new-onset arrhythmias were associated with nearly five-times greater risk of death (OR: 4.9;95% CI 1.7-14.4). Conclusions: In this retrospective study among hospitalized adults with a proven COVID-19 infection, admission ECGs demonstrating ischemic changes or new-onset dysrhythmia predict a higher risk of death in the short-term.","O'Day, K.; Ferreira, S.; Asaker, J.

"The impact of COVID-19 on health care professionals who are exposed to drug-related deaths while supporting clients experiencing addiction","Introduction This paper explores the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on health care professionals who support clients experiencing addiction. During the pandemic, addiction support became more challenging, as existing health care models had changed or been completely abolished. Clients continued to engage with social, justice, and health services in limited capacities, connecting with general practitioners, key workers, homelessness support workers, and other service providers. This marginalized population was among the most high-risk groups for adverse health outcomes during the pandemic and understanding the associated implications for practitioner well-being is crucial. Methods Fifteen health care professionals who work with active addiction in homelessness, public health, addiction, emergency medicine, and other areas participated in individual semi-structured interviews. Data analyses utilized reflexive thematic analysis. Results Four core themes emerged from the analysis: (i) Shift in Priority, (ii) Being Left Behind, (iii) Managing a Death, and (iv) Anxious Environment. Within each core theme, associated subthemes provide further context. The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the well-being of clinicians who work with people who use drugs, fostering a more anxious environment and compounding what can already be a high-stress occupation. Participants exhibited high levels of concern for the well-being of clients, and uncertainty permeated throughout conversations. Furthermore, staff expressed concern for their own well-being in the long term due to the inability to process adverse events, such as a service user's death, due to the chaotic nature of the pandemic. Conclusions This paper highlights some areas of concern to address for future service delivery and presents opportunities to future-proof services as the world moves toward hybrid models of working. The inflexibility of service provision during the pandemic and the digital divide due to public health measures pushed marginalized groups further into the margins, with significant implications for practitioner occupational well-being due to feelings of anxiety, powerlessness, and concern for mortality of clients. This study collects a broad scope of experiences across disciplines in health care and demonstrates how professionals navigated unprecedented circumstances.","O'Callaghan, Daniel, Lambert, Sharon","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2022.108720","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment;: 108720, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25890,""

"The dual pandemic: COVID-19, systemic racism, and college student-athletic mental health","The dual pandemic of 2020 - COVID-19 and systemic racism - continues to reshape society. The current study examines how this dual pandemic contributes to the psychological distress of college student-athletes, with attention to college student-athletes who identify as Black, Indigenous, or people of colour (BIPOC). A total of 222 student-athletes from nine universities completed the online survey. Student-athletes reported COVID-19 had a moderate impact on daily life. The direct effect of COVID-19 on psychological distress was found to be positive and significant but did riot differ for BIPOC and White participants. Additionally, nearly all BIPOC student-athletes reported experiencing systemic racism;yet the level of systemic racism did not predict psychological distress. Findings provide insight related to the importance of mental health among college student-athletes.","Newman, T. J.; Turgeon, S.; Moore, M.; Bean, C.; Lee, L.; Knuettel, M.; Rahill, C.

"The Time-Varying Relation between Stock Returns and Monetary Variables","The nature of the relation between stock returns and the three monetary variables of interest rates (bond yields), inflation and money supply growth, while oft studied, is one that remains unclear. We argue that the nature of the relation changes over time, and this variation is largely driven by shocks, with a change in risk associated with each variable shifting the pattern of behaviour. We show a change in the correlation between each of the three variables with stock returns. Notably, a predominantly negative correlation with bond yields and inflation becomes positive, while the opposite is true for money supply growth. The shift begins with the bursting of the dotcom bubble but is exacerbated by the financial crisis. Results of predictive regressions for stock returns also indicate a switch in behaviour. Predominantly negative predictive power switches temporarily to positive around economic shocks. This suggests that higher yields, inflation and money growth typically depress returns but support the market during periods of stress. However, after the financial crisis, higher inflation and money growth exhibit persistent positive predictive power and suggest a change in the risk perception of higher values.","McMillan, David G.","https://doi.org/10.3390/jrfm15010009","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Journal of Risk and Financial Management; 15(1):9, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25893,""
"Circadian rhythm disruption in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Implications for the post-acute sequelae of COVID-19","Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a common and disabling disorder primarily characterized by persistent fatigue and exercise intolerance, with associated sleep disturbances, autonomic dysfunction, and cognitive problems. The causes of ME/CFS are not well understood but may coincide with immune and inflammatory responses following viral infections. During the current SARS-CoV2 coronavirus pandemic, ME/CFS has been increasingly reported to overlap with persistent â€œlong COVIDâ€ symptoms, also called the post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). Given the prominence of activity and sleep problems in ME/CFS, circadian rhythm disruption has been examined as a contributing factor in ME/CFS. While these studies of circadian rhythms have been pursued for decades, evidence linking circadian rhythms to ME/CFS remains inconclusive. A major limitation of older chronobiology studies of ME/CFS was the unavailability of modern molecular methods to study circadian rhythms and incomplete understanding of circadian rhythms outside the brain in peripheral organ systems. Major methodological and conceptual advancements in chronobiology have since been made. Over the same time, biomarker research in ME/CFS has progressed. Together, these new developments may justify renewed interest in circadian rhythm research in ME/CFS. Presently, we review ME/CFS from the perspective of circadian rhythms, covering both older and newer studies that make use of modern molecular methods. We focus on transforming growth factor beta (TGFB), a cytokine that has been previously associated with ME/CFS and has an important role in circadian rhythms, especially in peripheral cells. We propose that disrupted TGFB signaling in ME/CFS may play a role in disrupting physiological rhythms in sleep, activity, and cognition, leading to the insomnia, energy disturbances, cognition problems, depression, and autonomic dysfunction associated with ME/CFS. Since SARS-like coronavirus infections cause persistent changes in TGFB and previous coronavirus outbreaks have caused ME/CFS-like syndromes, chronobiological considerations may have immediate implications for understanding ME/CFS in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and possibly suggest new avenues for therapeutic interventions.","McCarthy, M.

"Impact of the covid pandemic on depression and subsequent emergency department visits for anxiety and chest pain","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected nearly every aspect of daily life. The interpersonal loss due to quarantining and social distancing, compounded with societal disruption has negatively affected mental health. Once established, mental health conditions can become chronic with having subsequent effects on additional risk factors and disease incidence, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD). Methods: Patients who completed a PHQ-9 in a primary care setting in the year prior to the COVID pandemic (Mar 1, 2019 to Feb 29, 2020) and during the COVID pandemic (Mar 1, 2020 to Apr 20, 2021) were studied. Patients were stratified into 2 groups: no depression/no longer depressed and remained depressed/became depressed. Patients were assessed for follow-up emergency department (ED) visits for anxiety and chest pain (CP) after PHQ-9 completion during the pandemic. Results: A total of 4,633 patients were studied, with 2,848 (61.5%) being never/no longer depressed and 1,785 (38.5%) remaining/became depressed. PHQ-9 scores during the pandemic were higher than prior to the pandemic among those depressed. A total of 2,171 (46.6%) received a COVID test, with more depressed patients tested compared to non-depressed (Table), but with positivity for SARS-CoV-2 (n=362 [16.7%]) being similar (p=0.18). The table shows baseline characteristics and outcomes. Depression was associated with increased ED visits for anxiety (Table). Those with depression, visited the ED at 3.5 times and 2.7 times greater rate for anxiety and anxiety with CP compared to non-depressed, respectively. Conclusions: Depression was highly prevalent among patients who receive routine primary care, with depressive symptoms increasing during the pandemic. Since depression and anxiety are associated with an increased risk of CVD and associated risk factors, identifying and treating patients early who exhibit such symptoms will be important in reducing the risk of future CVD and risk factor incidence.","May, H.

"Views of Mental Health Professionals on Positive Changes in Service Practices and Staff-User Relationships After One Year of Covid-19 Pandemic in Italy","This study explored views of mental health services (MHS) professionals regarding positive changes in service practices and organizations, and staff-user relationships after one year of COVID-19 in Italy. Professionals from a community-oriented MHS completed online the Questionnaire on MHS Transformations during the COVID-19 pandemic, a 30-item tool developed by a participatory approach and validated. Of the 184 participants, 91.8% felt it was â€œtrue/definitely trueâ€ that during the pandemic they had informed users on procedures to reduce contagion risks, and 82.1% stated that they had increased telephone contact with users. Sixty-nine percent of professionals reported that staff revised treatment plans according to new needs of care and 78.6% stated that they had been able to mediate between user needs and safe working procedures. Moreover, 79.4% of respondents stated that they had rediscovered the importance of gestures and habits, and 65% that they had gained strength among colleagues to face fear. Fifty-four percent of participants admitted that they had discovered unexpected personal resources in users. Overall, 59.6% of participants stated that they found some positives in the COVID-19 experience.

"Knowledge, Attitude and Practice towards COVID-19 among Undergraduate Students in Nepal","Background: Nepal is a landlocked country standing highly vulnerable to unfolding pandemic. As per a UNDP survey in May, three in five employees had lost their job during COVID-19 and most of them were youths. During the first 74 days of lockdown, 16 people committed suicide per day (total 1227 cases). Hence, the main objective of the study was to assess knowledge, attitude, and practice toward COVID-19 in undergraduate students of Nepal. Aims and Objectives: This study aims to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice among undergraduates of Nepal. Materials and Methods: This study is a cross-sectional study conducted among undergraduates residing in Nepal through online Google Forms for the conduction of online survey using purposive sampling technique. The participants were called through social media and the process about the use of Google Forms was explained by the researcher. The questionnaires were taken from open-access pre-published article. Univariate and bivariate analyses were applied for assessing knowledge, attitude, and practice and their association with independent variables. Results: In this study, among the 120 respondent who had agreed to take part in the research study, the overall knowledge level was found to be high toward COVID-19 among Nepalese undergraduates (Mean=0.74, SD=0.16), Majority of the participants, that is, 92.5% of participants had positive attitude regarding improved immunity as a measure to protect from COVID-19 and had good practice to prevent COVID-19 (Mean=0.84, SD=0.28). Conclusion: The knowledge was found to be high. Furthermore, optimistic attitude and proactive practice was seen among the undergraduates toward the battle against this pandemic. Contradiction to previous studies, significant association of provincial habitat with attitude towards COVID-19 was found.

"Amplify or suppress the inspiration? Comment valence influences the reception of inspirational COVID-19 videos","Can popular media play a role in inspiring and uplifting peoples' spirits during the COVID-19 pandemic? The current study extended existing positive media psychology research by exploring the positive effects of inspirational COVID-19 online videos on meaningful affect, norm perceptions, and prosocial intentions. It was also proposed that positive online comments would amplify beneficial outcomes. A survey experiment (n = 620) with a 2 (video type: inspirational vs. Noninspirational) x 3 (comment type: positive comments, negative comments, or no comments) between-subjects design examined impacts on norm perceptions of self-transcendent behaviors, meaningful affect, and prosocial intentions. Results showed that inspirational videos (vs. noninspirational ones) led to greater prosocial intentions, which were mediated by more positive norm perceptions and stronger meaningful affect. However, instead of an amplifying effect of positive comments, evidence emerged of a suppressing effect of negative comments. Participants who read negative comments (vs. positive comments or no comments) about inspirational content reported more negative norm perceptions, lower levels of meaningful affect, and less prosocial intentions. Also, the light triad personality did not moderate any of the observed effects. The study advances inspirational media research by demonstrating that the content itself is not solely responsible for observed effects but also other cues in the media environment (e.g., others' comments). In addition, it introduced norm perceptions as a potential underlying mechanism in positive media effects. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement Inspirational online videos referencing COVID-19 helped to not only elicit positive emotions (e.g., the feeling of being touched and inspired) among individuals but also increase the norm perception that self-transcendent behaviors were favored by others, further leading to greater intentions to act in prosocial ways. However, such positive effects were dampened when the inspirational videos were accompanied by negative comments. The viewing of inspirational video content with accompanying positive comments can be an effective means for promoting mental health and social good.

"An Overview of System Strength Challenges in Australiaâ€™s National Electricity Market Grid","The national electricity market (NEM) of Australia is reforming via the rapid uptake of variable renewable energy (VRE) integration concurrent with the retirement of conventional synchronous generation. System strength has emerged as a prominent challenge and constraint to power system stability and ongoing grid connection of VRE such as solar and wind. In order to facilitate decarbonization pathways, Australia is the first country to evolve system strength and inertia frameworks and assessment methods to accommodate energy transition barriers, and other parts of the world are now beginning to follow the same approach. With the evolvement of the system strength framework as a new trending strategy to break the transition barriers raised by renewable energy project development and grid connection studies, this paper provides a high-level overview of system strength, covering such fundamental principles as its definition, attributes, and manifestations, as well as industry commentary, cutting-edge technologies and works currently underway for the delivery of a secure and reliable electricity system with the rapid integration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) in the NEM grid. The intent of this study is to provide a comprehensive reference on the engineering practices of the system strength challenge along with complementary technical, regulatory, and industry perspectives.","Li, Yu, Meng, Ke, Zhang, Wang, Zhang, Yuchen","https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics11020224","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Electronics; 11(2):224, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25900,""

"'No one understands what we go through': self-identification of health risks by women sanitation workers in Pune, India during the COVID-19 pandemic (Special Issue: Gender, development and health)","This paper speaks of the women sanitation workers who are working at the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic in Pune city, an epicentre of rising COVID-19 cases in India. Prevailing caste and gendered norms of labour roles render the women doubly vulnerable. Within that context, we investigate how the women sanitation workers self-identify their health risks and needs. We document their internal negotiation of health risks, and their narratives pertaining to chronic health issues and deteriorating mental health arising from COVID-19-related uncertainty. We also probe on how their family roles and obligations intersect with their de-prioritisation of self-care. The investigation reveals narratives of lack of agency at work, invisibilised and endemic mental wellness issues, and neglect of personal well-being at the cost of centring the needs of the family.","Kisana, R.; Shah, N.","https://doi.org/10.1080/13552074.2021.1885217","","Database: GIM; Publication details: Gender and Development; 29(1):35-54, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25902,""
"Mental health status of adults under institutional quarantine: a cross-sectional survey in Tunisia","Introduction: restrictive measures imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as quarantine, may induce psychiatric outcomes among concerned individuals. The present study aimed to describe the mental health status of Tunisian adults under mandatory institutional quarantine imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to determine factors influencing the occurrence of psychiatric symptoms. Methods: a cross-sectional phone survey was conducted from April to November 2020 using convenience sampling of persons who had experienced mandatory institutional quarantine. A standardized questionnaire was administered to participants including questions about socio-demographic characteristics and quarantine related information. Generalized anxiety disorder, depression symptoms, and sleep quality during quarantine were assessed using, respectively, the generalized anxiety disorder-7 (GAD-7), the centre for epidemiological studies depression (CES-D-10) and the insomnia severity index (ISI) scales. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine factors associated with anxiety and/or depression and with clinical insomnia. Results: among 506 participants, 38.3% experienced anxiety and/or depression symptoms (anxiety: 15.4%;depression: 37.4%) and 19.2% had clinical insomnia. The prevalence of anxiety and/or depression symptoms and insomnia were higher among women those who spent three hours or above on COVID-19 news, those who had economic difficulties due to COVID-19 pandemic, those who were not satisfied by the accommodation conditions of quarantine facilities, and those who had experienced stigma. Conclusion: high prevalence of psychiatric symptoms among quarantined individuals was found in this study. Psychological interventions should thus be an integral part of the COVID-19 control strategy in order to provide adequate psychological support to persons quarantined due to COVID-19.","Kharroubi, G.; Cherif, I.; Amor, S.

"Psychological Impact of Covid-19 on the Public","The novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) originated from China in the last week of December, 2019. It spread very rapidly across the globe and was declared as a global emergency and a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Millions of people were affected by this current pandemic globally, and as compared to the physical effects of this catastrophic pandemic it has also critical psychological effects on human life. Various societal stigmas related to COVID-19, lack of anticipatory planning of governments, and failure of global health care leaders and agencies to quickly respond to this crisis has made the current pandemic more devastating for mental health. Numerous adverse effects of the current pandemic on the mental health of the patients and the public such as anxiety, depression, insomnia, increased substance abuse, domestic violence, behavior changes and suicide tendency have severely compromised the resilience of patients and families. The aim of the article was to create an insight in world health care agencies, local health care leaders and the government regarding the psychological impact of COVID-19 on the affected families and public in Pakistan. Moreover, in the light of international research and WHO guidelines, this paper has provided suggestions and recommendations to local government and public regarding management of COVID-19's adverse effects on mental health.","Karim, Abdul, Ilyas, Muhammad, Rahman, Shakir, Khan, Innayatullah","https://doi.org/10.26634/jnur.10.4.17433","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: i-Manager's Journal on Nursing; 10(4):8-12, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25904,""
"Preserving rural school health during the COVID-19 pandemic: Indigenous citizen scientist perspectives from a qualitative study","This qualitative study is part of Smart Indigenous Youth, a digital health community trial involving rural schools in Saskatchewan, Canada. Secondary school administrators and educators were engaged as citizen scientists in rural Indigenous communities to understand rapid decision-making processes for preserving school health during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to inform evidence-based safe school policies and practices. After COVID-19 restrictions were implemented, key informant interviews and focus groups were conducted with school administrators and educators, respectively, to understand the impact of school responses and decision-making processes. Two independent reviewers conducted thematic analyses and compared themes to reach consensus on a final shortlist. Four main themes emerged from the administrator interviews, and six main themes were identified from the educator focus group discussions which revealed a pressing need for mental health supports for students and educators. The study findings highlight the challenges faced by schools in rural and remote areas during the COVID-19 pandemic, including school closures, students' reactions to closures, measures taken by schools to preserve health during the pandemic, and different approaches to implement for future closures. Citizen scientists developed a set of recommendations, including the need for structured communication, reflection meetings, adequate funding, and external monitoring and evaluation to guide evidence-based safe school policies and practices during the pandemic.","Kannan, P.; Bhawra, J.; Patel, P.; Katapally, T.

"Supporting new digital natives: Children's mental health and wellbeing in a hi-tech age","This book pulls together insights into how children and young people (CYP) can be active co-producers in shaping their learning experiences. Not only is it helpful for thinking about the role new digital natives play in their own educational journey and for supporting their mental health and wellbeing in today's rapidly changing virtual climate, but the varied and innovative interventions and initiatives it outlines will surely continue to inspire and have relevance down the line. The book addresses teachers, parents and carers, educators, social workers and others who work directly with the new digital native generation, and crucially it can help make a real difference to the lives of those children and young people. The enduring battle against the COVID-19 crisis has brought the plight of CYP's mental wellbeing further into the spotlight, with new as well as existing challenges to overcome. It is imperative that government policies and strategies worldwide are robust and well targeted to protect the mental wellbeing of all CYP and prevent the onset of more serious problems taking hold. This will require an understanding of the complex and intersecting nature of the issues facing CYP, many of which predate the pandemic. The book highlights some of those crucial factors and, moreover, showcases some innovative and insightful projects which offer simple, practical approaches to help ameliorate CYP's mental wellbeing. The interventions and initiatives presented in this book offer an insight into a range of approaches which have the common purpose of supporting mental wellbeing for children growing up in a digital age. The theoretical framework of the book aligns with social models of mental health which contrast with the traditional biomedical focus on individual deficits and treatment approaches.

"Technology-delivered motivational interviewing interventions for patients with cardiovascular diseases-a systematic review","Introduction: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are a major source of burden worldwide. COVID-19 pandemic has renewed the importance of remote psychoeducational interventions to improve outcomes in these patients. Technology-delivered motivational interviewing (TD-MI) has proven to be effective in chronic disease populations, yet there has been no attempt to summarize TD-MI characteristics and effectiveness in CVD populations. Methods: We searched PubMed, CINHAL, PsychInfo and Web of Science (from inception to May 1, 2021) for randomized controlled trials that enrolled adults with CVD. Record screening, data extraction and risk of bias assessment were performed in duplicate. This review is registered in PROSPERO, CRD42021241516. Results: Of the 2,742 records identified, 7 studies were eligible for qualitative synthesis. Participants (n=12,053, mean age = 62.25, 37.5% females) enrolled from community settings and prevalently affected by coronary artery disease (n. studies=5), hypertension (n=3) and heart failure (n=3), received an average of 11 phone (n=6) or video calls (n=1) over an average of 7 months. Interventionists were mostly nurses (n=4), followed by psychologists (n=2) and a social worker (n=1). Treatment fidelity was assessed in 5 trials;2 trials reported the intervention to be based on a theoretical framework, and 2 studies specified if the interventionist underwent some training before TD-MI administration. Caregivers were never involved. Most targeted outcomes were medication adherence (n=5), quality of life (n=4), disease-related parameters (n=4), and depression (n=3). Risk of bias varied markedly, with the largest source resulting from lack of blinding of participants and assessors (performance bias). The only feasible meta-analysis showed no significant effects of TDMI on depression (n=3;Z=1.18, p=0.24;I2=42%). Conclusions: The number of trials involving TD-MI interventions across CVD populations is scarce and their effectiveness is inconclusive. There was lack of reporting of interventionists' training, description of treatment fidelity, and blinding procedures. More trials with stronger designs and better reporting are needed in the CVD field to inform clinical decision making and research.","Iovino, P.; Baricchi, M.; Ghizzardi, G.; Trenta, A.

"Application of Ionic Liquids for the Recycling and Recovery of Technologically Critical and Valuable Metals","Population growth has led to an increased demand for raw minerals and energy resources;however, their supply cannot easily be provided in the same proportions. Modern technologies contain materials that are becoming more finely intermixed because of the broadening palette of elements used, and this outcome creates certain limitations for recycling. The recovery and separation of individual elements, critical materials and valuable metals from complex systems requires complex energy-consuming solutions with many hazardous chemicals used. Significant pressure is brought to bear on the improvement of separation and recycling approaches by the need to balance sustainability, efficiency, and environmental impacts. Due to the increase in environmental consciousness in chemical research and industry, the challenge for a sustainable environment calls for clean procedures that avoid the use of harmful organic solvents. Ionic liquids, also known as molten salts and future solvents, are endowed with unique features that have already had a promising impact on cutting-edge science and technologies. This review aims to address the current challenges associated with the energy-efficient design, recovery, recycling, and separation of valuable metals employing ionic liquids.","Inman, Grace, Nlebedim, Ikenna C.; Prodius, Denis","https://doi.org/10.3390/en15020628","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Energies; 15(2):628, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25909,""

The intentions of this study therefore firstly, to determine the content analysis by interviewing tertiary students and secondly, to determine the frequency distribution by questionnaire developed from results of the content analysis. To better understand the consequences of this outbreak, we took an interview from forty respondents, including undergraduate and postgraduate students across Bangladesh. Results of Content analysis revealed that stakeholders of tertiary education are encountering severe problems in mental health, financial, technical, and study. A questionnaire was designed based on results were obtained through content analysis and distributed using email, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Telegram, Facebook, and Instagram from May 20 to May 30, 2021. A total number of 505 valid questionnaires were received from respondents. Frequency distribution analysis disclosed that 60% respondents have no separate reading rooms. Laptops and desktops are commonly used for online classes, but unfortunately, 21% respondents have no personal electronic gadgets. Moreover, 55% reported spending less time to study during the coronavirus outbreak. Furthermore, 88% respondents reported experiencing mental health-related stress, anxiety, and depression problems. The proportion that suffered financial crisis, family disruptions, internet and technology related problems were 79%, 83% and 72% respectively. Since coronavirus pandemic is a totally new phenomenon in the world, not much empirical literature exist.

"Association of inflammation with decreased myocardial function in covid patients with shock","Introduction: The response to COVID infection has been associated with intense inflammation, and some patients have cardiac involvement. In a group of patients with COVID infection and shock whose ventricular function was characterized by echocardiography, we examined the relationship between levels of ferritin, an inflammatory marker that is elevated in COVID, and LV ejection fraction (EF). Methods: Of 1275 patients hospitalized with COVID pneumonia, 215 had shock requiring vasopressors. 162 had echocardiography to assess ventricular function and stroke volume. EF was measured using Simpson's rule and stroke volume (SV) by Doppler. Patients were divided into groups with low or preserved EF (EF or EF , cutoff &lt;e45%), and low or normal cardiac index, (CI, CI or CI , cutoff =&lt;e2.2 L/min/m2). Ferritin within 7 days of the echo was available in 147/162 patients. We examined the association between ferritin levels and ejection fraction. Results: Mean age was 66.7, EF 58.7Â±13.9;CI 2.41Â±0.89 L/min/m2 , ferritin 3036Â±2318 ng/mL (normal &lt;336). Five patients had obstructive shock from pulmonary embolism (normal LVEF, low SV, RV dysfunction) and were excluded. The other 157 patients were divided into groups based on EF and CI (Figure). High ferritin levels correlated with low EF (r=-0.18, p=0.02), and ferritin levels were greatly increased in patients with a hemodynamic profile of cardiogenic shock. (EF CI , Figure, p=0.017 by ANOVA) Conclusion: COVID-induced shock had a cardiogenic profile (EF CI ) in 10% of patients, and another 5% had low EF but normal CI. Ferritin correlated with low EF and was increased in patients with a profile of cardiogenic shock. This suggests that marked inflammation may depress myocardial function in COVID patients with shock-analogous to a similar myocardial depression seen with bacterial-associated septic shock.","Hollenberg, S.

"A Study on the Prevalence of Psychological Impact During the COVID19 Pandemic","Purpose-COVID-19 caused a great deal of anxiety across the world. In addition to the apparent clinical effects in patients contaminated with it, general mental wellbeing has been severely affected. India implemented a lockdown, like other nations, to control and restrict spread of corona virus. Current research aims to address the psychological impact among Indians caused due to preventive measures suggested by WHO. Design/methodology/approach-An online based survey of questions on psychological impact has been carried out among two thousands adult populations. A multi-criteria decision making approach along with statistical analysis have been used to evaluate the data. Findings-Despite the current situation, stress, anxiety, and depression were found to be in normal ranges for mental health among the individuals highlighting their capabilities to remain normal in times of COVID-19. Limitations/implications-Firstly, the sample size was very limited in some categories.

"Maternal fear of COVID-19 and prevalence of postnatal depression symptoms, risk and protective factors","This is a multicenter prospective observational study, aimed to evaluate the relations between Fear of COVID-19 and postpartum depression (PPD) symptom, that included a cohort of women who delivered during COVID-19 lockdown between 03 and 05/2020. Participants were approached after delivery and asked to complete an online questionnaire. Data was verified with each center's perinatal database. The validated Fear of COVID-19 Scale was in use. PPD was evaluated using the EPDS questionnaire as a categorical (=13) and as a continuous scale. Pre-existing maternal disability was defined as any prior physiological/psychological chronic health condition. Continuous medical supervision or stress contributing complications at birth included pregnancy and labor related complications. Regression analysis and ROC statistics were utilized to evaluate associations and control for confounders. Overall, 421 women completed the questionnaires. Of them, 53(12.6%) had a high EPDS score. Fear of COVID-19 was positively correlated with PPD symptoms (rÂ =Â 0.35,pÂ =Â 0.000), ROC-AUC 0.73, 95% CI 0.65â€“0.81, pÂ =Â 0.000. Following adjustment to confounders (maternal age, nulliparity, ethnicity, marital status, financial difficulties, maternal disability, accessibility to medical services, and continuous medical supervision (, the most important factor that correlated with depression symptoms was maternal disability (aOR 4.61,95% CI 1.96â€“10.82) followed by Fear of COVID-19 (aOR 1.11,95% CI 1.05â€“1.17). High accessibility to medical services during pregnancy (aOR 0.62, 95%CI 0.45â€“0.84) was protective for PPD symptoms. To conclude, during the COVID-19 pandemic, maternal disability and Fear of COVID-19 are positively associated with a high EPDS score. High medical accessibility during pregnancy was found as a protective factor for PPD.","Gluska, H.; Shiffman, N.; Mayer, Y.; Elyasyan, L.; Elia, N.; Daher, R.; Sharon Weiner, M.; Miremberg, H.; Kovo, M.; Biron-Shental, T.; Gabbay-Benziv, R.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2022.01.015","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Psychiatric Research;2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25913,""

"Womenâ€™s Substance Use and Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Purpose Women are experiencing greater unemployment and increased stress from childcare responsibilities than men during the COVID-19 pandemic. Women with these experiences may be at particular risk for mental illness and increased substance use during the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of the study was to assess womenâ€™s substance use, mental health, and experiences of COVID-19 pandemic impacts. Methods A national online survey was administered to adult women from September to November 2020. The survey included questionnaires assessing mental health, loneliness, intolerance for uncertainty, social support, substance use, and intimate partner violence. Results Four hundred ninety-nine women responded;most were White, college educated, and in their mid-30â€™s. Of the 20.24% who acknowledged at least one IPV problem, 29.7% stated that their IPV problems have gotten worse since the pandemic began, and 16.83% said that they have increased their drug or alcohol use to cope with their relationship problems. Anxiety, perceived daily impact of COVID-19, and lower self-efficacy were significant predictors of COVID-19 anxiety. Those with risky alcohol use had significantly higher anxiety (p = .028) and depression (p = .032) than those with low risk alcohol use. Conclusions Greater anxiety about COVID-19, greater reported changes in daily life due to the pandemic, and high risk alcohol use are related to greater mental-health related distress among women. For some, intimate partner violence has gotten worse during the pandemic and drug or alcohol use is a coping mechanism.","Devoto, Amanda, Himelein-Wachowiak, McKenzie, Liu, Tingting, Curtis, Brenda","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.whi.2022.01.004","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Women's Health Issues;2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25915,""
"Characteristics Associated with Communicative Participation after Total Laryngectomy","Purpose The purpose of this study was to identify individual characteristics that are associated with communicative participation after total laryngectomy (TL). Methods This study was a single-institution investigation of individuals who had undergone TL. Data were collected at a single timepoint via patient self-report and medical record review. Thirty-five participants completed a questionnaire containing a communication survey as well as several published, validated instruments. Independent variables included characteristics related to demographics, health and medical history, social network composition, and communication. The dependent variable was communicative participation, which was assessed using the Communicative Participation Item Bank (CPIB). Correlations between the independent variables and CPIB scores were calculated to assess the influence of these characteristics on communicative participation. The study participants were subdivided into three distinct groups based on whether their primary method of communication was spoken or non-spoken and the frequency of using alternate methods of communication. Outcomes across the three groups were then compared. A follow-up survey was also conducted to examine the impact of â€œstay at homeâ€ orders during the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020-21. Results There were significant correlations between communicative participation and some non-communication-related characteristics. Reduced communicative participation was associated with younger age, less time since TL, a history of reconstructive surgery, poorer self-rated health, more depressive symptoms, worse quality of life, and a weaker social network of friends. Several communication-related characteristics were also associated with CPIB scores. Increased communicative participation was associated with using fewer non-spoken communication methods, higher levels of satisfaction with speech and communication, and better communicative effectiveness. There were significant differences between the three groups for communicative effectiveness and satisfaction with speech. The three groups did not differ significantly for satisfaction with communication or communicative participation. There were no significant differences in CPIB scores measured before and during the pandemic. Conclusions Communicative participation is a complex measure that may be affected by a variety of factors related to demographics, health, social network status, and communication. Despite poorer communicative effectiveness and lower levels of satisfaction, individuals who use non-spoken methods of communication after TL did not demonstrate worse communicative participation than those using spoken methods. Surprisingly, CPIB scores did not decline as a result of social distancing.","Dahl, Kimberly L.; Bolognone, Rachel K.; Childes, Jana M.; Pryor, Rebecca L.; Graville, Donna J.; Palmer, Andrew D.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcomdis.2022.106184","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Communication Disorders;: 106184, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25916,""

"An examination of pickleball participation, social connections, and psychological well-being among seniors during the COVID-19 pandemic (Leisure and aging in difficult times)","This study examined how the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the physical activity, social connections, and psychological well-being of seniors who participate in the sport of pickleball. A total of 36 pickleball players who were over the age of 65 completed an online survey that assessed pickleball participation, social connections, physical/mental health, loneliness, and life satisfaction measures in February/March 2020 (pre-COVID) and again in November 2020 (during COVID). Findings indicated that a majority of the participants are still playing pickleball outdoors, but less frequently. They reported lower social connections through pickleball and in their daily life. While perceived physical health scores were stable, participants reported significantly lower mental health, higher loneliness, and lower life satisfaction during the pandemic. Those playing less pickleball were significantly more likely to report lower life satisfaction during the pandemic. The findings from this study have implications for both leisure practitioners and public health professionals as they strategize ways to continue to offer recreation experiences safely.","Casper, J.

"The interpersonal-psychological theory of suicide and the role of psychological pain during the COVID-19 pandemic: a network analysis: Suicide and psychological pain","Introduction Among the most investigated theories explaining suicidal behavior there are the interpersonal-psychological theory of suicide (IPTS) by Thomas E. Joiner and the one focused on the construct of psychological pain (or psychache, or mental pain). Objective Since it remains unclear whether these two different theories correlate with each other in the explanation of suicidal risk, we used a network analysis approach to investigate the complex interplay between both IPTS and psychological pain theories and history of suicidal planning and/or suicide attempt (SP/SA). Methods A sample of 1,586 university students from various Italian universities was recruited between April 24th, 2020 and February 23rd, 2021, hence during the COVID-19 pandemic. To be included subjects should have been university students and aged between 18 and 35 years old. Results Within a network that included the core factors from both models (IPTS and psychological pain), higher fearlessness about death (Acquired Capability for Suicide Scale-Fearlessness About Death, ACSS-FAD) and higher psychological pain (Psychache Scale) were the variables most strongly associated with history of SP/SA. Conclusions Considering a large number of variables, history of SP/SA was explained in particular by fearlessness about death and psychological pain in university students. Hence these aspects should be targeted in the treatment for suicide prevention.","Calati, Raffaella, Romano, Daniele, Magliocca, Sara, Madeddu, Fabio, Zeppegno, Patrizia, Gramaglia, Carla","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.01.078","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Affective Disorders;2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25919,""

This infection primarily affects the respiratory system, but other organs and systems can be affected in the short term, such as the neurological system. A large population of patients has managed to overcome the SARS-CoV-2 infection, however, a serie of late clinical manifestations have begun to be reported, basically neuropsychiatric, including anxiety, depression, disorder of sleep, muscle pain, dizziness, headaches, fatigue, anosmia, among others;this set of late manifestations has been called post-Covid-19 neurological syndrome and requires, on the one hand, the attention of the medical community to investigate the late manifestations or sequel of this disease and, on the other hand, medical vigilance when consulting patients with these manifestations.","Caballero-Alvarado, J.; Camacho-Vargas, E.; Rojas-Sanchez, P.","https://doi.org/10.35434/rcmhnaaa.2021.143.1284","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Revista Del Cuerpo Medico Del Hospital Nacional Almanzor Aguinaga Asenjo; 14(3):404-409, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25920,""

"How New Fed Corporate Bond Programs Cushioned the Covid-19 Recession","In the financial crisis and recession induced by the Covid-19 pandemic, many investment-grade firms became unable to borrow from securities markets. In response, the Fed not only reopened its commercial paper funding facility but also announced it would purchase newly issued and seasoned corporate bonds rated as investment grade before the Covid pandemic. We assess the effectiveness of this program using long sample periods, spanning the Great Depression through the Great and Covid Recessions. Findings indicate that the announcement of corporate bond backstop facilities helped stop risk premia from rising further than they had by late-March 2020. In doing so, these backstop facilities limited the role of external finance premia in amplifying the macroeconomic impact of the Covid pandemic. Nevertheless, the corporate bond programs blend the roles of the Federal Reserve in conducting monetary policy via its balance sheet, acting as a lender of last resort, and pursuing credit policies.","Bordo, Michael D.; Duca, John V.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbankfin.2022.106413","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Banking & Finance;: 106413, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25922,""
"Impaired systemic oxygen extraction relates to reduced exercise capacity in post-covid-19 long hauler syndrome","Introduction: Following acute coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) disease, at least 10% of patients report some form of residual limitation, most commonly dyspnea and fatigue. These COVID-19 â€œlong haulersâ€ experience symptoms that are largely unexplained by pulmonary function testing (PFT), echocardiogram and chest computed tomography (CT). Using invasive cardiopulmonary exercise testing, this pilot study characterized exercise limitation in 5 patients with persistent symptoms 1 year following mild COVID-19 illness. Methods: Following written informed consent, data were obtained in accordance with an IRBapproved protocol entailing placement of radial and pulmonary arterial catheters for pressure monitoring and blood sampling prior to and during maximum upright incremental exercise. Rest and exercise pulmonary hemodynamics, ventilation and gas exchange were recorded. Aerobic exercise capacity was estimated by peak O2 consumption (VO2 ). Results: All patients had normal biventricular and valvular function on resting echocardiogram, no evident parenchymal lung disease on CT, and normal PFTs. Resting mean pulmonary arterial pressure was =20 mmHg for all patients with pulmonary vascular resistance &lt;3 Woods units. At maximum exercise, all patients exhibited normal respiratory, cardiac output (% predicted), and total pulmonary vascular resistance responses, but demonstrated clearly depressed aerobic capacity (peak VO2 &lt;80% predicted). Reduced peak VO2 was associated with impaired systemic O2 extraction as indicated by an arterial-venous O2 content difference (adjusted for hemoglobin) of &lt;80% (Figure 1). Conclusion: This case series provides preliminary evidence that reduced peak aerobic capacity among long haulers is primarily attributable to a peripheral (i.e., impaired systemic O2 extraction), rather than central cardiopulmonary, limitation. These results suggest that systemic microcirculatory dysfunction contributes to exercise limitation.","Biondi, M. J.; Joseph, P.; Gulati, M.; Possick, J.; Lutchmansingh, D.; Cullinan, M.; Heerdt, P.

"Attitude to Distance Learning of Schoolchildren and Students: Subjective Assessments of Advantages and Disadvantages","Currently, during the pandemic, the forced transition to distance learning carries a number of problems. These problems affect various aspects of education, including the study of studentsâ€™ attitudes to distance learning. The purpose of this research is to study the features of the subjective attitude of schoolchildren and students to distance learning. This research involved 140 secondary school students (average age M = 10.7, SD = 7.2 (66.3% men)) and 30 university students (average age M = 22.5, SD = 2.4 (20% men)). The methods used were a questionnaire, Chi-square test and Criterion f*. Fisher angular transformation. The study showed that schoolchildren do not intend to continue studying in the distance form if they choose, with a generally positive attitude towards distance learning. The self-assessment of motivation to study in a distance format has not changed, both among schoolchildren and students. Students are more likely to have a positive attitude to distance learning than schoolchildren. The variety of choices of advantages and disadvantages of distance learning is greater among students than among schoolchildren. The perspective of this study is thus to study the factors that determine the positive and negative attitudes to distance learning.","Belousova, Alla, Mochalova, Yuliya, Tushnova, Yulya","https://doi.org/10.3390/educsci12010046","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Education Sciences; 12(1):46, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25924,""
"Transient Myocardial Ischemia in a Case Post Infra-Muscular Adrenaline","Background: Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency and requires immediate medical attention. Kounis syndrome is myocardial infarction or injury occurring in the setting of anaphylaxis and can also be due to the effects of epinephrine. Adrenaline is a common drug in the management of anaphylaxis but the electrocardiographic consequences of its administration post an attack are seldomly seen. Vasospasm is generally the cause for myocardial injury in an acute setting following the administration of epinephrine. Case Presentation: A 21-year- old female developed sudden onset breathlessness and giddiness post vaccination with the oxford -AstraZeneca COVID -19 vaccine. She was administered 0.5 ml adrenaline (1:1000) intramuscularly on the lateral aspect of the left thigh, following which she complained of chest tightness and palpitations. This was accompanied by hypotension and global ST segment depression on her Electrocardiogram. The second electrocardiogram, done after 30 minutes showed a relative resolution in ST segment depressions with sinus rhythm in the one done at 16:00 hours. Creatine Kinase- MB and Troponin I were within normal limits and the patient experienced symptomatic improvement with normalization of blood pressure post fluid challenge. Conclusion: This case report highlights the case of a young female with no comorbidities who developed transient myocardial ischemia after administration of intramuscular adrenalin in therapeutic dose in view of an anaphylactic reaction. The probable action is alpha mediated coronary vasospasm. The potential adverse effects in an acute setting are hence outlined in this case report without discouraging its use given the potential benefits outweigh the risks.","Bawiskar, N.; Rasheed, A.; Bhagawati, J.; Acharya, S.","https://doi.org/10.9734/JPRI/2021/v33i59B34349","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Journal of Pharmaceutical Research International; 33(59B):36-40, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25925,""
"BURNOUT SYNDROME PREVENTION IN NURSING AT PANDEMIC COVID-19: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW","The COVID-19 pandemic has generated burnout syndrome in nurses. Objective: To identify preventive measures of burnout syndrome in nurses in times of COVID-19 pandemic. Method: Systematic review conducted between August and December 2020, in the databases: PubMed, Scielo, Elsevier, Medline and Cinahl, applying the search engines: burnout syndrome, nurs*, pandemic, covid 19, stress, management, with the Boolean operators AND, OR. We searched for articles published during the year 2020 in English and Spanish. Theses and conference s were excluded. A spreadsheet was used for data collection and analysis. From a total of 626 articles, 17 were selected for analysis. Result: Preventive measures for burnout syndrome in nurses were classified into two categories: I.- Organizational Strategies, which are subdivided into 9 aspects: 1) mental and physical health, 2) work environment, 3) teamwork, 4) work shift, 5) support groups, 6) online assistance, 7) training, 8) structure/functioning and 9) health policies. II.-Personal Strategies, focusing on 1) communication, 2) self-care and 3) stress management techniques. Conclusions: To prevent burnout in nursing in times of pandemic, both organizational and personal measures are fundamental. It is suggested to incorporate programs focused on mental health, to ensure that institutions have the necessary resources to face crises and to promote constant communication. In addition, promote the application and deepening of these measures in the current and future health crises, for the benefit of the labor welfare of nurses in the world.","Avendano, F. C.; Hoyos, A.

"Psychological and illness-related correlates of insomnia in mildly symptomatic Nigerian COVID-19 adult patients during self-isolation","Background: Globally, the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted the sleep quality of healthcare workers and healthy subjects. There is a dearth of studies on the extent and factors associated with insomnia among COVID-19 patients in Nigeria and Sub-Saharan Africa. Our aim in this study is to assess the extent and the illness-related and psychological correlates of insomnia in a cross-sectional sample of mildly symptomatic Nigerian COVID-19 adult patients. Methods: Nigerian COVID-19 patients (n=498) aged 18 years and above completed an online survey that consisted of sociodemographic and illness-related details, the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8), suicidal ideation (item 9 of the PHQ-9) and the Brief Symptoms Rating Scale (BSRS-5). Results: Insomnia of varying degrees was present in 22.5%. Hierarchical linear regression analysis showed that the combination of psychological distress, suicidal ideation, and duration of self-isolation were significantly associated with insomnia (accounts for 86% of the variance on ISI scores). Conclusions: Our study revealed that insomnia is relatively common among the mildly symptomatic COVID-19 Nigerian adult patients. The associated factors may serve as a template for the development of insomnia improving interventions for mildly symptomatic Nigerian COVID-19 patients.","Aloba, O.; Opakunle, T.","https://doi.org/10.5455/IM.82937","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: International Medicine; 3(5):145-151, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25927,""
"Compassion fatigue, burnout, and secondary trauma in resident assistants","The number of students with mental health issues in institutions of higher education has been rising over the past few years, and the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated this issue.

Specifically, resonant frequency breathing can exert an impact on stress response systems through the vagus nerve and the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. This may induce reductions in stress and improvement in emotion regulation. Young adults, including college students, tend to be at a higher risk for psychological distress, as they face several psychosocial challenges. The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed new and unique stressors that resulted in higher levels of stress and emotional symptoms and it has been shown that this may have placed young adults at a particular disadvantage. The current study is a randomized controlled trial that aimed to investigate the effects of a mobile application guided resonant frequency breathing training on stress, anxiety, and depression in young adults with elevated stress. Eighty participants were randomized to either a breathing group or a waitlist control group (40 participants in each group). Breathing group participants were instructed to complete two 10-minute breathing sessions per day for five days of the week for a period of 4 weeks. Self-report outcome measures were administered at baseline and at post-training, as well as weekly through online questionnaires. The results showed that the breathing intervention did not result in a higher decrease in stress, anxiety, or depression measured at post-training. However, weekly data showed a decline in stress at weeks 3 and 4 and a lower perceived psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the breathing group relative to the control group. All participants also showed a decrease in psychological distress over time. The current findings are in line with previous literature during the COVID-19 pandemic showing reductions in psychological distress in young adults in the United States. This breathing paradigm could be an accessible, effective, and feasible intervention for young adults experiencing increased stress.

"TMS and CBT-I for comorbid depression and insomnia Exploring feasibility and tolerability of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) for comorbid major depressive disorder and insomnia during the COVID-19 pandemic","Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) is the gold standard treatment for Insomnia Disorder and has been shown to have an antidepressant effect in those with comorbid MDD and Insomnia Disorder. Despite the proven efficacy of CBT-I in the treatment of Insomnia Disorder and promising early work suggesting CBT-I may improve mood symptoms in comorbid MDD and Insomnia Disorder. Conclusions from this study are limited by the enrollment of only two participants. The authors suspect that recruitment was lower than anticipated due to factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the largest contributor likely being the reduced number of patients being seen in consultation for rTMS treatment. The transition of patient visits to virtual platforms likely contributed to limited recruitment as virtual visits limited advertisement of the study and available information to patients. For participants that opted not to enroll following the initial phone call, it is possible that these participants were hesitant to participate in two separate interventions (rTMS and CBT-I), both of which are time-consuming and require multiple visits.

"TOWARDS AN EVIDENCE-BASED MULTIMODAL MENTAL HEALTH INTERVENTION FRAMEWORK FOR RURAL SOUTH AFRICAN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS","Higher education institutions of learning are entrusted with the important role of educating their nation, especially the youth. Amid the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, the traditional role of universities has been disrupted, and how long this disruption will last is uncertain. Considering this reality, we hypothesised that the psychological well-being of university community members has been negatively impacted. This study sought to establish the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and develop a contextually evidence- based psychological programme to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 on students. We adopted a convergent parallel mixed methods research (MMR) design and administered an online survey to all students in the university. In total, 313 students participated in the quantitative portion of the study, whereas 229 completed the qualitative part. The study revealed that students predominately experienced anxiety and depression. We also found that students exhibited feelings of isolation, boredom, loneliness and confined as a result of the change of routines. This caused the students to learn to adapt and cope with new ways of engaging with their studies. We therefore propose a customised COVID-19 mental health framework to be instituted and offered to students.","Mokwena, Jabu, Mphekgwana, Peter, Mabila, Thembinkosi, Makhado, Lufuno, Selepe, Mandu, Makgahlela, Mpsanyana, Mothiba, Tebogo","https://www.google.com/search?q=TOWARDS+AN+EVIDENCE-BASED+MULTIMODAL+MENTAL+HEALTH+INTERVENTION+FRAMEWORK+FOR+RURAL+SOUTH+AFRICAN+UNIVERSITY+STUDENTS","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: African Perspectives of Research in Teaching and Learning; 5:95-114, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25934,""
"Investigation of PTSD during the coronavirus epidemic","Aim: We investigated to understand post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during the coronavirus epidemic, and related influential factors. We hoped to provide more basis for targeted services to improve public psychological health care. Methods: From the psychological aid platform set up by the Wuhan Mental Health Center, we obtained online sample data of Chinese residents during the coronavirus epidemic. We used the PTSD examination scale as the study tool and analyzed the data with SPSS. Results: A total of 376 data was collected. The PTSD degree of the public was 45.93 +/- 17.32, the positive detection rate was 63.56%, and the PTSD level increased with fluctuation. Participants' gender, educational level, and location were the influential factors. Specifically, women, lower educational backgrounds, and people in Wuhan were more likely to have PTSD. Conclusions: The epidemic had a great impact on people's psychological status. Although the epidemic has basically been brought under control, PTSD levels have not declined. Therefore, it is necessary to provide timely psychological assistance for people in need, and help them adapt to life as soon as possible.

"Evolution of anxiety and depressive symptoms and their associated factors among employed workers in metropolitan France in 2020","Introduction - In France, social distancing measures of varying extents are in place since 17 March 2020 (date of the first lockdown) to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2. These measures have had different degrees of impact on working conditions. In consequence, new sources of risk for mental health may have emerged. This study aims to document the evolution of anxiety and depression among the employed working population and to identify the subgroups most affected by these mental health conditions. It constitutes a first step towards the development of targeted interventions. Methods - Data were obtained from Coviprev, a survey carried out on the general population. For each wave of the survey, an independent sample of 2,000 people aged 18 and over residing in metropolitan France was interviewed via the Internet. For the present study, only employed workers were selected (people working from or outside of home, on furlough or off work). This population represented 52-55% of the total sample depending on the wave concerned. The data presented here were gathered from the first wave (23-25 March 2020) to the 19th wave (14-16 December 2020). &gt; Alexandre Lesage et coll. Sant.. publique France, Saint-Maurice Sant.. publique France, Saint-Maurice BEH Covid-19 N.. 13 , 23 novembre 2021 , 3 Results - The prevalence of anxiety was 30.5% during the first wave. It then declined significantly until wave 3 (14-16 April) before stabilizing at relatively high levels. For depression, prevalence was 20.9% in wave 2. It showed a significant drop with the easing of lockdown measures, before increasing significantly again in October around the second lockdown. In terms of work organisation: for men, being off work was associated with an increased risk of presenting an anxiety vs working outside of home. For both men and women, working outside of home was associated with a lower risk of depression vs working from home, being on furlough or off work. Analysis by sector showed a higher risk of presenting anxiety among workers in the financial and insurance services and in the arts, entertainment and recreational industries. Conversely, this risk was lower for workers in human health and social services, public administration, and professional, scientific and technical services. The risk of depression was higher in education services and lower in human health and social work activities. Conclusions - Our results show that the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among the employed was consistently high in France throughout 2020. It appears that particular vigilance must be shown to certain population categories such as people on sick leave, women with dependent children and more globally to workers employed in the arts, entertainment and recreational industries and education services.","Lesage, A.; Chee, C.

"The effect of psilocybin on personality","As classic psychedelics are increasingly legalized and reintroduced into the psychotherapeutic frame, a deeper understanding of their effect on personality and overall wellbeing - as well as their clinical contraindications and potential pitfalls - will prove essential. As a result, this study represents a preliminary investigation into the effect of psilocybin exposure on a range of personality constructs.Methods: Data was collected through a collaboration with The Psychedelic Society, an organization that legally administers psilocybin in the Netherlands to self-selecting retreat attendees who have been screened for mental health disorders in accordance with Johnson et al.'s (2008) widely accepted safety guidelines. Participants completed the following measures via online questionnaire the day before psilocybin exposure, two days after psilocybin exposure, and at a one-month follow-up: Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), Experiences in Close Relationships-Revised (ECR-R), Mentalization Scale (MentS), Inventory of Personality Organization (IPO), Pathological Narcissism Inventory (PNI), Pro-Environmental Behavior (PEB) and the Ryff Scale of Psychological Well-Being (Ryff). As rigorous double-blind clinical studies have linked psychedelic-occasioned mystical experiences to sustained improvement in personality-related domains (Maclean et al., 2011;Griffiths et al., 2006;Griffiths et al., 2008, Griffiths et al., 2011), the Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ) was also administered. Lastly, participants provided self-report responses to open-ended questions regarding subjective experiences following psilocybin exposure. Results: Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, data collection was prematurely cut short, and only preliminary conclusions can be drawn. Those provisional conclusions include significantly improved overall symptomatology (BSI GSI), identity diffusion (IPO-ID) and reality testing (IPO-RT) following psilocybin exposure. Significant interactions were also identified for primitive defenses (IPO-PD) and narcissistic grandiosity (PNI-G), with the non-mystical experience group trending toward improvement, and the mystical-experience group remaining largely unchanged over time. Due to methodological constraints encountered, these findings remain preliminary. Nevertheless, the presence of multiple significant findings (however nascent) within the context of so few participants suggests the possibility of more robust findings in the context of a larger sample size.

"The curative power of happy science religious intervention (prayer) on COVID-19","Recent decades have seen a tremendous increase in scientific interest regarding the relationship between religion and health. In particular, and in regard to the impact of the Wuhan Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), the putative effectiveness of religious intervention on infectious diseases has received greater attention worldwide. Indeed, Hummer et al., (2010) analyzed data from a 16-year prospective study of a US representative sample of 20,139 cases, of whom 3,934 were identified as having died. People who attended religious services more than once a week exhibited less than half the risk of death due to infectious disease in the follow-up period compared with those who had never attended. Our research group has previously reported randomized clinical trials in which a group psychotherapy or prayer based on Happy Science-a religious movement founded by Master Ryuho Okawa in 1986 that has since grown into one of the most influential religious organizations in Japan-doctrine significantly reduces depressive symptoms, which robustly deteriorate a wide range of physical disorders. Moreover, Happy Science has recently published some clinical cases in which Happy Science prayers cured COVID-19. Thus, this article reviews previous reports showing the ameliorating effects of religious interventions on infectious diseases and suggests possible underlying mechanisms.

Objectives: Comment on aspects related to occupational health in health professionals in the context of the current epidemiological situation and provide recommendations for staff working in Cuban medical brigades in collaboration abroad. Material and method: A review of 25 updated bibliographies that included periodical publications of national and foreign authors indexed in different databases was carried out. Development: The pandemic exposes health professionals to psychosocial occupational risks. Some stressors during pandemic outbreaks have long-lasting effects. Recommendations have been published for the working population in order to preserve their mental health and in particular that of exposed personnel. Conclusions: Permanent access to updated scientific information from authorized and reliable sources, social support networks, obtaining self-help skills and professional advice are part of a set of psychosocial protective factors to enhance resources for coping with stress, preventing post-traumatic stress and the mental exhaustion of health personnel who work in Cuban medical missions in collaboration in different countries and who provide services to confirmed and/or suspected COVID-19 patients.","Arias, E.

"Overall and cause-specific hospitalisation and death after COVID-19 hospitalisation in England: A cohort study using linked primary care, secondary care, and death registration data in the OpenSAFELY platform","There is concern about medium to long-term adverse outcomes following acute Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), but little relevant evidence exists. We aimed to investigate whether risks of hospital admission and death, overall and by specific cause, are raised following discharge from a COVID-19 hospitalisation. With the approval of NHS-England, we conducted a cohort study, using linked primary care and hospital data in OpenSAFELY to compare risks of hospital admission and death, overall and by specific cause, between people discharged from COVID-19 hospitalisation (February to December 2020) and surviving at least 1 week, and (i) demographically matched controls from the 2019 general population; and (ii) people discharged from influenza hospitalisation in 2017 to 2019. We used Cox regression adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, obesity, smoking status, deprivation, and comorbidities considered potential risk factors for severe COVID-19 outcomes. We included 24,673 postdischarge COVID-19 patients, 123,362 general population controls, and 16,058 influenza controls, followed for Ã¢â€°Â¤315 days. COVID-19 patients had median age of 66 years, 13,733 (56%) were male, and 19,061 (77%) were of white ethnicity. Overall risk of hospitalisation or death (30,968 events) was higher in the COVID-19 group than general population controls (fully adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.22, 2.14 to 2.30, p &lt; 0.001) but slightly lower than the influenza group (aHR 0.95, 0.91 to 0.98, p = 0.004). All-cause mortality (7,439 events) was highest in the COVID-19 group (aHR 4.82, 4.48 to 5.19 versus general population controls [p &lt; 0.001] and 1.74, 1.61 to 1.88 versus influenza controls [p &lt; 0.001]). Risks for cause-specific outcomes were higher in COVID-19 survivors than in general population controls and largely similar or lower in COVID-19 compared with influenza patients. However, COVID-19 patients were more likely than influenza patients to be readmitted or die due to their initial infection or other lower respiratory tract infection (aHR 1.37, 1.22 to 1.54, p &lt; 0.001) and to experience mental health or cognitive-related admission or death (aHR 1.37, 1.02 to 1.84, p = 0.039); in particular, COVID-19 survivors with preexisting dementia had higher risk of dementia hospitalisation or death (age- and sex-adjusted HR 2.47, 1.37 to 4.44, p = 0.002). Limitations of our study were that reasons for hospitalisation or death may have been misclassified in some cases due to inconsistent use of codes, and we did not have data to distinguish COVID-19 variants. In this study, we observed that people discharged from a COVID-19 hospital admission had markedly higher risks for rehospitalisation and death than the general population, suggesting a substantial extra burden on healthcare. Most risks were similar to those observed after influenza hospitalisations, but COVID-19 patients had higher risks of all-cause mortality, readmission or death due to the initial infection, and dementia death, highlighting the importance of postdischarge monitoring.","Bhaskaran, Rentsch, Hickman, Hulme, Schultze, Curtis, Wing, Warren-Gash, Tomlinson, Bates, Mathur, MacKenna, Mahalingasivam, Wong, Walker, Morton, Grint, Mehrkar, Eggo, Inglesby, Douglas, McDonald, Cockburn, Williamson, Evans, Parry, Hester, Harper, Evans, Bacon, Smeeth, Goldacre","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1003871","20220125","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25943,""
"A Review of Sublingual Sufentanil Tablet (SST) and its Utility as an Analgesic Agent for Pain Procedures","Sedation for pain medicine procedures provides a unique challenge for proceduralists. Many patients dealing with pain are on chronic opioids and require higher doses of sedation for adequate procedural comfort. Chronic pain patients have various comorbidities including depression, neuropsychiatric disorders, peripheral vascular disease, and renal impairment, among others [1]. These confounding variables make the overall treatment of their pain condition much more challenging. For patients requiring intravenous (IV) sedation for their pain procedures, the constant need for access may render them a ""difficult stick"" over time. Another factor to consider is the increasing requirements by the hospital system needing IV sedatives and analgesics in the intensive care unit and operating rooms during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Sublingual sufentanil (SST) provides an excellent analgesic option for patients undergoing interventional pain procedures. The use of SST allows hospitals to preserve IV agents for more critical areas and mitigates the difficulty of obtaining IV access in patients.","Koushik, Schwartz, Cherkalin, Sankar, Shaparin, Viswanath","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11916-022-01014-0","20220125","Coronavirus (COVID-19); Interventional Pain Management; Intravenous Sedation; Sublingual Sufentanil (SST)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25944,""

The initiative included four Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles that resulted in implementing a standardized workflow for depression screening, collaborative efforts with health information technology to prompt providers to perform screening via the medical record, delivering educational materials for providers and clinic staff and conducting follow-up education. Between September 2020 and April 2021 there were 23,745 clinic encounters with adult patients that were analyzed to determine whether patients were up-to-date on depression screening following their visit. A multi-level logistic regression model was constructed to determine the changes in likelihood of a patient being up-to-date on screening over the study period, while controlling for patient demographics and comorbidities. The average proportion of up-to-date patients increased from 61.03% in September 2020 to 82.33% in April 2021. Patients aged 65+ and patients with comorbidities were more likely to be up-to-date on screening; patients with telemedicine visits had lower odds of being up-to-date on depression screening. Overall, this paper describes a feasible, effective intervention to increase depression screening in a primary care setting. Additionally, we discuss lessons learned and recommendations to inform the design of future interventions.","Blackstone, Sebring, Allen, Tan, Compton","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10900-022-01068-6","20220125","Depression screening; Family medicine; Primary care; Quality improvement","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25945,""
"The Impact of Wearable Technologies in Health Research: Scoping Review","Wearable devices hold great promise, particularly for data generation for cutting-edge health research, and their demand has risen substantially in recent years. However, there is a shortage of aggregated insights into how wearables have been used in health research. In this review, we aim to broadly overview and categorize the current research conducted with affordable wearable devices for health research. We performed a scoping review to understand the use of affordable, consumer-grade wearables for health research from a population health perspective using the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) framework. A total of 7499 articles were found in 4 medical databases (PubMed, Ovid, Web of Science, and CINAHL). Studies were eligible if they used noninvasive wearables: worn on the wrist, arm, hip, and chest; measured vital signs; and analyzed the collected data quantitatively. We excluded studies that did not use wearables for outcome assessment and prototype studies, devices that cost &gt;Ã¢â€šÂ¬500 (US $570), or obtrusive smart clothing. We included 179 studies using 189 wearable devices covering 10,835,733 participants. Most studies were observational (128/179, 71.5%), conducted in 2020 (56/179, 31.3%) and in North America (94/179, 52.5%), and 93% (10,104,217/10,835,733) of the participants were part of global health studies. The most popular wearables were fitness trackers (86/189, 45.5%) and accelerometer wearables, which primarily measure movement (49/189, 25.9%). Typical measurements included steps (95/179, 53.1%), heart rate (HR; 55/179, 30.7%), and sleep duration (51/179, 28.5%). Other devices measured blood pressure (3/179, 1.7%), skin temperature (3/179, 1.7%), oximetry (3/179, 1.7%), or respiratory rate (2/179, 1.1%). The wearables were mostly worn on the wrist (138/189, 73%) and cost &lt;Ã¢â€šÂ¬200 (US $228; 120/189, 63.5%). The aims and approaches of all 179 studies revealed six prominent uses for wearables, comprising correlations-wearable and other physiological data (40/179, 22.3%), method evaluations (with subgroups; 40/179, 22.3%), population-based research (31/179, 17.3%), experimental outcome assessment (30/179, 16.8%), prognostic forecasting (28/179, 15.6%), and explorative analysis of big data sets (10/179, 5.6%). The most frequent strengths of affordable wearables were validation, accuracy, and clinical certification (104/179, 58.1%). Wearables showed an increasingly diverse field of application such as COVID-19 prediction, fertility tracking, heat-related illness, drug effects, and psychological interventions; they also included underrepresented populations, such as individuals with rare diseases. There is a lack of research on wearable devices in low-resource contexts. Fueled by the COVID-19 pandemic, we see a shift toward more large-sized, web-based studies where wearables increased insights into the developing pandemic, including forecasting models and the effects of the pandemic. Some studies have indicated that big data extracted from wearables may potentially transform the understanding of population health dynamics and the ability to forecast health trends.","Huhn, Axt, Gunga, Maggioni, Munga, Obor, SiÃƒÂ©, Boudo, Bunker, Sauerborn, BÃƒÂ¤rnighausen, Barteit","https://doi.org/10.2196/34384","20220125","big data; commercially available wearables; consumer-grade wearables; fitness trackers; global health; low-resource setting; mHealth; mobile phone; population health; public health; research; review; tracker; wearable","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25946,""
"The Impact of Research Culture on Mental Health &amp; Diversity in STEM","The onset of COVID-19, coupled with the finer lens placed on systemic racial disparities within our society, has resulted in increased discussions around mental health. Despite this, mental health struggles in research are still often viewed as individual weaknesses and not the result of a larger dysfunctional research culture. Mental health interventions in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) academic community often focus on what individuals can do to improve their mental health instead of focusing on improving the research environment. In this paper, we present four aspects of research that may heavily impact mental health based on our experiences as research scientists: bullying and harassment; precarity of contracts; diversity, inclusion, and accessibility; and the competitive research landscape. Based on these aspects, we propose systemic changes that institutions must adopt to ensure their research culture is supportive and allows everyone to thrive.","Limas, Corcoran, Baker, Cartaya, Ayres","https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202102957","20220125","STEM; academia; diversity; mental health; precarity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25947,""
"Effectiveness of telemedicine psychoeducational interventions for adults with non-oncological chronic disease: A systematic review","To evaluate the effectiveness of telemedicine psychoeducational interventions (PIs) in adult patients on the clinical management of chronic non-oncological diseases compared with another therapeutic option or no treatment. Systematic review of randomized controlled trials. Six databases were searched between January 2011 and August 2021. A systematic review was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Study selection, quality appraisal and data extraction were conducted independently by two reviewers. A third arbiter was available if discrepancies. A total of 719 articles were reviewed and 17 studies met the inclusion and quality criteria. The included studies related to smoking, chronic pain, obesity and mental illness. Most interventions were based on cognitive behavioural theory. Most of the included studies (12/17, 70.5%) showed improvements in health and significant reductions in anxiety, pain and depression with variable effect sizes. Patients reported a high satisfaction rate and indicated lectures or self-report writings as helpful in their recovery compared with more interactive items. Only financial incentives demonstrated greater adherence. A specific intervention format or complementary professional support was not associated with health outcomes. Telemedicine PIs are a safe and effective option for the clinical management of adults with chronic diseases. Future longitudinal studies are needed to assess the impact of these interventions on chronic physical and mental disease, evaluating the quality of life, morbidity and mortality. The results reinforce the telemedicine PIs with effects on clinical management similar to those of the face-to-face modality and can be carried out in a safe environment for patients at a lower cost to the health system. These conditions make them suitable for comprehensive care in the epidemiological COVID-19 context with the highest safety conditions for the patients and professionals.","SÃƒÂ¡nchez-GutiÃƒÂ©rrez, Gil-GarcÃƒÂ­a, Rivera-Sequeiros, LÃƒÂ³pez-MillÃƒÂ¡n","https://doi.org/10.1111/jan.15151","20220125","chronic illness; clinical effectiveness; empowerment; health education; information technology; patient participation; psychosocial nursing; self-care; systematic reviews and meta-analyses; telenursing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25948,""

"Psychological distress and associated factors among hospital workers in Uganda during the COVID-19 lockdown - A multicentre study","To assess the prevalence of psychological distress (PD), and its associated demographic, psychosocial, hospital and health-related factors among hospital workers in Uganda during the COVID-19 related lockdown. An online cross-sectional study was conducted among three hundred ninety six participants recruited from eight hospitals and PD was assessed using the Kessler 6 distress scale from May to June 2020. PD was present in 92.7% of the participants with majority (78.3%) having mild to moderate PD whereas 14.4% had severe PD. Severe PD had statistically significant association with having financial liabilities (O.R = 3.69 (1.55-8.77), p = 0.003). However, ability to maintain contact with family members and friends (O.R = 0.43 (0.22-0.84), p value = 0.013), and having enough personal protective equipment and safety tools at work place (O.R = 0.44 (0.23-0.84), p value = 0.012) were protective against severe PD. having excessive worry about getting infected with COVID-19, conflicts within a home, segregation by friends or community, longer working hours or involvement in management of suspected or confirmed case were not associated with severe PD. The findings indicate the need to take into consideration the mental wellbeing of health workers during this COVID-19 outbreak. Whereas hospital workers continue to provide their services during the COVID-19 pandemic and related lockdown, it is important that they maintain contact with social support networks and be provided with counselling and mental health and psychosocial services in order to optimise their mental health during this pandemic.","Kirabira, Ben Forry, Ssebuufu, Akimana, Nakawuki, Anyayo, Mpamizo, Chan Onen, Ingabire, Gumisiriza, Waiswa, Mawanda, Ashaba, Kyamanywa","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e08807","20220125","COVID-19; Hospital workers; Lockdown; Psychological distress; Uganda","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25950,""
"Sentiment and Firm Behavior During the COVID-19 Pandemic","How did optimism or pessimism about the duration of shutdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic affect firms' business outlook and behavior? In a large panel of German firms, we identify sentiment as the only plausible determinant of the cross-sectional variation in the expected shutdown length because this variation is uncorrelated with fundamentals. Firms incorporate this sentiment regarding the shutdown duration in their more general business outlook. Sentiment was also an important determinant of firms' crisis response: More pessimistic firms-those that perceived the shutdown to last longer-were more likely to implement strong measures like layoffs or canceling investments. The implementation of soft measures, e.g., working from home, was unrelated to the sentiment regarding the shutdown length.","Buchheim, Dovern, Krolage, Link","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jebo.2022.01.011","20220125","COVID-19; Employment; Firm behavior; Investment; Sentiment; Shutdown","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25951,""
"Behavioral coping phenotypes and associated psychosocial outcomes of pregnant and postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic","The impact of COVID-19-related stress on perinatal women is of heightened public health concern given the established intergenerational impact of maternal stress-exposure on infants and fetuses. There is urgent need to characterize the coping styles associated with adverse psychosocial outcomes in perinatal women during the COVID-19 pandemic to help mitigate the potential for lasting sequelae on both mothers and infants. This study uses a data-driven approach to identify the patterns of behavioral coping strategies that associate with maternal psychosocial distress during the COVID-19 pandemic in a large multicenter sample of pregnant women (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2876) and postpartum women (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1536). Data was collected from 9 states across the United States from March to October 2020. Women reported behaviors they were engaging in to manage pandemic-related stress, symptoms of depression, anxiety and global psychological distress, as well as changes in energy levels, sleep quality and stress levels. Using latent profile analysis, we identified four behavioral phenotypes of coping strategies. Critically, phenotypes with high levels of passive coping strategies (increased screen time, social media, and intake of comfort foods) were associated with elevated symptoms of depression, anxiety, and global psychological distress, as well as worsening stress and energy levels, relative to other coping phenotypes. In contrast, phenotypes with high levels of active coping strategies (social support, and self-care) were associated with greater resiliency relative to other phenotypes. The identification of these widespread coping phenotypes reveals novel behavioral patterns associated with risk and resiliency to pandemic-related stress in perinatal women. These findings may contribute to early identification of women at risk for poor long-term outcomes and indicate malleable targets for interventions aimed at mitigating lasting sequelae on women and children during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Werchan, Hendrix, Ablow, Amstadter, Austin, Babineau, Anne Bogat, Cioffredi, Conradt, Crowell, Dumitriu, Fifer, Firestein, Gao, Gotlib, Graham, Gregory, Gustafsson, Havens, Howell, Humphreys, King, Kinser, Krans, Lenniger, Levendosky, Lonstein, Marcus, Monk, Moyer, Muzik, Nuttall, Potter, Salisbury, Shuffrey, Smith, Smith, Sullivan, Zhou, Thomason, Brito","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-05299-4","20220125","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25952,""
"Impact of COVID-19 restrictions on behavioural and psychological symptoms in home-dwelling people with dementia: a prospective cohort study (PANDEM)","To investigate the impact of the COVID-19 restrictions on behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). Prospective cohort study (PAN.DEM) nested within the halted parent trial (LIVE@Home.Path). Households in Norway immediate before and 6-9Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks into the COVID-19 restrictions. 104 dyads (persons with mild to moderate dementia aged Ã¢â€°Â¥65Ã¢â‚¬â€°and their informal carers) completed both prepandemic and pandemic assessments, among 237 in the parent trial. Mini-Mental Status Examination score 15-26 or Functional Assessment Staging score 3-7 covered dementia severity. Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-12) total (range 0-144), psychosis (range 0-24), hyperactive behaviour (range 0-60) and mood subsyndrome (range 0-48) scores; Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) total score (range 0-38). We found an overall increase in BPSD by NPI-12 total score comparing prepandemic to pandemic levels (median 16 IQR (4.5-29) to 20 (7-32.5), p=0.03) over a mean of 86 days (SD 19). NPI-12 total score worsened in 57 (55%) of people with dementia and was associated with postponed or averted contacts with healthcare professionals (logistic regression, OR 3.96, 95% CI 1.05 to 14.95). Psychosis subsyndrome levels increased (0 (0-3) to 0.5 (0-6), p=0.01) in 37 (36%) persons; this worsening was associated with partial insight (9.57, 1.14 to 80.71) and reduced informal carer contact (4.45, 1.01 to 19.71). Moreover, depressive symptoms increased as assessed by CSDD total score (5 (3-9) to 7 (4-12), p=0.01) and worsened for 56 (54%), which was inversely associated with psychotropic drugs on-demand (0.16, 0.03 to 0.75). BPSD worsened during the first months of the COVID-19 restrictions, most pronounced for psychosis and depression. These BPSD exacerbations have implications for pandemic policies, emphasising that restrictions must balance COVID-19 morbidity and mortality against dementia deterioration.

"Relationship between screen time among children and lower economic status during elementary school closures due to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic","This study aimed to examine whether the extended use of a variety of digital screen devices was associated with lower economic status and other environmental factors among Korean elementary school children and their caregivers during school closures precipitated by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A total of 217 caregivers of children 7-12Ã¢â‚¬â€°years of age from Suwon, Korea, were recruited and asked to respond to a self-administered questionnaire in June 2020. The questionnaire addressed demographic information and children's use of digital media, in addition to their caregivers. The t-test was used for continuous variables, and the Kruskal-Wallis test was used for variables measured on an interval scale. A multiple regression analyses were performed to examine the effects of significant correlative factors on screen time in children as predictors. Children with lower household incomes demonstrated a higher frequency and longer duration of smartphone and tablet personal computer use compared to those from higher income households. Children of households in which incomes decreased after COVID-19 used smartphones and tablet PCs more often and for longer durations. Children from households that experienced decreased income(s) after COVID-19 used personal computers more often and for a longer duration, and children from low-income families engaged in longer screen time on smartphones. A change in primary caregiver(s) may have increased children's screen time on smartphones.

The current study aimed to investigate associations between protective factors (state mindfulness, values and self-compassion) and risk factors (COVID-19 stress, worry and rumination) for mental health during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. 439 participants completed three online surveys during the 1st wave of the pandemic in the UK: Time 1 (April 1-5th 2020), Time 2 (April 15-19th April), Time 3 (May 13-17th 2020). Measures of wellbeing, burnout and life satisfaction. Psychological health outcome measures were found to be lower (worse) than normative comparison data during the early stages of the UK lockdown, while COVID-19 stress and worry reduced over time. Multilevel models found that higher levels of trait and state measures of psychological flexibility and self-compassion were associated with better psychological health across time points. Higher levels of COVID-19 stress, worry and rumination were also associated with poorer psychological health.

"Association between COVID-19 pandemic and the suicide rates in Nepal","Past works have linked the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent public health responses such as isolation, quarantine, and lockdown to increased anxiety, sleep disorders, depressive symptoms, and suicidal ideation. Only a few studies, mostly carried out in high-income countries, have investigated the association between the pandemic and suicide rate. We seek to investigate the changes in the monthly suicide rates during the COVID-19 pandemic in Nepal, compared to the pre-pandemic suicide rates. This is a retrospective study investigating the changes in suicide rates in Nepal during the COVID-19 pandemic period (April 2020 to June 2021), compared to the pre-pandemic period (July 2017 to March 2020), adjusted for seasonality and long-term trend in the suicide rate. We performed analysis for the entire country as well as sub-sample analyses stratified by gender and provinces. A total of 24350 suicides deaths during four years of the study window were analyzed. We found an overall increase in the monthly suicide rate in Nepal with an average increase of 0.28 (CI: 0.12,0.45) suicide per 100,000 during the pandemic months. The increase in suicide rate was significant both among males (increase in rate = 0.26, CI: 0.02,0.50) and females (increase in rate = 0.30, CI: 0.18,0.43). The most striking increments in suicide rates were observed in June, July, and August 2020. The pattern of increased suicide rates faded away early on among males, but the effect was sustained for a longer duration among females. Sudurpaschim and Karnali provinces had the highest increase in suicide rates associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with an increased suicide rate in Nepal. The findings may inform policymakers in designing appropriate public health responses to the pandemic that are considerate of the potential impact on mental health and suicide.","Acharya, Subedi, Acharya, Ghimire","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0262958","20220124","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25958,""
"Associations between anxiety and the willingness to be exposed to COVID-19 risk among French young adults during the first pandemic wave","The COVID-19 outbreak has generated significant uncertainty about the future, especially for young adults. Health and economic threats, as well as more diffuse concerns about the consequences of COVID-19, can trigger feelings of anxiety, leading individuals to adopt uncertainty-reducing behaviours. We tested whether anxiety was associated with an increase in willingness to be exposed to the risk of COVID-19 infection (WiRE) using an online survey administered to 3,110 French individuals aged between 18 and 35 years old during the first pandemic wave and lockdown period (April 2020). Overall, 56.5% of the sample declared a positive WiRE. A one standard deviation increase in psychological state anxiety raised the WiRE by +3.9 pp (95% CI [+1.6, 6.2]). Unemployment was associated with a higher WiRE (+8.2 percentage points (pp); 95% CI [+0.9, 15.4]).

"Polish medical students facing the pandemic-Assessment of resilience, well-being and burnout in the COVID-19 era","Recent reports indicate that COVID-19 pandemic has significant influence on medical professionals' mental health. Strict limitations in clinical practice and social interactions within academic community, which had to be introduced, could lead to significant psychological distress in medical students. The aim of the study was to assess resilience, well-being and burnout among Polish medical students in the COVID-19 era. The online survey consisting of validated questionnaires assessing resilience (Resilience Scale 14; RS-14), well-being (Medical Student Well-Being Index) and burnout (Maslach Burnout Inventory) as well as self-created survey concerning mental health problems, use of stimulants, SARS-CoV-2 infection, work in COVID-19 units, medical education and social attitude towards health care professionals in the pandemic era was distributed via Facebook and other online students' platforms. 1858 MSs from all polish medical schools agreed to fill in the survey. 'Very low', 'low' and 'on the low end' levels of resilience were found in 26%, 19.1% and 26.9% of the study group, respectively. Students with higher resilience level presented better attitude towards online and hybrid classes. 16.8% of respondents stated that they worked, currently work or plan to work voluntarily at the pandemic frontline. In terms of burnout, these respondents presented lower exhaustion (p = 0.003) and cynicism (p = 0.02), and higher academic efficacy (p = 0.002). That group also showed greater resilience (p = 0.046). The SARS-CoV-2 infection among respondents, their relatives and friends did not influence the results. 39.1% of respondents declared the need of the psychological or psychiatric consultation in relation to pandemic challenges. 231 (26.4%) participants previously diagnosed with mental health disorders noticed worsening of their symptoms. Increased intake of alcohol, cigarettes or other stimulants was noticed by 340 (28.6%) respondents. 80.2% of respondents thought that social aversion and mistrust towards doctors increased during the pandemic and part of them claimed it affected their enthusiasm toward medical career. The majority of medical students presented low levels of resilience and high burnout at the time of pandemic. Providing necessary support especially in terms of mental health and building up the resilience of this vulnerable group seems crucial to minimize harm of current pandemic and similar future challenges.","Forycka, PawÃ…â€šowicz-Szlarska, BurczyÃ…â€žska, Cegielska, Harendarz, Nowicki","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0261652","20220124","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25960,""
"Selective Changes in Medical Cannabis Use Early in the COVID-19 Pandemic: Findings from a Web-Based Sample of Adults in the United States","<b>Background:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic has had widespread impacts on mental health and substance use. While increases in nonmedical cannabis use during COVID-19 have been documented among people who use cannabis across a diversity of settings, changes in specific medical applications of cannabis during the COVID-19 pandemic have not been characterized. We sought to examine changes in the prevalence, frequency, and mode of use of medical cannabis for a range of commonly treated conditions and symptoms during COVID-19. <b>Methods:</b> Data were obtained from an online survey of a sample of adults in the United States who use cannabis (<i>n</i>=1886), administered in September 2020. This study was restricted to participants who self-reported past-year medical cannabis use (<i>n</i>=598). Using data reported in a retrospective (pre-COVID) and current assessment period, we examined changes in cannabis use prevalence, frequency, and inhalation as the primary mode of administration for 11 commonly treated conditions. <b>Results:</b> There were slight but statistically significant increases in weekly (from 21.4% to 23.4%) and daily (from 16.2% to 20.7%) self-reported medical cannabis use during COVID-19 (<i>p</i>&lt;0.001). Anxiety was the only specific therapeutic purpose for which daily cannabis use increased statistically significantly during COVID-19 (18.5% to 25.4%; <i>p</i>=0.004). In multivariable logistic regression, the odds of increasing cannabis use for anxiety during COVID-19 were statistically significantly higher for women, respondents from Western states, and states with legal medical and nonmedical cannabis. <b>Discussion:</b> We detected slight shifts toward higher frequencies of medical cannabis use during COVID-19. Disaggregated by therapeutic indication, daily cannabis use to manage anxiety increased during the pandemic. There is a need to assess whether changes in cannabis use that coincided with the pandemic will be sustained over time, and how these changes are connected to mental health outcomes, particularly among women.","Lake, Assaf, Gorbach, Cooper","https://doi.org/10.1089/can.2021.0115","20220124","COVID-19; United States; anxiety; cannabis; medical cannabis; survey","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25961,""
"Weathering the economic storm together: Family identification predicts future well-being during COVID-19 via enhanced financial resilience","The economic crisis precipitated by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has placed considerable financial pressures on households across the world. These are compounded by the enforced isolation accompanying pandemic restrictions, during which individuals can struggle to access external assistance and often need to rely heavily on the social, emotional, and financial support of other family members. Previous research indicates that family financial stress has negative consequences for the mental health and well-being of members, but that heightened family identification can provide individuals with a stronger sense of collective financial resilience. In the present study, an online longitudinal survey of U.K. residents (<i>N</i> = 172) shows that, in summer 2020, the positive relationship between individuals' family identification and their well-being 1 month later was mediated by levels of perceived family financial efficacy and financial stress. These findings build upon existing evidence of the pivotal role of the family in financial well-being and suggest that supporting family units to cope with shared financial challenges may have psychological benefits over and above supporting individual family members.

"Psychosocial Stressors and Coping Strategies Among African Americans During Early Stages of the COVID-19 Pandemic: a Qualitative Study","The disproportionate impact of coronavirus (COVID-19) on African Americans along with associated inequities in social determinants of health (SDOH) and racism increase their vulnerability to the psychosocial impact of COVID-19. This qualitative study applied the socio-ecological model (SEM) to explore psychosocial stressors, coping styles, and needs to improve psychosocial health among unique subgroups of African Americans in early pandemic stages. Sixty-two African Americans (16 parents, 15 young adults, 16 essential workers, and 15 individuals with underlying medical conditions) participated in qualitative, semi-structured interviews between May and September 2020. Interview data were analyzed based on the SEM using thematic analysis. The majority (84%) reported being stressed with parents having the highest level. Four themes emerged : (1) our COVID-19 pandemic state of mind, (2) top stressors in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, (3) coping strategies during COVID-19, and (4) needs during the COVID-19 pandemic to reduce stress. While there were similarities, different stressors were experienced among subgroups, which yielded different coping styles and needs from stakeholders across multi-levels to improve their psychosocial health. Findings suggest current and future pandemic response plans need targeted strategies across multiple levels of influence to address the psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on African Americans.","Gillyard, Davis, Parham, Moss, Barre, Alexander, Cunningham-Erves","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40615-022-01229-2","20220124","African Americans; COVID-19; Coping style; Mental health; Psychosocial distress; Public health emergency","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25963,""
"Mental Health and COVID-19 Pandemic Stressors Among Latina/o/x College Students with Varying Self and Parental Immigration Status","The COVID-19 pandemic has produced significant psychological distress for college students due to the sudden proliferation of stressors. We examine whether and how self and parental immigration status contributes to Latina/o/x college students' mental health and pandemic stressors during the initial months of the pandemic. We draw on quantitative and qualitative survey data collected in March-June 2020 with 1,600 Latina/o/x University of California undergraduate students from three self-identified groups: undocumented students, US citizens with at least one undocumented parent, and US citizens with lawfully present parents. Quantitative analyses reveal that the pandemic produced widespread negative mental health effects but the severity of these effects did not differ by self/parental immigration status. Our qualitative analyses identify common pandemic-related stressors across our three student groups (financial insecurity, COVID-19 virus concerns, academic strains, and social dynamics); however, undocumented students and US citizens with undocumented parents identify unique aspects of these stressors due to legal vulnerabilities. Self and parental undocumented status also compromises the ability to manage common pandemic stressors because of immigration status-related exclusion from necessary resources. Ultimately, we argue that the high-stress nature of the pandemic elevated mental distress across all student groups, but the structural exclusion of undocumented immigrants contributes to unique experiences of stress among Latina/o/x undocumented students and US citizen students with undocumented parents.","Enriquez, Morales, Rodriguez, Chavarria, Ro","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40615-021-01218-x","20220124","COVID-19; College students; Immigration status; Latina/o/x; Mental health; Stressors; Undocumented","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25964,""

"Clinical Outcomes Among Patients With 1-Year Survival Following Intensive Care Unit Treatment for COVID-19","One-year outcomes in patients who have had COVID-19 and who received treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU) are unknown. To assess the occurrence of physical, mental, and cognitive symptoms among patients with COVID-19 at 1 year after ICU treatment. An exploratory prospective multicenter cohort study conducted in ICUs of 11 Dutch hospitals. Patients (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°452) with COVID-19, aged 16 years and older, and alive after hospital discharge following admission to 1 of the 11 ICUs during the first COVID-19 surge (March 1, 2020, until July 1, 2020) were eligible for inclusion. Patients were followed up for 1 year, and the date of final follow-up was June 16, 2021. Patients with COVID-19 who received ICU treatment and survived 1 year after ICU admission. The main outcomes were self-reported occurrence of physical symptoms (frailty [Clinical Frailty Scale score Ã¢â€°Â¥5], fatigue [Checklist Individual Strength-fatigue subscale score Ã¢â€°Â¥27], physical problems), mental symptoms (anxiety [Hospital Anxiety and Depression {HADS} subscale score Ã¢â€°Â¥8], depression [HADS subscale score Ã¢â€°Â¥8], posttraumatic stress disorder [mean Impact of Event Scale score Ã¢â€°Â¥1.75]), and cognitive symptoms (Cognitive Failure Questionnaire-14 score Ã¢â€°Â¥43) 1 year after ICU treatment and measured with validated questionnaires. Of the 452 eligible patients, 301 (66.8%) patients could be included, and 246 (81.5%) patients (mean [SD] age, 61.2 [9.3] years; 176 men [71.5%]; median ICU stay, 18 days [IQR, 11 to 32]) completed the 1-year follow-up questionnaires.

"Sex-dependent differences in stress-induced depression in Wistar rats are accompanied predominantly by changes in phosphatidylcholines and sphingomyelins","With a high annual and lifetime prevalence, depression is becoming the leading contributor to the global disease burden. During the COVID-19 crisis, the depression and mood disorders accelerated significantly. Despite the growing evidence, the precise underlying mechanisms of depression disorders (DD) remain unknown. When studying DD in humans, there are many uncontrollable factors such as medication history, age of the patient or living conditions. In this regard, animal models provide an essential step for examining neural circuitry or molecular and cellular pathways in a controlled environment. As far as we know, women have a consistently higher prevalence of DD than men. Thus, the aim of our study was to evaluate sex-related changes in blood metabolites in a model of stress-induced depression in Wistar rats. Pregnant females were stressed using restriction of mobility in the final week of the pregnancy three times a day for 45 minutes each, three following days. After the birth, the progeny aged 60 days was stressed repeatedly. The perturbation in overall energy metabolism as well as in lipid metabolism was found. While in males, phosphatidylcholines (the most phosphatidylcholine with acyl-alkyl residue sum C40:4 - PC ae C40:4), sphingomyelins, and acylcarnitines were changed, in females, lipid metabolism perturbation was seen with the most critical alteration in hydroxysphingomyelin with acyl residue sum C16:1 (SM OH C16:1). Our results confirm that the animal model may be used further in the research of depression. Our results may provide an essential insight into the sex-dependent pathogenesis of depression and contribute to the search for effective treatment and prevention of depression with respect to sex.","Leskanicova, Babincak, Mochnacky, Pipova Kokosova, Kukelova, Urbanska, Kolesarova, Macekova, Kostolny, Kiskova","https://doi.org/10.26402/jpp.2021.4.14","20220125","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25967,""
"The Beneficial Effect of the First COVID-19 Lockdown on Undergraduate Students of Education: A Prospective Cohort Study","The COVID-19 pandemic has been spreading consistently since the beginning of 2020. On February 27th, the first patient with the Coronavirus was diagnosed in Israel. On March 14th,2020 the Israeli government declared a general lockdown that lasted about a month, which altered the lives of the entire population. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the change in well-being, physical activity, and sleep quality of undergraduate students of Education at two time points: before (November 2019) and during (April 2020) the first COVID-19 lockdown. 533 undergraduate students of Education submitted an online questionnaire before the lockdown and at its end. The questionnaire comprised four parts: a sociodemographic and exercise questionnaire taken from the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form, sleep quality, rated using the Mini Sleep Questionnaire, and well-being, rated using the short version of the mental health inventory. This is a pre-post prospective cohort questionnaire study. It was predicted that there would be a decrease in the aforementioned parameters. Contrary to all expectations, an increase was observed in all three. Results show that during the lockdown, there was an increase in the level of exercise students engaged in. 61.4% of the students engaged in a greater amount of physical activity during the COVID-19 lockdown, compared to 40.9% of the students who engaged in a greater amount of physical activity before COVID-19. Levels of sleep quality (mean 5.34, SD 0.92 vs. mean 5.12, SD 0.46 P =.015) and well-being (mean 3.79, SD 0.62 vs. mean 3.67, SD 0.59 P =.022) were also higher during the COVID-19 lockdown. These findings indicate that undergraduate students seem to have taken advantage of the change in lifestyle due to the lockdown, directing the free time towards improving health by engaging in more physical activity, thus improving sleep quality and well-being.","Joseph, Schori","https://doi.org/10.2196/27286","20220124","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25968,""
"Psychometric evaluation of a Fear of COVID-19 scale in China: Cross-sectional Study","At the very beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, information about fear of COVID-19 was very limited in Chinese populations and there was no standardised and validated scale to measure the fear associated with the pandemic. This cross-sectional study aimed to adapt and validate a fear scale to determine the levels of fear of COVID-19 among the general population in mainland China and Hong Kong. An online questionnaire platform was developed for data collection; the study instruments were an adapted version of the eight-item Breast Cancer Fear Scale ('the Fear Scale') and the four-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4). The internal construct validity, convergent validity, known-group validity, and reliability of the adapted Fear Scale were assessed, and descriptive statistics were used to summarise the participants' fear levels. A total of 2,822 study participants aged 18 or older were included in the analysis. The reliability of the adapted scale was satisfactory, with a Cronbach's ÃŽÂ± coefficient of 0.93.The item-total correlations corrected for overlap were &gt;0.4, confirming its internal construct validity. Regarding convergent validity, a small to moderate correlation between the Fear Scale and the PHQ-4 scores was found. Regarding known-group validity, we found that study participants who were recruited from Hong Kong had a higher level of fear than the study participants from mainland China. Older adults had a higher level of fear than the younger adults. Furthermore, having hypertension, liver diseases, heart diseases, cancer, anxiety and insomnia were associated with a higher fear level. The descriptive analysis found that more than 40% of the study participants reported that the thought of COVID-19 scared them. About one-third of the study participants reported that when they thought about COVID-19, they felt nervous, uneasy and depressed. To conclude, the psychometric properties of the adapted Fear Scale is acceptable to measure the fear of COVID-19 among Chinese people. Our study stresses the need for more psychosocial support and care to help this population cope with their fears during the pandemic.","Choi, Duan, Fong, Lok, Ho, Wong, Lin","https://doi.org/10.2196/31992","20220124","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25969,""
"Our Post-Zoom Reflection: Turning Off the Monitor","Over a year ago, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in lockdowns and isolation, quickly shifting social interactions online.

A recent survey study was then conducted analyzing the mental health and self-image of people as they returned to in-person activities. Increased time spent online and use of filters, which provoked unrealistic expectations, correlated with worsening anxiety and worsening self-perception, especially in respondents under the age of 24 years. A large percentage of this cohort also planned to invest in their appearance to cope with this anxiety. After a year of being behind the screen, with the ability to enhance features with the click of a button, individuals are concerned about their appearance and their ability to return to a life in-person.

"Expectations of pregnant women for antenatal care services and factors affecting anxiety severity during the COVID-19 pandemic","We aimed to evaluate the difficulties pregnant women encountered while receiving health care, their demands for antenatal care, and their mental state during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 447 pregnant women were included in this cross-sectional study. The data were collected through a face-to-face questionnaire, which assessed participants' demographic, individual, and obstetric characteristics, their opinions regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, expectations from their antenatal care services, and their Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) scores. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it was determined that 17.2% of the pregnant women participating in our study could not go to antenatal follow-ups and almost half (45.9%) demanded that their follow-ups be reduced due to the risk of coronavirus transmission. The BAI scores were found to be significantly higher in participants with low-income levels, chronic diseases, those in the third trimester, those with high-risk pregnancy either previous or current, and those who got pregnant unintentionally. Young age, unintentional conception, advanced pregnancy week, previous high-risk pregnancy, and failure to receive regular antenatal care were independent variables that predicted moderate-severe anxiety in logistic regression analysis. In order to minimize the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of pregnant women, it is important to develop support programs that contribute to the well-being of the mother and fetus by recognizing the pregnant women at risk in the antenatal period.","Kumru, Merih, Ãƒâ€“zdemir, Akalin, Cogendez","https://doi.org/10.5603/GP.a2021.0179","20220124","Beck Anxiety Inventory; COVID-19; antenatal care; anxiety; coronavirus; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25971,""
"Pregnancy and childbirth during the coronavirus pandemic The cross-sectional study of 1321 participants in Poland","The impact of infection with novel coronavirus - SARS-CoV-2 - on women's and fetus' was unclear; therefore, it was the reason for many worries.

We designed an original 23-question survey aimed at women who were pregnant during the pandemic or who gave birth at that time. The survey included demographic data, questions about prenatal care, mental status and worries, and hospitalisation. Our study included 1321 women: 1010 (76.5%) during pregnancy and 311 (23.5%) after the delivery in the studied time. For 1168 (88,4%) respondents, the pandemic had a negative impact on their mood. The three main concerns were: the need for isolation from the child (n = 498, 37.7%), the childbirth without a partner/trusted companion (n = 417, 31.6%) and the risk of infection of the child in hospital (n = 381, 28.8%). The novel coronavirus pandemic affects the mental health of pregnant women. Pregnant patients should be considered a group of particular concerns. Patients consider remote obstetrical consultations as an insufficient approach. The reason for the highest worries of pregnant patients is a lack of companionship during labour.

One cohort that has received less attention, but who may be more vulnerable to the mental and physical health related impacts of COVID-19 restrictions are postpartum mothers. The aim of this study was to explore the mental health, well-being, and health behaviours of mothers up to 12 months postpartum whilst living in Australia under COVID-19 level 3 and 4 restrictions. <b>Methods:</b> 351 women in their first year postpartum residing in Australia whilst under level 3/4 social distancing restrictions (during April 13 and June 11, 2020) were recruited to participate in an online questionnaire. The survey measured symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress (DASS), wellness (SF-36), physical activity (Godin-Shephard score), perceived value of health outcomes, diet, and sleep. Descriptive statistics and linear regressions were performed. <b>Results:</b> Data was analysed for 139 eligible women. Of these women, 74% scored ""normal"" for depression, 84% for anxiety, and 72% for stress. Over half (58%) of women reported being worn out all, most, or a good bit of the time and 77% reported being a happy person all, most, or a good bit of the time. Analysis of the perceived values of health outcome revealed women had high value for ""<i>getting out of the house,"" ""achieving a better overall mood,""</i> and ""<i>to feel better physically</i>."" Women were considered physically active according to the Godin Leisure score, however only 41% of women met the current Australian national physical activity guidelines of 150 min.week<sup>-1</sup>. <b>Conclusions:</b> Overall the majority of postpartum mums that were surveyed, have normal mental health symptoms, and despite being worn out most are happy at least a good bit of the time. This study highlights the importance of health values in maintaining leisure physical activity and mental health. In addition it appears women may benefit from virtual group exercise and community programs to encourage being physically active and socialising with friends simultaneously.","Christie, Beetham, Stratton, Francois","https://doi.org/10.3389/fgwh.2021.793602","20220125","depression; exercise; isolation; maternal; mood; pandemic; physical activity; post-pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25973,""
"Prosocial and Positive Health Behaviors During a Period of Chronic Stress Protect Socioemotional Well-Being","Behavior that helps, supports, or protects others-or prosocial behavior-has emerged as a health-relevant behavior that can promote the giver's well-being, yet whether prosocial behavior protects against the effects of a major, ongoing chronic stressor warrants further examination. Thus, in the context of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, we examined whether two types of behaviors-those enacted to prevent the spread of disease to the self and others (positive health behaviors) and those enacted to promote others' psychological and financial well-being (prosocial behaviors)-might protect well-being over time. Using a longitudinal survey method, 745 participants (<i>M</i> <sub>age</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°62.87Ã‚Â years) reported their engagement in positive health behaviors, prosocial behaviors, and socioemotional well-being (depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, loneliness) approximately two months into mandated lockdown orders in the USA. Three months later, participants again reported their well-being. Results showed that greater self-reported positive health behaviors (e.g., wearing a facemask, distancing from others) was related to decreased depressive symptoms over time, whereas greater self-reported prosocial behaviors (e.g., donating time or money, thanking an essential worker) was related to decreased loneliness over time. Neither behavior was related to anxiety symptoms. Together, results suggest that both doing things for the benefit of others and engaging in positive health behaviors protects well-being, even during times of chronic stress. Findings are however limited by the use of self-report measures. Future research should use experimental and behavioral approaches beyond self-report to verify findings.

"Serum levels of vitamin D and immune system function in patients with COVID-19 admitted to intensive care unit","Vitamin D is believed to affect the functionality of the immune system for the prevention of coronavirus disease. To investigate the role of this vitamin against the Coronavirus, this study analyzed the serum levels of vitamin D, the transcription pattern of inflammatory cytokines, and the frequency of total lymphocytes, TCD4<sup>+</sup>, TCD8<sup>+</sup>, and NK cells in 50 COVID-19-affected subjects in comparison to 50 healthy participants. This study diagnosed and evaluated 100 patients. Frequency of lymphocytes was determined using flow cytometry. Cytokine expression levels were measured using Real-Time PCR. Serum levels of vitamin D and cytokines levels in cultured cell supernatant were measured by ELISA. Patients with COVID-19 exhibited decreased serum levels of vitamin D versus the healthy participants (<i>p</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.0024). The total number of lymphocytes, TCD4<sup>+</sup>, TCD8<sup>+</sup>, and NK cells was significantly reduced in patients with COVID-19 (<i>p</i>Ã‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.0001). Considerable upregulation of IL-12, IFN-ÃŽÂ³, and TNF-ÃŽÂ± was seen in COVID-19 patients compared to the control group, whereas IFN-ÃŽÂ± was downregulated in COVID-19 patients. ELISA results also had increased levels of IL-12, TNF-ÃŽÂ±, and IFN-ÃŽÂ³ (<i>p</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.0014, 0.0012, and <i>p</i>Ã‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.0001, respectively), and decreased level of IFN-ÃŽÂ± (<i>p</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.0021) in patients with COVID-19 compared to the control group. These findings suggest a probable association among vitamin D concentrations, immune system function, and risk of COVID-19 infection. As a result, it is recommended that vitamin D be considered as a candidate for handling and controlling COVID-19 because of its ability to target the cytokine storm and its antiviral effects.","Soltani-Zangbar, Mahmoodpoor, Dolati, Shamekh, Valizadeh, Yousefi, Sanaie","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.genrep.2022.101509","20220125","ACE2, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; ARDS, Acute respiratory distress syndrome; COVID-19; Cytokines; ELISA, Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; IFN-ÃŽÂ³, Interferon gamma; Immune Response; Lymphocytes; PBMCs, Peripheral blood mononuclear cells; SARS Coronavirus; TNF-ÃŽÂ±, Tumor necrosis factor-alpha; Vitamin D","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25975,""
"Reflections on the Concomitants of the Restrictive Visitation Policy During the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Ubuntu Perspective","Caregiving is a prominent concept in the Ubuntu philosophy, and caring and visitation of the sick is regarded as an example of Ubuntu. The restrictive visitation policy adopted in the hospitals during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic affected the exhibition of this concept among patients, nurses, and families. The narrative inquiry was used to explore the reflections of the participants on the impact caused by the non-visitation policy experienced during the first and second waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa. The narrative inquiry approach allowed the participants to tell their story as it is unique to them. The study used purposive sampling technique to select five participants for the webinar. Three themes emerged from the narrated stories which are 1) moral anguish of the caregivers; 2) mental health instability, and 3) erosion of trust in health care practitioners (HCPs). The non-visitation hospital policy was intended to reduce the danger of spreading COVID-19 within and outside the hospital; however, the care provided was devoid of the values of Ubuntu such as mutual respect, relational, responsibility, reciprocity, and interconnectedness. In retrospect, a case-by-case application of the policy would reduce the non-desirable effect of the policy on the patients, nurses, and patients' family members.","Mulaudzi, Anokwuru, Du-Plessis, Lebese","https://doi.org/10.3389/fsoc.2021.769199","20220125","COVID-19; Ubuntu perspective; caregiving; reflections; restrictive visitation policy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25976,""
"COVID-19-Related Psychological Trauma and Psychological Distress Among Community-Dwelling Psychiatric Patients: People Struck by Depression and Sleep Disorders Endure the Greatest Burden","COVID-19 has created a general state of worry and distress, especially among vulnerable groups such as those with psychiatric diagnoses. Worldwide, psychiatric care provision has drastically suffered during the pandemic, with many patients unable to access proper care, which may have implications for increased mental health consequences in patients with psychiatric disorders (e.g., relapse and suicide). This cross-sectional study used structural equation modeling to investigate COVID-19-related trauma and distress among Arab psychiatric population during COVID-19 quarantine. Patients with pre-existing psychiatric disorders (<i>N</i> = 168) completed an online survey that comprised the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 21 (DASS-21), the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and a questionnaire on COVID-19-related attitudes/perceptions, sources of information, used protective measures, and socio-demographic information. Respondents commonly reported feeling down-hearted/blue, trouble concentrating, along with symptoms of avoidance and rumination related to the pandemic. Patients with depression and sleep disorders expressed higher COVID-19-related trauma than patients with other disorders. Perceived physical health mediated the effect of co-morbid chronic physical disorders on COVID-19 trauma, psychological distress, perceived vulnerability to COVID-19, and perceived likelihood of recovery in case of contracting COVID-19. Perceived physical health and perceived vulnerability to COVID-19 were strong direct predictors of COVID-19-related trauma and psychological distress. Staying at home negatively predicted COVID-19 trauma and exerted an indirect negative effect on psychological distress via COVID-19 trauma. COVID-19 trauma, age, and marital status directly predicted psychological distress, with COVID-19 trauma being the strongest predictor. Educational level, income, having family members working in the medical field, keeping up to date with the news on deaths/infected cases or the development of COVID-19 drugs or vaccines, satisfaction with available information on COVID-19, and using different protective measures were not associated with significant differences in COVID-19 trauma and psychological distress scores. Immuno-psychiatric interventions should be designed to target COVID-19-trauma and distress among younger single patients with perceived poor physical health, especially those diagnosed with depression and sleep disorders.","Ali, Alkhamees, Abd Elhay, Taha, Hendawy","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.799812","20220125","Arabic/Arab/Saudi Arabia; age/unemployment/single/marital status; coronavirus disease 2019/COVID-19; major depression disorder/sleep disorders; psychiatric disorders/co-morbid physical disorders; psychological distress; psychological trauma; stay-at-home","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25977,""
"Factors associated with prolonged length of hospital stay among COVID-19 cases admitted to the largest treatment center in Eastern Ethiopia","The hospital admissions load and how long each patient will stay in the hospital should be known to prevent the overwhelming of the health system during coronavirus disease 2019 era. Even though the length of hospital stay could vary due to different factors, the factors that affect the stay are not well characterized yet, particularly in the resource-limited settings. Knowing the time spent by the coronavirus disease 2019 patients in the hospital and its associated factors are important to prioritize mobilizing resources, such as beds, pharmacological and non-pharmacological supplies, and health personnel. Therefore, this study was intended to determine the median and identify factors associated with the length of hospital stay among coronavirus disease 2019 cases. A facility-based cross-sectional study design was implemented on 394 randomly selected hospitalized patients. Epidata Version 3.1 software was used for data entry, and further analysis was done using Stata version 14.2 software. Frequencies, median with interquartile range, and chi-square test were performed. A logistic regression model was used to identify the association between outcome and explanatory variables. The statistical significance was declared at <i>p</i>-value of less than 0.05 at 95% confidence interval. The analysis was done for a total of 394 cases admitted for coronavirus disease 2019. The median age of the study participants was 40Ã¢â‚¬â€°years with interquartile range of 28-60Ã¢â‚¬â€°years. The median length of hospital stay was 12Ã¢â‚¬â€°days with the interquartile range of 8-17Ã¢â‚¬â€°days. The patients presented with shortness of breathing (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.74, 95% confidence interval: 1.33-5.66), incident organ failure (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.65, 95% confidence interval: 1.15-11.58), increased leukocyte count (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.95; 95% confidence interval: 0.91-0.99), and blood urea nitrogen (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.98, 95% confidence interval: 0.97-0.99) had a significant association with prolonged hospital stay. This study demonstrated that the proportion of patients stayed above the median hospital stay of the total patients was 185 (46.9%) with the median length of 12 (interquartile rangeÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°8-17)Ã¢â‚¬â€°days. Patients presented with difficulty of breathing, had incident organ failure, had decreased leukocyte, and blood urea nitrogen level should be estimated to stay longer in the hospital. Hence, patients with prolonged hospital length of stay associating factors should be expected to consume more pharmacological and non-pharmacological resources during hospital care receiving.","Birhanu, Merga, Ayana, Alemu, Negash, Dessie","https://doi.org/10.1177/20503121211070366","20220125","Ethiopia; Hospital length of stay; SARS-CoV-2; coronavirus; factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25978,""
"Nurses' Physical and Psychological Symptoms During the first COVID-19 Lockdown in Italy: a Nationwide Cross-Sectional Study in Stem Cell Transplantation Setting","Northern Italy was one of the first European territories to deal with the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. Drastic emergency restrictions were introduced to contain the spread and limit pressure on healthcare facilities. However, nurses were at high risk of developing physical, mental, and working issues due to professional exposure. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate these issues among nurses working in Italian hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) centers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected online immediately after the first ""lockdown"" period in order to investigate the prevalence of physical issues, sleep disorders, and burnout symptoms and explore correlations with COVID-19 territorial incidence in Northern Italian regions versus Central and Southern Italian regions. Three hundred and eight nurses working in 61 Italian HSCT Units responded to the survey. Depression, cough, and fever were more frequently reported by nurses working in geographical areas less affected by the pandemic (p=0.0013, p&lt;0.0001, and p=0.0005 respectively) as well as worst sleep quality (p=0.008). Moderate levels of emotional exhaustion (meanÃ‚Â±SD -17.4Ã‚Â±13.0), depersonalization (5.3Ã‚Â±6.1), and personal accomplishment (33.2Ã‚Â±10.7) were reported without significant differences between territories. different COVID-19 incidence among territories did not influence nurses' burden of symptoms in the HSCT setting.

"Impact of mandatory social isolation measures due to the COVID-19 pandemic on the subjective well-being of Latin American and Caribbean dentists","With the spread of the COVID-19 virus, containment measures such as home confinement were implemented, generating stress, anxiety, depression and aggravation of pre-existing diseases in the population, including dentists, who have also been affected due to the risk involved in practicing their profession. Objective: To determine the impact of mandatory social isolation measures on the subjective well-being of Latin American and Caribbean dentists during the community quarantine due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. A Cross-sectional study in a sample of 1195 dentists from 21 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. The main outcome was Subjective Well-Being, evaluated through the World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5). In addition, sociodemographic characteristics, variables related to the community quarantine due to the COVID-19 pandemic and health variables were considered. A descriptive, bivariate and multivariate (multiple linear regression) analysis was performed to observe the behavior of the variables. A multiple linear regression analysis was performed, where all the variables included within dimensions, were distributed in a single model, observing an R2% of 9.000 (<i>p</i>&lt;0.001), where the R2% change was significant (<i>p</i>&lt;0.001) and a constant of 44.190; likewise, within this model, the variable follow-up of preventive measures against COVID-19 reported an unstandardized regression coefficient (b) of 2. 316 (95%CI:1.133-3.499;<i>p</i>&lt;0.001), the self-perceived level of concern against COVID-19 obtained a (b) of -5.470 (95%CI:-7.509--3.430; <i>p</i>&lt;0.001), the biological sex variable manifested a (b) of -5.417 (95%CI: - 1.157-1.910; <i>p</i>&lt;0.001); finally, the level of economic income during compulsory social isolation presented a (b)=5.354 (CI95%:3.461- 7.247; <i>p</i>&lt;0.001). An association was found between subjective well-being and variables related to the social impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as following preventive measures, concern about the pandemic and economic factors (decrease in income level), in addition to biologic sex.

"Impact of Postgraduate Student Internships During the COVID-19 Pandemic in China","To understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on postgraduate students' internships in China, 911 students from different regions of China were surveyed through online questionnaires. Among the postgraduate students surveyed, 48.51% of which believed that the pandemic had its greatest impact on colleagues interaction, and 59.60% believed that the pandemic had a strong impact on practical skills. In total, 31.8% of postgraduate internship programs were impacted by COVID-19. The proportions of respondents having severe, moderate, and mild anxiety levels were 1.42%, 4.72%, and 15.92%, respectively; and the rates of severe, moderate, and mild depression were 1.64%, 10.86%, and 21.84%, respectively. ANOVA found that major, degree type, and degree of impact of the pandemic on colleague interactions and improved practical abilities all affected postgraduate mental health. The findings suggest that the mental health of postgraduate students should be monitored during a pandemic, and targeted psychological counseling should be offered. Postgraduate internships should be emphasized as to ensure a smooth internship process during a pandemic period. Psychological counseling and assistance should be provided to those whose internships were affected by the pandemic, and programs should be set up to aid postgraduate students in adapting to the new internship and employment conditions brought on by the ""new normal"" of pandemic prevention and control.","Zhang, Lu, Kang, Quan","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.790640","20220125","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; internship; postgraduate student","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25981,""
"Psychodynamic Therapist's Subjective Experiences With Remote Psychotherapy During the COVID-19-Pandemic-A Qualitative Study With Therapists Practicing Guided Affective Imagery, Hypnosis and Autogenous Relaxation","The COVID-19-pandemic brought massive changes in the provision of psychotherapy. To contain the pandemic, many therapists switched from face-to-face sessions in personal contact to remote settings. This study focused on psychodynamic therapists practicing Guided Affective Imagery, Hypnosis and Autogenous Relaxation and their subjective experiences with psychotherapy via telephone and videoconferencing during the first COVID-19 related lockdown period in March 2020 in Austria. An online survey completed by 161 therapists produced both quantitative and qualitative data with the latter being subject to a qualitative content analysis. Our research suggests that telephone and videoconferencing are considered valuable treatment formats to deliver psychodynamic psychotherapy. However, therapists' experiences with remote psychotherapy are multifaceted and ambiguous. In particular, the findings raise questions concerning the maintenance of the therapeutic alliance, the development of the analytic process, the sensitivity to unconscious communication, and the indication for certain types of patients that still need further investigation. Our research indicates that the long-standing reticence toward remote treatments offers among psychodynamic therapists is becoming more differentiated and partially dissolves as therapists gain experiences in their use. Attitudes are becoming more open. At the same time, the way is being prepared to take a closer look at the specific processes and dynamics of remote psychotherapy and to examine them critically in future studies.","Jesser, Muckenhuber, Lunglmayr","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.777102","20220125","COVID-19; e-mental health; pandemic; psychotherapy; psychotherapy via telephone; remote psychotherapy; telehealth; videoconferencing psychotherapy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25982,""
"Exploring Higher Education Pathways for Coping With the Threat of COVID-19: Does Parental Academic Background Matter?","First-generation students (FGS) are more likely to feel misplaced and struggle at university than students with university-educated parents (continuous-generation students; CGS). We assumed that the shutdowns during the Coronavirus-pandemic would particularly threaten FGS due to obstructed coping mechanisms. Specifically, FGS may show lower identification with the academic setting and lower perceived fairness of the university system (system justification). We investigated whether FGS and CGS used different defenses to cope with the shutdown threat in a large sample of German-speaking students (<i>N</i> = 848). Using Structural Equation Modeling, we found that for all students, independent of academic parental background, high levels of system justification were associated with perceiving the learning situation as less threatening, better coping with failure, and less helplessness. However, in comparison to CGS, FGS showed small but significant reductions in system justification and relied more on concrete personal relationships with other students as well as their academic identity to cope with the threatening situation. We discuss implications for helping FGS succeed at university.","MÃƒÂ¶ller, ThÃƒÂ¼rmer, Tulis, Reiss, Jonas","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.768334","20220125","COVID-19; defensive strategies; first-generation students; social belonging; system justification","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25983,""
"Psychological Health Conditions and COVID-19-Related Stressors Among University Students: A Repeated Cross-Sectional Survey","The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has broadly impacted university students' customary life, resulting in remarkable levels of stress and psychological suffering. Although the acute phase of the crisis has been overcome, it does not imply that perceived stress related to the risk of contagion and to the changes in the relational life experienced over more than 1Ã¢â‚¬â€°year of the pandemic will promptly and abruptly decrease. This study aims at comparing university students' psychological health conditions before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, but also at providing information on how psychological health conditions evolved over the 1Ã¢â‚¬â€°year of the pandemic. We analyzed data from a repeated cross-sectional survey on different samples of university students before the pandemic in 2017 (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°545) and during the pandemic (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°671).

The COVID-19 Student Stress Questionnaire (CSSQ) and the Symptom-Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R) were used to assess, respectively, COVID-19-related stressors (Relationships and Academic Life, Isolation, and Fear of Contagion) and the presence of psychological symptoms. Psychological health conditions were compared at baseline and during the pandemic, whereas both psychological health conditions and perceived levels of COVID-19-related stressors were compared over the three pandemic stages. In addition, Logistic Regression was used to explore the associations between COVID-19-related stressors and psychological symptoms. Findings revealed a significant increase in symptoms of Depression (DEP), Phobic-Anxiety (PHOB), Obsessive-Compulsive (O-C), and Psychoticism (PSY) from pre to during the pandemic. Perceived levels of COVID-19-related stress and specific psychological symptoms significantly increased as the pandemic was progressing. COVID-19-related stressors emerged as significantly associated with several psychopathological symptoms.

"The Association Between Dry Eye Disease With Depression, Anxiety and Sleep Disturbance During COVID-19","<b>Objective:</b> This study aimed to investigate the relationship between dry eye disease (DED) with anxiety and depression. Additionally, the mediating effect of sleep quality on this relationship was explored. <b>Methods:</b> 321 patients with DED were recruited from Tianjin Medical University Eye Hospital clinic and surveyed using demographic questionnaires, the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).

Moreover, there is evidence that pregnant women have experienced high levels of anxiety and depression symptoms during the pandemic. Our study aimed to evaluate the association of pregnancy-specific stress, pandemic-related stress, and coping strategies with anxiety, depressive and obsessive-compulsive symptomatology in Italian women during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (December 2020-June 2021). We also investigated whether there were differences in these levels of psychopathology compared to a prior study conducted during the first pandemic wave (April-August 2020) in Italian pregnant women. <b>Methods:</b> We assessed 325 pregnant women receiving outpatient prenatal care, using the Revised Prenatal Distress Questionnaire (NuPDQ), Pandemic-Related Pregnancy Stress Scale (PREPS), the Revised Prenatal Coping Inventory (NuPCI), General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2), and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) screening. The main analysis was conducted comparing multiple logistic regression models predicting each psychopathological outcome from specific covariates and NuPDQ, PREPS, and NuPCI scores. <b>Results:</b> 42.8% of the sample reported significant levels of anxiety, while 10.3% was positive on depression screening and 13.1% on OCD screening. No significant difference was found in the prevalence of high anxiety, depression, or OCD screening scores compared with the first pandemic wave. Controlling for covariates, we found that GAD-7 and PHQ-2 scores were predicted by pregnancy-specific stress; positive OCD screening was not. The model of high anxiety was improved by adding pandemic-related stress as a predictor (in particular, feeling unprepared for delivery and postpartum). Finally, coping strategies (avoidance, spiritual coping, and planning-preparation) significantly improved prediction of all three psychopathological outcomes. <b>Conclusions:</b> The present study suggests the importance of pregnancy-related stress, COVID-19 pandemic stress, and of coping strategies in counteracting or contributing to psychiatric symptomatology during the current pandemic.","Penengo, Colli, Cesco, Croccia, Degano, Ferreghini, Garzitto, Lobel, Preis, Sala, Driul, Balestrieri","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.775585","20220125","COVID-19; anxiety; coping; depression; pregnancy; prenatal stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25987,""
"Hidden in Plain Sight? Men's Coping Patterns and Psychological Distress Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Individuals cope with stress using multiple strategies, yet studies of coping profiles are rare. We draw data from a longitudinal study of Australian men (<i>n</i> = 272; 30-37 years), assessed before (T1) and during (T2) a nation-wide COVID-19 lockdown. We aimed to: (1) identify men's multi-strategy coping profiles before and during the pandemic; (2) assess cross-sectional (T1-T1, T2-T2) and prospective (T1-T2) associations between profiles and symptoms of psychological distress (stress, anxiety, depression, and anger); and (3) examine relationships between coping profiles and appraisals of pandemic-related stressors and options for coping. In latent profile analyses of 14 coping strategies, three profiles emerged that were largely consistent across T1 and T2: (1) Relaxed Copers (low use of all strategies), (2) Approach Copers, and (3) Dual Copers (high avoidant and moderate-high approach-oriented strategies). Compared to Relaxed and Approach Copers, men who were Dual Copers had elevated psychological distress cross-sectionally before (T1) and during (T2) the pandemic, but not prospectively. <i>Post hoc</i> analyses suggested this was because many men changed coping profiles in the context of the pandemic. Men with stable (T1-T2) or new (T2 only) Dual Coping profiles experienced greater psychological distress and more negative appraisals of pandemic stressors and options for coping. In sum, at the sample level, the composition of men's coping profiles and associations with mental health risk were relatively stable over time and contexts; however, many men appeared to respond to pandemic conditions by changing coping profile groups, with mostly positive mental health outcomes. Of concern were men who adopted more avoidant strategies (e.g., denial, self-distraction, disengagement, substance use, and self-blame) under pandemic conditions. These Dual Coper men also engaged in commonly observable approach-oriented behaviours (e.g., planning, active coping, humour, seeking practical social support) that may mask their vulnerability to mental health risk. Our findings highlight the clinical importance of enquiring about escalating or frequent avoidant coping even in the presence of more active and interactive approach-oriented behaviours.","Livingston, Youssef, Francis, Greenwood, Olsson, Macdonald","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.772942","20220125","COVID-19; anxiety; coping; depression; men; pandemic; psychological distress; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25988,""
"Correlation of Childhood Psychological Abuse and Neglect With Mental Health in Chinese College Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Experience of childhood maltreatment is a major factor affecting adult mental health. The purpose of this study was to understand the association of childhood psychological abuse and neglect with mental health in college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online questionnaire survey was conducted from February 21 to March 12, 2020. The participants were 200 students at a university of physical education in Shaanxi Province, China. Participants completed the Child Psychological Abuse and Neglect Scale and the Mental Health Self-Report Questionnaire. Regarding childhood maltreatment experience, 52.5% of respondents screened positive for childhood psychological abuse, 55.8% for psychological neglect, and 43.6% for both. Moreover, 37.6% of participants screened positive for psychological health problems during the pandemic. Childhood psychological abuse and neglect were positively associated with mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. A regression analysis revealed that the reproving dimension of psychological abuse was a risk factor for mental health problems in college students during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Zhu, Li, Hao","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.770201","20220125","COVID-19; childhood maltreatment; college students; mental health; psychological abuse and neglect","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25989,""
"Opioids in COVID-19: Two Sides of a Coin","<b>Introduction:</b> The treatment of most severe COVID-19 patients included the large-scale use of sedatives and analgesics-possibly in higher doses than usual-which was reported in the literature. The use of drugs that decrease mortality is necessary and opioids are important agents in procedures such as orotracheal intubation. However, these drugs seem to have been overestimated in the COVID-19 pandemic. We performed a review of the PubMed-Medline database to evaluate the use of opioids during this period. The following descriptors were used to enhance the search for papers: ""Opioids"", ""COVID-19,"" ""COVID-19 pandemic,"" ""SARS-CoV-2,"" ""Opioid use disorder,"" ""Opioid dependence"" and the names of the drugs used. We also evaluated the distribution of COVID-19 patients in Brazil and the applicability of opioids in our country during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Results:</b> Several positive points were found in the use of opioids in the COVID-19 pandemic, for instance, they can be used for analgesia in orotracheal intubation, for chronic pain management, and as coadjutant in the management of acute intensification of pain. However, high doses of opioids might exacerbate the respiratory depression found in COVID-19 patients, their chronic use can trigger opioid tolerance and the higher doses used during the pandemic might result in greater adverse effects. Unfortunately, the pandemic also affected individuals with opioid use disorder, not only those individuals are at higher risk of mortality, hospitalization and need for ventilatory support, but measures taken to decrease the SARS-CoV-2 spread such as social isolation, might negatively affect the treatment for opioid use disorder. In Brazil, only morphine, remifentanil and fentanyl are available in the basic health care system for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Out of the 5,273,598 opioid units used in this period all over the country, morphine, fentanyl, and remifentanil, accounted for, respectively, 559,270 (10.6%), 4,624,328 (87.6%), and 90,000 (1.8%) units. Many Brazilian regions with high number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 had few units of opioids available, as the Southeast region, with a 0.23 units of opioids per confirmed COVID-19 case, and the South region, with 0.05 units. In the COVID-19 pandemic scenario, positive points related to opioids were mainly the occurrence of analgesia, to facilitate intubation and their use as coadjutants in the management of acute intensification of pain, whereas the negative points were indiscriminate use, the presence of human immunosuppressor response and increased adverse effects due to higher doses of the drug. <b>Conclusion:</b> The importance of rational and individualized use of analgesic hypnotics and sedative anesthetics should be considered at all times, especially in situations of high demand such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Palamim, Boschiero, Faria, Valencise, Marson","https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2021.758637","20220125","alfentanil; fentanyl; hydromorphone; methadone; morphine; opioid use disorder and dependence; remifentanil; sufentanil","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25990,""
"Baseline predictors of progression of Parkinson's disease in a sample of Egyptian patients: clinical and biochemical","Clinical progression of Parkinson's disease (PD) is highly heterogeneous, and its predictors are generally lacking. Identifying predictors of early disease progression is important for patients' management and follow-up. The current study aims to identify clinical, neuroimaging and biochemical baseline predictors of motor progression in patients with PD. Forty-five PD patients were assessed at baseline, 6 months and 1 year using MDS-UPDRS total and subscores, Hoehn and Yahr (H&amp;Y), Schwab and England (S&amp;E), International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Baseline New Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (NFOG-Q), Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Ten-Meter Walking Test (10-MWT)<b>,</b> and Time Up and Go Test (TUG), Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), PD questionnaire 39 (PDQ-39), MRI brain, uric acid, lipid profile and glycated hemoglobin were performed. Significant worsening of MDS-UPDRS total, part III scores, H&amp;Y, S&amp;E and IPAQ (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) was detected. One-year progression of H&amp;Y and S&amp;E were significantly correlated to disease duration (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.014, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.025, respectively). Progression of H&amp;Y was correlated to baseline TUG (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.035). S&amp;E progression was correlated to baseline MDS-UPDRS total score (rhoÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.478, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and part III (rhoÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.350, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.020), H&amp;Y (rhoÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.401, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.007), PIGD (rhoÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.591, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), NFOG-Q (rhoÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.498, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), and TUG (rhoÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.565, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Using linear regression, there was no predictors of clinical progression among the used baseline variables.

"Turkish validity and reliability of coronavirus anxiety scale","The Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) was developed to differentiate individuals who were functionally impaired by anxiety about COVID-19 from those anxious, but not disabled by their emotional reactions to the disease. The aim of the present study is to validate the Turkish version of the CAS. The study was carried out in two stages. In the first phase, the validity and reliability study of the scale was conducted with 95 people. The single-factor structure of the scale was confirmed with exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis results. Cronbach's alpha internal consistency coefficient was found to be 0.86. In the second stage; the data were collected using the Turkish version of CASand Herth Hope scale. The scales were applied to 720 people. It was determined that there was a statistically significant relationship between total CAS scores and the Herth Hope Index.

"Progressive ShallowNet for Large Scale Dynamic and Spontaneous Facial Behaviour Analysis in Children","COVID-19 has severely disrupted every aspect of society and left negative impact on our life. Resisting the temptation in engaging face-to-face social connection is not as easy as we imagine. Breaking ties within social circle makes us lonely and isolated, that in turns increase the likelihood of depression related disease and even can leads to death by increasing the chance of heart disease. Not only adults, children's are equally impacted where the contribution of emotional competence to social competence has long term implications. Early identification skill for facial behaviour emotions, deficits, and expression may help to prevent the low social functioning. Deficits in young children's ability to differentiate human emotions can leads to social functioning impairment. However, the existing work focus on adult emotions recognition mostly and ignores emotion recognition in children. By considering the working of pyramidal cells in the cerebral cortex, in this paper, we present progressive lightweight shallow learning for the classification by efficiently utilizing the skip-connection for spontaneous facial behaviour recognition in children. Unlike earlier deep neural networks, we limit the alternative path for the gradient at the earlier part of the network by increase gradually with the depth of the network. Progressive ShallowNet is not only able to explore more feature space but also resolve the over-fitting issue for smaller data, due to limiting the residual path locally, making the network vulnerable to perturbations. We have conducted extensive experiments on on benchmark facial behaviour analysis in children that showed significant performance gain comparatively.","Qayyum, Razzak, Moustafa, Mazhar","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imavis.2022.104375","20220125","Depressed; Emotion care; Facial behavior recognition; Patient Monitoring; Progressive ShallowNet; Psychological health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25993,""

"Impact of COVID-19 social distancing measures on routine mental health care provision and treatment outcome for common mental disorders in the Netherlands","The uptake of digital interventions in mental health care (MHC) has been slow, as many therapists and patients believe that in-person contact is essential for establishing a good working relationship and good outcomes in treatment. The public health policies regarding social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic forced an abrupt transformation of MHC provisions for outpatients: Since mid-March 2020, nearly all in-person contact was replaced with videoconferencing. The COVID-19 crisis offered a unique opportunity to investigate whether MHC with videoconferencing yields inferior results as compared to in-person interventions. In a large urban MHC facility in the Netherlands measurement-based care is routine practice. Outcome data is regularly collected to support shared decision-making and monitor patient progress. For this study, pre- and posttest data were used to compare outcomes for three cohorts: Treatments performed prior to, partially during, and entirely during the COVID-19 lockdown. Outcomes were compared in two large data sets; Basic MHC (N= 1392) and Specialized MHC (N=1040). Therapeutic outcomes appeared robust for COVID-19 conditions across the three cohorts: No differences in outcomes were found between treatments that were conducted during lockdown compared to in-person treatments prior to COVID-19, or treatments which started in-person, but needed to be continued by means of videoconferencing. Videoconferencing care during the COVID-19 pandemic had similar outcomes compared to traditional in-person care. These real-world results corroborate findings of previous randomized controlled studies and meta-analyses in which videoconferencing and in-person care has been directly compared in terms of clinical effectiveness.","de Beurs, Blankers, Peen, Rademacher, Podgorski, Dekker","https://doi.org/10.1002/cpp.2713","20220124","COVID-19; depression, anxiety; effectiveness; videoconferencing treatment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25995,""
"Assessment of Patient Perspectives and Barriers to Self-Infusion of Augmentation Therapy for Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency is an autosomal co-dominant genetic condition that predisposes individuals to pulmonary and hepatic disease, and in severe cases is treated with augmentation by intravenous infusion. Our aim was to assess patient reluctance to transition to self-administered augmentation of alpha-1-antitrypsin, during the pandemic of SARS-CoV-2. A phone questionnaire was administered to 22 patients with severe alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency who were currently receiving AAT augmentation therapy. Inclusion criteria included patients [Formula: see text] 18Ã‚Â years old, diagnosed with AATD, and receiving intravenous AAT protein augmentation therapy. Information was gathered regarding demographics, perspectives on transitioning to self-administered treatment, and anxiety and depression prevalence. Results were collected anonymously using REDCap. Joint and marginal statistical analysis was done to quantify links between participants' willingness to transition to self-infusion and correlations with sex, age, years of therapy, anxiety, and depression. Of 22 patients, 14 were male and eight were female. Ages ranged from 36 to 79Ã‚Â years, with an average of 62.5. Genotypes were ZZ (14), MZ (3), and SZ (2) among others. Average length of intravenous augmentation was 9.5Ã‚Â years. The majority, 16 participants, were aware self-infusion was an option. Eight participants were willing to consider transitioning to self-infusion if trained and educated. Eight patients reported that fear of COVID-19 transmission influenced their decision-making. Above-normal anxiety, and depression scores, were found in four, and six patients, respectively. Neither sex, age, years of treatment, anxiety, or depression were found to be associated with willingness to consider self-infusion therapy.

"Climate change and mental health: time for action and advocacy","Climate change poses an existential threat to our planet and our health. We explore the intersections of climate change and mental health which has been under-recognised to date. Climate change can affect mental health directly through the effects of extreme weather events such as heat, drought and flooding, and indirectly through increasing rates of migration and inequality. Vulnerable individuals with neuropsychiatric disorders will be particularly at risk. Emerging evidence is alsoÃ‚Â showing effects of air pollution on brain development. Mitigation efforts related to reducing carbon emissions will have both direct and indirect effects on mental health. A further consideration demonstrated by the COVID-19 pandemic is that the spread of infectious disease can have substantial effects on the mental health of the population.

"Differences in mental health problems, coping self-efficacy and social support between adults victimised before and adults victimised after the COVID-19 outbreak: population-based prospective study","Victims of violence, accidents and threats are at risk for mental health problems. Lower coping self-efficacy and social support levels increase this risk. Although highly relevant, it is unknown if the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic amplifies these risks. To examine if the prevalence, incidence and/or mean scores for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety and depression symptoms, general mental health problems, coping self-efficacy, lack of emotional support and social acknowledgement are higher among adults victimised in the year after the COVID-19 outbreak compared with adults victimised in a similar period before the outbreak.

Data was extracted from four surveys of the VICTIMS study (March 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021), based on a random sample of the Dutch population. Multivariate logistic regression analyses and mixed-effects models were used to examine differences between the two victim groups (2019: n = 421, 2021: n = 319) and non-victims (n = 3245). Adults victimised after the outbreak more often had PTSD, anxiety and depression symptoms, general mental health problems and lower coping self-efficacy than those victimised before. They did not differ in lack of support and acknowledgement. Both victim groups differed from non-victims, where mental health problems and lack of support levels were much lower and almost stable. The COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on the mental health and coping self-efficacy levels of victims, whereas mental health problems among non-victims remained virtually stable. Mental healthcare workers, general practitioners and victim services should take this impact into account.","van der Velden, Contino, Das, Leenen, Wittmann","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjp.2021.226","20220124","COVID-19; PTSD; coping self-efficacy; social support; victims","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25998,""
"Pre-pandemic mental and physical health as predictors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy: evidence from a UK-wide cohort study","Although several predictors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy have been identified, the role of physical health and, particularly, mental health, is poorly understood. We used individual-level data from a pandemic-focused investigation (COVID Survey), a prospective cohort study nested within the UK Understanding Society (Main Survey) project. In the week immediately following the announcement of successful testing of the first efficacious inoculation (Oxford University/AstraZeneca, November/December 2020), data on vaccine intentionality were collected in 12,035 individuals aged 16-95Ã¢â‚¬â€°years. Pre-pandemic, study members had responded to enquiries about diagnoses of mental and physical health, including the completion of the 12-item General Health Questionnaire for symptoms of psychological distress (anxiety and depression). Peri-pandemic, individuals indicated whether they or someone in their household was shielding; that is, people judged by the UK National Health Service as being particularly clinically vulnerable who were therefore requested to remain at home. Intention to take up vaccination for COVID-19 was also self-reported. In an analytical sample of 11,955 people (6741 women), 15.4% indicated that they were vaccine-hesitant. Relative to their disease-free counterparts, shielding was associated with a 24% lower risk of being hesitant (odds ratio; 95% confidence interval: 0.76; 0.59, 0.96), after adjustment for a range of covariates which included age, education, and ethnicity. Corresponding results for cardiometabolic disease were 22% (0.78; 0.64, 0.95), and for respiratory disease were 26% (0.74; 0.59, 0.93). Having a pre-pandemic diagnosis of anxiety or depression, or a high score on the distress symptom scale, were all unrelated to the willingness to vaccine-hesitancy. People with a physical condition were more likely to take up the potential offer of a COVID-19 vaccination. These effects were not apparent for indices of mental health.Key messagesIn understanding predictors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, the role of physical and mental health has not been well-examined despite both groups seemingly experiencing an elevated risk of the disease.In a large UK cohort study, people with a pre-pandemic physical condition were more likely to take up the theoretical offer of vaccination.There were no apparent effects for indices of pre-pandemic mental health.","Batty, Deary, Altschul","https://doi.org/10.1080/07853890.2022.2027007","20220124","COVID-19; Mental health; cohort study; physical health; vaccine hesitancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",25999,""
"Potential indirect impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on children: a narrative review using a community child health lens","Ã¢â€“ÂªIn this narrative review, we summarise the vast and burgeoning research on the potential and established indirect impacts on children of the COVID-19 pandemic. We used a community child health lens to organise our findings and to consider how Australia might best respond to the needs of children (aged 0-12 years). Ã¢â€“ÂªWe synthesised the literature on previous pandemics, epidemics and natural disasters, and the current COVID-19 pandemic. We found clear evidence of adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on children that either repeated or extended the findings from previous pandemics. Ã¢â€“ÂªWe identified 11 impact areas, under three broad categories: child-level factors (poorer mental health, poorer child health and development, poorer academic achievement); family-level factors that affect children (poorer parent mental health, reduced family income and job losses, increased household stress, increased abuse and neglect, poorer maternal and newborn health); and service-level factors that affect children (school closures, reduced access to health care, increased use of technology for learning, connection and health care). Ã¢â€“ÂªThere is increasing global concern about the likely disproportionate impact of the current pandemic on children experiencing adversity, widening existing disparities in child health and developmental outcomes.

Using a mixed-methods design (convergent parallel design), we aimed to assess the experience, perceptions, and reactions of cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were cancer patients receiving treatment at the hospital during the pandemic (July to August 2020). In study 1, 95 participants filled out a questionnaire measuring COVID-19 experiences and perceptions, psychological distress, and intolerance of uncertainty. In study 2, in-depth interviews were conducted with 10 cancer patients, probing their experience during the COVID-19 period. Most participants experienced the COVID-19 pandemic as a major threat that would affect future health, most attended all or most of their scheduled treatments, and their mean level of psychological distress was low. A mild decrease in social support was reported, and remote contacts and support from the community had not compensated for decreased person-to person contacts. In addition, intolerance of uncertainty was related to higher psychologicalÃ‚Â distress, which was partially mediated by perceptions of threat. The analysis of in-depth interviews strengthened the quantitative findings by elucidating the experience of fear of contagion alongside determination to continue treatment. The mixed-methods design enabled us to examine the responses of cancer patients attending treatment. The findings suggest that in times of extreme uncertainty such as COVID-19, health experts need to screen cancer patients and survivors for emotional and instrumental support needs and identify patients and survivors with high intolerance of uncertainty as a risk factor for psychological distress.","Cohen, Yagil, Aviv, Soffer, Bar-Sela","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11764-021-01126-3","20220123","COVID-19; Intolerance of uncertainty; Perceived threat; Psychological distress; Remote contact; Social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",26001,""
"The impacts of masks and disinfectants on migraine patients in the COVID-19 pandemic","Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and disinfectants has become necessary to prevent transmission of the virus. However, the effects of such pandemic obligations on chronic diseases such as migraine have not been fully elucidated. We aimed to investigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the use of masks and disinfectants, on migraine patients. A total of 310 migraine patients were included. Demographic data, migraine characteristics, and mask and disinfectant use were obtained through a face-to-face survey. Patients were grouped as worsening, stable, or improving according to pre-pandemic and pandemic migraine characteristics. Migraine worsening was found in 177 (57.1%) patients, stable course in 96 (31%) patients, and improvement in 37 (11.9%) patients. The use of scalp contact masks and double masks and daily mask duration were higher in the worsening group (p:0.005, p:0.005 and p:0.001). In addition, the frequency of personal disinfectant use was higher in this group (p:0.011). In regression analysis, mask type, daily mask duration, presence of allodynia, being a health worker, depression score, and odor were determined as independent risk factors for migraine worsening. We found a worsening of migraines in more than half of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also demonstrated a relationship between migraine worsening and mask type, number of masks, and intensive disinfectant use. Migraine patients should be advised of optimal prevention methods based on individual social and working conditions rather than exaggerated preventative measures.","Yuksel, Kenar, Gursoy, Bektas","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jocn.2022.01.006","20220125","COVID-19; Disinfectant; Mask; Migraine; Personal protective equipment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",26002,""
"Public mental health: required actions to address implementation failure in the context of COVID-19","Mental disorders account for at least 18% of global disease burden, and the associated annual global costs are projected to be US$6 trillion by 2030. Evidence-based, cost-effective public mental health (PMH) interventions exist to prevent mental disorders from arising, prevent associated impacts of mental disorders (including through treatment), and promote mental wellbeing and resilience. However, only a small proportion of people with mental disorders receive minimally adequate treatment. Compared with treatment, there is even less coverage of interventions to prevent the associated impacts of mental disorders, prevent mental disorders from arising, or promote mental wellbeing and resilience. This implementation failure breaches the right to health, has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, and results in preventable suffering, broad impacts, and associated economic costs. In this Health Policy paper, we outline specific actions to improve the coverage of PMH interventions, including PMH needs assessments, collaborative advocacy and leadership, PMH practice to inform policy and implementation, training and improvement of population literacy, settings-based and integrated approaches, use of digital technology, maximising existing resources, focus on high-return interventions, human rights approaches, legislation, and implementation research. Increased interest in PMH in populations and governments since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic supports these actions. Improved implementation of PMH interventions can result in broad health, social, and economic impacts, even in the short-term, which support the achievement of a range of policy objectives, sustainable economic development, and recovery.","Campion, Javed, Lund, Sartorius, Saxena, Marmot, Allan, Udomratn","https://doi.org/10.1016/S2215-0366(21)00199-1","20220123","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",26003,""
"Perceived risk and distress related to COVID-19 in healthcare versus non-healthcare workers of Pakistan: a cross-sectional study","Healthcare workers (HCWs) have found themselves and their families more susceptible to contracting COVID-19. This puts them at a higher risk of psychological distress, which may compromise patient care. In this study, we aim to explore the risk perceptions and psychological distress between HCWs and non-healthcare workers (NHCWs) in Pakistan. A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online self-administered questionnaire. Psychological distress was assessed through The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Comparisons were made between HCWs (front/backend, students/graduates) and NHCWs related to risk perceptions and stress levels related to COVID-19. Following tests for normality (Shapiro-Wilk test), variables that fulfilled the normality assumption were compared using the independent samples t-test, while for other variables Mann-Whitney U-test was employed. Pearson Chi-square test was used to compare categorical data. Multiple logistic regression techniques examined the association of participant age, gender, household income, and the presence of COVID-19 symptoms with depression and anxiety levels. Data from 1406 respondents (507 HCWs and 899 NHCWs) were analyzed. No significant difference was observed between HCWs and NHCWs' perception of susceptibility and severity towards COVID-19. While healthcare graduates perceived themselves (80% graduates vs 66% students, p-value 0.011) and their family (82% graduates vs 67% students, p-value 0.008) to be more susceptible to COVID-19, they were less likely to experience depression than students. Frontline HCWs involved in direct patient care perceived themselves (83% frontline vs. 70% backend, p-value 0.003) and their family (84% frontline vs. 72% backend, p-value 0.006) as more susceptible to COVID-19 than backend healthcare professionals. Over half of the respondents were anxious (54% HCWs and 55% NHCWs). Female gender, younger age, lower income, and having COVID-19 related symptoms had a significant effect on the anxiety levels of both HCWs and NHCWs. Frontline HCWs, young people, women, and individuals with lower income were at a higher risk of psychological distress due to the pandemic. Government policies should thus be directed at ensuring the mental well-being of frontline HCWs and improving their satisfaction to strengthen the health care delivery system. The findings suggest the need to provide mental health support for health workers.","Abid, Shahzad, Khan, Piryani, Khan, Rabbani","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12960-022-00705-4","20220123","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Healthcare workers; Psychological distress; Risk perception","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",26004,""
"The effect of school summer holidays on inequalities in children and youngÃ‚Â people's mental health and cognitive ability in the UK using data from the millennium cohort study","Summer learning loss has been the subject of longstanding concern among researchers, the public and policy makers. The aim of the current research was to investigate inequality changes in children's mental health and cognitive ability across the summer holidays. We conducted linear and logistic regression analysis of mental health (borderline-abnormal total difficulty and prosocial scores on the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ)) and verbal cognitive ability (reading, verbal reasoning or vocabulary) at ages 7, 11 and 14, comparing UK Millennium Cohort Study members who were interviewed before and after the school summer holidays. Inequalities were assessed by including interaction terms in the outcome models between a discrete binary variable with values representing time periods and maternal academic qualifications. Coefficients of the interaction terms were interpreted as changes from the pre- to post-holiday period in the extent of inequality in the outcome between participants whose mothers had high or low educational qualifications. Separate models were fitted for each age group and outcome. We used inverse probability weights to allow for differences in the characteristics of cohort members assessed before and after the summer holidays. Mental health (borderline/abnormal SDQ total and prosocial scores) at ages 7 and 14 worsened and verbal cognitive ability scores at age 7 were lower among those surveyed after the summer holidays. Mental health inequalities were larger after the holidays at age 7 ([ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.4; 95%CI (0.6, 3.2) and 14: [ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.5; 95%CI (0.7, 3.2)], but changed little at age 11 (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.9; 95%CI (0.4, 2.6)]. There were differences in pro-social behaviours among those surveyed before/after the school holidays at age 14 [ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.2; 95%CI (0.5, 3.5)] but not at age 7 or 11. There was little change in inequalities in verbal cognitive ability scores over the school holidays [Age 7: bÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.3; 95%CI (-Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.3, 6.0); Age 11: bÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.7; 95%CI (-Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.3, 2.8); Age 14: bÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.3; 95%CI (-Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.0, 0.4)]. We found inequalities in mental health and cognitive ability according to maternal education, and some evidence or worsening mental health and mental health inequalities across school summer holidays. We found little evidence of widening inequalities in verbal cognitive ability. Widespread school closures during the COVID-19 restrictions have prompted concerns that prolonged closures may widen health and educational inequalities. Management of school closures should focus on preventing or mitigating inequalities that may arise from differences in the support for mental health and learning provided during closures by schools serving more or less disadvantaged children.","Kromydas, Campbell, Chambers, Boon, Pearce, Wells, Craig","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-12540-2","20220123","COVID-19; Cognitive ability; Inequalities; Mental health; School closures","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",26005,""
"Mental Health in Multiple Sclerosis During the COVID-19 Outbreak: A Delicate Balance between Fear of Contagion and Resilience","The current study aimed at exploring the relationship between objective disability, illness perceptions, resilience, fear of COVID-19, and psychological distress (i.e., anxiety, depression, and stress) in people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) during the second wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. A group of 122 pwMS recruited in an Italian university hospital took part in this cross-sectional monocentric study. Hierarchical multiple linear regression analyses were performed to assess the strength of the hypothesized associations. Results indicated that, differently from cognitive impairment, motor disability was positively associated with anxiety. However, accounting for subjective illness perception, such association was no longer significant. Moreover, accounting for both protective and risk factors in the models, even illness perception was no longer significant, highlighting the central role of resilience and fear of COVID-19 in explaining the negative emotional outcomes.

"A prospective cohort study of the psychological consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on frontline healthcare workers in New York City","We sought to describe the course and correlates of psychological distress in frontline healthcare workers (FHCWs) during the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City (NYC). A prospective cohort study of FHCWs at the Mount Sinai Hospital was conducted during the initial 2020 surge (T1) and 7Ã‚Â months later (T2). Psychological distress [i.e., positive screen for pandemic-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and/or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)], occupational and personal exposures to COVID-19, coping strategies, and psychosocial characteristics were assessed. Four courses of psychological distress response were identified: no/minimal, remitted, persistent, and new-onset. Multinomial logistic regression and relative importance analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with courses of distress. Of 786 FHCWs, 126 (16.0%) FHCWs had persistent distress; 150 (19.1%) remitted distress; 35 (4.5%) new-onset distress; and 475 (60.4%) no/minimal distress. Relative to FHCWs with no/minimal distress, those with persistent distress reported greater relationship worries [19.8% relative variance explained (RVE)], pre-pandemic burnout (18.7% RVE), lower dispositional optimism (9.8% RVE), less emotional support (8.6% RVE), and feeling less valued by hospital leadership (8.4% RVE).Ã‚Â Relative to FHCWs with remitted symptoms, those with persistent distress reported less emotional support (29.7% RVE), fewer years in practice (28.3% RVE), and psychiatric history (23.6% RVE). One-fifth of FHCWs in our study experienced psychological distress 7Ã‚Â months following the COVID-19 surge in NYC. Pandemic-related worries, pre-pandemic burnout, emotional support, and feeling valued by leaders were linked to persistent distress. Implications for prevention, treatment, and organizational efforts to mitigate distress in FHCWs are discussed.","Peccoralo, Pietrzak, Feingold, Syed, Chan, Murrough, Kaplan, Verity, Feder, Charney, Southwick, Ripp","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00420-022-01832-0","20220122","Burnout; COVID-19 pandemic; Healthcare workers; Mental Health; Psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",26007,""
"The occurrence and risk factors associated with post-traumatic stress disorder among discharged COVID-19 patients in Tianjin, China","Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a serious mental health condition that is triggered by a terrifying event.

Participants from various settings, including primary care clinics, hospitals, nursing homes, and mental health facilities, are being enrolled. In 26 countries, we are using a similar study design with harmonized measures to capture data on COVID-19 related exposures and variables of interest during two years of follow-up. Exposures include potential stressors related to working in healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as sociodemographic and clinical factors. Primary outcomes of interest include mental health variables such as psychological distress, depressive symptoms, and posttraumatic stress disorders. Other domains of interest include potentially mediating or moderating influences such as workplace conditions, trust in the government, and the country's income level. As of August 2021,Ã¢â‚¬â€°~Ã¢â‚¬â€°34,000 health workers have been recruited. A general characterization of the recruited samples by sociodemographic and workplace variables is presented.

"Understanding Sleepiness and Fatigue in Cabin Crew Using COVID-19 to Dissociate Causative Factors","<b>OBJECTIVES:</b> Airline cabin crew experience high levels of fatigue and sleepiness. Whether these are solely related to their work schedules/jetlag or are in part related to individual factors is unknown. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted the aviation industry and many cabin crew have been grounded. This provides a unique opportunity to assess the causes of fatigue and sleepiness in this population.<b>METHODS:</b> An online anonymous survey was distributed in April-June 2020 to cabin crew who were 1) flying, 2) grounded but doing alternative work, and 3) grounded, not working, or unemployed. The survey measured fatigue, sleepiness, and mental health. It also screened their risk for insomnia, depression, and shift work disorder and assessed drug and caffeine use.<b>RESULTS:</b> Collected were 409 valid responses: 45 currently flying; 35 grounded but doing alternate work; and 329 not working. On average, all three groups experienced normal levels of fatigue and sleepiness. The risk for major depressive disorder was 27.4%, with 59.5% of individuals reporting abnormal levels of anxiety. Caffeine intake and the use of drugs and alcohol to facilitate sleep were common, although not different between those currently flying vs. grounded.<b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> With reduced workloads or not flying, cabin crew reported lowered fatigue and sleepiness compared to prepandemic findings, along with reduced risk for major depressive disorder. However, a high occurrence of negative emotional states were reported, potentially related to the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic. This study suggests fatigue and sleepiness is primarily related to airline operational rather than personal variables.<b>Wen CC-Y, Nicholas CL, Howard ME, Trinder J, Jordan AS. <i>Understanding sleepiness and fatigue in cabin crew using COVID-19 to dissociate causative factors</i>.

Participant characteristics (i.e. age, sex, body mass index (BMI), marital status, education, household composition, and occupation status), living environment (i.e. housing type and degree of urbanization), psychological characteristics (i.e. resilience, outcome expectations, vitality, and mental health), and medical history were collected via an online questionnaire. Short Questionnaire to Assess Health-enhancing physical activity was used to assess PA behavior before and during lockdown. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare PA levels, in metabolic equivalent of task (MET)-minutes per weekÃ‚Â (min/wk), before and during lockdown. Multivariable linear regression analyses were performed to examine correlates of PA changes. 4033 participants (57% male; 59Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 13 years) were included. PA decreased significantly during lockdown with meanÃ‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â SD changes of 393Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 2735 MET-min/wk for total, 133Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 785 MET-min/wk for transportation, 137Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 1469 MET-min/wk for occupation, and 136Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 1942 MET-min/wk for leisure time PA. Household PA did not change significantly. Unemployment, COVID-19-related occupational changes, higher BMI, and living in an apartment or semi-detached/terraced houseÃ‚Â were significantly related to larger decreases in total and domain-specific PA. Higher vitality was related to smaller decreases in total and domain-specific PA. Higher age was significantly associated with a larger decrease in leisure time PA. Lower education was associated with smaller decreases in transportation and occupational PA compared to higher education. PA levels significantly reduced during lockdown compared to before lockdown. Declines were observed during transportation and occupation, but were not compensated by an increase in leisure time PA. We identified subgroups that were more susceptible to reductions in domain-specific or total PA levels and should therefore be encouraged to increase their PA levels during lockdown.","Schoofs, Bakker, de Vries, Hartman, Spoelder, Thijssen, Eijsvogels, Buffart, Hopman","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-12560-y","20220124","Coronavirus; Healthy lifestyle; Lockdown; Netherlands; Physical inactivity; Prevention","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",26013,""
"Factors associated with COVID-19 pandemic induced post-traumatic stress symptoms among adults living with and without HIV in Nigeria: a cross-sectional study","Nigeria is a country with high risk for traumatic incidences, now aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to identify differences in COVID-19 related post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) among people living and not living with HIV; to assess whether PTSS were associated with COVID-19 pandemic-related anger, loneliness, social isolation, and social support; and to determine the association between PTSS and use of COVID-19 prevention strategies. The data of the 3761 respondents for this analysis was extracted from a cross-sectional online survey that collected information about mental health and wellness from a convenience sample of adults, 18Ã¢â‚¬â€°years and above, in Nigeria from July to December 2020. Information was collected on the study's dependent variable (PTSS), independent variables (self-reported COVID-19, HIV status, use of COVID-19 prevention strategies, perception of social isolation, access to emotional support, feelings of anger and loneliness), and potential confounder (age, sex at birth, employment status). A binary logistic regression model tested the associations between independent and dependent variables. Nearly half (47.5%) of the respondents had PTSS. People who had symptoms but were not tested (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.20), felt socially isolated (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.16), angry (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.64), or lonely (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.19) had significantly greater odds of reporting PTSS (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). People living with HIV (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.39), those who wore masks (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.62) and those who had emotional support (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.63), had lower odds of reporting PTSS (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05). The present study identified some multifaceted relationships between post-traumatic stress, HIV status, facemask use, anger, loneliness, social isolation, and access to emotional support during this protracted COVID-19 pandemic. These findings have implications for the future health of those affected, particularly for individuals living in Nigeria.

"Prolonged migraine aura resembling ischemic stroke following CoronaVac vaccination: an extended case series","After the initiation of the COVID-19 vaccination program in Thailand, thousands of patients have experienced unusual focal neurological symptoms. We report 8 patients with focal neurological symptoms after receiving inactivated virus vaccine, CoronaVac. Patients were aged 24-48Ã¢â‚¬â€°years and 75% were female. Acute onset of focal neurological symptoms occurred within the first 24Ã¢â‚¬â€°h after vaccination in 75% and between 1-7d in 25%. All presented with lateralized sensory deficits, motor deficits, or both, of 2-14Ã¢â‚¬â€°day duration. Migraine headache occurred in half of the patients. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain during and after the attacks did not demonstrate any abnormalities suggesting ischemic stroke. All patients showed moderately large regions of hypoperfusion and concurrent smaller regions of hyperperfusion on SPECT imaging while symptomatic. None developed permanent deficits or structural brain injury. Here, we present a case series of transient focal neurological syndrome following Coronavac vaccination. The characteristic sensory symptoms, history of migraine, female predominant, and abnormal functional brain imaging without structural changes suggest migraine aura as pathophysiology. We propose that pain related to vaccine injection, component of vaccine, such as aluminum, or inflammation related to vaccination might trigger migraine aura in susceptible patients.","Suwanwela, Kijpaisalratana, Tepmongkol, Rattanawong, Vorasayan, Charnnarong, Tantivattana, Roongruang, Ongphichetmetha, Panjasriprakarn, Chutinet, Akarathanawat, Saver","https://doi.org/10.1186/s10194-022-01385-0","20220125","COVID-19; CoronaVac vaccine; Cortical spreading depression; Neurological deficit; Sinovac; Brain Ischemia; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Epilepsy; Female; Humans; Ischemic Stroke; Migraine Disorders; Migraine with Aura; SARS-CoV-2; Stroke; Vaccination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",26015,""
"Assessment of COVID-19 Fear in Five European Countries before Mass Vaccination and Key Predictors among Nurses and Nursing Students","Levels of fear have increased since the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. The absence of a safe and effective vaccine for mass-vaccination deteriorates this situation, which has a significant impact on mental health. This study aimed to assess the feelings of fear among nurses and nursing students in five European countries. A multicenter cross-sectional study was conducted in five European countries (Greece, Albania, Cyprus, Spain, and Kosovo) before the start of mass vaccination in Europe. Data collection was conducted in December 2020-January 2021 using an online questionnaire for nursing students and professional nurses. Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) was used for measuring levels of fear. IBM SPSS version 21.0 was used for statistical analysis. The study population included 1135 nurses and 1920 nursing students from Kosovo (<i>n</i> = 1085), Spain (<i>n</i> = 663), Greece (<i>n</i> = 534), Albania (<i>n</i> = 529), and Cyprus (<i>n</i> = 244). According to multivariable analysis, females (OR = 2.53, 95% CI = 1.89-3.15), married (OR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.24-1.48), nurses (OR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.28-1.45) and those with a chronic disease (OR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.11-1.62) were more fearful of COVID-19. It is important to decrease fear in the population of nurses who are at the frontlines of the pandemic. The provision of appropriate education and training activities for nurses and students to manage their stress levels is of high importance. Future studies should focus on levels of fear after the administration of several safe and effective vaccines worldwide.","Patelarou, Galanis, Mechili, Argyriadi, Argyriadis, Asimakopoulou, Kicaj, Bucaj, Carmona-Torres, Cobo-Cuenca, DoleÃ…Â¾el, Finotto, JaroÃ…Â¡ovÃƒÂ¡, Kalokairinou, Mecugni, Pulomenaj, Malaj, Sopjani, Zahaj, Patelarou","https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10010098","20220124","COVID-19; FCV-19S; fear; nurses; nursing students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",26016,""
"Analyzing Topics and Sentiments from Twitter to Gain Insights to Refine Interventions for Family Caregivers of Persons with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) During COVID-19 Pandemic","We randomly extracted Tweets mentioning dementia/Alzheimer's caregiving-related terms (n= 58,094) from Aug 23, 2019, to Sep 14, 2020, via an API.

We compared emotional valence scores of Tweets from before (through the end of 2019) and after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-). Prevalence of topics related to caregiver emotional distress (e.g., depression, helplessness, stigma, loneliness, elder abuse) and caregiver coping (e.g., resilience, love, reading books) increased, and topics related to late-stage dementia caregiving (e.g., nursing home placement, hospice, palliative care) decreased during the pandemic. The mean emotional valence score significantly decreased from 1.18 (SD 1.57; range -7.1 to 7.9) to 0.86 (SD 1.57; range -5.5 to 6.85) after the advent of COVID-19 (difference -0.32 CI: -0.35, -0.29).

"EACVI survey on burnout amongst cardiac imaging specialists during the 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic","The European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging Scientific Initiatives Committee conducted a global survey to evaluate the impact of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on the mental well-being of cardiac imaging specialists. In a prospective international survey performed between 23 July 2021 and 31 August 2021, we assessed the mental well-being of cardiac imaging specialists Ã¢Ë†Â¼18 months into the COVID-19 pandemic. One-hundred-and-twenty-five cardiac imaging specialists from 34 countries responded to the survey. More than half described feeling anxious during the pandemic, 34% felt melancholic, 27% felt fearful, and 23% respondents felt lonely. A quarter of respondents had increased their alcohol intake and more than half reported difficulties in sleeping. Two-thirds of respondents described worsening features of burnout during the past 18 months, 44% considered quitting their job. One in twenty respondents had experienced suicidal ideation during the pandemic. Despite these important issues, the majority of participants (57%) reported having no access to any formal mental health support at work. The survey has highlighted important issues regarding the mental well-being of cardiac imaging specialists during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a major issue in our sub-specialty, which requires urgent action and prioritization so that we can improve the mental health of cardiovascular imaging specialists.","Joshi, Stankovic, Demirkiran, Haugaa, Maurovich-Horvat, Popescu, Cosyns, Edvardsen, Petersen, Carvalho, Cameli, Dweck","https://doi.org/10.1093/ehjci/jeac002","20220121","Burnout; COVID-19","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",26018,""
"The impact of COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical interventions on the lived experiences of people living in Thailand, Malaysia, Italy and the United Kingdom: A cross-country qualitative study","This qualitative study explores the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), including social distancing, travel restrictions and quarantine, on lived experiences during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Thailand (TH), Malaysia (MY), Italy (IT) and the United Kingdom (UK). A total of 86 interviews (TH: n = 28; MY: n = 18; IT: n = 20; UK: n = 20) were conducted with members of the public, including healthcare workers (n = 13). Participants across countries held strong views on government imposed NPIs, with many feeling measures lacked clarity. Most participants reported primarily negative impacts of NPIs on their lives, including through separation, isolation and grief over missed milestones; work-related challenges and income loss; and poor mental health and wellbeing. Nonetheless, many also experienced inadvertent positive consequences, including more time at home to focus on what they most valued in life; a greater sense of connectedness; and benefits to working life. Commonly employed coping strategies focused on financial coping (e.g. reducing spending); psycho-emotional coping (e.g. engaging in spiritual practices); social coping and connectedness (e.g., maintaining relationships remotely); reducing and mitigating risks (e.g., changing food shopping routines); and limiting exposure to the news (e.g., checking news only occasionally). Importantly, the extent to which participants' lived experiences were positive or negative, and their ability to cope was underpinned by individual, social and economic factors, with the analysis indicating some salient differences across countries and participants. In order to mitigate negative and unequal impacts of NPIs, COVID-19 policies will benefit from paying closer attention to the social, cultural and psychological-not just biological-vulnerabilities to, and consequences of public health measures.","Schneiders, Naemiratch, Cheah, Cuman, Poomchaichote, Ruangkajorn, Stoppa, Osterrieder, Cheah, Ongkili, Pan-Ngum, Mackworth-Young, Cheah","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0262421","20220124","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",26019,""
"Repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic on health professionals in the state of Rio de Janeiro / Brazil","Brazil has been severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The high numbers of confirmed cases and deaths have continued unabated since the first reported case, with no flattening or downward turn in the curve. In this context, healthcare workers have been exposed uninterruptedly to stress factors throughout a year of the pandemic. The studyÃ‚Â´s aim was to identify and analyze healthcare workersÃ‚Â´ perceptions of their feelings and concerns that have surfaced in responding to the pandemic. This was a cross-sectional online qualitative survey study of 554 healthcare personnel working in the state of Rio de Janeiro during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recruitment occurred from July 20 to September 30, 2020, using an online survey, preceded byfree informed consent term. Data were analyzed with the Iramuteq software. Through a dendrogram, the words with the highest chi-square were highlighted and grouped into four classes: healthcare workersÃ‚Â´ fear of falling ill to COVID-19 and infecting their family members; work/labor issues; feelings of powerlessness and need for public policies for government action; and fatigue and burnout in the pandemic.

"Parental Knowledge/Monitoring and Depressive Symptoms During Adolescence: Protective Factor or Spurious Association?","Parental knowledge/monitoring is negatively associated with adolescents' depressive symptoms, suggesting monitoring could be a target for preventionÃ‚Â andÃ‚Â treatment. However, no study has rigorously addressed the possibility that this association is spurious, leaving the clinical and etiological implications unclear. The goal of this study was to conduct a more rigorous test of whether knowledge/monitoring is causally related to depressive symptoms. 7940 youth (ages 10.5-15.6Ã‚Â years, 49% female) at 21 sites across the U.S. completed measures of parental knowledge/monitoring and their own depressive symptoms at four waves 11-22Ã‚Â weeks apart during the COVID-19 pandemic. First, monitoring and depression were examined in standard, between-family regression models. Second, within-family changes in monitoring and depression between assessments were examined in first differenced regressions. Because the latter models control for stable, between-family differences, they comprise a stronger test of a causal relation. In standard, between-family models, parental monitoring and youths' depressive symptoms were negatively associated (standardized [Formula: see text]=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.22, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°[-0.25,Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.20], pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). In first-differenced, within-family models, the association shrunk by about 55% (standardized [Formula: see text]=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.10, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°[-0.12,Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.08], pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). The magnitude of within-family association remained similar when adjusting for potential time-varying confounders and did notÃ‚Â varyÃ‚Â significantly by youth sex, age, or history of depressive disorder. Thus, in this community-based sample, much of the prima facie association between parental knowledge/monitoring and youths' depressive symptoms was driven by confounding variables rather than a causal process. Given the evidence to date, a clinical focus on increasing parentalÃ‚Â knowledge/monitoring should not be expected to produce meaningfully large improvements in youths' depression.","Pelham, Tapert, Gonzalez, Guillaume, Dick, Sheth, Baker, Baskin-Sommers, Marshall, Lisdahl, Breslin, Van Rinsveld, Brown","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10802-021-00896-9","20220121","Adolescence; Depression; Parental monitoring","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",26021,""

"COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in patients with mental illness: strategies to overcome barriers-a review","People with mental health problems are at particular risk both for infection with COVID-19 and for more severe course of illness. Understanding COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is crucial in promoting vaccine acceptance among people with mental health diagnoses. This review aims to identifyÃ‚Â the prevalence and discuss factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among the mentally ill population. We conducted a detailed literature search and included 15 articles for discussion in this review. Several studies showed varying trends of vaccine hesitancy rates among different countries. Major factors involved in vaccine hesitancy in generalÃ‚Â include mistrust, misinformation, believing in conspiracy theories, and negative attitudes towards vaccines. It was surprising that none of the studies were focused on vaccine acceptance rates and factors associated with vaccine hesitancy among the mentally ill population. However, studies do show that COVID-19 is associated with worse healthcare outcomes for psychiatric patients, and vaccine hesitancy correlated with a lower likelihood of receiving mental health treatment and vaccinations. Psychiatrists need to address issues among patients who areÃ‚Â particularly vulnerable to the fear of vaccines which include anxiety, panic attacks, certain phobias including trypanophobia and agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and certain types of traumas. Psychiatrists need to communicate effectively, show respect, empathy, and deliver accurate and honest information about the vaccines. Motivational interviewing, getting people with mental health illness to organize vaccine campaigns, and involving families with mental health problems may promote vaccine acceptance among this group. Existing literature on the rates of vaccine hesitancy among people with mental health illness is limited. The mental health illness may increase the risk ofÃ‚Â hesitancy especially in patients having certain emotional disorders such as anxiety and phobia. More studies addressing vaccine hesitancy rates and factors associated with the mentally ill population need to be done in the future.","Payberah, Payberah, Sarangi, Gude","https://doi.org/10.1186/s42506-022-00102-8","20220124","Acceptance; COVID-19; Mental illness; Pandemic; Vaccine hesitancy; Vaccine refusal","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",26023,""
"Physician Health Care Visits for Mental Health and Substance Use During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Ontario, Canada","Physicians self-report high levels of symptoms of anxiety and depression, and surveys suggest these symptoms have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is not known whether pandemic-related stressors have led to increases in health care visits related to mental health or substance use among physicians. To evaluate the association between the COVID-19 pandemic and changes in outpatient health care visits by physicians related to mental health and substance use and explore differences across physician subgroups of interest. A population-based cohort study was conducted using health administrative data collected from the universal health system (Ontario Health Insurance Plan) of Ontario, Canada, from March 1, 2017, to March 10, 2021. Participants included 34Ã¢â‚¬Â¯055 physicians, residents, and fellows who registered with the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario between 1990 and 2018 and were eligible for the Ontario Health Insurance Plan during the study period. Autoregressive integrated moving average models and generalized estimating equations were used in analyses. The period during the COVID-19 pandemic (March 11, 2020, to March 10, 2021) compared with the period before the pandemic. The primary outcome was in-person, telemedicine, and virtual care outpatient visits to a psychiatrist or family medicine and general practice clinicians related to mental health and substance use. In the 34Ã¢â‚¬Â¯055 practicing physicians (mean [SD] age, 41.7 [10.0] years, 17 918 [52.6%] male), the annual crude number of visits per 1000 physicians increased by 27%, from 816.8 before the COVID-19 pandemic to 1037.5 during the pandemic (adjusted incident rate ratio per physician, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.07-1.19). The absolute proportion of physicians with 1 or more mental health and substance use visits within a year increased from 12.3% before to 13.4% during the pandemic (adjusted odds ratio, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.03-1.14). The relative increase was significantly greater in physicians without a prior mental health and substance use history (adjusted incident rate ratio, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.60-1.85) than in physicians with a prior mental health and substance use history. In this study, the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a substantial increase in mental health and substance use visits among physicians.

To determine if depressive symptoms are associated with greater likelihood of believing vaccine-related misinformation. This survey study analyzed responses from 2 waves of a 50-state nonprobability internet survey conducted between May and July 2021, in which depressive symptoms were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item (PHQ-9). Survey respondents were aged 18 and older. Population-reweighted multiple logistic regression was used to examine the association between moderate or greater depressive symptoms and endorsement of at least 1 item of vaccine misinformation, adjusted for sociodemographic features. The association between depressive symptoms in May and June, and new support for misinformation in the following wave was also examined. Depressive symptoms. The main outcome was endorsing any of 4 common vaccine-related statements of misinformation. Among 15Ã¢â‚¬Â¯464 survey respondents (9834 [63.6%] women and 5630 [36.4%] men; 722 Asian respondents [4.7%], 1494 Black respondents [9.7%], 1015 Hispanic respondents [6.6%], and 11Ã¢â‚¬Â¯863 White respondents [76.7%]; mean [SD] age, 47.9 [17.5] years), 4164 respondents (26.9%) identified moderate or greater depressive symptoms on the PHQ-9, and 2964 respondents (19.2%) endorsed at least 1 vaccine-related statement of misinformation. Presence of depression was associated with increased likelihood of endorsing misinformation (crude odds ratio [OR], 2.33; 95% CI, 2.09-2.61; adjusted OR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.91-2.43). Respondents endorsing at least 1 misinformation item were significantly less likely to be vaccinated (crude OR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.36-0.45; adjusted OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.40-0.51) and more likely to report vaccine resistance (crude OR, 2.54; 95% CI, 2.21-2.91; adjusted OR, 2.68; 95% CI, 2.89-3.13). Among 2809 respondents who answered a subsequent survey in July, presence of depression in the first survey was associated with greater likelihood of endorsing more misinformation compared with the prior survey (crude OR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.42-2.75; adjusted OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.14-2.33). This survey study found that individuals with moderate or greater depressive symptoms were more likely to endorse vaccine-related misinformation, cross-sectionally and at a subsequent survey wave. While this study design cannot address causation, the association between depression and spread and impact of misinformation merits further investigation.","Perlis, Ognyanova, Santillana, Lin, Druckman, Lazer, Green, Simonson, Baum, Della Volpe","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.45697","20220124","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",26025,""
"Posttraumatic Stress Disorder in Nurses During a Pandemic: Implications for Nurse Leaders","This study aimed to explore the association between nurses' practice environment (NPE), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and intent to leave among nurses working during the COVID-19 pandemic. High levels of physiological and psychological stress in the workplace render nurses susceptible to PTSD. To date, little research has focused on the relationship between NPE, PTSD, and intent to leave during a major health crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional online survey was completed by nurses who were members of northeastern and midwestern state nurses' associations. Approximately 44% of nurses sampled indicated a preference for leaving their position. Significant associations were identified between NPE and PTSD and between NPE and intent to leave. This assessment of nurses working during the COVID-19 pandemic may inform future mental health strategies and stress management interventions that support nurses continuing to work during a major health crisis.","Zeiher, Sego, Trimmer, Bowers","https://doi.org/10.1097/NNA.0000000000001112","20220124","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",26026,""

"Long COVID-19: Objectifying most self-reported neurological symptoms","We aimed to objectify and compare persisting self-reported symptoms in initially hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients after infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by applying clinical standardized measures. We conducted a cross-sectional study of adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection including medical history, neurological examination, blood markers, neuropsychological testing, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Fifty patients with persisting symptoms for at least 4Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks were included and classified by initial hospitalization status. Median time from SARS-CoV-2 detection to investigation was 29.3Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks (range 3.3-57.9). Although individual cognitive performance was generally within the normative range in both groups, mostly mild deficits were found in attention, executive functions, and memory. Hospitalized patients performed worse in global cognition, logical reasoning, and processes of verbal memory. In both groups, fatigue severity was associated with reduced performance in attention and psychomotor speed tasks (r<sub>s</sub> Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.40, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05) and reduced quality of life (EQ5D, r<sub>s</sub> Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.57, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and with more persisting symptoms (median 3 vs. 6, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01). PROMs identified fatigue, reduced sleep quality, and increased anxiety and depression in both groups but more pronounced in non-hospitalized patients.

"Comparison of sleep quality among puerperal women before and during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional survey in Lanzhou, China","Few studies have yet examined sleep quality among puerperal women during theÃ‚Â coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This cross-sectional study aimed to compare the sleep quality of puerperal women before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Lanzhou, China. The study exploreed the factors that affect sleep quality among puerperal women. The study population comprised puerperal women who went to the obstetric department of the Gansu Provincial Maternity and Childcare Hospital on the 42nd day after childbirth. Sleep quality was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Data were collected by doctors in the obstetric department before the COVID-19 pandemic (Oct.-Dec. 2019) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (Feb.-Apr. 2020) in China. Multiple linear regressions were used to examine the association between the sleep quality of puerperal women and COVID-19 andÃ‚Â to identify factors that affect the total PSQI scores. In 2019, 546 puerperal women were assessed compared with 655Ã‚Â who were assessed in 2020. Compared with before COVID-19, the total PSQI scores of puerperal women improved during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the influencing factors of sleep quality among puerperal women were the pandemicÃ‚Â itself, age, conception method, and postpartum depression (PPD). In contrast with other studies, there was no evidence for worsening sleep quality of puerperal women during the COVID-19 pandemic in Lanzhou, China.

"Maladaptive Changes in Delay Discounting in Males during the Covid-19 Pandemic: The Predictive Role Of Functional Connectome","The Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) and measures to curb it created population-level changes in male-dominant impulsive and risky behaviors such as violent crimes and gambling. One possible explanation for this is that the pandemic has been stressful, and males, more so than females, tend to respond to stress by altering their focus on immediate versus delayed rewards, as reflected in their delay discounting rates. Delay discounting rates from healthy undergraduate students were collected twice during the pandemic. Discounting rates of males (n=190) but not of females (n=493) increased during the pandemic. Using machine learning, we show that prepandemic functional connectome predict increased discounting rates in males (n=88). Moreover, considering that delay discounting is associated with multiple psychiatric disorders, we found the same neural pattern that predicted increased discounting rates in this study, in secondary datasets of patients with major depression and schizophrenia. The findings point to sex-based differences in maladaptive delay discounting under real-world stress events, and to connectome-based neuromarkers of such effects. They can explain why there was a population-level increase in several impulsive and risky behaviors during the pandemic and point to intriguing questions about the shared underlying mechanisms of stress responses, psychiatric disorders and delay discounting.","Xiao, Chen, Chen, Gao, He, Wang, Lei, Qiu, Feng, Chen, Turel, Bechara, He","https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhab505","20220121","intertemporal choice; mental disorders; neural substrates; pandemic; sex-based difference","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",26032,""
"Psychological Distress During COVID-19 Curfews and Social Distancing in Saudi Arabia: A Cross-Sectional Study","<b>Background:</b> Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread to over 150 countries worldwide. Since the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Saudi Arabia, cases have continued to escalate exponentially. The COVID-19 outbreak has had a negative effect on mental health and well-being. The study aimed to investigate the effects of the strict national regulations associated with the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. <b>Methods:</b> This was a cross-sectional study of a convenience sample of Saudi residents. Saudi residents aged 18 years or older were invited to complete an online questionnaire after one month of a nationwide 24-h curfew between May 6, 2020 and May 13, 2020. We measured psychological distress using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). We ran binary logistic regression analyses to detect variables that significantly predicted DASS-21 scores. <b>Results:</b> A sample of 2252 participants was recruited from the general population of Saudi Arabia. The DASS-21 score means and standard deviations for depression and anxiety for the whole sample (10.73 Ã‚Â± 10.29 and 6.98 Ã‚Â± 8.30, respectively) were in the range of mild depression and anxiety. In contrast, the mean DASS-21 stress score was within the normal range (11.97 Ã‚Â± 10.80).

We aimed to investigate the prevalence of anxiety and depression and risk factors among patients with cardiovascular disease in the post-pandemic period. <b>Method:</b> A cross-sectional survey was conducted through opportunistic and snowball sampling in southeast China from 10 October to 24 November. Anxiety and depression were assessed on the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS). <b>Results:</b> A total of 435 patients with hypertension (48.05%), atrial fibrillation (17.24%), coronary artery disease (14.48%), heart failure (9.89%) and other heart diseases (10.34%) completed the survey. Interestingly, most patients reported monthly income comparable to (90.11%) or even greater than (8.51%) pre-pandemic income. The occurrence of anxiety and depression was 11.72 and 9.20%, respectively. Marital status and treatment interruption during the pandemic were independent risk factors for both anxiety and depression. Moreover, current monthly income and access to telemedicine during the pandemic were independent risk factors for anxiety. <b>Conclusion:</b> Patients with cardiovascular disease may experience anxiety and depression not only because of disease complications but also because of the effects of the pandemic.

Potential harm to self and baby due to COVID-19 infection as well as uncertainties about delivery are among contributors to maternal anxiety. We aimed to assess the prevalence of psychological distress among pregnant women during the Malaysian Movement Control Order (MCO). <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional study was conducted between May and June 2020 in a teaching hospital in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. A self-administered electronic questionnaire was distributed which included the following; (1) Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS 21), (2) Short Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (SWEMWBS), (3) MCO effect questionnaire, and (4) newly designed COVID-19 pregnancy-related anxiety. Chi-square test and logistic regression were performed to determine significant associations whilst mean scores comparison were conducted through Mann-Whitney-<i>U</i>-test. <b>Results:</b> Four hundred and fifteen women were included in the final analysis. The prevalence of psychological distress among our cohort was 14.7%; with a two-fold increase of risk among the non-Malays (AOR 1.98, 95% CI 1.00-3.89) whilst a greater number of social support showed a protective effect (AOR 0.51, 95%CI 0.28-0.92). Malay ethnicity (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) alongside greater household income (<i>p</i> = 0.014) were positive predictors of a higher sense of maternal wellbeing. Multiparous women and those of higher economic status experienced the more negative effect of the MCO. Around 88% of our women reported a higher level of COVID-19 pregnancy-related anxiety. Younger (<i>p</i> = 0.017) and first-time mothers (<i>p</i> = 0.039) were more likely to be anxious. Although adequate maternal knowledge on COVID-19 was associated with a greater sense of maternal wellbeing (<i>p</i> = 0.028), it was also linked to a higher level of COVID-19 related anxiety (AOR 3.54, 95% 1.29-9.70). <b>Conclusion:</b> There was a relatively low prevalence of psychological distress among expectant mothers in Malaysia during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.

"The Psychological Nursing Interventions Based on Pygmalion Effect Could Alleviate Negative Emotions of Patients with Suspected COVID-19 Patients: a Retrospective Analysis","This study aims to explore the psychological status of suspected COVID-19 patients during quarantine and put forward a new yet effective psychological nursing strategy for intervention. We performed a retrospective study with suspected COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized to the two hospitals of Hunan province, China and accepted the intervention of psychological nursing from 01/2020 to 03/2020. The control group received routine psychological nursing care and the observation group received the new psychological nursing intervention according to Pygmalion effect. A total of 89 objects were included in the analysis. Results of the questionnaire before intervention showed that the majority of isolated suspected COVID-19 patients showed negative emotions, with the incidence of depression (51.69%), anxiety (14.617%), inverted provocation (22.47%), extraverted provocation (25.84%). And the extraverted provocation scores of female patients was significantly higher than that of male counterparts (P &lt; 0.05). At discharge, compared with the control group, the scores of depression, anxiety, introversion and extraversion of patients in the observation group were significantly lower after nursing intervention based on Pygmalion effect. The satisfaction rate of psychological care based on Pygmalion effect was 86.66%. Suspected COVID-19 patients tend to show the symptoms of depression, anxiety and irritation during quarantine.

"Adolescents' psychosocial well-being one year after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Norway","The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically restricted adolescents' lives. We used nationwide Norwegian survey data from 2014-2021 (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°227,258; ages 13-18) to examine psychosocial outcomes in adolescents before and during the pandemic. Multilevel models revealed higher depressive symptoms and less optimistic future life expectations during the pandemic, even when accounting for the measures' time trends. Moreover, alcohol and cannabis use decreased, and screen time increased. However, the effect sizes of all observed changes during the pandemic were small. Overall, conduct problems and satisfaction with social relationships remained stable.

"The times, they are a-changin': tracking shifts in mental health signals from early phase to later phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia","Widespread problems of psychological distress have been observed in many countries following the outbreak of COVID-19, including Australia. What is lacking from current scholarship is a national-scale assessment that tracks the shifts in mental health during the pandemic timeline and across geographic contexts. Drawing on 244Ã¢â‚¬â€°406 geotagged tweets in Australia from 1 January 2020 to 31 May 2021, we employed machine learning and spatial mapping techniques to classify, measure and map changes in the Australian public's mental health signals, and track their change across the different phases of the pandemic in eight Australian capital cities. Australians' mental health signals, quantified by sentiment scores, have a shift from pessimistic (early pandemic) to optimistic (middle pandemic), reflected by a 174.1% (95% CI 154.8 to 194.5) increase in sentiment scores. However, the signals progressively recessed towards a more pessimistic outlook (later pandemic) with a decrease in sentiment scores by 48.8% (95% CI 34.7 to 64.9). Such changes in mental health signals vary across capital cities. We set out a novel empirical framework using social media to systematically classify, measure, map and track the mental health of a nation. Our approach is designed in a manner that can readily be augmented into an ongoing monitoring capacity and extended to other nations. Tracking locales where people are displaying elevated levels of pessimistic mental health signals provide important information for the smart deployment of finite mental health services. This is especially critical in a time of crisis during which resources are stretched beyond normal bounds.","Wang, Huang, Hu, Zhang, Li, Ning, Corcoran, Khan, Liu, Zhang, Li","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2021-007081","20220121","COVID-19; mental health &amp; psychiatry; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",26039,""
"Longitudinal survey on the Psychological Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Healthcare Workers (PsyCOVer) in France: study protocol","In the pandemic, healthcare professionals face even higher levels of stress. It is therefore a priority to estimate the impact of the pandemic on mental health and to propose targeted strategies to improve resilience. The aims of the study were to (1) assess the mental health of healthcare professionals working with patients with COVID-19 and identify social determinants that may increase the risk of negative outcomes; and (2) test the effectiveness of an intervention to improve the resilience of healthcare professionals in France. To evaluate the first objective, a national longitudinal study will be carried out among healthcare professionals working with patients with COVID-19. Participants will be recruited via an internet link that will be widely disseminated on social media, mailing lists, medical boards and French medical journals. Primary outcomes are mental health distress/symptoms and resilience. Secondary outcomes are burnout, social and occupational supports and substance use. To meet the second objective, an interventional study will be conducted. The main outcome is the effectiveness of the PsySTART-Responder and the Anticipate.Plan.Deter program. Qualitative analyses will be conducted to understand the strategies used to cope with the pandemic. The study protocol was approved by the <i>Sorbonne UniversitÃƒÂ©</i> Ethical Committee (No 2020-CER-2020-27) and was declared to French Commission on Information Technology and Liberties, CNIL (NÃ‚Â°2222413, 20-05-2021).

"The interplay between partisanship, risk perception, and mental distress during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States","COVID-19 is a profoundly partisan issue in the U.S., with increasing polarization of the Republicans' and Democrats' responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and their precautionary actions to reduce virus transmission. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether and how partisan gaps in many aspects of the pandemic are linked to mental health, which has increasingly been a major concern. This study examined the association between political partisanship and mental health by assessing the mediating and moderating relationships between risk perception, expected infection severity of COVID-19, and partisanship in terms of mental health during the early stages of the pandemic. The data were drawn from a cross-sectional web survey conducted between March 20 and 30, 2020, with a sample of U.S. adults (<i>N</i> =Ã‚Â 4,327). Of those participants, 38.9% and 29.6% were Democrats and Republicans, respectively. The results indicate that Democrats were more likely to experience COVID-induced mental distress than Republicans, and higher risk perception and expected infection severity were associated with mental distress. Furthermore, risk perception and expected infection severity of COVID-19 mediated approximately 24%-34% of the associations between political partisanship and mental distress. Finally, the adverse mental health impact of risk perception and expected infection severity appeared to be much stronger for Republicans than Democrats. The findings suggest that political partisanship is a key factor to understanding mental health consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak in the U.S.","Kwon","https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2022.2029916","20220121","Partisanship; mental distress; pandemic; risk perception","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",26041,""

This study aimed to investigate the impacts of COVID-19 on the mental health and sexual behaviour of male physicians working during the pandemic. A survey was carried out on male physicians working in Turkey during the pandemic. Participants' sexual behaviours, anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms were assessed. The frequency of anxiety and depressive symptoms was 55.9% and 44.1%, respectively. Among the 102 participants, 35.3% reported decreased sexual desire, and 41.2% reported decreased sexual intercourse. Working more, caring for COVID-19 patients, having higher scores for anxiety and depressive symptoms were related to changes in sexual behaviour.

"Associations of consequences of coronavirus pandemic with anxiety, depression and loneliness: moderating effects of internal resources","The influence of personal internal resources (IRs) on coping with traumatic events is constantly researched. This study aimed to determine how the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic affected anxiety, depression, and loneliness in two groups at different levels of exposure (low and high) to the infection. We analysed the impact of IRs in the form of the level of hope and self-efficacy on mental reactions (anxiety and depression) and social well-being (loneliness). The study was conducted as an internet survey. Descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and difference tests were used for preliminary analyses. Structural equation models (SEM) were used for multivariate data analysis. The SEM model revealed that people working in a profession with a higher risk of infection coped better in the pandemic. We observed a higher level of IRs in the higher exposure group, and the consequences were less pronounced. We concluded by stating that the level of hope and sense of self-efficacy could moderate the response in a pandemic situation and constitute protective factors against psychopathological symptoms.","Stefaniak, Janicki, Ã…Å¡witaj, SzykuÃ…â€ša-Piec, Grabowska-Lepczak","https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2022.2029504","20220121","COVID-19; Internal resources; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",26043,""
"Psychosocial influence of COVID-19 on healthcare workers","Aim To assess a psychosocial impact of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on health care workers and to quantify the size of depression symptoms, anxiety and stress levels. Methods This cross-sectional study used an anonymous online survey questionnaire as a research instrument and it included 114 health workers of all profiles from the Sarajevo Canton employed in private and public institutions. The research was voluntary, non-commercial and all participants provided an oral informed consent. Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) questionnaire was used for assessing emotional status of depression, anxiety and stress. Results The mean age of participants was 40.5Ã‚Â±8.44 years with male:female ratio of 0.28. Prevalence of depression was 46.5%, anxiety61.4%, and 36.9% stress. Age and gender had no effect on emotional status, but it was revealed that women achieved higher depression, anxiety and stress scores than men (without statistical significance). The most notable effect on the emotional state was found for direct or indirect contact with COVID-19 patients. Medical workers in direct contact with COVID-19 patients achieved greater depression (p=0.005), anxiety (p=0.001), stress (p=0.030) and total DASS-21 (p=0.003) scores. Conclusion High prevalence of health workers affected by various psychological ailments during the COVID-19 pandemic was found.

"Depression, anxiety, and stress in South Korea general population during the COVID-19 pandemic","To investigate the prevalence and risk factors of poor mental health in the general South Korean population during the COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sectional, population-based, online survey study was conducted from November 5, 2020 to November 20, 2020 and included adults aged 20-49 years in Chungnam Province, South Korea. A total of 549 adults were included. A total of 18.8% of the participants had symptoms of depression, 10.6% had symptoms of anxiety, and 5.1% had a high level of perceived stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Higher levels of stress (OR, 3.13 [95% CI, 1.13-8.67]), anxiety (OR, 2.23 [95% CI, 1.09-4.49]), and depression (OR, 3.00 [95% CI, 1.64-5.50]) were found among never married, widowed, divorced, and separated people compared to married/cohabiting/partnered subjects. Subjects who felt increased stress at home during the COVID-19 outbreak reported more depression (OR, 2.45 [95% CI, 1.49-4.05]) and anxiety (OR, 2.42 [95% CI, 1.31-4.50]).

"Changes in Dietary Intake Patterns and Weight Status during the COVID-19 Lockdown: A Cross-Sectional Study Focusing on Young Adults in Malaysia","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) isolation has altered individuals' food purchasing behaviour and dietary intake patterns. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the changes in dietary intake patterns and their impacts on the weight status of young adults in Malaysia during the COVID-19 lockdown. This cross-sectional study involved 1045 young adults in Malaysia. The changes in dietary intake patterns were assessed using the Dietary Diversity Questionnaire with slight modifications, while anthropometric measurements including body height, body weight before the pandemic and current body weight were self-reported. Overall, nearly half of the respondents (48.8%) gained weight during the confinement, with an average increment of 4.06 Ã‚Â± 3.23 kg. Of 1045, 45.3% reported consuming more fruits and 60.2% had higher plain water intake during the pandemic. It is observed that 41.0% to 66.8% of the young adults changed their dietary intake patterns during the pandemic. Increased consumption in cereals and grains (ÃŽÂ² = 0.084, <i>p</i> = 0.015, 95% CI = 0.017-0.160), as well as oils and fats (ÃŽÂ² = 0.123, <i>p</i> = 0.001, 95% CI = 0.059-0.241), was positively associated with weight gain during the pandemic. On the contrary, an increased plain water intake was negatively associated with weight gain during the lockdown (ÃŽÂ² = -0.100, <i>p</i> = 0.003, 95% CI = -0.171--0.034). Findings in the current study also suggested that cutting back cereals and grains (ÃŽÂ² = 0.156, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, 95% CI = 0.122-0.288), as well as oils and fats (ÃŽÂ² = 0.091, <i>p</i> = 0.012, 95% CI = 0.022-0.183), contributed significantly to weight loss during the pandemic confinement. In conclusion, the enforcement of the Movement Control Order (MCO) drove up the prevalence of overweight/obesity among young adults in Malaysia. Increased consumption of cereals and grains and oils and fats contributed to weight gain in the pandemic lockdown. Nonetheless, a noticeable proportion of young adults in Malaysia shifted to a healthier food choice by increasing the consumption of fruits and vegetables.","Tan, Tan, Tan","https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14020280","20220121","COVID-19; dietary intake patterns; weight status; young adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",26046,""
"Critical Issues of Working during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Italian Healthcare Workers' Experience","<i>Background</i>: The COVID-19 pandemic has strongly impacted on healthcare services' organization and healthcare workers' mental health, increasing the risk of psychological symptoms and burnout. Italy has been one of the most affected countries, especially the northern regions, even with exceptions in some rural provinces. <i>Aim</i>: We chose to investigate the mental health conditions of healthcare workers operating in the rural province of Rovigo (a small town in Veneto, northern Italy), where relatively few deaths and contagions were reported during the pandemic, even if Veneto-globally-was one of the most affected regions of Italy. We wanted to verify the psychological outcomes of health workers operating in a context where the impact of the pandemic appeared to be relatively mild. <i>Methods</i>: Through an online survey, we investigated perceived difficulties at work and in daily life, perceived loneliness and social support, coping strategies, and level of psychological distress (sample size: 749; mean age = 48.04 years, SD = 10.66). The questionnaire had both open- (2) and close-ended questions (5 single-choice and 13 multiple-choice). We verified possible associations between sex, age group, work department and percentage of responses with chi-square tests of independence on each question. Data cleaning excluded all contradictory answers from the multiple-choice questions from the analyses (final sample size: 640). <i>Results</i>: Frontliners and non-frontliners reported a similar experience of the COVID-19 pandemic (without significant differences in perceived difficulties, coping strategies and sources of support). Nevertheless, they still reported various forms of negative emotions (e.g., helplessness-40.94%; sadness-36.56%; frustration-32.66%) and lack of support from the health organization (especially frontliners-28.72%). However, psychological help was scarcely requested. <i>Conclusions</i>: Despite the province not being massively affected by the pandemic, healthcare workers felt the need for clearer and more supportive guidance. They seem to perceive collective opportunities to share needs and difficulties as more useful than individual interventions (as those provided by the ad hoc created listening service).","Vicentini, Mercurio, Romascu, Battaglia, Tribbia, Siviero, Grossi, Martucci, De Leo","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19020927","20220121","COVID-19; Italy; healthcare workers; mental health; online survey","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",26047,""
"Psychological Impact and Compliance with Staying at Home of the Public to COVID-19 Outbreak during Chinese Spring Festival","In December 2019, COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan, China. Most of the studies related to the psychological impact and compliance with staying at home due to COVID-19 focused on ten days or one month after the initial ""stay-at-home"" phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. The early psychological impact and behavior change to COVID-19 during the Chinese Spring Festival (the start time for recommendations to stay at home) is uncertain. In this study, people from 23 provinces in China were recruited to participate in an online survey, using Credamo. Psychological impact and compliance with staying at home were evaluated by a self-designed and validated questionnaire. The results indicated that anxiety was the most often reported feeling (mean: 3.69), followed by sadness (mean: 3.63). Participants employed in foreign-owned companies were most likely to express anxiety and sadness. Overall, 61.8% of participants reported hardly going out, whereas 2.4% said they frequently went out during the initial ""stay-at-home"" phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants with higher levels of anxiety and sadness were most likely to stay at home against the spread of COVID-19, as were female gender. This survey is an important study of the first reaction to staying at home during the initial ""stay-at-home"" phase coinciding with Chinese Spring Festival. Our findings identified factors associated with higher level of psychological impact and better compliance with staying at home recommendations during Chinese Spring Festival.

"Why the World Should Not Follow the Failed United States Model of Fighting Domestic Hunger","Many industrialized nations have followed the lead of the United States (US) in reducing workers' wages and cutting government safety nets, while giving their populaces the false impression that non-governmental organizations can meet the food and basic survival needs of their low-income residents. The history of the last 50 years and the global COVID-19 pandemic demonstrate why that is a mistake, leading to vastly increased household food insecurity, poverty, and hunger. This paper takes a close look at US data to help to better understand the significant impact US federal government policy measures had on limiting hunger throughout the pandemic and how we can learn from these outcomes to finally end hunger in America and other developed nations. The top three policy prescriptions vital in ending household food insecurity in the US and industrialized countries are as follows: (1) to create jobs; raise wages; make high quality healthcare and prescription medicine free; and ensure that high quality childcare, education, transportation, and broad-band access are affordable to all; (2) to enact a comprehensive ""Assets Empowerment Agenda"" to help low-income people move from owing to owning in order to develop middle-class wealth; and (3) when the above two steps are inadequate, ensure a robust government safety net for struggling residents that provides cash, food, and housing assistance.","Berg, Gibson","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19020814","20220121","COVID-19; food banks; food insecurity; hunger","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",26051,""

"Variation in Cause-Specific Mortality Rates in Italy during the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Study Based on Nationwide Data","Italy was a country severely hit by the first coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic wave in early 2020. Mortality studies have focused on the overall excess mortality observed during the pandemic. This paper investigates the cause-specific mortality in Italy from March 2020 to April 2020 and the variation in mortality rates compared with those in 2015-2019 regarding sex, age, and epidemic area. Causes of death were derived from the national cause-of-death register. COVID-19 was the leading cause of death among males and the second leading cause among females. Chronic diseases, such as diabetes and hypertensive, ischemic heart, and cerebrovascular diseases, with decreasing or stable mortality rates in 2015-2019, showed a reversal in the mortality trend. Moreover, mortality due to pneumonia and influenza increased. No increase in neoplasm mortality was observed. Among external causes of death, mortality increased for accidental falls but reduced for transport accidents and suicide. Mortality from causes other than COVID-19 increased similarly in both genders and more at ages 65 years or above. Compared with other areas in Italy, the Lombardy region showed the largest excess in mortality for all leading causes. Underdiagnosis of COVID-19 at the beginning of the pandemic may, to some extent, explain the mortality increase for some causes of death, especially pneumonia and other respiratory diseases.","Grande, Fedeli, Pappagallo, Crialesi, Marchetti, Minelli, Iavarone, Frova, Onder, Grippo","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19020805","20220121","COVID-19; Italy; causes of death; mortality; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",26053,""
"Occupational Stressors and Access to COVID-19 Resources among Commuting and Residential Hispanic/Latino Farmworkers in a US-Mexico Border Region","Hispanic/Latino and migrant workers experience high degrees of occupational stress, constitute most of California's agricultural workforce, and were among the most impacted populations by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, relatively little is known about the occupational stress experienced by farmworkers who commute daily between the US and Mexico. Occupational stress is considered an imbalance between the demands at work and the capabilities to respond in the context of the workforce. The goal of this study is to determine the type and severity of stressors in daytime and resident farmworkers and how COVID-19 vaccination status contributes to these stressors. Interviews containing the Migrant Farmworker Stress Inventory (MSWSI) were administered to a sample of 199 Hispanic/Latino farmworkers in Imperial County, a multi-billion-dollar agriculture sector in the US. Principal factor analysis differentiated latent factors in the MFSWI. Simple linear regression models and correlations identified associations between MFWSI scores and sample characteristics. The MFWSI reduced to five stressor domains: Health and Well-Being Vulnerabilities, Inadequate Standards of Living/Unknown Conditions of Living, Working Conditions, Working Environment, and Language Barriers. Approximately 40 percent of the respondents reported significant stress levels, with foreign-born (<i>p</i> = 0.014) and older respondents (<i>p</i> = 0.0415) being more likely to experience elevated stress regardless of their nighttime residence. We found that Spanish-language COVID-19 outreach might have been particularly effective for workers who reported high stress from English-language communication (<i>p</i> = 0.001). Moreover, our findings point to the importance of worker and human rights to mitigate the high-stress foreign-born workers who live in Mexico and the US experience.","Keeney, Quandt, VillaseÃƒÂ±or, Flores, Flores","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19020763","20220121","COVID-19; Hispanic/Latino farmworkers; US-Mexico border; mental health; migrant stress; precarious workers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",26054,""
"Tokophobia and Anxiety in Pregnant Women during the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic in Poland-A Prospective Cross-Sectional Study","SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus emerged in the world at the end of 2019. The introduction of a number of restrictions had a significant effect on numerous aspects of human life with particular influence being exerted on pregnant women and their sense of security. The study aimed to assess the level of anxiety and its main determinants in women in the third trimester of pregnancy during the coronavirus pandemic. The study technique included the present purposely designed questionnaire, Labor Anxiety Questionnaire (KLPII), and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). The study was conducted in a group of 315 women in the third trimester of pregnancy. A total of 258 women (81.9%) completed the questionnaire in May 2020, and 57 of them (18.1%) completed it in October 2020. The overall analysis of the Labor Anxiety Questionnaire and the STAI inventory revealed a high level of anxiety, particularly situational anxiety, in pregnant women during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The age and financial status of the women were the factors which contributed to the intensification of tokophobia. Women interviewed in October 2020 were characterized by higher tokophobia levels compared to the respondents included in May 2020. It seems justified to in-crease the vigilance in the diagnostics of possible mental disorders in the perinatal period during pandemic.","Makara-StudziÃ…â€žska, ZarÃ„â„¢ba, Kawa, Matuszyk","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19020714","20220121","SARS-CoV-2; perinatal anxiety; perinatal depression; perinatal stress; tokophobia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",26055,""
"Nanotechnologies in Delivery of DNA and mRNA Vaccines to the Nasal and Pulmonary Mucosa","Recent advancements in the field of in vitro transcribed mRNA (IVT-mRNA) vaccination have attracted considerable attention to such vaccination as a cutting-edge technique against infectious diseases including COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2. While numerous pathogens infect the host through the respiratory mucosa, conventional parenterally administered vaccines are unable to induce protective immunity at mucosal surfaces. Mucosal immunization enables the induction of both mucosal and systemic immunity, efficiently removing pathogens from the mucosa before an infection occurs. Although respiratory mucosal vaccination is highly appealing, successful nasal or pulmonary delivery of nucleic acid-based vaccines is challenging because of several physical and biological barriers at the airway mucosal site, such as a variety of protective enzymes and mucociliary clearance, which remove exogenously inhaled substances. Hence, advanced nanotechnologies enabling delivery of DNA and IVT-mRNA to the nasal and pulmonary mucosa are urgently needed. Ideal nanocarriers for nucleic acid vaccines should be able to efficiently load and protect genetic payloads, overcome physical and biological barriers at the airway mucosal site, facilitate transfection in targeted epithelial or antigen-presenting cells, and incorporate adjuvants. In this review, we discuss recent developments in nucleic acid delivery systems that target airway mucosa for vaccination purposes.","Tang, Cai, Xu, Sun, Liu, Rosenecker, Guan","https://doi.org/10.3390/nano12020226","20220121","DNA vaccine; intranasal delivery; mRNA vaccine; mucosal immune response; nanoparticles; pulmonary delivery","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",26056,""
"Post-Intensive Care Syndrome in Survivors from Critical Illness including COVID-19 Patients: A Narrative Review","Current achievements in medical science and technological advancements in intensive care medicine have allowed better support of critically ill patients in intensive care units (ICUs) and have increased survival probability. Post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) is a relatively new term introduced almost 10 years ago, defined as ""new or worsening impairments in physical, cognitive, or mental health status arising after critical illness and persisting beyond acute care hospitalization"". A significant percentage of critically ill patients suffer from PICS for a prolonged period of time, with physical problems being the most common. The exact prevalence of PICS is unknown, and many risk factors have been described well. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) survivors seem to be at especially high risk for developing PICS. The families of ICU survivors can also be affected as a response to the stress suffered during the critical illness of their kin. This separate entity is described as PICS family (PICS-F). A multidisciplinary approach is warranted for the treatment of PICS, involving healthcare professionals, clinicians, and scientists from different areas. Improving outcomes is both challenging and imperative for the critical care community. The review of the relevant literature and the study of the physical, cognitive, and mental sequelae could lead to the prevention and timely management of PICS and the subsequent improvement of the quality of life for ICU survivors.","Vrettou, Mantziou, Vassiliou, Orfanos, Kotanidou, Dimopoulou","https://doi.org/10.3390/life12010107","20220121","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; post-intensive care syndrome; post-traumatic stress disorder; quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",26057,""
"Mental Health Well-Being and Attitudes on Mental Health Disorders among Family Physicians during COVID-19 Pandemic: A Connection with Resilience and Healthy Lifestyle","Family physicians (FPs) are exposed to high amounts of stress, and could be susceptible to the development of mental health disorders (MHD), especially after the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of the current study was to assess MHD history, attitudes toward MHDs and stress-coping strategies in FPs. An additional goal was to estimate their comprehensive well-being and investigate connections with resilience and a healthy lifestyle. A total of 483 FPs submitted their responses via online survey. MHD attitudes were assessed with the according questionnaires, while burnout levels, healthy lifestyle, resilience, job and life satisfaction were estimated with validated scales. Results have shown that 32.5% of FPs disclosed positive MHD history, while 68.7% used professional help. Resilience and healthy lifestyle levels were significantly higher in MHD negative FPs (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), while burnout levels were lower (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Moreover, healthy lifestyle (ÃŽÂ² = 0.03, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) was an independent correlate of resilience, while healthy lifestyle (ÃŽÂ² = -0.35, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, and resilience (ÃŽÂ² = -1.82, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) were of burnout levels. Finally, resilience (OR = 0.387, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and healthy lifestyle (OR = 0.970, <i>p</i> = 0.021) were shown as independent predictors of positive MHD history status. Strong promotion and education of FP population regarding resilience and healthy lifestyle should be utilized in practice in order to alleviate the possibility of mental health disturbances and the according consequences.","Vilovic, Bozic, Zuzic Furlan, Vilovic, Kumric, Martinovic, Rusic, Rada, Tomicic","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm11020438","20220121","COVID-19; family physician; healthy lifestyle; help-seeking; mental health; primary care; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",26058,""
"Burnout, Depression and Sense of Coherence in Nurses during the Pandemic Crisis","During the COVID-19 pandemic, the risk to nurses' mental health has increased rapidly. The aim of the study was to investigate the prevalence of depression and burnout and to evaluate their possible association with the sense of coherence in nursing staff during the pandemic crisis. The Copenhagen Burnout Inventory questionnaire, Beck's Depression Inventory, and the Sense of Coherence questionnaire were completed by 101 male and 559 female nurses. Individual and demographic data were recorded. Regarding depression, 25.5% of respondents exhibited mild depression, 13.5% moderate depression and 7.6% severe depression. In the burnout scale, 47.1% had a pathological value. Female nurses had higher burnout (<i>t</i> test <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01, 49.03 vs. 38.74) and depression (<i>t</i> test <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01, 11.29 vs. 6.93) scores compared to men and lower levels in the sense of coherence (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05, 59.45 vs. 65.13). Regression evidenced that 43.7% of the variation in the BDI rating was explained by the CBI, while an additional 8.3% was explained by the sense of coherence. Mediation analysis indicated a partial mediation of burnout in the correlation between sense of coherence and depression. The sense of coherence acted as a negative regulator between burnout and depression.","Pachi, Sikaras, Ilias, Panagiotou, Zyga, Tsironi, Baras, Tsitrouli, Tselebis","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10010134","20220121","COVID-19; burnout; depression; nurses; sense of coherence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",26059,""
"Effect of Home-Based Tele-Pilates Intervention on Pregnant Women: A Pilot Study","Pilates is effective for training the core muscles and stabilizing the hip joints, which provides relief from pelvic pain and low back pain during pregnancy. However, there are no specific guidelines on appropriate physical exercises for pregnant women due to the current pandemic. We aimed to apply the exercise standard proposed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists to home-based tele-Pilates exercise (HTPE), to determine its effect on the physical and mental health of pregnant women. We randomly divided the subjects into the following two groups who completed 8 weeks of HTPE (50 min/day, 2 days/week): (a) Pilates exercise (PE, <i>n</i> = 7) and (B) non-Pilates exercise (CON, <i>n</i> = 7). HTPE was performed by adjusting the program every 3 weeks, based on pain and physical fitness levels. We measured body composition, muscles of the hip joint, pelvic tilt, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), before and after HTPE. Following HTPE, while the percentage of body fat and body mass index had significantly decreased, the body fat mass did not change in the PE group (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The PE group showed an increase in strength of the left and right hip flexion and hip abduction, compared to the CON group (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). The ODI and PSQI were significantly decreased in the PE group (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Therefore, the 8-week HTPE program is an effective exercise for pregnant woman that reduces body fat metabolism and strengthens muscles of the hip joint, thus alleviating pregnancy-induced low back pain and insomnia.","Hyun, Cho, Koo","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10010125","20220121","COVID-19; hip abduction; hip flexion; pelvic tilt; physical exercise; pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",26060,""
"Early Childhood Teachers of Color in New York City: heightened stress, lower quality of life, declining health, and compromised sleep amidst COVID-19","Stress and well-being are known to influence the quality of teacher-student interactions, teachers' delivery of emotional and instructional support, and the social competence and executive function skills of young learners-dynamics that impact the education and development of young children. Even prior to COVID-19, 46% of teachers reported notably high levels of daily stress. Given the additional stressors associated with the pandemic, this multi-methods study explores the well-being of Latinx, Black, and multiracial early childhood teachers in New York City, where communities of Color have been particularly hard hit by COVID-19. Via an amalgamation of descriptive and interpretive approaches-a survey, time-use diaries, and qualitative interviews-this study documents early childhood teachers' experiences making sense of and negotiating the impacts of intersecting stressors on their stress, health, quality of life, and sleep amidst COVID-19. Survey findings show reduced well-being across measures among the early childhood teachers in the sample, while qualitative findings illustrate the many layers of challenges that teachers of Color faced during the pandemic. Time-use diaries show extremely high demands and long work hours associated with concerning lack of self-care and attention to mental health. Interviews elucidate how stress is layered across environmental, occupational, and racial factors. This study points to the need to attend to the well-being of Black, Latinx, and multiracial early childhood teachers in urban settings during and after COVID-19 recovery.","Souto-Manning, Melvin","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecresq.2021.11.005","20220122","Black Teachers; COVID-19; Early Childhood Education; Early Childhood Teacher Support; Emotional Well-Being; Fatigue; Health; Humanizing Teachers of Color; Latinx Teachers; Multiracial Teachers; Pandemic; Perceived Stress; Quality of Life; Race; Sleep; Social Functioning; Stress Theory; Time Use; Urban Setting; Young Children","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",26061,""
"Offlineâ€“but not onlineâ€“autonomy and competence are associated with lower internalizing symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic among adolescents in PerÃº","Adolescent developmental tasks, including autonomy and competence, have been disrupted by COVID-19-related lockdowns around the world. In this observational study, we investigate how a sense of subjective autonomy and competence, both online and offline, relate to anxiety and depression during COVID-19 among 2,390 low and middle-income adolescents (11-17 years) in PerÃº. As we hypothesize, our data indicated that higher offlineâ€“and not onlineâ€“autonomy and competence were robustly associated with lower internalizing symptoms. While the online sphere might offer opportunities for adolescents to fulfill developmental tasks, we found that virtual experiencesâ€”even those that facilitate a sense of autonomy and competenceâ€”are insufficient means to cope with the negative effects of physical restrictions in the context of a global pandemic.","Estelle Berger et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0010-595-C12","20220125","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Adolescence; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; global south; adolescence; autonomy; digital technologies; competence; perÃº","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-26","",26062,""
