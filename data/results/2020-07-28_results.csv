"Mental health disorders and associated risk factors in quarantined adults during the COVID-19 outbreak in China: a cross-sectional study","People undergoing mass home- and community-based quarantine are vulnerable to mental health disorders during the COVID-19 outbreaks, but few studies have evaluated associated psychosocial factors. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of anxiety or depressive symptoms and identify associated demographic and psychosocial factors in the general Chinese population during the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine period. Participants aged 18 or above were recruited in a cross-sectional online survey using snowball sampling during February 26-29, 2020. The survey included questions on demographics, family relationships, chronic diseases, quarantine conditions, lifestyle, COVID-19 infection, and anxiety and depressive symptoms. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with elevated anxiety or depressive symptoms. Out of 2331 participants, 762 (32.7%) experienced elevated anxiety or depressive symptoms. Nine risk factors associated with anxiety or depressive symptoms included younger age, reduced income, having cancer or other chronic diseases, having family members living with cancer, concerns for COVID-19 infection for themselves or family members, living alone, having family conflicts, having &lt; 3 or &gt; 8 hours sedentary time per day, and worsened sleeping quality. The findings highlight an urgent need for psychological support for populations at high risk for elevated anxiety or depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreaks.","Guo, Cheng, Zeng, Li, Zhu, Yang, Xu, Li, Leng, Monroe-Wise, Wu","https://doi.org/10.2196/20328","20200727","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-28","",3478,""
"Anxiety and depression in the Republic of Ireland during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland resulted in a nationwide quarantine on March 27<sup>th</sup> , 2020. This study represents the first assessment of rates of anxiety and depression in the general population of Ireland during the pandemic. Our first aim was to estimate the probable prevalence rates of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and depression, and to identify sociodemographic risk factors associated with screening positive for GAD or depression. Our second aim was to determine if COVID-19 related anxiety was highest amongst those in society at greatest risk of morality from COVID-19. Self-report data was collected from a nationally representative Irish sample (N = 1,041) online between March 31<sup>st</sup> and April 5<sup>th</sup> ; the first week of the nationwide quarantine measures. Recognised cut-off scores on the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 were used to estimate rates of GAD and depression. Correlates of screening positive for GAD or depression were assessed using logistic regression analysis. GAD (20.0%), depression (22.8%), and GAD or depression (27.7%) were common. Screening positive for GAD or depression was associated with younger age, female sex, loss of income due to COVID-19, COVID-19 infection, and higher perceived risk of COVID-19 infection. Citizens aged 65 and older had significantly higher levels of COVID-19 related anxiety than adults aged 18-34. Initial results from this multi-wave study monitoring changes in population anxiety and depression throughout the pandemic indicate that GAD and depression were common experiences in the population during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hyland, Shevlin, McBride, Murphy, Karatzias, Bentall, Martinez, ValliÃƒÂ¨res","https://doi.org/10.1111/acps.13219","20200727","COVID-19; anxiety; coronavirus; depression; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-28","",3479,""

"Factors Influencing Anxiety of Health Care Workers in the Radiology Department with High Exposure Risk to COVID-19","BACKGROUND During the outbreak of COVID-19, health care workers in the radiology department frequently interact with suspected patients and face a higher risk of infection and sudden surges in workload. High anxiety levels seriously harm physical and mental health and affect work efficiency and patient safety. Therefore, it is critical to determine anxiety levels of health care workers and explore its risk factors. MATERIAL AND METHODS Self-Rating Anxiety Scale and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale were used to evaluate the anxiety and resilience of 364 health care workers with high exposure risk from the radiology departments of 32 public hospitals in Sichuan Province, China. Multivariate linear regression was used to analyze factors related to anxiety. RESULTS The mean anxiety score was 44.28Ã‚Â±8.93 and 23.4% of our study participants reported mild (n=63), moderate (n=19), or severe (n=3) anxiety. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that age, job position, availability of protective materials, signs of suspected symptoms, and susceptibility to emotions and behaviors of people around them were identified as risk factors for anxiety, whereas psychological resilience was identified as a protective factor. CONCLUSIONS Our study suggests that the anxiety level of health care workers in the radiology department with a high exposure risk to COVID-19 was high in the early stage of the outbreak, although the majority remained within normal limits. Timely assessment and effective intervention measures can improve the mental health of these at-risk populations.","Huang, Wang, Liu, Ye, Chen, Xu, Qu, Ning","https://doi.org/10.12659/MSM.926008","20200727","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-28","",3483,""
"The downstream effects of COVID-19: a call for supporting family wellbeing in the NICU","Parents of NICU infants are a vulnerable population from a psychological perspective, and often experience high levels of acute stress, depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress. The added burden of the current SARS CoV-2 disease (COVID-19) pandemic is likely to exacerbate these issues, with potential implications for the wellbeing of infants and families in the short- and long-term. In this paper, we propose utilizing the stress contagion framework and consider how psychosocial stress can &quot;spill over&quot; into the parent-infant relationship domain, which can impact child development and family wellbeing longer term. As the effects of the pandemic will likely persist well beyond the acute stage, we offer advocacy points and general guidelines for healthcare professionals to consider in their quest to mitigate stress and build resilience in NICU families.","Erdei, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41372-020-0745-7","20200725","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-28","",3484,""
"How COVID-19 Is Testing and Evolving Our Communication Skills","The COVID-19 pandemic forced us, as health care professionals and members of the general public, to adapt. Simple things we take for granted have become more difficult. As pressures increased for health care professionals, conversations and decisions have become tougher. This brought the need to adapt working practices and find ways to continue providing compassionate patient-centred care remotely. In UK radiotherapy departments, radiation therapist (review radiographer)-led clinics moved to telephone-based clinics to reduce the time spent by patients in a hospital environment. This required setting up a &quot;virtual&quot; clinic room with patients by removing distractions and setting boundaries for the conversation. We have had to adapt our communication skills quickly as picking up on nonverbal cues is not possible through the phone. It can be challenging to understand feelings through the tone of a patient's voice and empathise accordingly. The pandemic has forced patients to slow down and really focus on themselves which has led to picking up physical and mental health changes earlier. This is one of the many positive outcomes that can be drawn from the pandemic. Although we have changed how we work, ultimately we are still here to help our patients.","Julka-Anderson","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmir.2020.06.008","20200725","COVID-19; cancer; communication; radiotherapy; review; telephone","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-28","",3485,""
"Patient-reported Outcomes of Patients With Breast Cancer During the COVID-19 Outbreak in the Epicenter of China: A Cross-sectional Survey Study","We aimed to analyze the psychological status in patients with breast cancer (BC) in the epicenter of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A total of 658 individuals were recruited from multiple BC centers in Hubei Province. Online questionnaires were conducted, and these included demographic information, clinical features, and 4 patient-reported outcome scales (Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire [GAD-7], Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9], Insomnia Severity Index [ISI], and Impact of Events Scale-Revised [IES-R]). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was designed to identify potential factors on mental health outcomes. Questionnaires were collected from February 16, 2020 to February 19, 2020, the peak time point of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Of patients with BC, 46.2% had to modify planned necessary anti-cancer treatment during the outbreak. Severe anxiety and severe depression were reported by 8.9% and 9.3% of patients, respectively. Severe distress and insomnia were reported by 20.8% and 4.0% of patients, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis demonstrated poor general condition, shorter duration after BC diagnosis, aggressive BC molecular subtypes, and close contact with patients with COVID-19 as independent factors associated with anxiety. Poor general condition and central venous catheter flushing delay were factors that were independently associated with depression. In terms of insomnia, poor generation condition was the only associated independent factor. Poor physical condition and treatment discontinuation were underlying risk factors for distress based on multivariable analysis. High rates of anxiety, depression, distress, and insomnia were observed in patients with BC during the COVID-19 outbreak. Special attention should be paid to the psychological status of patients with BC,Ã‚Â especially those with poor general condition, treatment discontinuation, aggressive molecular subtypes, and metastaticÃ‚Â BC.","Juanjuan, Santa-Maria, Hongfang, Lingcheng, Pengcheng, Yuanbing, Yuyan, Zhongchun, Bo, Meng, Qingfeng, Feng, Yi, Shengrong, Xingrui, Chuang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clbc.2020.06.003","20200725","Breast cancer; COVID-19; Epicenter; Psychological status","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-28","",3486,""
"Decrease in Ambient Fine Particulate Matter during COVID-19 Crisis and Corresponding Health Benefits in Seoul, Korea","Both domestic emissions and transported pollutants from neighboring countries affect the ambient fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) concentration of Seoul, Korea. Diverse measures to control the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), such as social distancing and increased telecommuting in Korea and the stringent lockdown measures of China, may reduce domestic emissions and levels of transported pollutants, respectively. In addition, wearing a particulate-filtering respirator may have decreased the absolute PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure level for individuals. Therefore, this study estimated the acute health benefits of PM<sub>2.5</sub> reduction and changes in public behavior during the COVID-19 crisis in Seoul, Korea. To calculate the mortality burden attributable to PM<sub>2.5</sub>, we obtained residents' registration data, mortality data, and air pollution monitoring data for Seoul from publicly available databases. Relative risks were derived from previous time-series studies. We used the attributable fraction to estimate the number of excessive deaths attributable to acute PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure during January to April, yearly, from 2016 to 2020, and the number of mortalities avoided from PM<sub>2.5</sub> reduction and respirator use observed in 2020. The average PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration from January to April in 2020 (25.6 ÃŽÂ¼g/m<sup>3</sup>) was the lowest in the last 5 years. At least -4.1 ÃŽÂ¼g/m<sup>3</sup> (95% CI: -7.2, -0.9) change in ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> in Seoul was observed in 2020 compared to the previous 4 years. Overall, 37.6 (95% CI: 32.6, 42.5) non-accidental; 7.0 (95% CI: 5.7, 8.4) cardiovascular; and 4.7 (95% CI: 3.4, 6.1) respiratory mortalities were avoided due to PM<sub>2.5</sub> reduction in 2020. By considering the effects of particulate respirator, decreases of 102.5 (95% CI: 89.0, 115.9) non-accidental; 19.1 (95% CI: 15.6, 22.9) cardiovascular; and 12.9 (95% CI: 9.2, 16.5) respiratory mortalities were estimated. We estimated that 37 lives were saved due to the PM<sub>2.5</sub> reduction related to COVID-19 in Seoul, Korea. The health benefit may be greater due to the popular use of particulate-filtering respirators during the COVID-19 crisis. Future studies with daily mortality data are needed to verify our study estimates.","Han, Hong","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17155279","20200727","COVID-19; Korea; health burden; lockdown; mortality; particulate matter","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-28","",3487,""

"The Nature, Cause and Consequence of COVID-19 Panic among Social Media Users in India","Aims The recent pandemic of COVID-19 has not only shaken the healthcare but also economic structure around the world. In addition to these direct effects, it has also brought in some indirect difficulties owing to the information epidemic on social media. As India experienced a later outbreak of COVID-19 and a prolonged uninterrupted lockdown, we aimed to understand the nature of panic social media users in India are experiencing due to the flow of (mis)information. We further extend this investigation to other countries. Methods We performed a cross-sectional study by conducting survey on multiple social media platforms. We received 1075 responses (sex ratio 2:1) through opportunity sampling from social media users of 30 different countries (between April 11, 2020 and May 15, 2020). We performed both quantitative and qualitative analyses on the 935 respondents from India. Several hypotheses are statistically tested on them and are further examined on rest of the 140 social media users from 29 other countries. We also performed a separate Twitter hashtag analysis and sentiment analysis on the responses. We applied a citizen science approach to involve the respondents in the analysis pipeline after the survey. Results This cross-sectional study on 1075 social media users from India and 29 other countries revealed a significant increase of social media usage and rise of panic over time in India. Middle-aged people and female exhibit a higher panic in India. The amount of panic was independent of the nature of association with COVID-19. The change of mental health was associated with panic level and productivity. Further qualitative analysis highlights the occurrences of information panic, economic panic, moral panic and spiritual panic, among other causes. Conclusions Several panic behaviors are unique to social media users in India possibly because COVID-19 broke out relatively later in comparison with the other countries and the uninterrupted lockdown prolonged for a long time. The amount of social media usage might not be causal but has a significant role in generating panic among the people in India. A significantly higher level of panic among the middle-aged people can be attributed to their higher amount of responsibility. The popularity of different hashtags, including the names of drugs under trial for COVID-19, in limited countries highlight that the causes of panic are not the same everywhere. As some of the respondents took part as citizen scientists a robust perspective to the outcome is obtained.","Chandrima Bhattacharya et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46052-9EA-D12","20200727","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; mental health; social media; covid-19; anxiety; panic","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-28","",3492,""
"Social capital and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic","COVID-19 pandemic is affecting mental health and wellbeing across populations. The continued burden of psychosocial stressors in different contexts necessitates multipronged interventions that address mental health problems and associated disparities. Global evidence suggests that social capital plays a critical role in determining mental health outcomes in communities, which can be leveraged for improving mental health in COVID-19. As communities with better social capital is likely to have a lower burden of mental disorders, it is necessary to assess potential measures to use social capital for mental health promotion in vulnerable populations. The existing forms of social capital may provide social support within and between communities that are critically affected by COVID-19. Alongside faster recovery from socioeconomic challenges, social capital interventions may strengthen the social determinants of mental health and empower communities to alleviate the psychosocial consequences of this pandemic.","Tahmina Tasnim Rodela et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460B6-B45-166","20200728","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Organization Development; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Clinical Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Health Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Work; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociological Practice and Public Sociology; mental health; coronavirus; psychosocial interventions; covid-19; social capital; mental disorders","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-28","",3493,""
