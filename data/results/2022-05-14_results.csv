"THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON OLDER ADULTS' FINANCES, WELL-BEING AND FEAR","The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak and subsequent lockdowns impacted the mental health of numerous sociodemographic groups globally. This crisis can produce stress, overwhelm, and powerful emotions in susceptible people, especially older persons. Our study examined the relationship between well-being and fear of COVID-19 among older persons residing in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, during the pandemic. A sociodemographic survey was undertaken. Two scales are used for a month of the COVID-19 outbreak: the Mental Health Continuum Short Form (MHC-SF) and the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S). We surveyed 158 senior citizens in Ho Chi Minh City between February and April 2021. There was no lockdown in Ho Chi Minh before the fourth wave of infection. Despite this, citizens have maintained high compliance with coronavirus prophylaxis. Sociodemographic data were described using descriptive statistics. A one-way MANOVA assessed the financial impact on older individuals' well-being. The Pearson correlation was employed to find the link between happiness and COVID-19 dread. During the COVID-19 pandemic, older persons who received various monthly allowances had statistically significant emotional and psychological well-being differences. There was no association between well-being and COVID-19 dread. The COVID-19 epidemic has disproportionately affected vulnerable groups. Older individuals are a risk population that requires material and mental care.","Huynh, C. V.; Phan, H. T.; Nguyen, X. T. K.; Nguyen-Thi, K. S.; Tran-Chi, V.

"ETHICAL CONFLICTS AMONG THE LEADING MEDICAL AND HEALTHCARE LEADERS","Today, the whole world is fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. In these circumstances, medical professionals are being viewed as the frontline warriors who are risking their lives for the sake of helping, caring, and curing these patients. However, in these difficult times, there are few medical professionals and health care providers who are taking advantage of this situation and taking advantage of distressed and distraught patients at will. A conflict between professional and personal ethical values makes them depressed and puzzled. It is tough for them to maintain a good image of their profession and business. The objectives of this study are to review the ethical conflict amid the ongoing Covid pandemic and post-Covid pandemic (vaccination period) in the context of medical professionals and health care providers. The paper is designed based on a literature review. Almost fifty-two research papers, articles, survey reports, and newspapers were studied in the context of ethics in business/profession. After reviewing moral distress is ongoing and post-pandemic period, the researchers have tried to present the medical professionals and health care providers' critical situation to give priority to their professional ethics or personal interest.","Roy, B.; Kumar, A.; Kumar, A.; Gowda, K.

"Understanding Precautionary Behavior in the Time of COVID-19","Compliance with the public health authority guidelines is crucial to prevent the spread of COVID-19 successfully. By analyzing individual responses to a survey, we identify the weakest links, i.e., those who do not follow the guidelines as much as others do, and why they are failing. We find that individuals older than 60 are most enthusiastic in protecting their and others' health and that those younger than 30 are least enthusiastic. We categorize the factors possibly influencing the precautionary behavior into three groups: preference, belief and constraint. It turns out that although beliefs on the effectiveness of protective measures do predict individual differences in their endeavors, they do not vary significantly across gender and age groups. On the other hand, risk, time, and social preferences explain individual differences well and significantly differ across gender and age groups. We also derive an implication for managing long-term risks due to fatigue and depression.","Jung, S.; Kim, S.

"COVID-19 Vaccine Refusal in Serbia as an Example of Social Solipsism","The number of citizens in Serbia vaccinated against COVID-19 was among the highest in Europe in early 2021. It started to stagnate as it approached 50% total population coverage, while the number of cases started to rise. The paper presents the cultural thought that leads people to decline COVID-19 vaccination, and aims to show that such cultural thought can be described as social solipsism. This means that illusions about reality are used as a cognitive reference point for organizing the world around us. It has been noted that there is no uniform category of opponents of the fight against the pandemic. There are those who, in their negative attitude to everything that is being undertaken to curb the pandemic, are led by the idea that the illness does not exist;then there are those who are opposed to vaccination in general, but also those who oppose only COVID-19 vaccination;in addition, there are those who prioritize their own principles based on legal, moral or religious norms over vaccination, interpreting those norms in this way, and those who believe that their lifestyle and state of health protect them from illness, and that this, rather than vaccination, should be the guideline for the fight against the pandemic;then there are those who are doubtful about everything they read and hear in the media about COVID-19, as well as those who are unable to provide a more specific explanation about the reasons for refusing to be vaccinated, and those who have lost all trust in politicians, i.e. in the way that our society has been organized under the influence of state and social actors;then, there are those whose trust in the medical profession has declined. Finally, there is a distinct subgroup of respondents, namely those who are able to put together a small pseudotheoretical system which links the pandemic as a global fact with events which may or may not be connected with it in the local, Serbian sociocultural context, in a manner which they perceive as being causal. What characterizes the cultural thought that leads them to refuse vaccination is distrust of the dominant social discourses, primarily political and scientific and, above all, medical discourses, and they consequently ignore the objective facts these discourses are based on. Such cultural thought can be termed postlogical because it ignores those social discourses - primarily scientific ones - which talk about the objective state of factual reality;instead, it draws on arguments that are not characteristic of causal, factographically informed thought, influencing public opinion by appealing to convictions and feelings rather than facts.","Zikic, B.","https://doi.org/10.21301/eap.v17i1.8","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Etnoantropoloski Problemi-Issues in Ethnology and Anthropology; 17(1):233-257, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31312,""
"Graphic Communities: Comics as Visual and Virtual Resources for Self and Collective Care","This commentary discusses the ways in which print and Instagram-based comics are used to represent the lived experiences of mental illness. Beginning with a brief overview of mental health-focused comic strips and graphic memoirs and turning to a discussion of the mental illness comics of Instagram, the article outlines how comics are being used as platforms for self and collective care. Instead of prioritizing a visual/discourse analysis of each web comic, this piece focuses on the comment threads of each Instagram post and examines the conversations which develop amongst users. By doing so, this essay begins a critical discussion of the ways in which comics may be used as mental health resources. While grounded in a discussion of Covid-19-related increases to mental illness symptoms, this piece is also interested in how comics may be used as therapeutic supports in a post-pandemic world.","Mazowita, A.","https://doi.org/10.16995/cg.6493","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Comics Grid-Journal of Comics Scholarship; 12:1-8, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31313,""
"Back to normal? psychological analysis of the return to classes in post-pandemic COVID-19","The pandemic has had a huge impact on the mental health of the population, manifesting symptoms of anxiety, depression, panic, anguish, fear and reaction to stress. The educational field has been mostly affected, both by the changes produced in online classes and by the return to face-to-face classes, which has generated adaptation difficulties for teachers, students and parents. It is argued that the pandemic has affected the development of socio-emotional skills, generating a gap, which has affected aggressive behavior, lack of empathy, anxiety, depressive symptoms, conflict resolution difficulties, impulse regulation, and episodes of violence. school in the child and adolescent population. It is argued that the development of the brain in the child and adolescent population has been affected, both by confinement, psychosocial vulnerability and by increased exposure to the Internet and social networks.

"Post-COVID-19 Lymphocytopenia and Opportunistic Pathogens Infection in a Thalassemia Major Patient","Transfusion-dependent thalassemia patients undergo transfusion immunomodulating effects, which result in a general immune response depression and, consequently, an increase in the frequency of infectious episodes and neoplastic events due to a reduction in phagocytic function. Altered natural killer functions and IL-2-mediated lymphocytic response, defects in antigen presentation due to monocyte&ndash;macrophage cells, and decreases in bone marrow precursors and HLA II+ cells all play key roles in immunodepression in thalassemia major. SARS-CoV-2 infection presents marked lymphopenia, occurring in 96.1% of severe cases. COVID-19-related lymphopenia is due to various mechanisms, which lead to an increase in lymphocytic apoptosis. Post-COVID-19 lymphocytic quantitative and functional disorders may compromise immune response and promote the onset of infections via opportunistic pathogens. Herein, we report a case of a thalassemia major patient who developed severe post-COVID-19 lymphocytopenia, which may have facilitated the onset of a severe Klebsiella Pneumoniae infection.","Petrungaro, Annamaria, Quartarone, Eugenia, Sciarrone, Paolo, Rigoli, Luciana","https://doi.org/10.3390/thalassrep12020006","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Thalassemia Reports; 12(2):30-33, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31315,""
"Relationships between Coping Styles, Emotional Distress, and Fear of COVID-19 among Workers in the Oil and Gas Industry in Malaysia during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has had serious impacts on psychological health globally. However, very little is currently known regarding the link between fear of COVID-19 with psychological health and various coping styles, especially among oil and gas workers. This study aims to assess the prevalence of depression and anxiety among oil and gas workers, and subsequently examine the role of sociodemographic and occupational variables, various coping styles, and emotional distress in contributing to fear of COVID-19. A total of 299 oil and gas workers participated in this study. The DASS-21, Brief COPE, and Fear of COVID-19 (FCV-19) were used to assess the research variables. The descriptive analyses of DASS-21 indicated a prevalence of 26.8%, 33.5%, and 17.1% for depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively, among oil and gas workers. The results also indicated that all types of coping styles (problem-oriented, emotion-oriented, and dysfunctional-oriented) were significant predictors of fear of COVID-19. Sociodemographic and occupational variables and emotional distress variables were not significant predictors of fear of COVID-19. The study suggests how crucial it is for occupational mental health surveillance and prompt intervention for oil and gas workers.","Kulip, Joseph, Jeffree, Mohammad Saffree, Pang, Nicholas Tze Ping, Nasirruddin, Nazmirrudin, Wider, Walton","https://doi.org/10.3390/su14095398","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sustainability; 14(9):5398, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31316,""
"Assessing the Relationships between Internet Addiction, Depression, COVID-19-Related Fear, Anxiety, and Suspicion among Graduate Students in Educational Administration: A Structural Equation Modeling Analysis","This study aims to examine the relationships between Internet addiction, depression, COVID-19-related fear, anxiety, and suspicion in graduate students. A total of 482 students pursuing a master's degree in educational administration participated in the study, which was designed according to the relational survey model. The data of the study were collected using online questionnaires, and the proposed hypotheses were tested and analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). The results of the study revealed that COVID-19-related suspicion positively and significantly predicted COVID-19-related fear and anxiety. In this context, the increased suspicion of graduate students due to COVID-19 also increased their fear and COVID-19-related anxiety, and this increased the possibility that they would exhibit depressive behaviors. However, a positive and significant relationship was found between COVID-19-related suspicion and depression. This result confirms that the increased suspicion of the participant students due to COVID-19 led to an increase in their depression scores. SEM results have shown a positive relationship between fear and anxiety related to COVID-19 and Internet addiction, and that the increase in students' anxiety and fear levels also increases their Internet addiction levels. In addition, the results of the study revealed that depression has a negligible indirect effect on the relationship between COVID-19-related fear, anxiety, and suspicion and Internet addiction. In conclusion, the proposed hypothetical model is confirmed after having examined the relationships among depression, Internet addiction, COVID-19-related fear and anxiety, and suspicion.","Karakose, Turgut","https://doi.org/10.3390/su14095356","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sustainability; 14(9):5356, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31317,""
"Perceived Symptoms, Mental Health and Quality of Life after Hospitalization in COVID-19 Patients","Patients recovering from novel coronavirus are reporting a variety of symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, myalgia as well as psychological distress and poor quality of life. The aim of this study is to assess quality of life and psychological distress in COVID-19 survivors and the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics that affect COVID-19 survivors' mental health status and quality of life. A quantitative study was conducted among COVID-19 survivors, who had previously been admitted to the University Hospital of Larissa, Greece. Data were collected via a questionnaire consisting of three-parts. The first part consisted of questions about the demographic characteristics. The second part was the SF-36 QoL index. The third part was the Symptom Checklist-90r (SCL 90-R). In addition, clinical information such as the length and the department of hospitalization, days since discharge and pulmonary function (spirometry values) were recorded. From a total of 145 patients, 60% were male, aged 59.72 &plusmn;12.74 and 78.6% of them were married;the majority had completed secondary education, 35.9% were pensioners and 58.6 were living in urban areas. The most frequently reported symptoms were fatigue (67.6%) and pain (44.8%) and 11.7% were experiencing psychological distress. Pain, loss of smell, mandatory education, ICU admission, female gender and the experiencing of skin disturbance are associated with poor physical QoL among COVID-19 recovered patients. Greek COVID-19 previously hospitalized patients were reporting several symptoms associated with COVID-19. Good QoL and mental health were also reported. Physical pain, loss of smell and female gender were associated with poor QoL and psychological distress.","Fradelos, Evangelos C.; Boutlas, Stylianos, Tsimitrea, Eleni, Sistou, Alexandra, Tourlakopoulos, Konstantinos, Papathanasiou, Ioanna V.; Gourgoulianis, Konstantinos I.","https://doi.org/10.3390/jpm12050728","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Personalized Medicine; 12(5):728, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31318,""
"The Upshot of the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic on Nursing Assistants: Evaluating Mental Health Indicators in Huelva","Healthcare professionals who work in front-line situations are among those under the highest risk of presenting negative mental health indicators. We sought to assess the prevalence of low personal realization, emotional exhaustion, and depersonalization as well as probable non-psychotic psychiatric pathologies during the pandemic in nursing assistants in the city of Huelva (Spain), and to study the association between these mental health indicators and sociodemographic and professional variables. A cross-sectional descriptive investigation with a quantitative approach was used. A representative sample of these professionals, consisting of 29 men and 284 women, completed the GHQ-12 questionnaire, including sociodemographic data and the MBI-HSS questionnaire, collecting information on situations of contact with SARS-CoV-2. Data analysis was conducted, and correlations were established. We found that emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and probable non-psychotic, psychiatric pathologies were related to contact with SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, personal realization, depersonalization and emotional exhaustion were related to just gender. We conclude that nursing assistants from public hospitals in the city of Huelva who had contact with patients with SARS-CoV-2 in the workplace, showed poor mental health indicators than those who did not come into contact with infected individuals.","Gago-Valiente, Francisco-Javier, Moreno-SÃ¡nchez, Emilia, VÃ©lez-Moreno, Emilia, Merino-Godoy, MarÃ­a-de-los-Ãngeles, SÃ¡ez-Padilla, JesÃºs, de Paula RodrÃ­guez-Miranda, Francisco, da Costa, EmÃ­lia Isabel Martins Teixeira, Saenz-de-la-Torre, Luis-Carlos, Segura-Camacho, AdriÃ¡n, Mendoza-Sierra, MarÃ­a-Isabel","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm11092586","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Clinical Medicine; 11(9):2586, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31319,""
"Alcohol Consumption, Loneliness, Quality of Life, Social Media Usage and General Anxiety before and during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Singapore","This cross-sectional study aims to identify factors associated with anxiety levels of adults living in Singapore before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected using a web-based survey conducted from July to November 2020, accruing 264 eligible participants. Ordered logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), ranked as minimal (0&ndash;4), mild (5&ndash;9), moderate (10&ndash;14), and severe (15&ndash;21) before and during the pandemic. About 74% of participants were female, 50% were aged 25&ndash;34, and 50% were married. The GAD-7 level went up from the pre-pandemic for moderate (12.5% to 16%) and severe GAD (2% to 11%). Alcohol consumption (AOR 1.79, 95% CI 1.04&ndash;3.06), loneliness (AOR 1.28, 95% CI 1.05&ndash;1.54), and difficulty in switching off social media (AOR 2.21, 95% CI 1.29&ndash;3.79) predicted increased GAD-7 levels. The quality of life (AOR 0.84, 95% CI 0.79&ndash;0.90) was significantly associated with decreased GAD-7 levels.

"Are Personal Resources and Perceived Stress Associated with Psychological Outcomes among Israeli Teachers during the Third COVID-19 Lockdown?","Teachers' psychological responses during a pandemic, such as COVID-19, play an important role in their adaptation to the new routine. This research aimed to explore the association between personal resources (sense of control, social support), perceived stress, and three psychological outcomes (resilience, depression, loneliness) among teachers during the third COVID-19 lockdown in Israel. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 208 teachers. Significant associations were found between perceived stress, resilience, depression, and loneliness. Sense of control was significantly associated with perceived social support. The research model was tested using Structural Equation Modeling.

"Changes in Air-Pollution-Related Information-Seeking Behaviour during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Poland","Low air quality in Poland is a problem of particularly high urgency. Therefore, Poles must be aware of air quality levels, also during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study aimed to compare air-pollution-related information-seeking behaviour between the pre- and intra-pandemic periods as well as between the actual and theoretical machine-learning-forecasted intra-pandemic models. Google Trends search volumes (GTSVs) in Poland for air-pollution-related keywords were collected between January 2016 and January 2022. To investigate the changes that would have occurred without the outbreak of the pandemic, Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) machine-learning models were trained. Approximately 4,500,000 search queries were analysed. Between pre- and intra-pandemic periods, weighted mean GTSVs changed by &minus;39.0%. When the actual intra-pandemic weighted mean GTSVs were compared to the intra-pandemic forecasts, the actual values were lower by &minus;16.5% (SARIMA's error = 6.2%). Compared to the pre-pandemic period, in the intra-pandemic period, the number of search queries containing keywords connected with air pollution decreased. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic might have facilitated the decrease. Possible causes include an attention shift towards everyday problems connected to the pandemic, worse mental health status and lower outdoor exposure that might have resulted in a lower intensity of non-pandemic-related active information-seeking behaviour.","Nazar, Wojciech, Niedoszytko, Marek","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19095613","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(9):5613, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31322,""

"At Home and on the Brink: US Parents' Mental Health during COVID-19","Though the COVID-19 pandemic required significant changes and adaptations for most Americans, parents faced acute challenges as they had to navigate rapidly changing schooling and child care policies requiring their children to spend more time at home. This study examines the effects of COVID-19 school and workplace policies as well as environmental and economic characteristics on parental mental health, worry, hopelessness, and anxiety. Using data from four waves of the Socio-Economic Impacts of COVID-19 Survey and regression analysis, we explore associations between parents' mental health, worry, hopelessness, and anxiety and school learning environment, child grade and learning disability, employment characteristics, and sociodemographic factors. We find that having a child attend a private school or school with above average instructional quality was associated with better mental health of parents.

"Evaluation of an Inpatient Psychiatric Mother-Baby Unit Using a Patient Reported Experience and Outcome Measure","Understanding the patient experience of admission to a psychiatric mother-baby unit (MBU) informs service improvement and strengthens patient-centered care. This study aims to examine patients' experience, satisfaction, and change in mental health status related to MBU admission. At discharge, 70 women admitted to a public MBU completed the Patient Outcome and Experience Measure (POEM), rated the usefulness of therapeutic groups, and provided written qualitative feedback. Paired sample t-tests, correlations, and thematic content analysis were completed. Women were highly satisfied with the level of care and support received, particularly for those who were voluntarily admitted. Women reported an improvement in mental health from admission to discharge. Women appreciated the staff's interpersonal skills, provision of practical skills, education, advice, support from other women, and therapeutic groups offered. Women suggested improvements such as having greater food choices, more MBU beds, more group sessions, family visitations, which had been restricted due to COVID-19, environmental modifications, and clarity of communication surrounding discharge. This study highlights the benefits of MBUs and the specific aspects of care that are favorable in treating women with mental illnesses who are co-admitted with their baby in an MBU.","Branjerdporn, Grace, Hudson, Carly, Sheshinski, Roy, Parlato, Linda, Healey, Lyndall, Ellis, Aleshia, Reid, Alice, Finnerty, Catherine, Arnott, Rachelle, Curtain, Rebecca, McLean, Miranda, Parmar, Snehal, Roberts, Susan","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19095574","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(9):5574, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31325,""
"Age-Related Differences in Psychological Distress during the COVID-19 Pandemic","While the negative impact of COVID-19 total lockdown on mental health in youth has been extensively studied, findings collected during subsequent waves of the pandemic, in which restrictive rules were more eased, are very sparse. Here, we explore perceived psychological distress during the partial lockdown of the third wave in Southern Italy in a large sample of students, focusing on age and gender differences. Also, we assessed whether attending the type of education could have a protective role on students' psychological well-being. An online survey was completed by 1064 southern Italian students (age range: 8&ndash;19 years;males = 368) from March to July 2021. The survey consists of a set of questions regarding general sociodemographic information as well as several aspects of students' psychological well-being. Psychological distress was higher in high school students compared to both elementary and middle ones. In addition, we found gender differences, but only in high school students, with females reporting higher psychological distress than males. Finally, our mediation analysis showed a mediated role of face-to-face schooling in the relationship between age and psychological distress. In conclusion, this study highlights age-related differences in psychological distress during the pandemic and the protective role of school in presence for mental health in Italian students.","Rega, Angelo, Nappo, Raffaele, Simeoli, Roberta, Cerasuolo, Mariangela","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19095532","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(9):5532, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31326,""
"Strategies for the Psychological Support of the Healthcare Workforce during the COVID-19 Pandemic: The ERNST Study","The COVID-19 pandemic led to the implementation of interventions to provide emotional and psychological support to healthcare workers in many countries. This ecological study aims to describe the strategies implemented in different countries to support healthcare professionals during the outbreak. Data were collected through an online survey about the measures to address the impact of the pandemic on the mental health of healthcare workers. Healthcare professionals, researchers, and academics were invited to respond to the survey. Fifty-six professionals from 35 countries contributed data to this study. Ten countries (28.6%) reported that they did not launch any national interventions. Both developed and developing countries launched similar initiatives. There was no relationship between the existence of any type of initiative in a country with the incidence, lethality, and mortality rates of the country due to COVID-19, and per capita income in 2020. The 24 h hotline for psychological support was the most frequent intervention. Tools for self-rescue by using apps or websites were extensively used, too. Other common interventions were the development of action protocols, availability of regular and updated information, implantation of distance learning systems, early detection of infection programs for professionals, economic reinforcements, hiring of staff reinforcement, and modification of leave and vacation dates.","LÃ³pez-Pineda, Adriana, Carrillo, Irene, Mula, Aurora, Guerra-Paiva, Sofia, Strametz, Reinhard, Tella, Susanna, Vanhaecht, Kris, Panella, Massimiliano, Knezevic, Bojana, Ungureanu, Marius-Ionut, Srulovici, Einav, Buttigieg, Sandra C.; SkoumalovÃ¡, Ivana, Sousa, Paulo, Mira, Jose, Consortium, On behalf of the ERNST","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19095529","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(9):5529, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31327,""
"Alcohol Use of German Adults during Different Pandemic Phases: Repeated Cross-Sectional Analyses in the COVID-19 Snapshot Monitoring Study (COSMO)","There is little evidence on how different COVID-19 pandemic phases influence the alcohol use behaviour of adults. The objective of this study is to investigate alcohol use frequency over different COVID-19 pandemic phases and to identify vulnerable subgroups for risky use behaviour in the German adult population. Survey waves of 14/15 April 2020 (n = 1032), 23/24 June 2020 (n = 993), and 26/27 January 2021 (n = 1001) from the COVID-19 Snapshot Monitoring (COSMO) were analysed. The mean age was 46 &plusmn;15.3 years in April, 46 &plusmn;15.5 years in June, and 45 &plusmn;15.5 years in January. The gender ratio was mostly equal in each survey wave. Descriptive analyses and univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses for individuals with increased alcohol use frequency (AUF) were performed. 13.2% in April (lockdown), 11.3% in June (easement), and 8.6% in January (lockdown) of participants showed an increased AUF. Individuals with perceived burden, high frustration levels due to protective measures, and young to middle-aged adults were more likely to increase their AUF during different pandemic phases. In conclusion, unfavourable alcohol behaviour might occur as a potentially maladaptive coping strategy in pandemics. Because of potential negative long-term consequences of problematic alcohol use behaviour on health, public health strategies should consider mental health consequences and target addictive behaviour, while also guiding risk groups towards healthy coping strategies such as physical activities during pandemics/crises.","Koeger, Melanie, Schillok, Hannah, Voss, Stephan, Coenen, Michaela, Merkel, Christina, Jung-Sievers, Caroline, study, On behalf of the COSMO","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19095489","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(9):5489, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31328,""
"The Moderating Effect of Compassionate Mindfulness on the Psychological Needs and Emotions of Generation Y in the 21st Century in Taiwan","During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic in Taiwan, 6.5% of Generation Y required medical treatment for emotional and stress-related mental disorders. This study explores the moderating effect of mindfulness training on psychological needs and emotions to propose effective measures to promote the mental health of Generation Y. This study was carried out by questionnaire, using the data of respondents born in 1980&ndash;1999, collected in three different periods for quantitative analysis with compassionate mindfulness as the main variable. The results show that the compassionate mindfulness effect on emotion regulation varies greatly among different educational levels. However, it still plays a positive role in the psychological needs of Generation Y. Most members of Generation Y who receive compassionate mindfulness training have fewer basic needs and more interpersonal trust. They pay more attention to individual-oriented self-realization. Compassionate mindfulness has a greater positive moderating effect on the mental health of women aged 30&ndash;39 and those who are highly educated. Compassionate mindfulness has a more positive moderating effect on the psychological needs of members of Generation Y who were born more recently. During the COVID-19 pandemic, providing compassionate mindfulness has a significant positive effect on the prevention of mental disorders of Generation Y in Taiwan.","Lin, Hui-Li, Lin, Fang-Suey, Liu, Ling-Chen, Liu, Wen-Hsin","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19095458","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(9):5458, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31329,""
"Internet-Based Psychological Interventions during SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic: An Experience in South of Italy","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to an increasing demand for online psychological intervention. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of received support in internet-based psychological intervention group (I-IG) patients, compared with a wait-list control group (CG). The Impact of Event Scale-Revised, Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item and Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale 7-item were administered. After participants had used the internet-based solution, the System Usability Scale was administered. In total, 221 patients (194 patients supported by internet-based interventions and 27 patients supported onsite) were included in intervention group, and 194 patients were included in CG. In a 6-month follow-up, participants in the I-IG demonstrated significant improvements in terms of PTSD risk (p &lt; 0.0001, d = 0.64), depression (p &lt; 0.0001, d = 0.68), and anxiety (p &lt; 0.0001, d = 1.33), compared to the CG. Significant improvements in onsite intervention group patients with a large to very large effect size of PTSD risk (p &lt; 0.0001, d = 0.91), depression (p &lt; 0.0001, d = 0.81), and anxiety (p &lt; 0.0001, d = 1.62) were found. After internet-based solution use, I-IG patients reported a very high usability and functionality (72.87 &plusmn;13.11) of online intervention. In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2-related mental health problems can be improved by internet-based psychological intervention.

"Virtual Reality (VR) Technology for Treatment of Mental Health Problems during COVID-19: A Systematic Review","There was a surge in psychological distress and emotional burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic. Virtual reality (VR) is helpful as a psychological intervention whilst maintaining physical or social distancing. The present systematic review assessed the role of VR as a psychological intervention tool for mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a systematic review that followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. This study used the search-related terms: (Virtual reality OR simulated-3D-environment OR VR) AND (covid! or corona!) AND (mental* OR psychologic* OR well* OR health*) AND (intervention) on six databases, i.e., MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Ovid Medline, EMBASE, ACM digital library, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from the inception date until 23 June 2021. We finally included four studies in the systematic review out of the 379 references imported for screening. These studies reveal that VR is beneficial as a psychological tool for intervention in individuals with mental health problems. Immersed in the telepresence, interacting in a 3-D format compared to a 2-D layout, having a sense of enjoyment and engagement, activating an affective-motivational state, 'escaping';to a virtual from the real world are pivotal faucets of VR as a psychological tool for intervention.","Hatta, Muhammad Hizri, Sidi, Hatta, Siew Koon, Chong, Che Roos, Nur Aishah, Sharip, Shalisah, Abdul Samad, Farah Deena, Wan Xi, Ong, Das, Srijit, Mohamed Saini, Suriati","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19095389","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(9):5389, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31331,""

"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Oncology Patients' Mental Health and Treatment Plans","The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted cancer care to a certain degree. There is objective evidence that COVID-19 outbreaks are causing substantial emotional distress among cancer patients regardless of their disease severity. This study aims to measure the levels of psychological distress, depression, and pandemic anxiety among cancer patients in Saudi Arabia during the outbreak of COVID-19 and their impact on patients' cancer treatment plans. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted among oncology patients in Saudi Arabia in November of 2020. The levels of stress, depression, and anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak were measured using the Questionnaire for Depression and Anxiety (PHQ-4), and patients were classified as depressed/distressed if the total score was 6 and above and classified as not depressed/distressed if they scored less than 6. Results: Among the sampled population, anxiety symptoms and depression were detected in 61.5% and 70.2%, respectively. Statistical analyses revealed that feeling more isolated was significant for anxiety symptoms (p = 0.005), while patients who used institutions as a source of COVID-19 information had significant depression (p = 0.010) compared to patients who accessed information from other sources. In the binary regression model, feeling more isolated than before was 3.208 times more likely to be associated with anxiety symptoms (OR = 3.208;95% CI = 1.391&ndash;7.396;p = 0.006), while those patients who had a support institution as a source of COVID-19 information were 4.2 times more likely to be associated with depression (OR = 4.200;95% CI = 1.328&ndash;13.280;p = 0.015). Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has added to the burden on cancer patients. The increased risk of anxiety symptoms and depression was clearly demonstrated in this study. Feeling isolated had a greater impact on anxiety symptoms, while obtaining COVID-19 information from a patient support institution negatively affected depression.","Althumairi, Arwa, Al askari, Entesar Ahmed, AlOmar, Reem S.; Alumran, Arwa","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10050825","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Healthcare; 10(5):825, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31333,""
"Anxiety, Depression, and Other Emotional Disorders during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Narrative Review of the Risk Factors and Risk Groups","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected many aspects of our lives, including mental health. Identifying risk factors and risk groups associated with anxiety, depression, and other emotional disorders for reasons related to the COVID-19 pandemic is highly relevant. This narrative review aims to summarize the evidence to date on risk factors for emotional disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic in order to identify the risk groups of people in need of early psychiatric and psychological assistance, point out the controversial data on the influence of risk factors on emotional disorders in COVID-19, and finally offer recommendations for alleviating symptoms of anxiety, depression, and other emotional disorders in such people. According to the current literature, being under the age of 40, being female, having contact with a COVID-infected person, and watching the news about COVID-19 for more than 3 h a day all increase the likelihood of anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances. Healthcare workers, particularly nurses, working in the COVID-19 hot zone suffer more from sleep disorders, anxiety, and depression. It is also noted that people with a previous psychiatric history, in addition to increased risks of anxiety and depression, have an increased risk of relapse during the COVID-19 pandemic. The same is true for people who have had episodes of substance abuse in the past. Aside from socioeconomic factors, the mental wellbeing of those who have had COVID-19 is also impacted by biological factors (using anti-COVID-19 drugs, COVID-19-associated immunothrombosis and venous thromboembolism, interferon-gamma-related cytokine storm, etc.), resulting in a wide range of acute and long-term cognitive disorders. During the restricted resource time, the aforementioned risk groups should be prioritized for prevention, early identification, and proper treatment of potential emotional disorders. The risk factors that were found in this narrative review, as well as how they interact and change over time, will help understand why some studies of at-risk groups do not agree with each other, justify new preventive measures, and strengthen existing programs to keep people's mental health in check during this pandemic and other emergencies.","Kassaeva, Polina, Belova, Elena, Shashina, Ekaterina, Shcherbakov, Denis, Makarova, Valentina, Ershov, Boris, Sukhov, Vitaly, Zabroda, Nadezhda, Sriraam, Natarajan, Mitrokhin, Oleg, Zhernov, Yury","https://doi.org/10.3390/encyclopedia2020060","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Encyclopedia; 2(2):912-927, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31334,""
"Physical Health, Media Use, Stress, and Mental Health in Pregnant Women during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to significant changes in the care of pregnant women and their fetuses. Emerging data show elevated depression and anxiety symptoms among pregnant women. Aims: The purpose of this article is to investigate the psychological and behavioral impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on pregnant women in Greece during the first national lockdown. Methods: We used a cross-sectional, anonymous survey to collect data in two fetal medicine clinics in the largest urban centers of Greece during the months of April and May 2020. The questionnaire was largely based on the CoRonavIruS Health Impact Survey (CRISIS), and assessed sociodemographic characteristics, general health and obstetric data and COVID-19-related worries and life changes. Mood symptoms, substance use and lifestyle behaviors were assessed at two time points (3 months prior to the pandemic and the 2 weeks before taking the survey), while perceived stress was measured with the perceived stress scale (PSS-14). Results: A total of 308 pregnant women (Mage = 34.72), with a mean gestation of 21.19 weeks participated in the study. Over one-third of the women found COVID-19 restrictions stressful, and their highest COVID-19-related worry was having to be isolated from their baby. Mean PSS-14 score was 21.94, suggesting moderate stress. The strongest predictors of stress were physical and mental health status before COVID-19 and having experienced a stressful life event during their pregnancy. Compared to 3 months before the pandemic, women reported higher scores on mood symptoms (p &lt; 0.001), TV use (p = 0.01) and social media use (p = 0.031) in the last 2 weeks before taking the survey.

"Association between Sleep Quality and Mental Health among Patients at a Post-COVID-19 Recovery Clinic","A growing body of research documents the persistence of physical and neuropsychiatric symptoms following the resolution of acute COVID-19 infection. To the best of our knowledge, no published study has examined the interaction between insomnia and mental health. Accordingly, we proposed to examine new diagnoses of insomnia, and referrals to pulmonary and sleep medicine clinics for treatment of sleep disorders, in patients presenting to one post-acute COVID-19 recovery clinic. Additionally, we aimed to examine the relationship between poor sleep quality, depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress. Patients presented to the clinic on average 2 months following COVID-19 infection;51.9% (n = 41) were hospitalized, 11.4% (n = 9) were in the intensive care unit, 2.5% (n = 2) were on a mechanical ventilator, and 38.0% (n = 30) were discharged on oxygen. The most commonly reported symptom was fatigue (88%, n = 70), with worse sleep following a COVID-19 infection reported in 50.6% (n = 40). The mean PSQI score was 9.7 (82.3%, n = 65 with poor sleep quality). The mean GAD-7 score was 8.3 (22.8%, n = 14 with severe depression). The mean PHQ-9 was 10.1 (17.8%, n = 18 with severe anxiety). The mean IES-6 was 2.1 (54.4%, n = 43 with post-traumatic stress). Poor sleep quality was significantly associated with increased severity of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress.

"Enduring COVID-19 lockdowns: Risk versus resilience in parentsâ€™ health and family functioning across the pandemic","Have the demands of the COVID-19 pandemic risked declines in parents? health and family functioning, or have most parents been resilient and shown no changes in health and family functioning? Assessing average risk versus resilience requires examining how families have fared across the pandemic, beyond the initial months examined in prior investigations. The current research examines changes in parents? health and functioning over the first 1.5Â years of the pandemic. Parents (N = 272) who had completed general pre-pandemic assessments completed reassessments of psychological/physical health, couple/family functioning, and parenting within two mandatory lockdowns in New Zealand: at the beginning of the pandemic (26 March?28 April 2020) and 17Â months later (18 August?21 September 2021). Parents exhibited average declines in psychological/physical health (greater depressive symptoms;reduced well-being, energy and physical health) and in couple/family functioning (reduced commitment and family cohesion;greater problem severity and family chaos). By contrast, there were no average differences in parent-child relationship quality and parenting practices across lockdowns. Declines in health and couple/family functioning occurred irrespective of pre-pandemic health and functioning, but partner support buffered declines in couple/family functioning. The results emphasize that attending to the challenges parents and couples face in the home will be important to mitigate and recover from the impact of the pandemic on parents? and children?s well-being.","Overall, Nickola C.; Low, Rachel S.

"In-Silico Evaluation of 10 Structurally Different Glucosinolates on the Key Enzyme of SARS-CoV-2","The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) triggered a worldwide rise in the prevalence of the coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19) and surfaced as a universal wellbeing matter. Analogous with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the main 3-chymotrypsin-alike cysteine protease (3CL(Pro)) virus enzyme that manages the replications of 2019-nCoV and regulates its existence span, possibly will be considered like a medication break through focus. In this study, the binding potential of 10 glucosinolates (Glu) having a variety of structures was studied with the catalytic dyad remains of 2019-nCoV-3CL(Pro ) by molecular cutting developing. The outcomes have shown that Glu containing sinigrin (SN) have been shown to be realistically bound to the 2019-nCoV-3CL(Pro) receptor and catalytic dyad binding sites (Cys145 and His41). Our simulation results have shown that sinigrin have a potential activity against 2019-nCoV and could be further used for drug production and optimization in the battle against COVID-19. In details, SN-SARS-CoV-2-3CL(Pro)-facilityacted without exhibit whichever observable variations, with reference to the constancy of Glu-enzyme complexes by means of average RMSD of 1.5 +/- 0.02 angstrom. Meanwhile, the ordinary behavior of a SN-SARS-CoV-2-3CL(Pro) complex continued as compact and steady during (50 ns) MD simulations. Current investigation has revealed that Glu with a specific structure could be successful against COVID-19 as natural components.","Sobhy, R.; Nawaz, A.; Fikry, M.; Sami, R.; Algarni, E.; Benajiba, N.; Qari, S.

Introduction: Fibromyalgia is a syndrome characterized by chronic generalized pain, joint stiffness, sleep disorders, fatigue, anxiety and depressive episodes, whose clinical manifestations begin after a physical or emotional trauma. However, few publications describe the clinical impact of COVID-19 on fibromyalgia symptoms. Objective: to map the available medical evidence on the impact of COVID-19 and PCS in patients with and without a diagnosis of fibromyalgia prior to infection. Materials and methods: Exploratory systematic review in PubMed and Scopus, considering articles in English and Spanish, with data on fibromyalgia in the population surviving SARS-CoV-2 infection. The clinical trial records of the World Health Organization databases were reviewed. Results: 12 published articles were included: retrospective studies (n = 4), cross-sectional (n = 2), cases and controls (n = 2), qualitative studies (n = 2), a prospective cohort (n = 1) and a longitudinal section study (n = 1). The total study population of the included publications was 3,060 patients. In addition, one randomized controlled clinical trial and two observational cross-sectional and case-control studies were included. The total sum of the study population was 173 participants. Conclusion: Survivors of COVID-19 with or without a previous diagnosis of fibromyalgia may present an increase in chronic pain, insomnia, joint stiffness, and deterioration in quality of life. The population with a history of fibromyalgia may be more affected by psychological stress, tissue damage to neuromuscular structures, and inflammation due to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Tuta-Quintero, Eduardo, Mora-Karama, Claudia, Pimentel, Juan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rcreu.2022.03.008","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Revista Colombiana de ReumatologÃ­a;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31342,""
"Treating COVID-19 patients with EMDR: A pilot study","The threatening and unpredictable nature of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic presents unprecedented mental-health challenges worldwide. For those directly affected by the disease, the stress of facing potential death and overcoming fear can overwhelm their personal coping resources and can lead to symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder and anxiety and depression. The objective of our study was to investigate the effectiveness of Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy to reduce anxio-depressive symptoms, distress and fear of the unknown in COVID-19 patients hospitalized for intensive care. A pilot study was conducted with 21 participants hospitalized for COVID-19 (11 women and 10 men) who were treated with EMDR therapy and assessed for anxio-depressive symptoms (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, HADS), intensity of distress (Subjective Units of Disturbance, SUD scale), and levels of experienced fear (i.e., fear of the unknown) (Multidimensional Assessment of COVID-19-Related Fears, MAC-RF). After the 4-session treatment, the EMDR therapy showed to be effective in reducing all of the evaluated symptoms in all patients and allowed for stabilization. All patients maintained improved psychological states for one week following the four sessions. EMDR therapy has been shown to be an effective strategy for helping patients process exposure to adverse events by relieving symptoms of acute stress and trauma. EMDR is a focused approach that with as few as 4 sessions can strengthen adaptive coping strategies for dealing with an ongoing situation, restore optimism and can rapidly prevent the onset of potentially long-lasting psychological disorders.","Brennstuhl, Marie-Jo, Pascale, Tarquinio, Ann, Rydberg Jenny, Louise, Tarquinio Camille, Lydia, Peter, Christine, Rotonda, Cyril, Tarquinio","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejtd.2022.100276","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: European Journal of Trauma & Dissociation;: 100276, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31343,""
"Efficacy and Acceptability of Remote Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Patients With Major Depressive Disorder in Japanese Clinical Settings: A Case Series","Remote cognitive and behavioral therapy (CBT) via videoconference has been garnering attention as a means of improving access to CBT for depression, in particular during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. However, there is a lack of evidence supporting its implementation in Japanese clinical settings. This case series aimed to establish preliminary evidence of whether remote CBT can be an effective therapy for major depression in Japanese clinical settings. Five patients who met the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder were enrolled and underwent remote CBT via videoconference and face-to-face assessment interviews. The results showed that remote CBT via videoconference improved depressive symptoms, enabling a relatively high level of patient satisfaction and working alliance. Moreover, detailed feedback from our patients showed that continuous monitoring was preferable for increasing treatment engagement. Further research is warranted to test the efficacy and acceptability of remote CBT via videoconference for treating major depression.","Nogami, Waka, Nakagawa, Atsuo, Kato, Noriko, Sasaki, Yohei, Kishimoto, Taishiro, Horikoshi, Masaru, Mimura, Masaru","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpra.2022.04.002","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Cognitive and Behavioral Practice;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31344,""
"Supporting grandchildren's remote instruction during COVID-19: Experiences of custodial grandmothers","While negative impacts of COVID-19-related remote instruction on children continue to emerge, it appears that vulnerable students will disproportionately bear the burden. One such vulnerable population is children being raised by grandparents. The purpose of this mixed methods study was to gain insight into custodial grandmothers' (CGMs) experiences of their grandchildren's remote instruction, as well as individual and contextual factors associated with these experiences. A national sample of 315 CGMs, drawn from two randomized clinical trials, completed an online survey in Spring of 2020. Results of a thematic analysis and supplemental quantitative analyses revealed three themes. First, access to technology and instructional supports were critical to the success of remote instruction, with barriers being difficulties using technology and poor-quality remote instruction. Next, grandchild socioemotional difficulties, and fit with remote instruction, were central to their engagement and success with remote instruction. Finally, CGMs experienced multiple stressors related to managing the demands of remote instruction, work, and family. Challenges associated with remote instruction were related to pre-pandemic difficulties such as grandchild problems and CGM depressive symptoms. Collectively, the results highlight how multiple adversities may have amplified grandchildren's existing vulnerability to negative outcomes. Implications are addressed, including strategies for supporting children raised by grandparents beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","Dolbin-MacNab, Megan L.; Jeanblanc, Alexandra B.; Musil, Carol M.; Infurna, Frank J.; Smith, Gregory C.","https://doi.org/10.1002/pits.22714","","Database: Wiley; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychology in the Schools; n/a(n/a), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31345,""

"The collateral damage of a global crisis: the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on thework experience of Gastrointestinal-Liver doctors","The collateral damage of a worldwide crisis: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the work experiences of gastroenterologists This study investigated the impact of work changes as a result of COVID-19 on the work experiences of 248 gastroenterologists (GEs) working in Dutch hospitals. Specifically, we studied how the work of GEs changed as a result of the COVID-19 crisis, and what effect this has on burnout, engagement, job satisfaction, employability, work ability, physical and psychological health. Participants completed a questionnaire in the run-up to the second COVID-19 wave in October 2020. Results show that the COVID-19 crisis significantly reduced their number of working hours, and a small proportion of GEs worked temporarily in other units to care for COVID-19 patients. At the time of this study, the impact of these changes on the work experiences of GEs appears to be small. Although before the COVID-19 crisis GEs were slightly more positive about their work ability, physical and mental health than during this crisis, the changes in their work as a result of the COVID-19 crisis had no apparent negative effects on other aspects of their work experience. This study underscores the importance of not equating healthcare workers in drawing conclusions about the impact of the COVID-19 crisis. Different groups can experience the COVID-19 crisis differently, and variation can also exist within professional groups. Attention for work perceptions remains important because doctors who experienced more stress/work pressure reported less favorable outcomes.","van Leeuwen, E. H.; Taris, T.

"Cutting Edge: T Cell Responses to B11529 (Omicron) SARS-CoV-2 Variant Induced by COVID-19 Infection and/or mRNA Vaccination Are Largely Preserved","Several studies have demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 variant-of-concern B.1.1.529 (Omicron) exhibits a high degree of escape from Ab neutralization. Therefore, it is critical to determine how well the second line of adaptive immunity, T cell memory, performs against Omicron. To this purpose, we analyzed a human cohort (<i>n</i> = 327 subjects) of two- or three-dose mRNA vaccine recipients and COVID-19 postinfection subjects. We report that T cell responses against Omicron were largely preserved. IFN-ÃŽÂ³-producing T cell responses remained equivalent to the response against the ancestral strain (WA1/2020), with some (Ã¢Ë†Â¼20%) loss in IL-2 single or IL-2<sup>+</sup>IFN-ÃŽÂ³<sup>+</sup> polyfunctional responses. Three-dose vaccinated participants had similar responses to Omicron relative to post-COVID-19 participants and exhibited responses significantly higher than those receiving two mRNA vaccine doses. These results provide further evidence that a three-dose vaccine regimen benefits the induction of optimal functional T cell immune memory.","JergoviÃ„â€¡, Coplen, Uhrlaub, Beitel, Burgess, Lutrick, Ellingson, Watanabe, Nikolich-Ã…Â½ugich","https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.2200175","20220513","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31352,""
"Mental health and psychological resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross- cultural comparison of Japan, Malaysia, China, and the US","The current study examined how psychological resilience acted as a buffer against mental health deterioration during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We conducted an online survey in four countries (Japan, Malaysia, China, and the U.S.) to examine how psychological resilience functions toward the maintenance of mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. We collected data from 1583 citizens from four countries via an online survey between October 14 and November 2, 2020. We gathered demographic data and measured mental distress (depression, anxiety, and stress) and fear of COVID-19. Data on sense of control, ego-resilience, grit, self-compassion, and resilience indicators were also collected. Sense of control was negatively associated with mental distress in all four countries. Self-compassion was negatively associated with mental distress in the samples from Japan, China, and the U.S. We also found an interaction effect for sense of control: the lower the sense of control, the stronger the deterioration of mental distress when the fear of COVID-19 was high. This study's cross-sectional design precludes causal inferences. Further, lack of data from people who were actually infected with the virus limits comparisons of people who were and were not infected. Finally, as this study only compared data from four countries, comparisons with more countries are needed. A sense of control and self-compassion may help buffer against mental health deterioration during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sense of control was consistently associated with mental health across cultures.","Sugawara, Chishima, Kubo, Shah, Mun, Ng, Masuyama, Gu, Tee","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.05.032","20220513","COVID-19; Mental health; Psychological resilience; Self-compassion; Sense of control","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31353,""
"The impact of non-infection pandemic stress on depression and anxiety severity: Investigating mediation by intrusive and deliberate rumination","Social restrictions to curb COVID-19's spread have had adverse effects on population mental health. Rumination is one mechanism through which pandemic stress (PS) might translate into psychopathology. In particular, intrusive rumination (IR) is believed to be problematic. In this study, we investigated whether IR and deliberate rumination (DR) mediated the associations between PS and both depression and anxiety severity. 1090 participants recruited online and from an undergraduate psychology participation pool completed an assessment of COVID-19 PS, as well as the Event-Related Rumination Inventory, the Beck Depression Inventory-II, and the Beck Anxiety Inventory. Total scores for PS, IR, DR, depression, and anxiety severity were tested in a parallel mediation model. PS positively predicted IR, DR, depression, and anxiety severity. IR positively predicted 1depression and anxiety severity, whereas DR did not. Indirect effects of PS on depression and anxiety severity were significant for IR, but not DR. Direct effects of PS on anxiety and depression severity were significant. Taken together, IR partially mediated the association between PS and both measures of psychopathology, and DR did not. This study was limited by its cross-sectional design and the lack of assessment of when PS exposure occurred. Regarding PS that is unrelated to infection by COVID-19, IR is one mechanism through which psychopathology may emerge, whereas DR appears to be benign. Promoting a shift from IR to DR may therefore be one strategy for mitigating the negative effects of PS and other stressors on mental health.","Squires, Hu, Milev, Poppenk","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.05.039","20220513","Anxiety; COVID-19 pandemic; Depression; Rumination; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31354,""
"Trajectory of cognitive impairments over 1 year after COVID-19 hospitalisation: Pattern, severity, and functional implications","The ongoing Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic has so far affected more than 500 million people. Lingering fatigue and cognitive difficulties are key concerns because they impede productivity and quality of life. However, the prevalence and duration of neurocognitive sequelae and association with functional outcomes after COVID-19 are unclear. This longitudinal study explored the frequency, severity and pattern of cognitive impairment and functional implications 1 year after hospitalisation with COVID-19 and its trajectory from 3 months after hospitalisation. Patients who had been hospitalised with COVID-19 from our previously published 3-months study at the Copenhagen University Hospital were re-invited for a 1-year follow-up assessment of cognitive function, functioning and depression symptoms. Twenty-five of the 29 previously assessed patients (86%) were re-assessed after 1 year (11Ã‚Â±2 months). Clinically significant cognitive impairments were identified in 48-56 % of patients depending on the cut-off, with verbal learning and executive function being most severely affected. This was comparable to the frequency of impairments observed after 3 months. Objectively measured cognitive impairments scaled with subjective cognitive difficulties, reduced work capacity and poorer quality of life. Further, cognitive impairments after 3 months were associated with the severity of subsequent depressive symptoms after 1 year. In conclusion, the stable cognitive impairments in approximately half of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and negative implications for work functioning, quality of life and mood symptoms underline the importance of screening for and addressing cognitive sequelae after severe COVID-19.","Miskowiak, Fugledalen, Jespersen, Sattler, Podlekareva, Rungby, Porsberg, Johnsen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euroneuro.2022.04.004","20220513","COVID-19; Cognitive impairment; Depression; quaLity of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31355,""
"Markers of Social and Emotional Health in College Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b><i>Objective:</i></b> Research on effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the mental health of youth have mostly focused on the occurrence of negative states such as anxiety and depression. The objective of this study was to assess the social and emotional health of university students in India, as influenced by COVID-19 test results and the experience of isolation or quarantine. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in India during July and early August 2021 among university students aged 20-25 years. The Social Emotional Health Survey-Higher Education (SEHS-HE) was used to assess 4 domains: belief in self, belief in others, emotional competence, and engaged living. <b><i>Results:</i></b> There were 187 respondents from 78 institutions in 14 of 29 states of India. The sample was 51% male. The mean SEHS-HE scores were approximately 75% of the maximum score in each domain. In multivariable regression analysis, sex, residence with family, and a negative COVID-19 report had little effect on SEHS-HE domains. COVID-19 positivity was associated with significantly lower scores on all domains (<i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01). Isolation/quarantine was associated with significantly or near-significantly higher scores on all domains (<i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01). In all cases, ÃŽÂ² coefficients and the proportion of the variance explained by the regression were small. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Major pandemic-related internal and environmental determinants of SEHS-HE remain to be identified. Strategies to improve the well-being of college students should be directed toward those who have tested positive for the disease. The experience of isolation/quarantine is not pathoplastic.","Sarkar, Jasmine, Thomas, Andrade","https://doi.org/10.4088/PCC.22m03247","20220513","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31356,""
"Menstrual experiences after COVID-19 vaccination in a non-menstruating gender diverse sample","After COVID-19 vaccination a number of currently and formerly menstruating people reported changes in menstrual bleeding and menstrual symptoms. Media highlighted these experiences, but much of the focus was on changes in regularly menstruating cis-gendered women and unnecessary concerns about fertility. This was despite ample evidence of vaccine safety for people who were currently pregnant or conceived after vaccination. An overlooked phenomenon was reports of periods, spotting, or other unexpected vaginal bleeding in people who usually do not menstruate, including people assigned female at birth who are transmasculine, trans men, agender, non-binary, and other gender diverse identities. We present preliminary descriptions of post-vaccine menstrual experiences of a vaccinated, non-menstruating, gender diverse sample. We conducted an online survey to characterize the menstrual experiences of a diverse group of currently and formerly menstruating people from April 7, 2021 through Oct 7, 2021. From over 160,000 responses, we identified 552 people between the ages of 18 and 45 who 1) reported they usually do not menstruate; 2) reported using testosterone and/or gender-affirming hormones (some did not specify testosterone); and 3) were not cis women. In addition to demographic characteristics (e.g., age, gender), we asked multiple-choice and open-ended questions about current menstrual status (including why they do not menstruate), hormone medications, contraceptive use, and menstrual symptoms after being vaccinated. Here, we combine experiences for both doses of the vaccine for analysis and group period, spotting, and other menstrual bleeding into one category called ""breakthrough bleeding"". In this sample (n=552, age=25.6 +/- 5.7 (mean +/-SD)), most respondents (84%, 463/552) selected more than one gender, with the most common for this subsample being transgender (n=460), man or man identified (n=373), non-binary (n=241), and genderqueer/gender non-conforming (n=124). 33% of respondents (180/552) reported breakthrough bleeding after vaccination, 9% (52/552) reported chest or breast soreness, and 46% (254/552) reported having other symptoms they would usually associate with a period. In response to the open-ended question about other period related symptoms, respondents reported common symptoms such as cramping and bloating. A number of respondents also used the open-ended text boxes to report negative mental health in response to their period symptoms, including anxiety, depression, gender dysphoria, panic attacks, and suicidal ideation. Many gender diverse people who received vaccines for COVID-19 experienced symptoms that are usually associated with menstruation, including unexpected bleeding. Because menstruation is usually considered in relation to fertility, other important aspects of this physiology are overlooked and this impacts people beyond fertile women. Attentiveness to menstruation beyond fertility and more inclusive use of gender in clinical trials is important to prepare people for potential side effects, address medically underserved populations, and reduce vaccine hesitancy.","Lee, Junkins, Clancy","https://doi.org/10.1096/fasebj.2022.36.S1.R5912","20220513","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31357,""
"The mechanism and effects of remdesivir-induced developmental toxicity in zebrafish: Blood flow dysfunction and behavioral alterations","The antiviral drug remdesivir has been used to treat the growing number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. However, the drug is mainly excreted through urine and feces and introduced into the environment to affect non-target organisms, including fish, which has raised concerns about potential ecotoxicological effects on aquatic organisms. Moreover, studies on the ecological impacts of remdesivir on aquatic environments have not been reported. Here, we aimed to explore the toxicological impacts of microinjection of remdesivir on zebrafish early embryonic development and larvae and the associated mechanism. We found that 100 ÃŽÂ¼M remdesivir delayed epiboly and impaired convergent movement of embryos during gastrulation, and dose-dependent increases in mortality and malformation were observed in remdesivir-treated embryos. Moreover, 10-100 ÃŽÂ¼M remdesivir decreased blood flow and swimming velocity and altered the behavior of larvae. In terms of molecular mechanisms, eighty differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by transcriptome analysis in the remdesivir-treated group. Some of these DEGs, such as manf, kif3a, hnf1ba, rgn, prkcz, egr1, fosab, nr4a1, and ptgs2b, were mainly involved in early embryonic development, neuronal developmental disorders, vascular disease and the blood flow pathway. These data reveal that remdesivir can impair early embryonic development, blood flow and behavior of zebrafish embryos/larvae, probably due to alterations at the transcriptome level. This study suggests that it is important to avoid the discharge of remdesivir to aquatic ecosystems and provides a theoretical foundation to hinder remdesivir-induced ecotoxicity to aquatic environments.","Li, Zhang, Song, Li, Yang, Tian, Zhang, Cao, Song, Chen, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1002/jat.4336","20220513","Behavior; Blood flow; Epiboly; Remdesivir; Transcriptomics; Zebrafish","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31358,""
"Clinicians' Attitudes Toward Telepsychology in Addiction and Mental Health Services, and Prediction of Postpandemic Telepsychology Uptake: Cross-sectional Study","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented uptake of telepsychology services; however, clinicians have mixed attitudes toward virtual technologies. This study (1) explored clinicians' experiences of and intentions to use video, telephone, and in-person services, and (2) tested the utility of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) to predict clinicians' intentions to offer telepsychology after the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinician satisfaction and therapeutic alliance were compared across in-person, video, and telephone services, while technology attitudes and intention to use after the pandemic were compared across video and telephone services among 118 addiction and mental health clinicians during the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinicians reported more positive experiences with in-person services than both virtual technologies; further, clinicians reported greater positive experiences, attitudes, and intentions to use video services than telephone services across measures. Based on the UTAUT, performance expectancy positively predicted concurrent intentions to use video services (ÃŽÂ²=0.46; P&lt;.001) and telephone services (ÃŽÂ²=0.35; P&lt;.001) after the pandemic. Social influence (ÃŽÂ²=0.24; P=.004) and facilitating conditions (ÃŽÂ²=0.19; P=.03) additionally predicted the intention to use telephone services.

"Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Chinese Graduate Students' Learning Activities: A Latent Class Analysis","To investigate the impact of the pandemic on graduate students' learning activities, a series of questionnaires were distributed to graduate students in universities across China, and 2,818 responses were collected. A latent class analysis was performed to classify the effects of the pandemic on graduate students' learning activities. Then, a multinomial logistic regression analysis and an analysis of variance analysis were carried out to explore the impact of demographic variables on the classification and their mental health status. The analysis identified four latent classes: ""the overall less affected"" (34.83%), ""the overall more affected"" (31.97%), ""course activities were more affected"" (19.40%), and ""social activities were more affected"" (13.79%). The multinomial logistic regression analysis indicated that during the pandemic, the learning activities of graduate students in all grades were affected to varying degrees, and the impacts on second-year and third-year graduate students were greater than those of first-year graduate students. The analysis of variance revealed that the scores for anxiety, depression, and social anxiety of ""the overall more affected"" were significantly greater than those of the other three groups, and nearly one-third of students belonged to this class, suggesting that more attention and care should be given to these students. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of graduate students have suffered mental problems (anxiety and depression).

"Dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe: five lessons from the European Society for Traumatic Stress Studies","The paper provides insights into the mental health consequences of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic from the Central, Eastern, Nordic, Southern, and Western subregions of Europe, represented by five member countries of the European Society for Traumatic Stress Studies (ESTSS). On the basis of the existing national research and experiences in these countries, we propose five lessons learned. (1) There is no evidence of a mental health pandemic so far in the countries in focus. No increase in severe mental disorders but some increase in the symptoms of common mental health disorders are observable. More high-quality longitudinal studies are needed to understand the mental health burden of the pandemic. (2) The pandemic affects countries (including the mental health situation) differently, depending on the level of the exposure, management policies, pre-pandemic structural characteristics, and healthcare resources. (3) The pandemic affects people differently: the exposure severity to pandemic-related stressors differs between individuals, as well as individual resources to cope with these stressors. There are winners and losers as well as identifiable at-risk groups that need particular attention. (4) Besides the negative consequences, the pandemic has had a positive impact. The rapidly applied innovations within the system of healthcare responses provide a window of opportunity for positive changes in mental healthcare policies, strategies, and practices. The increased focus on mental health during the pandemic may contribute to the prioritization of mental health issues at policy-making and organizational levels and may reduce stigma. (5) A stress- and trauma-informed response to COVID-19 is required. The European community of psychotraumatologists under the leadership of ESTSS plays an important role in promoting stress- and trauma-informed healthcare and policies of pandemic management. Based on the lessons learned, we propose a stepped-care public mental health model for the prevention of adverse mental health outcomes during pandemics. Population mental health is affected differently in the COVID-19 pandemic: there are winners and losers, as well as identifiable at-risk groups that need particular attention.A stress- and trauma-informed public mental health stepped-care model can address pandemic-related mental health burden in a systematic way. Este articulo proporciona informaciÃƒÂ³n sobre las consecuencias para la salud mental de la pandemia por la COVID-19 en las subregiones Central, Oriental, NÃƒÂ³rdica, Meridional y Occidental de Europa, representadas por cinco paÃƒÂ­ses miembros de la Sociedad Europea de Estudios del EstrÃƒÂ©s TraumÃƒÂ¡tico (ESTSS). Sobre la base de las investigaciones y experiencias nacionales existentes en estos paÃƒÂ­ses, proponemos cinco lecciones aprendidas: 1. No hay evidencia de una pandemia de salud mental hasta el momento en los paÃƒÂ­ses en estudio. No se observa un aumento de los trastornos mentales severos, pero sÃƒÂ­ un aumento de los sÃƒÂ­ntomas de los trastornos de salud mental comunes. Se necesitan mÃƒÂ¡s estudios longitudinales de alta calidad para entender la carga de salud mental de la pandemia; 2. La pandemia afecta a los paÃƒÂ­ses (incluida la situaciÃƒÂ³n de salud mental) en forma diferente segÃƒÂºn el nivel de exposiciÃƒÂ³n, las polÃƒÂ­ticas de gestiÃƒÂ³n, las caracterÃƒÂ­sticas estructurales previas a la pandemia y los recursos de atenciÃƒÂ³n en salud; 3. La pandemia afecta a las personas de distintas maneras: la severidad de exposiciÃƒÂ³n a los estresores relacionados con la pandemia difiere entre las personas, asÃƒÂ­ como los recursos individuales para hacer frente a estos factores estresantes. Hay ganadores y perdedores asÃƒÂ­ como grupos de riesgo identificables que necesitan atenciÃƒÂ³n especial; 4. AdemÃƒÂ¡s de las consecuencias negativas, la pandemia ha tenido un impacto positivo. Las innovaciones aplicadas rÃƒÂ¡pidamente dentro del sistema de respuestas de atenciÃƒÂ³n de la salud son una ventana de oportunidad para cambios positivos en las polÃƒÂ­ticas, estrategias y prÃƒÂ¡cticas de atenciÃƒÂ³n de la salud mental. El aumento del enfoque en la salud mental durante la pandemia puede contribuir a la priorizaciÃƒÂ³n de problemas de salud mental en los niveles organizacionales y de formulaciÃƒÂ³n de polÃƒÂ­ticas y podrÃƒÂ­a reducir el estigma; 5. Se requieren respuestas frente a la COVID-19 informadas en estrÃƒÂ©s y en trauma. La comunidad europea de psicotraumatÃƒÂ³logos, bajo el liderazgo de la ESTSS, juega un papel importante en la promociÃƒÂ³n de la atenciÃƒÂ³n en salud informada en estrÃƒÂ©s y trauma y las polÃƒÂ­ticas de gestiÃƒÂ³n de pandemias. Basados en las lecciones aprendidas, proponemos un modelo de salud mental pÃƒÂºblica de atenciÃƒÂ³n escalonada para la prevenciÃƒÂ³n de las consecuencias adversas de salud mental durante las pandemias.

"Development and Validation of a Questionnaire to Assess Social Participation of High Risk-Adults in Germany During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Restrictions to contain the COVID-19 pandemic affect the social participation of people worldwide. Especially those at high risk for a severe disease tend to abstain from social gatherings. While there are a few questionnaires to measure social participation in elderly or chronic patients, a valid survey instrument that includes pandemic-related social participation is needed. We developed a social participation questionnaire that aims to assess pandemic-related restrictions in social participation. Items were developed using a theory and literature-based approach and then compiled in a discursive process involving experts and lay people. This was followed by the validation of the questionnaire through a cross-sectional survey on 431 individuals. Items with low item-total correlations and low factor loadings using exploratory factor analysis [EFA] were excluded. Using EFA on the remaining items, the factor structure was retrieved and tested with a confirmatory factor analysis [CFA]. Internal consistency was assessed with Chronbachs ÃŽÂ±. Initially, 27 items were developed which were used for validation. 13 items were excluded due to low item-total correlations and factors loadings. EFA of the remaining 14 items revealed three factors which were identified as domains ""active social participation,"" ""wellbeing,"" and ""restrictions"". CFA showed an acceptable model fit using the three-dimensional structure. Chronbachs ÃŽÂ± of 0.81 and McDonalds ÃŽÂ© of 0.87 indicate good internal consistency. Correlation analysis showed an association between the developed questionnaire and previously-established participation and mental health scales. This study suggests that our 14 item questionnaire is of high reliability and validity and can be used to measure social participation during a pandemic.","SchrÃƒÂ¶der, Heesen, Heinemann, Hummers, Jablonka, Steffens, Mikuteit, Niewolik, Overbeck, Kallusky, MÃƒÂ¼ller","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.831087","20220513","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; pandemic questionnaire; quality of life; questionnaire development and validation; questionnaire validation; social participation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31366,""
"Fear of Progression, Anxiety, and Depression in Patients With Advanced Melanoma in the COVID-19 and Post-COVID-19 Era","The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic causes great disruption to cancer care services, which might bring about psychological problems and further lower both physical and mental life quality in cancer patients. Until now, very few studies focused on the psychological distress of patients with advanced melanoma before or during the epidemic. This study aimed to elucidate the fear of progression (FoP), anxiety, depression, and related independent predictors in patients with advanced melanoma during the COVID-19 outbreak. Two hundred and seventy-three patients with unresectable stage III or metastatic melanoma were recruited from February 2020 to November 2021, and completed the Fear of Progression Questionnaire-Short Form (FoP-Q-SF), State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-6), and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). One hundred and seventy-four (64.7%) patients experienced heighted FoP (FoP-Q-SF: 39.9 Ã‚Â± 11.0), 198 (72.5%) patients reported elevated anxiety (STAI-6: 13.1 Ã‚Â± 3.0), and 62 (22.7%) patients had increased depression (PHQ-9: 6.4 Ã‚Â± 6.1). In multivariate analysis, illness duration (<i>OR</i> = 0.987 for FoP; <i>OR</i> = 0.984 for depression), cancer stage (<i>OR</i> = 14.394 for anxiety) and disease progression (<i>OR</i> = 1.960 for FoP; <i>OR</i> = 23.235 for anxiety; <i>OR</i> = 1.930 for depression) were independent predictors for FoP, anxiety or depression. Additionally, the high levels of FoP, anxiety and depression were significantly positive correlated with each other (<i>r</i> = 0.466 for FoP and anxiety; <i>r</i> = 0.382 for FoP and depression; <i>r</i> = 0.309 for anxiety and depression). Our study indicates that FoP, anxiety and depression are persisting among patients with advanced melanoma in the COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 era. Effective psycho-oncological interventions are needed for melanoma patients with psychological distress during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Wang, Li, Shi, Ji, Kong, Zhu, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.880978","20220513","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; fear of progression; melanoma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31367,""
"Association Between Clinical Competencies and Mental Health Symptoms Among Frontline Medical Staff During the COVID-19 Outbreak: A Cross-Sectional Study","In China, mental health of frontline medical staff might be influenced by clinicians' ability to handle the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Few studies to-date have addressed the association between clinicians' competencies and mental health in this context. This cross-sectional study was to examine the prevalence of mental health symptoms among frontline medical staff that fought against the COVID-19 outbreak, and explore the associations between their competencies, and separate and concurrent depressive and anxiety symptoms. A total of 623 frontline medical staff was included in this study. Competencies, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms were assessed using a self-reported short form of the Chinese clinical physicians' competency model, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 questionnaire, respectively. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the associations between one SD increase in competency scores and the prevalence of mental health problems. The prevalence of depressive, anxiety, and comorbid depressive and anxiety symptoms was 40.93, 31.78, and 26.00%, respectively. Among the medical staff with higher total competency scores, the prevalence of depressive [odds ratios (ORs) = 0.67, 95% confidence intervals (CIs): 0.55-0.81], anxiety (OR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.56-0.83), and comorbid anxiety and depressive symptoms (OR = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.55-0.83) was lower than among their lower-scoring counterparts. Subgroup analyses stratified by core competency scores revealed similar associations as the main analyses. The present findings highlight the association between high core competency scores and lower prevalence of depressive, anxiety, and comorbid anxiety and depressive symptoms.","Chang, Su, Xia, Gao, Zhang, Ma, Liu, Zhao","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.760521","20220513","COVID-19; competency; frontline staff; medical staff; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31368,""

"Update on the Coordinated Efforts of Looking After the Health Care Needs of Children and Young People Fleeing the Conflict Zone of Ukraine Presenting to European Emergency Departments-A Joint Statement of the European Society for Emergency Paediatrics and the European Academy of Paediatrics","This joint statement by the European Society for Emergency Paediatrics and European Academy of Paediatrics aims to highlight recommendations for dealing with refugee children and young people fleeing the Ukrainian war when presenting to emergency departments (EDs) across Europe. Children and young people might present, sometimes unaccompanied, with either ongoing complex health needs or illnesses, mental health issues, and injuries related to the war itself and the flight from it. Obstacles to providing urgent and emergency care include lack of clinical guidelines, language barriers, and lack of insight in previous medical history. Children with complex health needs are at high risk for complications and their continued access to specialist healthcare should be prioritized in resettlements programs. Ukraine has one of the lowest vaccination coverages in the Europe, and outbreaks of cholera, measles, diphtheria, poliomyelitis, and COVID-19 should be anticipated. In Ukraine, rates of multidrug resistant tuberculosis are high, making screening for this important. Urgent and emergency care facilities should also prepare for dealing with children with war-related injuries and mental health issues. Ukrainian refugee children and young people should be included in local educational systems and social activities at the earliest opportunity.","Nijman, Bressan, Brandenberger, Kaur, Keitel, Maconochie, Oostenbrink, Parri, Shavit, Teksam, Velasco, van de Voorde, Da Dalt, Guchtenaere, Hadjipanayis, Ross Russell, Del Torso, Bognar, Titomanlio","https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2022.897803","20220513","emergency medicine; infectious diseases; mental health; pediatrics; post-traumatic stress disorder; refugee; social medicine; trauma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31370,""
"Worries About COVID-19 and Adolescents' Mental Health and Life Satisfaction: The Role of Sociodemographics and Social Support","Worries related to the COVID-19 pandemic are associated with mental health problems and reduced life satisfaction. However, the association between different types of worries about COVID-19 and adolescent mental health is unclear. Moreover, there is a lack of information about whether certain groups of adolescents are more vulnerable to the adverse effects of worries and how social support may moderate these effects. Adolescents (<i>N</i> = 12,686) completed a survey during the lockdown in spring 2020 in Oslo, Norway (37% response rate, 56.4% girls). The results showed that adolescent worries could be categorized into worries related to infection and those related to the general negative effects of the pandemic. Multivariate regression analyses showed that both types of worries were negatively related to positive affect and life satisfaction and positively related to depressive symptoms. Interaction analyses indicated that some associations with positive affect and depressive symptoms were stronger among adolescents with non-migrant backgrounds, higher family SES, and high reported levels of social support and physical contact during the pandemic. The findings suggest that COVID-19 worries may have negative effects on mental health and inform strategies to increase tailored psychological interventions to mitigate the effect of worry on adolescents' mental health and life satisfaction.","RodrÃƒÂ­guez-Cano, CortÃƒÂ©s-GarcÃƒÂ­a, Ulset, von Soest","https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2022.847434","20220513","COVID-19; adolescents; life satisfaction; mental health; worry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31371,""

"The Glass Ceiling Thickens: How The COVID-19 Pandemic Negatively Impacted Academic Medicine Faculty","Inequities faced by women in academic medicine before the COVID-19 pandemic are well-known, yet there are little formal data on exactly how the pandemic has affected faculty, particularly in academic medicine. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to elucidate the impact of the pandemic on faculty in academic medicine and identify whether it is disproportionately affecting populations, focusing specifically on responsibilities at home, work, and mental health according to gender identification, faculty rank, and faculty appointment. An online questionnaire was distributed in February 2021 to faculty at academic medicine centers. This questionnaire asked respondents to provide demographic data, answer questions about their responsibilities at home and work, and indicate whether and how the pandemic has affected both. Respondents were also asked questions on self-care and mental health and to document how their institution(s) can assist faculty in mitigating struggles associated with the pandemic. Responses were analyzed via quantitative (Pearson's chi-square tests) and qualitative (thematic analysis) means. Women, mid-, and early-career faculty were more likely to be responsible for the care of others (p=0.014), and the impact of the pandemic on caring for others was negative, especially for early career faculty (p=0.019). Research, teaching, and clinical practice were negatively impacted by the pandemic, with women feeling this more severely in clinical practice (p=0.003), as a result of an increased teaching load (p=0.042), and inadequate work environment (p=0.013). Women (p&lt;0.01), early career-faculty (p&lt;0.01), and clinical faculty (p=0.029) were also more negatively impacted by the pandemic in the areas of self-care and mental health. While there was no significant difference in who requested a leave of absence or tenure clock extension, early-career and women faculty were more likely to fear retribution for such requests. Faculty provided actionable suggestions to combat these negative effects under five themes, including Flexible Expectations, Support, Mental Health, Compensation, and Communication. Pre-pandemic stress and burnout among faculty in academic medicine has been well documented, and this study demonstrates that academic medicine faculty, particularly women and early-career faculty, continue to feel additional burdens secondary to the COVID-19 pandemic. These data can be utilized by administrations and future studies to make informed decisions regarding policies and programs created to assist those populations who are most vulnerable to the effects of the pandemic. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to provide both quantitative and qualitative data demonstrating a negative impact of the COVID pandemic on academic medicine faculty, particularly women and early career faculty.

"Autonomic Testing in Collegiate Athletes Following SARS-Cov-2 Infection","To date, more than 46 million people in the United States have contracted the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19. Over 700 thousand total cases have been linked to American colleges and universities. Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection may affect varied systems. It was reported that sympathetic nerve activity following SARS-CoV-2 infection was elevated in young individuals. Cardiovascular autonomic function post-acute SARS-CoV-2 infection in other populations such as athletes, however, has not been thoroughly investigated. Collegiate athletes are a unique population given that they might have a high level of physical fitness before the infection. The present study examined 16 collegiate athletes (12 men and 4 women, age: 20Ã‚Â±1 yrs, height: 181Ã‚Â±10 cm, weight: 81Ã‚Â±18 kg) who were evaluated ~2 weeks after testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction assay. These subjects were asymptomatic or with mild/moderate symptoms during infection. None of the subjects had been hospitalized for COVID-19 and all subjects were asymptomatic at the time of the study. Beat-by-beat blood pressure (BP) with Finometer, and heart rate (HR) from ECG were recorded during 10 minutes of supine rest, Valsalva maneuver, slow breathing (6 breaths/min), handgrip exercise, and 10 minutes of standing. BP, HR, heart rate variability (HRV), and cardiac baroreflex sensitivity (CBRS), and venous blood aldosterone and renin levels were analyzed. The vagal tone index from HRV in 3 of 16 athletes was lower than normative values. The responses in BP to Valsalva maneuver during phases IIa (i.e., ""early"") and IIb (i.e., ""late"") were mildly abnormal in 4 athletes and moderately abnormal in one athlete. The Valsalva ratio was below the normal range in 6 athletes. In response to slow breathing, the respiratory sinus arrhythmia amplitude was below the normal range in 3 athletes. In response to handgrip exercise, one athlete had an atypical response where BP decreased while HR was increased from baseline. Three of the subjects were unable to tolerate an orthostatic challenge for 10 minutes. Four out of 16 athletes had abnormally elevated renin activity and 1 out 16 elevated aldosterone levels. It is important to note that while several athletes had abnormal responses to the various autonomic tests, these abnormalities did not correlate with symptoms seen during the infection. Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection may reduce parasympathetic and increase sympathetic tone and may contribute to the autonomic disfunction associated in a subset of collegiate athletes even after recovering from COVID-19. This study provides further evidence for potential long-term cardiovascular autonomic effects of Covid-19 infection even in healthy young trained athletes. Further studies with a larger patient population as well as suitable healthy control subjects are warranted.","Luck, Blaha, Cauffman, Arnold, Gao, Hamaoka, Sinoway, Cui","https://doi.org/10.1096/fasebj.2022.36.S1.R1908","20220513","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31374,""
"Journaling as an effective tool to promote metacognition and enhance study methods in a pharmacology course, during and after the pandemic","Reflection on one's own actions is undoubtedly one of the most important lessons required throughout a career in medicine or pharmacology, due to the series of dilemmas and decisions that health professionals must face when providing care to patients or communities, teaching other professionals, or conducting biomedical research. Given the complexity of the challenge, there is surprisingly little literature on effective pedagogical strategies that enhance ongoing reflection in medical students. This self-reflection is particularly important in the current moment where in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and the social distancing it has brought, young students have seen reduced opportunities to interact with and learn from others. The practice of journaling is an effective strategy for prioritizing tasks, managing stress, reducing anxiety, and increasing productivity. The objective of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of journaling as an element that promotes better study habits and mental health in students of a medical pharmacology course. Since the second semester of 2020, the pharmacology course (second year of the medical career) has included weekly journaling as part of the course activities. Each week students must choose and reflexively answer 4-5 questions from a list of 35 items in different domains (emotional and health perception, goals and commitments, study method and habits, learning perception and teamwork). The exercise was graded according to the level of fulfillment of the task (number of items answered in a reflective and timely manner), without criticizing the content of the students' answers. At the end of the semester the students answered a short survey that evaluated their perception of the usefulness of the tool, through Likert-type questions. Most of the students reported that keeping a journal was useful to improve their physical and mental health (57%), organize their homework and assignments (69%), achieve their goals (85%), reflect on their role as a person (77%) or student (88%). In addition, students also agreed that the journal was helpful in increasing their confidence (51%), developing creativity (54%), and strengthening their communication skills (54%). The students' favorite domain for personal reflections was ""physical and mental health care"", with 66% of responses. More than 80% of students considered that writing about their goals and commitments, and about their study method and assignments, helped them to better organize their time. Moreover, 83% of students stated that they would like to continue with the habit of keeping a journal to organize their academic activities. Students positively valued the journals as a planning tool in their academic tasks. Importantly, students also positively evaluated the value of journaling as a useful tool for maintaining better physical and mental health. This is an important achievement given the emotional stress, anxiety and burn out that many medical students deal with, especially in times of the pandemic. Journaling is a cost-effective and easily implementable method in different STEM areas to promote metacognition and mental health in students.","Pena-Silva, Velasco-Castro, Matsingos, Jaramillo-Rincon","https://doi.org/10.1096/fasebj.2022.36.S1.R4840","20220513","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31375,""
"Post CovÃ„Â±d-19 VaccÃ„Â±natÃ„Â±on Inflammatory Syndrome: A Case Report","A previously healthy 24-year-old male patient was referred to our clinic with bilateral lower extremity pain and dark urine, which developed two weeks after receiving the second dose of BNT162b2 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. Laboratory tests indicated rhabdomyolysis. Lower extremity magnetic resonance imaging was compatible with myositis. Myositis-related antibodies were negative. Biopsy taken from gastrocnemius muscle revealed muscle necrosis and striking expression of major histocompatibility complex class I antigen. He was successfully treated, and his complaints resolved. One week later at follow-up, he reported new-onset exertional dyspnea with palpitations. ST-segment depressions were spotted on electrocardiography. Troponin T was found elevated as 0.595 ng/mL (normal &lt;0.014 ng/mL). Echocardiography showed hypokinetic left ventricle with ejection fraction of 40%, and pericardial effusion of 2mm. An appropriate treatment plan was formulated for the diagnosis of myocarditis, eventually the patient recovered within ten days.

"Effect of Social Isolation on Ovarian Follicles in Female Mice","Stay-at-home orders and social distancing have been central to the public health strategy employed during the COVID-19 pandemic. While these measures are essential for reducing the transmission of COVID-19, surveys administered during the pandemic revealed that this decrease in social interaction also resulted in increased loneliness and isolation in human populations over the past year. Social interaction is an important component of overall human wellness. In fact, social contact and social support are associated with better health and decreased mortality in humans. More studies are needed to specifically investigate how social isolation affects reproductive systems. Based on the rationale that environmental stimuli can influence hormonal cascades and therefore affect reproduction, we hypothesized that the lack of social stimuli experienced during social isolation influences the production of ovarian follicles. To test this, three-week-old female Swiss-Webster mice were placed in individual housing or in groups of three for five weeks, then their ovaries were harvested and embedded in Durcupan. From each right ovary, we cut 110 sections at 2-ÃŽÂ¼m thickness, 20 sections at 10-ÃŽÂ¼m thickness, and 100 sections at 2-ÃŽÂ¼m thickness. The cuts were oriented transversely to the oviduct. An observer, blind to experimental treatment, evaluated sample sections taken every 50 Ã‚Âµm by counting the total number of follicles present. In our preliminary analysis, we observed fewer follicles in individually housed mice than in group-housed mice. These preliminary results suggest that social isolation has implications for reproductive health and, in a larger context, demonstrate the importance of intraspecies interactions for social animals.","Rice, Pack, Provost, Keesom","https://doi.org/10.1096/fasebj.2022.36.S1.R3185","20220513","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31377,""
"Effect of COVID-19 on the Mental Health of College Students","COVID-19 has impacted the world greatly, leading researchers to be interested in the virus's relation to mental health among various settings. Repeated isolation due to quarantining and virtual school created a change in academic approach for students across college campuses and is thought to have negatively influenced their mental health, leading us to hypothesize that college students will have decreased levels of motivation and increased percentages of depression over an academic year. This study anonymously surveyed students from Lee University on their mental health over the course of their COVID-19-influenced college experience regarding their motivation, sleep patterns, and physical activity. Results showed that about half of the students felt their academic motivation was affected by the pandemic. Additionally, almost half of the students scored in the moderate to severe range of depression, with a weak correlation to the number of hours slept or the inclusion of physical activity daily. Participants also shared insights into whether they believed they looked after their mental health well during the school year, noting their attitudes and ways in which community and activity helped maintain a balanced mental health status. Findings conclude that although most students said that their academic year was not affected by COVID-19 in a drastic way on Lee University's campus, students still agreed that their college experience and outlook on mental health was influenced by the pandemic positively and negatively. These outcomes can provide small universities a better understanding of student experiences during COVID-19 to proactively meet the needs of students moving forward.","Marushka, Hobbs","https://doi.org/10.1096/fasebj.2022.36.S1.R2458","20220513","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31378,""
"Pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of fentanyl toxicity reversal by anti-fentanyl monoclonal antibodies in combination with naloxone","Widespread access to illicit fentanyl has contributed to an ongoing epidemic of fatal drug overdoses in the United States. The incidence of fatal overdoses in the United States accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic, with over 100,000 deaths recorded by April 2021. Fentanyl-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb) offer a prophylactic and therapeutic intervention against opioid overdose by binding and sequestering fentanyl in serum, and reducing distribution to the brain. Here, the kinetics of overdose reversal by anti-fentanyl mAb alone or in combination with naloxone were explored, and the dose-response relationship between naloxone and high doses of fentanyl in the presence of mAb was evaluated. To evaluate the kinetics of fentanyl reversal, fentanyl 0.1 mg/kg was administered to male Sprague-Dawley rats, and mAb or naloxone was administered fifteen minutes after exposure. Oxygen saturation was monitored constantly for ten minutes following administration of reversal agent. To evaluate duration and extent of protection from further fentanyl exposures, rats were pre-treated with mAb, naloxone, or a combination, and challenged with increasing doses of fentanyl up to 0.5 mg/kg. Finally, to determine whether the presence of mAb would increase efficacy of naloxone against a lethal dose of fentanyl, 2.25 mg/kg fentanyl was administered, followed by naloxone 0.01 to 1.0 mg/kg. The most rapid reversal of fentanyl toxicity was achieved by intravenous administration of a combination of anti-fentanyl mAb and naloxone (&lt;1 min). Intravenous naloxone reversed fentanyl toxicity more quickly than subcutaneous naloxone, and intravenous mAb was effective against fentanyl within 4 minutes, similar to subcutaneous NLX. Against further challenges of fentanyl, both mAb and 0.1 mg/kg naloxone were effective against 0.1-0.2 mg/kg fentanyl, and the combination of mAb and naloxone was effective against doses of 0.5 mg/kg fentanyl or higher. Prophylactic administration of mAb enhanced efficacy of naloxone in reversing a potentially lethal challenge of 2.25 mg/kg fentanyl. Finally, mAb sequestered high concentrations of both fentanyl and its metabolite norfentanyl in serum, and reduced brain concentrations of fentanyl in pre-exposure scenarios. These results support translation of mAb as medical countermeasures to prevent and reverse opioid overdose related to fentanyl and its analogs.","Baehr, Pravetoni","https://doi.org/10.1096/fasebj.2022.36.S1.R5896","20220513","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31379,""
"COVID-19-Related Burden and Risk Perception in Individuals with Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy and Multifocal Motor Neuropathy: A Cross-Sectional Study","This study investigated the mental health burden of patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) or multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) during the COVID-19 pandemic in comparison to matched healthy controls. The cross-sectional study included 59 patients with a diagnosis of either CIDP or MMN and 59 propensity score matched healthy controls. All participants completed a survey including demographics, distress (distress thermometer), depressive symptoms (PHQ-2), generalized anxiety (GAD-7), COVID-19-related fear, and risk perception. Additionally, patients with CIDP or MMN were asked about the frequency and type of infections since treatment initiation. Patients with either CIDP or MMN reported experiencing reduced frequency or no differences in infection frequency since immune medication was initiated. Regarding COVID-19, patients with CIDP or MMN rated their risk of infection similar to healthy controls, while they expected a higher probability of the occurrence of symptoms, severe course, and dying of COVID-19. They reported increased depressive symptoms, generalized anxiety, and COVID-19-related fear in comparison to healthy controls. Despite their personal experience of reduced frequency of infection since immune medication was initiated, patients with CIDP or MMN reported increased risk perception and prevalence of depressive symptoms, generalized anxiety, and COVID-19-related fear in comparison to healthy controls. This highlights the need for evidence-driven strategies to protect the mental health of this vulnerable group.","Musche, BÃƒÂ¤uerle, Jahre, Schweda, Dinse, Moradian, WeismÃƒÂ¼ller, Fink, Wolters, Fleischer, Kleinschnitz, Teufel, Skoda, Stettner","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40120-022-00359-3","20220513","Anxiety; CIDP; COVID-19; Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy; MMN; Mental health; Multifocal motor neuropathy; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31380,""
"Hypoechogenicity of brainstem raphe in long-COVID syndrome-less common but independently associated with depressive symptoms: a cross-sectional study","Long coronavirus disease (Long-COVID) syndrome is a hitherto poorly understood phenomenon with a broad spectrum of symptoms, including depression and anxiety. Depressive symptoms have been associated with brainstem raphe (BR) alterations in transcranial sonography (TCS) that might reflect dysfunction of the serotonergic system. The primary aim was to investigate the connection of BR alterations with depressive and anxiety symptoms in patients with Long-COVID syndrome. In a cross-sectional study design, we included outpatients fulfilling the criteria of Long-COVID syndrome. All patients were examined by TCS in the axial plane with focus on BR signal alterations. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to test for symptoms of anxiety and depression. We included nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°70 patients with Long-COVID syndrome, of which 28.6% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°20) exhibited a reduced echogenicity of BR in the TCS examination. Patients with hypoechogenic BR had higher subscores for anxiety and depression compared to normoechogenic patients (HADS depression: median 8 versus 5.5, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.006; HADS anxiety: median 9 versus 6.5, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.006). After adjustment for reasonable confounders, only the odds ratio (OR) for relevant depressive symptoms was higher among Long-COVID patients with hypoechogenic raphe (adjusted OR 3.884, 95% CI 1.244-12.123). Hypoechogenic BR alterations are independently associated with depressive symptoms in Long-COVID patients but are not highly frequent. Future studies should investigate whether the hypoechogenicity of the BR is a direct consequence or whether it reflects a priori a higher susceptibility to depressive symptoms after COVID-19, thus enabling to identify COVID-19 patients at higher risk of developing Long-COVID depressive symptoms.","Richter, Schulze, James, Siems, Trampe, Gold, Krogias, Faissner","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00415-022-11154-3","20220513","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31381,""

"The Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Penetrating Neurotrauma at a Level 1 Trauma Center","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the global delivery of healthcare. Recent data suggests a possible impact of the pandemic on patterns of neurotrauma. The aim was to assess the impact of the pandemic on the incidence of neurotrauma, with a focus on cranial gunshot wounds (cGSWs) at a large midwestern level 1 trauma center. We conducted a retrospective review of our trauma registry from March through September 2020 and compared it to the same months in 2019. Odds ratios were utilized to assess for differences in patient demographics, injury characteristics, rates of neurotrauma, and rates of cranial gunshot wounds. A total of 1188 patients presented with neurotrauma, 558 in 2019 and 630 in 2020. The majority of patients were male (71.33% in 2019; 68.57% in 2020) and Caucasian (78.67% in 2019; 75.4% in 2020). Patients presented with cGSWs more frequently in 2020 (n=49, 7.78%) than in 2019 (n=25, 4.48%). The odds of suffering a cGSW in 2020 was 73.6% higher than in 2019 (95% C.I. {1.0871, 2.7722} p=0.0209). The etiology of such injury was most commonly assault (n=16, 21.62% 2019; n=34, 45.95% 2020), followed by self-inflicted injury (n=4, 5.41% 2019; 12, 16.22% 2020). Despite the government-mandated shutdown, we observed an increase in the number of neurotrauma cases in 2020. There was a significant increase in the incidence cGSWs in 2020, with an increase in assaults and self-inflicted injuries. Further investigation into socioeconomic factors for the observed increase in cGSWs is warranted.","Yang, Johnson, Solomon, Ferguson, Johnson, Gerges, Wright, Parr, Ngwenya","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2022.05.001","20220513","COVID-19; Cranial gunshot wounds; Neurotrauma; Pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31383,""
"Psychological distress and social support among conflict refugees in urban, semi-rural and rural settlements in Uganda: burden and associations","Recent research shows that psychological distress is on the rise globally as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and restrictions imposed on populations to manage it. We studied the association between psychological distress and social support among conflict refugees in urban, semi-rural and rural settlements in Uganda during the COVID-19 pandemic. Cross-sectional survey data on psychological distress, social support, demographics, socio-economic and behavioral variables was gathered from 1014 adult refugees randomly sampled from urban, semi-rural and rural refugee settlementsÃ‚Â in Uganda, using two-staged cluster sampling. Data was analyzed in SPSS-version 22, and statistical significance was assumed at pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05. Refugees resident in rural/semi-rural settlements exhibited higher levels of psychological distress [F(2, 1011)Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°47.91; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001], higher availability of social interaction [F(2, 1011)Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°82.24; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001], lower adequacy of social interaction [F(2, 1011)Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°54.11; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001], higher availability of social attachment [F(2, 1011)Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°47.95; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001], and lower adequacy of social attachment [F(2, 1011)Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°50.54; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001] than peers in urban settlements. Adequacy of social interaction significantly explained variations in psychological distress levels overall and consistently across settlements, after controlling for plausible confounders. Additionally, adequacy of social attachment significantly explained variations in psychological distress levels among refugees in rural settlements, after controlling for plausible confounders. There is a settlement-inequality (i.e. rural vs. urban) in psychological distress and social support among conflict refugees in Uganda. To address psychological distress, Mental Health and Psychosocial Support Services (MHPSS) should focus on strategies which strengthen the existing social networks among refugees. Variations in social support are a key predictor of distress which should guide tailored need-adapted interventions instead of duplicating similar and generic interventions across diverse refugee settlements.","Seruwagi, Nakidde, Lugada, Ssematiko, Ddamulira, Masaba, Luswata, Ochen, Okot, Muhangi, Lawoko","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13031-022-00451-3","20220513","COVID-19; Conflict refugees; MHPSS; Psychological distress; Social support; Uganda; Urban / rural; Urban refugees","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31384,""
"Development, implementation and evaluation of the online Movement, Interaction and Nutrition for Greater Lifestyles in the Elderly (MINGLE) program: The protocol for a pilot trial","People with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) are more likely to experience loneliness, have poorer diets and be less physically active than people without AMD. The online Movement, Interaction and Nutrition for Greater Lifestyles in the Elderly (MINGLE) program is a holistic evidence-based intervention aiming to support people with AMD by incorporating physical activity, social interaction and nutrition education components all delivered via a COVID-19-safe Zoom platform. This study will involve two phases: 1) a formative qualitative study with AMD patients to identify the barriers and facilitators to participating in the proposed MINGLE program; and 2) a 10-week pilot study to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of MINGLE. Phase 1 involves AMD patients who will be recruited from an eye clinic in Western Sydney, Australia to participate in audio-recorded semi-structured interviews. Verbatim interview transcripts will be coded using the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation and Behaviour (COM-B) model and themes established. These themes will be used as a guide to specifically tailor the proposed MINGLE program to people with AMD. Phase 2 involves 52 AMD patients who will then be recruited from the same clinic to participate in the MINGLE program. Pre-post questionnaires will be administered to intervention participants to collect information on the following variables: demographics, socioeconomic status, vision function, loneliness, quality of life (including depression), falls risk, physical activity (level), and dietary intake.

"Digital Health Interventions for Delivery of Mental Health Care: Systematic and Comprehensive Meta-Review","The COVID-19 pandemic has shifted mental health care delivery to digital platforms, videoconferencing, and other mobile communications. However, existing reviews of digital health interventions are narrow in scope and focus on a limited number ofÃ‚Â mental health conditions. To address this gap, we conducted a comprehensive systematic meta-review of the literature to assess the state of digital health interventions for the treatment of mental health conditions. We searched MEDLINE for secondary literature published between 2010 and 2021 on the use, efficacy, and appropriateness of digital health interventions for the delivery of mental health care. Of the 3022 records identified, 466 proceeded to full-text review and 304 met the criteria for inclusion in this study. A majority (52%) of research involved the treatment of substance use disorders, 29% focused on mood, anxiety, and traumatic stress disorders, and &gt;5% for each remaining mental health conditions. Synchronous and asynchronous communication, computerized therapy, and cognitive training appear to be effective but require further examination in understudied mental health conditions. Similarly, virtual reality, mobile apps, social media platforms, and web-based forums are novel technologies that have the potential to improve mental health but require higher quality evidence. Digital health interventions offer promise in the treatment of mental health conditions. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, digital health interventions provide a safer alternative to face-to-face treatment. However, further research on the applications of digital interventions in understudied mental health conditions is needed. Additionally, evidence is needed on the effectiveness and appropriateness of digital health tools for patients who are marginalized and may lack access to digital health interventions.","Philippe, Sikder, Jackson, Koblanski, Liow, Pilarinos, Vasarhelyi","https://doi.org/10.2196/35159","20220513","COVID-19; computer-assisted therapy; digital health; mental health; mobile applications; mobile apps; online therapy; telemedicine; telepsychiatry; telepsychology; virtual reality exposure therapy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31386,""
"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on emergency department attendances for young people","There are concerns that the COVID-19 pandemic is having an indirect negative impact on young people. We aimed to assess the impact of the pandemic on emergency department (ED) presentations and admissions. We analysed ED presentations and admissions from a 5-year period (April 2016-February 2021). An interrupted time series analysis was used to estimate the presentations and admissions that would have been seen in year 5 without the pandemic using the data from years 1 to 4. These estimations were used to calculate the difference between the expected and the observed presentations and admissions during the pandemic year. There were 166Ã¢â‚¬â€°459 presentations over 5Ã¢â‚¬â€°years. There was a 38.1% (95% CI 33.9% to 42.3%) reduction in presentations during the pandemic with no variation by sex, age, deprivation or ethnicity. Largest reductions were associated with children being home schooled rather than with lockdowns. For admissions, there was a 23.4% (17.4% to 29.4%) reduction, less for 5-17Ã¢â‚¬â€°year age group. Infection and asthma/wheeze presentations reduced by around 60% with smaller reductions for mental health and trauma. There was no change for surgical presentations, burns/scolds or allergic reactions. There was an increase in females aged 11-17 years presenting with mental health issues during the pandemic. During the pandemic, there was a substantial reduction in both ED presentations and admissions. The differential impact on specific presentations suggests this was due to the impact of social distancing and reduced social mixing rather than widening of health inequality or increased barriers to care.

"Vital Signs: Changes in Firearm Homicide and Suicide Rates - United States, 2019-2020","The majority of homicides (79%) and suicides (53%) in the United States involved a firearm in 2020. High firearm homicide and suicide rates and corresponding inequities by race and ethnicity and poverty level represent important public health concerns. This study examined changes in firearm homicide and firearm suicide rates coinciding with the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. National vital statistics and population data were integrated with urbanization and poverty measures at the county level. Population-based firearm homicide and suicide rates were examined by age, sex, race and ethnicity, geographic area, level of urbanization, and level of poverty. From 2019 to 2020, the overall firearm homicide rate increased 34.6%, from 4.6 to 6.1 per 100,000 persons. The largest increases occurred among non-Hispanic Black or African American males aged 10-44 years and non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) males aged 25-44 years. Rates of firearm homicide were lowest and increased least at the lowest poverty level and were higher and showed larger increases at higher poverty levels. The overall firearm suicide rate remained relatively unchanged from 2019 to 2020 (7.9 to 8.1); however, in some populations, including AI/AN males aged 10-44 years, rates did increase. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the firearm homicide rate in the United States reached its highest level since 1994, with substantial increases among several population subgroups. These increases have widened disparities in rates by race and ethnicity and poverty level. Several increases in firearm suicide rates were also observed. Implementation of comprehensive strategies employing proven approaches that address underlying economic, physical, and social conditions contributing to the risks for violence and suicide is urgently needed to reduce these rates and disparities.","Kegler, Simon, Zwald, Chen, Mercy, Jones, Mercado-Crespo, Blair, Stone, Ottley, Dills","https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7119e1","20220513","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31388,""
"On Covid-19 and mental health: An observational study on depression, anxiety, and loneliness during the second lockdown in patients with Alzheimer disease","While visiting and socialization restrictions during lockdowns were instituted to cope with the Covid-19 spread and to prolong the life of residents of retirement homes, these measures could have been expected to decrease the quality of life of their residents.We assessed longitudinal effects of the two successive lockdowns, as implemented in France, on mental health (i.e., depression, anxiety, and loneliness) in 62 retirement home residents with Alzheimer disease (AD).Analysis demonstrated higher levels of depression, anxiety, and loneliness during the second lockdown than during the first lockdown.The increased levels of depression, anxiety, and loneliness during the second lockdown can be attributed to the longer duration of the restrictive measures, especially the restriction of visits, that were implemented in retirement homes. In addition, the increased workload of geriatric healthcare workers leading to higher levels of burnout and decreased quality of care may help explain the increased loneliness, depression, and anxiety of retirement home residents with AD, which were observed during the second Covid-19 era lockdown.","El Haj, Boutoleau-BretonniÃƒÂ¨re, Allain, Kapogiannis, Chapelet, Gallouj","https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000029145","20220513","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31389,""

"Impact of COVID-19 and lockdown on mental health and future orientation among young adult asylum seekers in Italy: A mixed-methods study","The COVID-19 outbreak caused a worldwide health emergency which disproportionately affected migrants and ethnic minorities. Yet, little is known about the psychosocial effects of the pandemic among refugees and asylum seekers. This study used a convergent parallel mixed-method design to explore knowledge and opinions concerning COVID-19 and the impact of lockdown on perceived mental health and future orientation among 42 young adult asylum seekers residing in northeastern Italy. Participants took part in individual interviews comprising both qualitative and quantitative questions. Qualitative reports were analyzed using thematic content analysis, whereas descriptive statistics and paired sample <i>t</i>-tests were computed on quantitative data. Results indicated that most participants were correctly informed about the nature, origin, and spread of COVID-19, expressed moderate or high satisfaction concerning the clarity of communication about safety measures, and followed them most of the time. Worries about family in the home country, loneliness, fear for own and loved ones' health, and concerns about delays in the asylum application were the most frequently mentioned stressful events. Psychological and physical distress significantly increased, and positive future orientation significantly decreased during the lockdown. However, participants also emphasized the usefulness of instrumental support from social workers and exhibited a resilient attitude characterized by the acceptance of uncertainty, sense of connectedness, and positive outlook. Overall, findings suggest that the current emergency may exacerbate psychological vulnerabilities of asylum seekers due to continued existential uncertainty. Thus, individual and contextual assets should be strengthened to promote psychosocial adjustment and coping resources in the context of the pandemic.","Ceccon, Moscardino","https://doi.org/10.1177/13634615221098306","20220513","COVID-19; asylum seekers; future orientation; mental health; mixed methods","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31392,""

"Investigating the feasibility of MePlusMe, an online intervention to support mental health, well-being, and study skills in higher education students","While there are several web-based mental health interventions, few target higher education (HE) students. Importantly, more research is needed to establish their effectiveness. Here, we provide a pragmatic evaluation of an online intervention (MePlusMe) specifically designed to improve the mental health, well-being, and study skills of HE students. In accordance with the published protocol for a feasibility study, we recruited a convenience sample of 137 HE students to participate in an eight-week intervention, with 26 participants retained at week 8. Validated measures of mood (depression and anxiety), well-being, and self-efficacy were collected at baseline, 2, 4, and 8<b>Ã¢â‚¬â€°</b>weeks, alongside two feedback forms assessing design and functionality (baseline) and engagement (week 4 and 8). We observed significant reductions in levels of anxiety and depression as well as increases in well-being, but no changes in self-efficacy. Participants rated the system design and functionality positively and qualitative findings indicated high levels of satisfaction with MePlusMe. Findings support both the acceptability and the effectiveness of MePlusMe. Nonetheless, modest retention rates limit the precision and generalisability of these findings.

"Predictors of Depression in Nurses During COVID-19 Health Emergency; the Mediating Role of Resilience: A Cross-Sectional Study","Nurses are susceptible to several mental problems, such as fear, stress, and depression due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which affects their emotional well-being. However, resilience plays an important role in mitigating the effects of COVID-19. This study was to examine the mediating role of resilience in the relation between fear, stress, and depression of nurses during COVID-19 health emergencies. A cross-sectional-predictive study was carried out. The variables analyzed were fear, resilience, stress, and depression. A total of 286 nurses from 2 hospitals in the cities of Juliaca and Puno, Peru. Data analyses were performed using structural equation modeling (SEM). Analyses showed that the variables were significantly related (<i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01).

As biopsychosocial models propose that not only the disease but also sociodemographic and psychosocial factors contribute to the development and maintenance of symptoms, this study investigates the predictive value of these factors for bothersome somatic symptoms in SARS-CoV-2 negative healthcare professionals. German healthcare professionals were assessed with self-rating questionnaires and underwent SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody tests at baseline and 8Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks later between April and August 2020. Differences in psychosocial variables between the time points were analyzed and regression analyses were performed to predict somatic symptoms at follow-up. 1185 seronegative healthcare professionals completed both assessments. Previous somatic symptom burden, higher levels of anxiety, being a nurse, younger age, higher psychological symptom burden, lower efficiency, and higher fatigability at baseline predicted somatic symptom burden at follow-up. Comparisons between baseline and follow-up showed a significant improvement in psychological impairment and deterioration of physical exhaustion. Our study applies a biopsychosocial perspective to bothersome somatic symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic and contributes to the identification of potential risk factors as a starting point for future interventions that could support the handling of symptoms.","Engelmann, Toussaint, Addo, Brehm, Lohse, Weigel, Thompson, LÃƒÂ¶we","https://doi.org/10.1080/09638237.2022.2069709","20220513","COVID-19; healthcare professionals; mental health; persistent somatic symptoms; somatic symptom burden; somatic symptom disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31397,""

Specifically, I analyze all 3216 citations of KÃƒÂ¼bler-Ross in the <i>New York Times</i> and the <i>Web of Science</i> database using qualitative and quantitative text analysis. I demonstrate how early scientific interest and commercial promotion led to adoption in popular culture, and document how the five-stage model expanded to cover everything from rent prices to COVID-19. I also argue that renewed interest in KÃƒÂ¼bler-Ross's work may signal contemporary attempts to mine the tradition for meaningful understandings of death and dying.","Bernau","https://doi.org/10.1177/00302228221098893","20220513","cultural sociology; death; diffusion; institutionalization; text analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31400,""
"Rapid review and commentary on the clinical implications of the population mental health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia","To provide a rapid clinical review and commentary for psychiatrists on the population mental health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia, including evidence-based findings and interventions. Whilst there was evidence of collective psychological resilience during the first 2Ã‚Â years of the COVID-19 pandemic, younger women, carers for those with COVID-19, and those with more household chores, childcare needs and higher economic strain, were at more risk. Interventions should therefore target people with these socio-demographic risk factors, as well as severe COVID-19 survivors, their relatives and frontline workers. However, the rapid spread of the Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant has the potential for greater impacts on population mental health. Innovations in telehealth and online therapy should be incorporated into standard care. Ongoing research is needed to assess who remains most vulnerable to negative mental health impacts of the current pandemic, and especially the longer term outcomes of mental ill health. Further research should also investigate evidence-based approaches to resilience and well-being.

"Soluble ACE2 and angiotensin II levels are modulated in hypertensive COVID-19 patients treated with different antihypertension drugs","This study examines the effect of antihypertensive drugs on ACE2 and Angiotensin II levels in hypertensive COVID-19 patients. Hypertension is a common comorbidity among severe COVID-19 patients. ACE2 expression can be modulated by antihypertensive drugs such as ACEis and ARBs, which may affect COVID-19's prognosis. BB and CCB reduce mortality, according to some evidence. Their effect on circulating levels of ACE2 and angiotensin II, as well as the severity of COVID-19, is less well studied. The clinical data were collected from 200 patients in four different antihypertensive medication classes (ACEi, ARB, BB, and CCB). Angiotensin II and ACE2 levels were determined using standard ELISA kits. ACE2, angiotensin II, and other clinical indices were evaluated by linear regression models.

ACE2 levels were higher in COVID-19 patients with severe disease (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.04) than mild (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.07) and moderate (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.007). The length of hospital stay is correlated with ACE2 levels (<i>r</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.3, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.003). Angiotensin II levels decreased with severity (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.04). Higher ACE2 levels are associated with higher CRP and D-dimer levels. Elevated Angiotensin II was associated with low levels of CRP, D-dimer, and troponin. ACE2 levels increase with disease severity in patients taking an ARB (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01), patients taking ACEi, the degree of disease severity was associated with a decrease in angiotensin II. BB patients had the lowest disease severity. We found different levels of soluble ACE2, and angiotensin II are observed among COVID-19 patients taking different antihypertensive medications and exhibiting varying levels of disease severity. COVID-19 severity increases with elevated ACE2 levels and lower angiotensin II levels indicating that BB treatment reduces severity regardless of levels of ACE2 and angiotensin II.","A Elrayess, T Zedan, A Alattar, Abusriwil, Al-Ruweidi, Almuraikhy, Parengal, Alhariri, Yassine, A Hssain, Nair, Al Samawi, Abdelmajid, Al Suwaidi, Omar Saad, Al-Maslamani, Omrani, Yalcin","https://doi.org/10.1080/08037051.2022.2055530","20220513","ACE2; ACEi; Angiotensin II; COVID-19; hypertension","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31402,""
"Evaluation of a Suicide Prevention Program Encompassing Both Student and Teacher Training Components","<b/> <i>Background:</i> Although suicide prevention programs have been shown to change suicide-related knowledge and attitudes, relatively little is known about their effects on actual behavior. <i>Aims:</i> Therefore, the focus of the present study was on improving participating school staff's practical and communication skills. <i>Method:</i> Suicide prevention workshops for students in grades 8-10 (<i>N</i> = 200) and a gatekeeper training program for school staff (<i>N</i> = 150) were conducted in 12 secondary schools in Germany. Schools were alternately assigned to one of three interventions (staff, students, or both trained) or to a waitlist control group. <i>Results:</i> School staff undergoing the training showed increased action-related knowledge, greater self-efficacy when counseling students in need and augmented counseling skills, and also had more conversations with students in need. Although students participating in the workshops did not seek help more frequently, they provided help to their peers more often in the conditions in which both students and school staff or only the latter had been trained. <i>Limitations:</i> The generalizability of the results is constrained by high dropout rates due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the relatively small sample size. <i>Conclusion:</i> A combination of suicide prevention programs for school staff and students appears to be most effective.","Bockhoff, Ellermeier, Bruder","https://doi.org/10.1027/0227-5910/a000862","20220513","gatekeeper training; psycho-educational training; students; suicide prevention in schools; teachers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31403,""

"Effects of Negative Emotions and Cognitive Characteristics on Impulse Buying During COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic has seriously disrupted the individual buying habits along with their consumption patterns. Previous studies indicated that anxiety and depression were related to impulse buying. However, no research has explored the mechanism possibly underlying the association between anxiety, depression, and impulse buying. Based on the regulatory focus theory and the emotion-cognition-behavior loop, this study aimed to examine the impacts of negative emotions on impulse buying and the mediating role of cognitive characteristics during the COVID-19 pandemic. In April 2021, 734 Chinese undergraduates were recruited by cluster sampling and they completed self-report measures of anxiety, depression, intolerance of uncertainty, cognitive flexibility, and impulse buying. Results showed that impulse buying was positively associated with anxiety, depression, and intolerance of uncertainty, while it was negatively associated with cognitive flexibility. Cognitive flexibility fully mediated the effects of anxiety and depression on cognitive facet of impulse buying. Meanwhile, intolerance of uncertainty fully mediated the effects of anxiety and depression on affective facet of impulse buying. Overall, this study shows that different pathways can explain how anxiety and depression exacerbate two aspects of impulse buying, and it highlights the importance of cognitive characteristics for the link between negative emotions and impulse buying. Intervention programs should focus on increasing cognitive flexibility and tolerance to uncertainty of high-risk individuals, so as to strengthen their adaptive purchase behaviors.","Yu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.848256","20220513","anxiety; cognitive flexibility; depression; impulse buying; intolerance of uncertainty","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31405,""
"Uses of Energy Psychology Following Catastrophic Events","Energy psychology, as most widely practiced, integrates the manual stimulation of acupuncture points with imaginal exposure, cognitive restructuring, and other evidence-based psychotherapeutic procedures. Efficacy for energy psychology protocols has been established in more than 120 clinical trials, with meta-analyses showing strong effect sizes for PTSD, anxiety, and depression. The approach has been applied in the wake of natural and human-made disasters in more than 30 countries. Four tiers of energy psychology interventions following the establishment of safety, trust, and rapport are described, including (1) immediate relief/stabilization, (2) reducing limbic arousal to trauma-based triggers, (3) overcoming complex psychological difficulties, and (4) promoting optimal functioning. The first tier is most pertinent in psychological first aid immediately following a disaster, with the subsequent tiers progressively being introduced over time with complex stress reactions and chronic disorders. Advantages of adding the stimulation of acupuncture points to a conventional exposure approach are identified, and challenges around cultural sensitivities and unintended effects are discussed. After establishing a framework for introducing energy psychology in disaster relief efforts, reports from a sampling of settings are presented, based on interviews with this paper's author. These include accounts of relief work with survivors of mass shootings, genocide, ethnic warfare, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, wildfires, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Hundreds of other reports from the field show a pattern of strong outcomes following the use of energy psychology in the days or weeks after a disaster and in the subsequent treatment of trauma-based psychological problems. Many of these accounts corroborate one another in terms of rapid relief and long-term benefits. Finally, examples of more efficient delivery methods utilizing large groups, lay counselors, digital technology, and cultivating community resilience are presented.","Feinstein","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.856209","20220513","acupressure; acupuncture; catastrophic events; disasters; emotional freedom techniques; energy psychology; thought field therapy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31406,""
"The Relationship of Breathing and COVID-19 Anxiety When Using Smart Watches for Guided Respiration Practice: A Cross-Sectional Study","COVID-19 mortality rates are increasing worldwide, which has led to many highly restrictive precautionary measures and a strong sense of anxiety about the outbreak for many people around the world. There is thus an increasing concern about COVID-19 anxiety, resulting in recommending approaches for effective self-care. From a positive psychology perspective, it is also important for people to have positive affect when dealing with this pandemic. According to previous literature, respiration is considered to be an effective way to enhance people's mental health. Among all the wearable devices, Apple Watch has the largest market share, so this study recruited Chinese users that use respiration exercise function on Apple Watch; a total of 316 valid data were retrieved. Meanwhile, to understand one approach related to using Apple Watch to practice respiration to reduce COVID-19 anxiety about being infected during the COVID-19 outbreak, this study used a web-based cross-sectional survey to examine anxiety about being infected by COVID-19 among Chinese people who had been using the Apple Watch to practice respiration during the period of the COVID-19 outbreak. The study was based on the Health Theoretical Model, and the model was developed with four dimensions and was validated with structural equation modeling. The results of this study showed that practicing few minutes had a positive relationship on positive attitude, and positive attitude had a negative relationship on pandemic anxiety and a positive relationship on continuance use intention. Anxiety about the pandemic had a negative relationship on the intention to continue using the function. This showed that respiration practice can help to suppress the increase in anxiety levels regarding this pandemic.","Wu, Chen, Ye, Hong, Ye, Wu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.847602","20220513","Apple Watch; COVID-19 anxiety; continuance intention; guided respiration practice; positive affect; positive psychology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31407,""
"Manifestation of Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Its Association With Somatic Symptoms Among Occupational and Physical Therapists During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The purpose of the study was to examine the level of generalized anxiety disorder among occupational and physical therapists during treatment sessions and its association with somatic symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. A descriptive cross-sectional design was used in this study. Data were collected during the month of April 2021, and the study included occupational and physical therapists who practiced during COVID-19 from March 2020 to March 2021. The generalized anxiety disorder scale (GAD-7) and a modified patient health questionnaire (mPHQ-15) were used to examine self-reported anxiety and somatic symptoms among the study participants. The independent <i>t</i>-test was used to determine differences between groups based on GAD-7 and mPHQ-15 results. Spearman's correlation test and chi-squared test were used to find the relationships between different variables such as anxiety and somatic symptoms. The study (<i>n</i> = 98 participants) included 56 occupational and 42 physical therapists. An 84% response rate was achieved. GAD-7 final score was ÃŽÂ¼ = 9.21 Ã‚Â± 5.63 with 27% reporting no anxiety, 14% mild, 38% moderate, and 21% severe. Independent <i>t</i>-tests on GAD-7 scores showed significant differences between therapist specializations [<i>t</i> <sub>(96)</sub> = -2.256; <i>p</i> = 0.026] and between therapists residing with or without their parents [<i>t</i> <sub>(96)</sub> = -2.536; <i>p</i> = 0.013].

"Perspectives of healthcare workers in South Africa on COVID-19 vaccination passports","Following the rollout of several effective vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), many countries have introduced vaccination passports or certificates as a means of certifying that an individual has been vaccinated against, is immune to, or is presently uninfected with COVID-19. An extensive ethical debate has ensued. To determine the perspectives of South African healthcare workers (HCWs) on the implementation of COVID-19 vaccination passports (C19VPs) in South Africa (SA). Healthcare workers working in various fields and practice settings throughout SA were invited to complete an online questionnaire. An online questionnaire was distributed using convenience sampling via social media platforms to HCWs over a 1-month period, collecting demographic details and responses to 8 Likert-type items regarding agreement with C19VPs, ethical issues and feasibility. Each item was graded from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree), with grouping of 4 of the 8 items exploring a common theme of C19VPs being a good idea, constituting a score out of 20. Non-parametric tests were performed to determine differences in responses between groups. One thousand HCWs responded to the survey and fulfilled inclusion criteria. The majority (83.2%) of respondents were medical practitioners (MPs). Overall, most (73.5%) respondents agreed that C19VPs are a good idea. Older respondents agreed more strongly than younger respondents (medians 18 and 17, respectively, <i>p</i> = 0.001), and respondents in private practice agreed more strongly than those in state practice (medians 18 and 16, respectively, <i>p</i> = 0.042). The median response was neutral (3) in response to the ethics of C19VPs considering variations in vaccine access and tending towards disagreement (2.5) in disadvantaging poorer people. Most respondents disagreed that vaccine hesitancy would make C19VPs unethical, and responses from provinces with the highest vaccination proportions disagreed more than others with lower vaccination proportion (median 2 compared with 3, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). There was uncertainty about the feasibility of C19VPs in SA, with older HCWs, non-students, senior MPs and those who thought C19VPs are a good idea being more likely to consider them feasible. The perspectives of HCWs, mainly MPs, about C19VPs in SA were obtained. Further research should focus on vaccine hesitancy and its factors in HCWs and the effect of C19VPs on restrictions, reduction in transmission and benefits on economies and mental health. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first survey data published on the perspectives of South African HCWs on C19VPs in the country. Healthcare workers are trusted influencers of vaccination decisions, and their opinion on vaccination certificates may also influence the South African public's perception and acceptance thereof.","van Vuuren, van Vuuren","https://doi.org/10.4102/hsag.v27i0.1823","20220513","COVID-19; ethics; healthcare workers; vaccine hesitancy; vaccine passports","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31409,""
"Exploring the effects of COVID-19 restrictions on wellbeing across different styles of lockdown","Countries have instigated different restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, nationwide, strict ""lockdown"" in Scotland was enacted with breaches punishable by law, whereas restrictions in Japan allowed for travel and interaction, with citizens <i>requested</i> rather than <i>required</i> to conform. We explored the impact of these differential strategies on health behaviours and wellbeing. In February 2021, 138 Scottish and 139 Japanese participants reported their demographic information, pandemic-induced health behaviour-change (alcohol consumption, diet, perceived sleep quality, physical activity), negative mood, and perceived social isolation. Scottish participants' health behaviours were characterised by greater change (typically negative), most likely due to greater lifestyle disruption, whereas Japanese participants' behaviours were more-stable. Negative changes to health behaviours were typically associated with poorer mental wellbeing and isolation. Interestingly though, Japanese participants reported greater negative mood but not isolation despite the less-restrictive lockdown. Taken together, different lockdown styles led to different changes in health behaviours.","Ingram, Hand, Hijikata, Maciejewski","https://doi.org/10.1177/20551029221099800","20220513","COVID-19; health behaviours; lockdown; mental health; mood; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31410,""
"Psychological Distress, Fear and Coping Strategies During the Second and Third Waves of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Southern Germany","The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed enormous psychological discomfort and fear across the globe, including Germany. To assess the levels of COVID-19 associated psychological distress and fear amongst Southern German population, and to identify their coping strategies. A cross-sectional survey using an online questionnaire was conducted in healthcare and community settings in the region of Ulm, Southern Germany. Assessment inventories were the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K-10), the Brief Resilient Coping Scale (BRCS), and the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), which were valid and reliable tools. A total of 474 Individuals participated in the study. The mean age was 33.6 years, and 327 (69%) were females. Most participants (<i>n</i> = 381, 80.4%) had high levels of psychological distress, whereas only 5.1% had high levels of fear, and two-thirds of participants showed higher levels of coping. Moderate to very high levels of psychological distress were associated with being female, living alone, distress due to employment changes, experiencing financial impact, having multiple co-morbidities, being a smoker, increased alcohol use over the previous 6 months, contact with COVID-19 cases and healthcare providers for COVID-19-related stress. Individuals who were Ã¢â€°Â¥60 years, lived with non-family members, had co-morbidities and visited a healthcare provider had higher levels of fear.

"Religion and the Mediating Role of Alexithymia in the Mental Distress of Healthcare Workers During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic in a Psychiatric Hospital in China","The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has created unprecedented challenges to the healthcare system, religion, and alexithymic trait that impacts the psychological resilience of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to investigate the role religion and alexithymia play in mental distress and the level of happiness of psychiatric hospital healthcare workers in China amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, whether symptom dimensions (anxiety, depression, hostility, inferiority, and insomnia) are associated with the level of happiness, and a 6-month follow-up was also investigated. A total of one-hundred and ninety healthcare workers were recruited from a psychiatric hospital in Jilin, China, and 122 were followed up after 6 months. All participants filled out the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale, five-item Brief-Symptom Rating Scale, and the Chinese Oxford Happiness Questionnaire. The mental distress of healthcare workers decreased from 2.6 to 1.5% in 6-months. Religious belief was not associated with the mental distress or happiness of healthcare workers. Instead, for those whose anxiety decreased over 6 months, their social adaptation status increased. For those whose inferiority level decreased over time, their perceived level of psychological well-being and overall happiness increased. In over half a century of living in different societies, religion stabilizes the mental health of those in Taiwan amidst the stress of the COVID-19 pandemic, but not in China. However, both regions found healthcare workers with alexithymic traits experienced a higher level of mental distress, implying that the collectivist culture of Confucian philosophy continues to influence the emotional expression and alexithymic traits of healthcare workers in China and Taiwan. To ensure a healthy and robust clinical workforce in the treatment and control of the pandemic, the cultural impact on the psychological resilience of medical workers needs to be addressed.","Zhao, Lung, Chen, Chang, Lung","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.837916","20220513","alexithymia; coronavirus disease 2019; healthcare worker; mental distress; religion","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31412,""
"Radical Acceptance of Reality: Putting DBTÃ‚Â®-A Skill Groups Online During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Study","Emotion dysregulation is a common challenge pertaining to numerous psychiatric disorders in adolescence and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Dialectical Behavior Therapy for Adolescents (DBTÃ‚Â®-A) has been shown to be an effective treatment, especially in the reduction of self-harm and suicidality. Measures in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic set strict limits on physical contacts with patients. In order to continuously provide evidence-based specialized care to patients suffering from emotion dysregulation, we offered two online DBTÃ‚Â®-A skill groups in a video-group-call format. We aimed at assessing our online DBTÃ‚Â®-A skills groups, collect according up- and downsides, and form a basis for advancement of this form of treatment provision. Also, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients was assessed. A physical DBTÃ‚Â®-A skill group was switched to a video-group-call format and a second group was initiated <i>de novo online</i>. After five sessions, patients engaged in structured group discussions to reflect experiences. Discussion content was analyzed via Inductive Category Formation within the Framework of Qualitative Content Analysis. Patients unanimously found the COVID-19 pandemic challenging, but also reported differentially on its impact. Downsides were balanced by subjective ""gains"" in time and a perceived reduction in stress. Technical problems of the online format were discussed, but did not limit the positive experience of still receiving treatment. Patients of both online DBTÃ‚Â®-A skill groups valued the offer, felt connected, and reported benefits from the treatment. The <i>transition</i> group additionally discussed changes in structure and content of the group sessions after the switch to online meetings and reflected differential functions of the group. Although the sample size is small, and conclusions are drawn from Inductive Qualitative Content Analysis, the presented results are of interest. In our investigation, video-group-calls were both safe and beneficial for patients. This alternative to physical meetings is not only interesting for further waves of the current pandemic but also for service provision in remote areas with limited access to specialized care. Further research is needed to challenge and refine our results and to explore extensions to ""basic"" video-group-calls, such as ""break-out sessions,"" blended therapy, or real-time supervision within an online session.","Bock, Graf, Woeber, Kothgassner, Buerger, Plener","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.617941","20220513","COVID-19; DBT-A; emotion dysregulation; online; skills group; teletherapy; video","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31413,""

"Pain burden in children with cerebral palsy (CPPain) survey: Study protocol","Pain is a significant health concern for children living with cerebral palsy (CP). There are no population-level or large-scale multi-national datasets using common measures characterizing pain experience and interference (ie, pain burden) and management practices for children with CP. The aim of the CPPain survey is to generate a comprehensive understanding of pain burden and current management of pain to change clinical practice in CP. The CPPain survey is a comprehensive cross-sectional study. Researchers plan to recruit approximately 1400 children with CP (primary participants) across several countries over 6-12Ã‚Â months using multimodal recruitment strategies. Data will be collected from parents or guardians of children with CP (0-17Ã‚Â years) and from children with CP (8-17Ã‚Â years) who are able to self-report. Siblings (12-17Ã‚Â years) will be invited to participate as controls. The CPPain survey consists of previously validated and study-specific questionnaires addressing demographic and diagnostic information, pain experience, pain management, pain interference, pain coping, activity and participation in everyday life, nutritional status, mental health, health-related quality of life, and the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on pain and access to pain care. The survey will be distributed primarily online. Data will be analyzed using appropriate statistical methods for comparing groups. Stratification will be used to investigate subgroups, and analyses will be adjusted for appropriate sociodemographic variables. The Norwegian Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics and the Research Ethics Board at the University of Minnesota in USA have approved the study. Ethics approval in Canada, Sweden, and Finland is pending.

Presented are first known data of three newly detected synthetic cannabinoids (SCs) in Toronto, Ontario. The present data are from samples analyzed between April and November 2020. Samples were collected at partnering harm reduction agencies in Toronto and analyzed using gas or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. An intake survey queried about the sample characteristics on submission, including expected drug(s). Samples were analyzed between 1 April and 20 November 2020 (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°19), which marks the period immediately following imposed COVID-19 border and movement restrictions in Canada. The newly detected, unexpected SCs were ACHMINACA (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°15), AB-FUBINACA (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3), and 4-fluoro-MDMB-BUTINACA (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1). Fentanyl was expected in 74% (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°14). Most SCs were detected in samples containing fentanyl or related analogues (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°18; 95%), or benzodiazepine-related drugs (i.e., etizolam and flualprazolam) (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°15; 79%). This information can inform overdose prevention efforts and drug market monitoring of SCs in Toronto and regions served by the same drug trafficking routes. The detection of SCs during a period marked by COVID-19-related restrictions can contribute to efforts to identify global drug market trends during this time.","Scarfone, Maghsoudi, McDonald, Thompson, Stefan, Beriault, Werb, Bowles","https://doi.org/10.1080/15563650.2022.2069575","20220513","CNS/psychological; analgesics; complications of poisoning; opioids; pharmaceuticals","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31416,""
"Autonomy, liberty, and risk: The ethical and legal challenges of suspending leave of absence for patients detained under the Mental Health Act 1983 during the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic","During the COVID-19 pandemic, many governments around the world have imposed significant restrictions on freedom of movement to tackle the virus. Mental health units have mirrored this approach, implementing restrictive measures to safeguard the health of patients, staff, and the wider community. This paper explores the relevant legal provisions and ethical principles that guide medical decisions regarding restriction of liberty, before considering the suspension of leave from hospital that occurred in several mental health services in response to the pandemic. It reviews how existing ethical principles within the field of public health may support a better-informed decision-making process, should similar widespread restrictions be imposed again.","Loughran, Latham","https://doi.org/10.1177/00258024221099691","20220513","COVID-19; coronavirus; mental health law","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31417,""
"US soldiers and the role of leadership: COVID-19, mental health, and adherence to public health guidelines","Previous studies have documented the impact of domain-specific leadership behaviors on targeted health outcomes in employees. The goal of the present study was to determine the association between specific leadership behaviors addressing COVID-19 and US soldiers' mental health and adherence to COVID-19 public health guidelines. An electronic, anonymous survey was administered to US Army soldiers across three major commands (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°7,829) from December 2020 to January 2021. The primary predictor of interest was soldiers' ratings of their immediate supervisors' behaviors related to COVID-19. The outcomes were soldiers' mental health (i.e., depression and generalized anxiety) and adherence to COVID-19 public health guidelines. Covariates were rank, gender, ratings of immediate supervisors' general leadership, level of COVID-19 concerns, and COVID-19 status (e.g., tested positive, became seriously ill). Logistic regressions were used to model the unique association of COVID-19 leadership behaviors with outcomes after adjusting for covariates. High levels of COVID-19 leadership behaviors were associated with lesser likelihood of soldiers' screening positive for depression (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.46; 95% CI [0.39, 0.54]) and anxiety (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.54; 95% CI [0.45, 0.64]), and greater likelihood of frequent adherence to preventive health guidelines (AORsÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.58; 95% CI [1.39, 1.80] to 2.50; 95% CI [2.01, 3.11]). Higher levels of COVID-19 leadership behaviors may support soldiers' mental health and encourage their adherence to COVID-19 public health guidelines. Given the link between these leader behaviors and soldier adaptation to the pandemic over and above general leadership, training for supervisors should focus on targeting specific health-promoting behaviors. Results can inform leader training for the military and other high-risk occupations.","Adler, Gutierrez, Gomez, Beymer, Santo, Thomas, Cates, Bell, Quartana","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-13345-z","20220513","Health promotion; Military; Occupational health; Pandemic; Supervisor","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31418,""

"Curiosity for information predicts wellbeing mediated by loneliness during COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic confronted humans with high uncertainty and lockdowns, which severely disrupted people's daily social and health lifestyles, enhanced loneliness, and reduced well-being. Curiosity and information-seeking are central to behavior, fostering well-being and adaptation in changing environments. They may be particularly important to maintain well-being during the pandemic. Here, we investigated which motives drive information-seeking, and whether and how curiosity and information-seeking related to well-being and mood (excitement, anxiety). Additionally, we tested whether daily diet contributed to this relationship during lockdown. Participants (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°183) completed questionnaires measuring curiosity, information-seeking, social and mental health. Using a smartphone app, participants submitted their daily food intake and lifestyle ratings for a week. We found participants had highest motivation to seek positive (vs. negative) information, concerning themselves more than others. Both trait curiosity and information-seeking predicted higher well-being, mediated by loneliness. Trait curiosity also predicted well-being and excitement days later. Considering diet, participants with lower trait curiosity ate food containing more tyrosine (i.e., dopamine precursor). Furthermore, participants consuming food high in sugar reported higher anxiety, which was specifically found in participants with relatively low, but not high, trait curiosity. Taken together, curiosity and information-seeking may benefit well-being and mood in high uncertain and challenging times, by interacting with lifestyle measures (loneliness and nutrition).","Losecaat Vermeer, Muth, Terenzi, Park","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-11924-z","20220511","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31420,""
"New Psychoactive Substances and receding COVID-19 pandemic: really going back to ""normal""?","To the Editor, The ongoing rise of New Psychoactive Substances (NPS), i.e. psychotropic molecules devised and synthesized to replicate the effects of traditional drugs of abuse in order to circumvent banned substances schedules, has been posing a challenge of enormous magnitude to substance detection systems and law enforcement worldwide. Still, it would be remiss to ignore the role played by the unprecedented public health emergency relating to the COVID-19 pandemic in the exacerbation of the NPS crisis. The diversion of resources has in fact hindered conventional approaches to drug monitoring, surveillance, control, and public health responses. The dangerous path ahead in our struggle against NPS abuse is best exemplified by the rather recent emergence of isotonitazene, an analogue of a benzimidazole class of analgesic compounds, powerful synthetic opioid and full mu-opioid receptor agonist belonging to the 2-benzylbenzimidazole group of compounds, which comprises the structurally different clonitazene, metonitazene and etonitazene (1). Isonitazene has reportedly been detected on European markets in at least five different forms and could even supplant fentanyl derivatives (2). Currently available data on isonitazene-related abuse and fatalities seem to be emblematic of the volatile, elusive nature of NPS: deaths in which isotonitazene was involved in fact presented substantial differences from casualties arising from synthetic opioids abuse. Case reports have highlighted how flualprazolam was detected in most fatalities associated with isotonitazene whereas flualprazolam was involved in only 8% of other synthetic opioid overdose deaths (3). Rather than rising background use, such a finding seems to suggest likely co-use or co-distribution of flualprazolam and isotonitazene. The key element of polysubstance involvement is rife in synthetic opioid overdose deaths. That being said, significantly more substances were implicated in isotonitazene-related deaths than fatalities linked to other synthetic opioid overdose (4, 5). Such dynamics and mortality patterns further stress the urgency of expanding health services for those suffering from opioid addiction disorders. Fine-tuned and standardized detection mechanisms relying on specialized assays based on sensitive instrumentation are essential for the timely and accurate characterization of such novel synthetic opioids (6-8). Isotonitazene in fact cannot be detected by common fentanyl testing strips (9). Hence, the essential nature of clinical and toxicological cannot be overstated, if we are to effectively deal with the public health risks arising from new substances or classes, along with the healthcare and social costs thereof (10). As new substances appear on illicit markets and are detected, their distinctive traits can only be identified by user experience, in the early stages (11-13). Nonetheless, the pandemic scenario has brought about a profound alteration of substance abuse patterns, and opened up new avenues of supply and demand for which our surveillance/detection systems may not be fully prepared or well-suited. As the pandemic appears to recede and hopefully turn into an endemic context based on coexistence with the SARS-CoV-2 and its less harmful variants, it would be a mistake to take for granted that drug abuse/trafficking dynamics will also get back to where they were before the pandemic. Putting in place policies aimed at monitoring web-based platforms and social media can potentially constitute a valuable tool in terms of keeping in check emerging substances, given how during the COVID-19 pandemic many interactions between traffickers and buyers have moved online (14). After all, social media have been playing an increasingly relevant role as interacting platforms, which users and drug dealers can take advantage of in order to discuss drug prices, substance purity, distinctive traits of the ""high"" (i.e. desired drug effects) they are seeking, ways of taking the substances, dosages, and characteristics of any new NPS becoming available on such back-alley marketing channels (15). Softwares designed and specifically programmed to sift through and analyze all detectable online information in that regard may prove valuable to figure out evolving dynamics of trafficking, purchases and use. Probing social media users has proven effective tool for public health concerns, e.g. drug checking services which have been harnessed due to their harm reduction potential in places estimated to be at risk, with large crowds gathering (concerts, clubs and the like). Nonetheless, research efforts need to be directed towards the new realm of criminality, the ""Dark Web"", in which all sorts of illegal exchanges and interactions are known to take place. A 2020 study has highlighted the appalling risks for drug users who choose to pursue that option in order to buy drugs (16). Three dealers were selected on a specific ""Dark Web"" marketplace, and NPS were ordered through such a channel. All these exchanges were thoroughly documented, and an analysis was undertaken of all the substances thus bought, totaling nine samples, by NMR, HRMS, LC-UV, and two also by x-ray diffraction. It was ultimately concluded that four out of five substances bought had been labeled with NPS names that did not match the actual substance, and two out of three samples of substances sold as new (i.e. unscheduled) NPS were instead found to be already documented substances, mislabeled and peddled under false pretenses. Drug dealers were therefore either deceiving their clients or were unaware as to the actual substances which they were selling. In light of such extremely worrisome findings, it is not hard to understand the implications and the major public health risks that such new trends of trafficking and abuse may entail. It is therefore incumbent upon the scientific community and law enforcement agencies to adapt and strive to meet the new challenges brought by the new criminal ecosystems in terms of drug enforcement, first and foremost the impervious environment known as ""Dark Web"" relying on untraceable cryptocurrencies for illegal transactions.","Napoletano, Basile, Lo Faro, Negro","https://doi.org/10.23750/abm.v93i2.13008","20220512","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31421,""
"The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on family caregivers' mental health: a rapid systematic review of the current evidence","Older adults, especially in isolation and with cognitive decline/dementia, can become more anxious and stressed during the quarantine. All these symptoms negatively affect the psycho-physical health of their caregivers. This study aimed to synthesize the current evidence on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on caregivers' mental health. A rapid systematic review was conducted using the following databases: Pubmed/Medline, CINAHL, Scopus, and PsycInfo (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020215485). The 'PRISMA' flow chart guided the selection of articles. The search was entirely performed up to September 15th, 2021.

"Enhancing GP care of mental health disorders post-COVID-19: a scoping review of interventions and outcomes","Considerable literature has examined the COVID-19 pandemic's negative mental health sequelae. It is recognised that most people experiencing mental health problems present to primary care and the development of interventions to support GPs in the care of patients with mental health problems is a priority. This review examines interventions to enhance GP care of mental health disorders, with a view to reviewing how mental health needs might be addressed in the post-COVID-19 era. Five electronic databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar and WHO 'Global Research on COVID-19') were searched from May - July 2021 for papers published in English following Arksey and O'Malley's six-stage scoping review process. The initial search identified 148 articles and a total of 29 were included in the review. These studies adopted a range of methodologies, most commonly randomised control trials, qualitative interviews and surveys. Results from included studies were divided into themes: Interventions to improve identification of mental health disorders, Interventions to support GPs, Therapeutic interventions, Telemedicine Interventions and Barriers and Facilitators to Intervention Implementation. Outcome measures reported included the Seven-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), the Nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the 'The Patient Global Impression of Change Scale'. With increasing recognition of the mental health sequelae of COVID-19, there is a lack of large scale trials researching the acceptability or effectiveness of general practice interventions. Furthermore there is a lack of research regarding possible biological interventions (psychiatric medications) for mental health problems arising from the pandemic.","Keyes, McCombe, Broughan, Frawley, Guerandel, Gulati, Kelly, Osborne, O'Connor, Cullen","https://doi.org/10.1017/ipm.2022.17","20220512","COVID-19; General practice; Interventions; Mental health; Pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-14","",31423,""
"Financial Stress Among Latino Adults in California During COVID-19","We study the impact of COVID-19 on stress, and especially on financial stress, among Latino adults in California. We take a mixed methods approach and rely on quantitative and qualitative data for our analysis. We recruited 84 low- and moderate-income (LMI) Latino adults in California through the Understanding America Study (UAS) Internet Panel who also participated in the Mobile Financial Diary (MFD) project, which took place during 2018Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°2019. We analyze data about personal experiences during COVID-19 in October 2020 and compare this to data collected during the period from August to October 2018. Our study portrays the experiences of California Latino adults who were predominantly born in the USA and are likely to be working and speak English. We also observe that a large percentage of our participants had health insurance and relatively high levels of educational attainment. We find contradictory results from our quantitative measures, where one of our indicators of financial behavior and well-being showed a significant increase (Financial Health Score), and the other (Financial Well-Being Scale) showed a significant decrease during COVID-19. Anxiety (GAD-7) and depression (PHQ) measures show no significant changes during COVID-19 in comparison to 2018. Nonetheless, our qualitative data analysis shows that many of our participants were experiencing major stressors during the pandemic associated with labor market experiences and family circumstances. In our qualitative data analysis, we also observe that women seemed to have been affected the most by the pandemic.
