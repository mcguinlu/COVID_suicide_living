"Have deaths of despair risen during the COVID-19 pandemic? A rapid systematic review","Objective: To systematically review the literature on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on deaths of despair (suicide, overdoses and drug-related liver diseases). Methods: Five electronic databases were searched using search terms on deaths of despair and COVID-19. Results: The review of 70 publications included indicates that there is no change or a decline in the suicide rate during the pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic period. Drug-related deaths such as overdose deaths and liver diseases, however, have been increased compared to the pre-pandemic rate. Findings are mainly from middle-high- and high-income countries and data from low-income countries are lacking. Synthesis of data from subgroup analysis indicates that some groups such as Black people, women and younger age groups would be more vulnerable to socioeconomic disruption during the pandemic. Conclusion: Studies included in this review were preliminary and suffered from methodological limitations such as lack of inferential analysis or using provisional data. Further high-quality studies are needed considering the contribution of factors such as disease prevalence, government intervention and environmental characteristics.","Hania Rahimi-Ardabili; Xiaoqi Feng; Phi Yen Nguyen; Thomas Astell-Burt","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.04.05.22272397","20220407","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-08","",29782,""
"Built environment's impact on COVID-19 transmission and mental health revealed by COVID-19 Participant Experience data from the All of Us Research Program","Objectives: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to millions of deaths. Effectively cutting the transmission of COVID-19 is essential to reduce the impact. Previous studies have observed the potential relationship between the built environment and COVID-19 transmission, however, to date, stringent studies investigating these relationships at the individual level are still insufficient. Here, we aim to examine the relationship between household types and COVID-19 infection (or mental health) during the early stages of the pandemic by using the All of Us Research Program COVID-19 Participant Experience (COPE) Survey data. Design: Based on 62,664 participants' responses to COPE from May to July 2020, we matched the cases of self-reported COVID-19 status, anxiety, or stress, with controls of the same race, sex, age group, and survey version. We conducted multiple logistic regressions between one of the outcomes and household type under the adjustment of other related covariates, such as ethnicity, age, social distancing behavior, and house occupancy. Results: Household type with a shared component was significantly associated with COVID-19 infection (OR=1.19, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.3; p=2x10-4), anxiety (OR=1.26, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.4; p=1.1x10-6), and stress (OR=1.29, 95% CI 1.2 to 1.4, p=4.3x10-10) as compared to free-standing houses after adjusted for the abovementioned confounding factors. Further, frequent nonessential shopping or outings, another indicator of built environment, was also associated with COVID-19 infection (OR=1.36, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.8; p=0.02), but not associated with elevated mental health conditions. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that the built environment of houses with a shared component tends to increase the risk of COVID-19 transmission, which consequently led to more anxiety and stress for their dwellers. It also suggested the necessity to improve the quality of the built environment through planning, design, and management toward a more resilient society in coping with future pandemics.","Wenting Luo; Edwin Baldwin; Anna Yi Jiang; Shujuan Li; Bo Yang; Haiquan Li","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.04.05.22273358","20220407","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-08","",29783,""
"IDENTITY CHANGES IN CRISIS SITUATIONS ANXIETY, FRUSTRATION AND ANGUISH DUE TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC","In this article, a review of the socio-anthropological literature on the impact of pandemics on the mental health of the population is made. Also, the way this pandemic affects the construction of identity of the population affected by pandemic is taken into discussion.

"Secondary Schooling and Digital Technologies in Times of Pandemic","This article explores a series of socio-educational practices and dynamics in secondary schools during the COVID-19 pandemic from its inception in early 2020 to its current drifts (mid-2021). For this, a survey (n: 623) and interviews with 40 students and teachers from the City of Buenos Aires were carried out. Fieldwork and the state of the art agree that, with the pandemic, the digital-educational gap has widened, in particular, due to the greater difficulties of connectivity and monitoring of distance classes among those who belong to popular sectors. Among the most relevant data, effects on the psychophysical health of a significant part of the educational community are observed: insomnia, malaise, anxiety, burn out and depression among students, teachers, parents and mothers. Beyond difficulties and uncertainty, students miss attending school as a space for meeting and sociability. They also demand an update of content and a greater inclusion of computer knowledge that is useful to them. Among the conclusions, in addition to the criticism of the school institution due to the scarcity or overload of tasks and classes by video call, the student population vindicates the teaching work and wishes to return to school presence as a place of socialization and learning.","Linne, J.","https://doi.org/10.37177/unicen/eb32-319","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Espacios En Blanco-Serie Indagaciones; 32(1):128-141, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-08","",29785,""
"Fear of coronavirus and forbid/allow asymmetry as determinants of acceptance of COVID-19 pandemic related restrictions and persistence of attitudes towards these regulations","In this study (N = 110) factors influencing formation of attitudes toward COVID-19 related restrictions as well as factors influencing stability or change of these attitudes were tested. Specifically, the study concentrated on two possible determinants of formation and changing attitudes toward COVID-19 related restrictions - fear of coronavirus and presenting restriction in forbid vs. allow frames. A restriction presented in the forbid frame was rejected more strongly than a restriction presented in the allow frame. For changing attitudes, a mere thought paradigm was used. This activity was not able to change these negative attitudes toward a forbid framed restriction. A higher level of fear of coronavirus was related to a more positive (or rather - less negative) attitude toward an allow framed restriction and allows this attitude to be changed to be more supportive of restrictions than initially. Moreover, the effect of fear was partially mediated by the changes in the confidence of initial attitude inconsistent thoughts.

"Emotion Based Signal Enhancement Through Multisensory Integration Using Machine Learning","Progress in understanding multisensory integration in human have suggested researchers that the integration may result into the enhancement or depression of incoming signals. It is evident based on different psychological and behavioral experiments that stimuli coming from different perceptual modalities at the same time or from the same place, the signal having more strength under the influence of emotions effects the response accordingly. Current research inmultisensory integration has not studied the effect of emotions despite its significance and natural influence in multisensory enhancement or depression. Therefore, there is a need to integrate the emotional state of the agent with incoming stimuli for signal enhancement or depression. In this study, two different neural network-based learning algorithms have been employed to learn the impact of emotions on signal enhancement or depression. It was observed that the performance of a proposed system for multisensory integration increases when emotion features were present during enhancement or depression of multisensory signals.","Khan, M.

"Quality mobile applications aimed at fostering healthy habits in children and young people Current outlook in Spain","Mobile applications which incorporate health-related contents are technological tools that have become more widely spread in recent years, especially due to the global coronavirus pandemic. In Spain, many apps have already been subjected to quality and reliability regulation through accreditation initiatives. In addition, it has been proven that gamification in this sort of technology is effective in generating healthy behaviors in the young population. This research focuses on knowing how many of these apps have a quality certification in our country and promote healthy habits in children and young people. An exhaustive review has been carried out of governmental and non-governmental health websites, specifically those which recognize different quality seals, badges or labels as accrediting initiatives in the field of health. As for the results, in spite of the importance for their health and well-being, there are few certified mobile applications that integrate gamified elements and are intended to educate children and adolescents about the importance of a healthy lifestyle in comparison to the number of apps available for adults.","Duarte-Hueros, A.; Delgado-Morales, C.","https://doi.org/10.21071/edmetic.v11i1.13832","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Edmetic; 11(1):15, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-08","",29788,""
"The prevalence and risk factors for anxiety in frontline nurses under COVID-19 pandemic based on a large cross-sectional study using the propensity score-matched method","Introduction: We determined the prevalence of anxiety and the associated risk factors in frontline nurses under COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted from February 20, 2020, to March 20, 2020, and involved 562 frontline nurses. The effective response rate was 87.68%. After propensity score matched, there were 532 participants left. Extensive characteristics, including demographics, dietary habits, life-related factors, work-related factors, and psychological factors were collected based on a self-reported questionnaire. Specific scales measured the levels of sleep quality, physical activity, anxiety, perceived organization support and psychological capital. Adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were determined by binary paired logistic regression. Results: Of the nurses enrolled in the study, 33.60% had anxiety. Five independent risk factors were identified for anxiety: poor sleep quality (OR=1.235), experienced major events (OR=1.653), lower resilience and optimism of psychological capital (OR=0.906, and OR=0.909) and no visiting friend constantly (OR=0.629). Conclusions: This study revealed a considerable high prevalence of anxiety in frontline nurses during the COVID-19 outbreak, and identified five risk factors, which were poor sleep quality, experienced major events, lower resilience and optimism of psychological capital, and no visiting friend constantly. Protecting mental health of nurses is important for COVID-19 pandemic control and their wellbeing. These findings enrich the existing theoretical model of anxiety and demonstrated a critical need for additional strategies that could address the mental health in frontline nurses for policymakers.","Dai, X.

"Evaluation of Anxiety, Depression, and Insomnia Levels of Healthcare Professionals after Inactive COVID-19 Vaccination (CoronaVac)","Objective: The aim of this study was to examine changes in the levels of depression, anxiety, and insomnia after inactive COVID-19 vaccination among healthcare professionals working actively during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted from January 1, 2021, to June 30, 2021, using an online survey across frontline healthcare professionals in Turkey. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale were used to evaluate the mental health of the participants, and the Insomnia Severity Index-7 (ISI-7) was used to evaluate their sleep problems. The data obtained from two different periods, pre-vaccination and post-vaccination, were examined. Results: The study included 416 healthcare professionals. The frequency of depression, anxiety, and insomnia was 27.9%, 31.5%, and 41.1%, respectively, in the pre-vaccination period, and there was a decrease in these rates (22.8%, 21.9%, and 34.1%, respectively) in the post-vaccination period. The differences between the two periods were also statistically significant for the PHQ-9 (p=0.000), GAD-7 (p=0.002), and ISI-7 (p=0.038) scores. We determined that the presence of long weekly working hours, being female, living alone, and presence of psychiatric disease were effective in the development of depression and anxiety. Conclusion: Among frontline healthcare professionals, depression, anxiety, and insomnia symptoms and the frequency of the diagnosis of these clinical conditions increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, after the start of the immunization process, the frequency of these mental disorders and the anxiety levels of the healthcare professionals significantly decreased.

"Rehabilitation of post-COVID patients with chronic fatigue and cognitive disorders syndromes","Introduction. Almost all patients, who have experienced acute manifestations of COVID-19, regardless of the severity of the acute phase of the disease, are only at the beginning of a long way to recovery. According to experts, SARS-CoV-2 infection should affect almost 80% of the world's population, so all these patients to a greater or lesser extent will need a rehabilitation of certain manifestations of postcovid syndrome. Purpose: to study the effectiveness of rehabilitation program and the dynamics of cognitive impairment and manifestations of chronic fatigue syndrome in patients after coronavirus disease. Methods: The study design included 60 patients after SARS-Cov-2 infection. Among the examined patients there were 26 (43,3%) women and 34 (56,7%) men. An average age of the patients was 43,9 +/- 1,08 years. Patients were referred to the Department of Physical Rehabilitation after coronavirus disease with chronic fatigue and cognitive disorders syndromes. Accordingly, all patients, who participated in the study, were divided into two groups: group I - 28 patients with a general condition of moderate severity at the hospital stage and 32 patients - group II, with severe course of the disease and oxygen demand at the hospital stage. Depending on the duration of rehabilitation, two observation periods were used - on the 7th and 14th day of rehabilitation program. Results: It has been proven, that patients, who didn't need oxygen, were complaining about anosmia, cephalgia, cognitive impairment, increased anxiety and fatigue. Dysgeusia, dyssomnia, and depression were more common in patients, requiring oxygen therapy at the hospital stage. Rehabilitation program eliminated cognitive dysfunction, depression, cephalgia, drowsiness and dyssomnia on the 7th day in patients, who did not require oxygen therapy (p&gt;0,05), and in patients, who needed oxygen therapy - on the 14th day of the rehabilitation program (p&gt;0,05). However, 2 (6,3%) and 3 (9,4%) patients, who needed oxygen therapy, even after 14 days of rehabilitation had manifestations of minor recurrent headache and drowsiness. Conclusion: Thus, patients after coronavirus disease, who needed oxygen therapy at the hospital stage, need long-term rehabilitation program.","Babliuk, L.; Fediaeva, S.; Babova, I.; Mesoedova, V.; Tamazlykar, S.","https://doi.org/10.12680/balneo.2022.497","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Balneo and Prm Research Journal; 13(1):9, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-08","",29791,""
"Depression, anxiety and stress among nursing officers in a dedicated hospital for COVID patients in Sri Lanka: a single institute experience","The main objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression, among nurses working in a tertiary hospital dedicated to the COVID-19 patients in Sri Lanka. A cross-sectional study was carried out among nurses working at Colombo East Base Hospital. The data was collected using a self-administered questionnaire and DASS-21, a set of three self-report scales designed to measure the negative emotional states of depression, anxiety, and stress over three months from October 2020. Data were analysed applying descriptive statistics and inferential statistical methods. There was a total of 131 study participants (response rate 83%), and most of them were working in general wards (56%), while 42% were in critical care units. The proportion of anxiety and stress is associated with nurses working in critical care units were significantly higher than those in general wards (p &lt; 0.001). There were no associations between sex, marital status, having children, experience, qualifications, and medical or psychiatric conditions (p &gt; 0.05). The system of reporting mental health issues was unfortunately not in place. Staff felt that reporting stress/burnout or anxiety might seem like a negative attribute. Considering the above factors, one would expect more prevalence than we have seen in this study;therefore, we can infer that if mental health is not prioritised in healthcare institutions, then definitely lack of awareness/openness and under-reporting by staff will result in a long-term systemic problem (Suffering in the name of Resilience).","Pathiraja, PathirajageDeepthiMadushan, Srikanthi, W.

"An Interesting Case of Fatal Myasthenic Crisis Probably Induced by the COVID-19 Vaccine","A myasthenic crisis is a severe, life-threatening exacerbation of myasthenia gravis that causes a rapid onset of muscle weakness and fatigue that may result in tetraparesis, dyspnea, respiratory insufficiency, aspiration, and death. Bulbar muscle functions are markedly affected resulting in depressed cough reflex, swallowing, and speech. Thus, mechanical ventilation, supportive feeding, and critical care are essential for the survival of patients in a myasthenic crisis. Numerous precipitating factors of this condition are well known and include infections, various medications, pregnancy, and childbirth. Patients with myasthenia gravis are at a considerably higher risk of developing a debilitating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection due to the associated immunosuppression resulting from long-term corticosteroid use, which makes vaccination of such individuals necessary. However, the relationship between an exacerbation of myasthenia gravis and the COVID-19 vaccination is currently unknown. In this paper, we report the case of a 55-year-old male patient who developed a myasthenic crisis after receiving the first dose of the ChAdOx1-S (recombinant) vaccine (AstraZeneca batch number 210157;AstraZeneca plc, Cambridge, United Kingdom). Despite the administration of aggressive and intensive treatment over a period of 29-day hospitalization, the myasthenic crisis could not be reversed and the patient ultimately deteriorated and succumbed from multiple myocardial infarction events and organ failures. While it is still uncommon, evidence associating the effects of the vaccine to the development of a crisis is mounting;therefore, it is crucial for clinicians to promptly identify clinical features that suggest an exacerbation of myasthenia gravis in order to intervene at the earliest possible stage for a more favorable outcome. The myasthenia gravis patient should be informed about the possible association between COVID-19 vaccination and the development of a myasthenic crisis.","Sonigra, K. J.; Sarna, K.; Vaghela, V.

"Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) After COVID-19: A Case Report","A 48-year-old female with past medical history of anxiety and depression presented to the rheumatology clinic after being referred for further evaluation of abnormal labs, Raynaud's phenomenon, and other concerning symptoms. Shortly after hospitalization for COVID-19 pneumonia, she began experiencing symptoms that included fatigue, xerostomia, dysphagia, bilateral lower extremity weakness, dyspnea with exertion, unintentional weight loss, and diffuse skin hyperpigmentation. Labs ordered shortly before presentation were significant for antinuclear antibody (ANA) titer &gt; 1:1280. Physical exam was remarkable for puffy fingers, sclerodactyly of the fingers, diffuse skin hyperpigmentation, and abnormal nailfold capillaries. Anti-RNA polymerase III, anti-Scl-70, anti-centromere, anti-SSA, anti-SSB, anti-Smith, and anti-Smith/RNP antibodies were all negative. BNP, aldolase, and serum myoglobin levels were within normal limits while creatine phosphokinase level was slightly decreased. Pulmonary function testing showed reduced diffusion capacity with normal lung mechanics and volumes. High-resolution CT scan of the chest showed interstitial lung disease, with findings suggestive of nonspecific interstitial pneumonia. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed mild elevation of right ventricular systolic pressure, but pulmonary hypertension was not found on right heart catheterization. Esophagugastroduodenoscopy (EGO) with biopsy performed for evaluation of esophageal dysphagia showed sliding hiatal hernia, irregular Z-line, and gastric hyperemia. Biopsy of the distal esophagus was consistent with Barrett's esophagus. The patient was diagnosed with SSc according to the 2013 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR-EULAR) classification criteria for SSc. She is currently being treated with mycophenolate mofetil, amlodipine, methotrexate, and prednisone.","Chandra, A.; Kahaleh, B.","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.23179","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Cureus Journal of Medical Science; 14(3):5, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-08","",29794,""
"Pain Management and COVID-19: A Latin American Perspective","Vaccinations and therapeutics have been developed for COVID-19, but vaccine uptake varies markedly among countries. Public health responses have also varied, in particular, with lockdown efforts and school closing. All over the world, the pandemic exposed healthcare and economic weaknesses. COVID-19 exacerbated mental health issues by exposing the population to prolonged periods of fear, anxiety, financial stress, psychological uncertainties, and sometimes isolation from even family and friends. Chronic pain patients have been disproportionately affected. The pandemic-associated stresses may have exacerbated their already painful symptoms while at the same time interrupting their access to care. The ramifications of the COVID-19 post-viral syndrome (""long COVID-19"") are not yet known. COVID-19 viral infection has been associated with neuropathic pain symptoms. Tele-triage and telehealth applications can help manage chronic pain patients in the COVID-19 era, but many interventional procedures, injections, or other treatments have been delayed. The role of palliative care for patients with terminal cases of infection must be re-examined. Palliative care is a relatively new medical specialty and allows terminally ill patients to die in as much comfort and peace as can be afforded to them. More training in palliative care for all clinicians is urgently needed. COVID-19 exposed much that is wrong or weak or inadequate in our healthcare systems, but it also allowed us to embrace new technologies and develop better systems to manage the challenge of a pandemic.","Guerrero, M.; Castroman, P.; Quiroga, O.; Cook, M.

"Effectiveness of digital mental health interventions for university students: an umbrella review","Background Poor mental health among university students remains a pressing public health issue. Over the past few years, digital health interventions have been developed and considered promising in increasing psychological wellbeing among university students. Therefore, this umbrella review aims to synthesize evidence on digital health interventions targeting university students and to evaluate their effectiveness. Methods A systematic literature search was performed in April 2021 searching PubMed, Psychology and Behavioural Science Collection, Web of Science, ERIC, and Scopus for systematic reviews and meta-analyses on digital mental health interventions targeting university students. The review protocol was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews PROSPERO [CRD42021234773]. Results The initital literature search resulted in 806 records of which seven remained after duplicates were removed and evaluated against the inclusion criteria. Effectiveness was reported and categorized into the following six delivery types: (a) web-based, online/computer-delivered interventions (b) computer-based Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT), (c) mobile applications and short message service (d) virtual reality interventions (e) skills training (f) relaxation and exposure-based therapy. Results indicated web-based online/computer delivered-interventions were effective or at least partially effective at decressing depression, anxiety, stress and eating disorder symptoms. This was similar for skills-training interventions, CBT-based intervention and mobile applications. However, digital mental health interventions using virtual reality and relaxation, exposure-based therapy was inconclusive. Due to the variation in study settings and inconsistencies in reporting, effectiveness was greatly dependent on the delivery format, targeted mental health problem and targeted purpose group. Conclusion The findings provide evidence for the beneficial effect of digital mental health interventions for university students. However, this review calls for a more systematic approach in testing and reporting the effectiveness of digital mental health interventions.","Harith, Sophia, Backhaus, Insa, Mohbin, Najihah, Huyen Thi, Ngo, Khoo, Selina","https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.13111","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: PeerJ;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-08","",29796,""
"Challenges, burden and emotional impact on Portuguese athletes during COVID-19 pandemic","This study aimed to explore how contextual variables associated with the period of confinement during pandemic can differentiate symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress. It also intended to understand the concerns that were experienced by athletes when resuming their sport practice and how these could be associated with psychopathological indicators. The sample comprised 265 athletes who completed self-reported questionnaires. Results demonstrated that there were differences in psychopathological indicators in terms of hours of training per week, and the type of contact that athletes have with their coach. Athletes reported concerns regarding the resumption of sport practice, and that were associated with anxiety, depression, and stress symptoms. This study may contribute in warning the sports community about the impact of contextual variables-related to critical moments of this pandemic. Sports communities should encourage the preservation of the athlete's physical activities, as well as supporting coaches in continuing to guide athlete's training.","Oliveira, S.; Cunha, M.; Rosado, A.; Ferreira, C.","https://doi.org/10.6018/cpd.462181","","Database: CAB Abstracts; Publication type: article; Publication details: Cuadernos de Psicolog..a del Deporte; 22(1):44-60, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-08","",29797,""
"Effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on the livelihood and food security of street food vendors and consumers in Nigeria","Nigeria's local food economy was affected by state-imposed restrictions to curb the spread of COVID-19 in communities. Street food vendors and consumers are among local food system actors impacted by such restrictions because their livelihood and food security are contingent on daily operations on the street. Informed by a descriptive qualitative approach, we interviewed 31 street food vendors and consumers who shared their experiences on how the lockdown impacted them. Vendors reported various impacts, including losing income, customers, customer trust, and social connection. Street food consumers reported difficulties meeting their food needs and developing multiple coping strategies, including cutting back on fruit and vegetable consumption and food sharing. Both vendors and consumers would like to see measures put in place to allow them to operate safely in a future lockdown event.

"COVID-19 pandemic and individuals with severe mental illness: A comparative study of Community Mental Health Centers early experiences in COVID-19 pandemic","Objective: In this study, we aimed to determine the effects of the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic on the services in Community Mental Health Centers (CMHCs) and on the patients followed up by the CMHC. In this direction, the clinical data of the patients and CMHC services were compared with the same period of the previous year. Method: Three CMHCs' data within the first three months following the first COVID-19 case report in Turkey (11.03.202011.06.2020) were compared with the same period of the previous year retrospectively. Sociodemographic data, the number of admissions to the emergency psychiatry outpatient clinic, and the number of admissions to the psychiatry service of 2008 patients followed-up by CMHC were recorded as well as clinical parameters of inpatients and the quantitative values of the services provided by CMHCs. Results: The number of patients presenting to the emergency psychiatry outpatient clinic and admission to the inpatient psychiatry unit significantly decreased in the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic (p &lt;0.001). While a narrowing was observed in psychiatric hospitalization indications, face-to-face CMHC services decreased. Conclusion: The COVID-19 outbreak has created difficulties in preventing and treating COVID19 infection in individuals with severe mental illness, as well as difficulties in safely handling patients' existing mental illnesses. Considering the experiences from the early period of the pandemic, for current and future needs, the continuity of CMHCs should be supported and efforts should be made to provide digital services such as telepsychiatry applications when necessary.","Saglam, N.

"Six-Week Hospital-Based Pulmonary Rehabilitation in Covid Pneumonia ICU Survivors: Experience from a Tertiary Care Center in Central India","OBJECTIVE: There is very limited data on the usefulness of pulmonary rehabilitation in patients with coronavirus pneumonia who have survived intensive care unit care. The primary aim was to explore the feasibility of conducting a pulmonary rehabilitation program in patients with coronavirus disease-19 pneumonia surviving intensive care. The secondary aim was to study the impact of a hospital-based 6-week pulmonary rehabilitation program on exercise capacity, quality of life, and psychological parameters in these patients. This study was conducted at the Center for Pulmonary Rehabilitation, Department of Pulmonary Medicine of the institute. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 27 patients were enrolled. Among them, 14 patients who completed the desired 12 sessions over 6 weeks constituted the pulmonary rehabilitation group and 13 patients who either did not consent or defaulted within the first 2 weeks were considered as controls. Both groups had assessments at 0 and 6 weeks that included a 6-Minute Walk Test, Incremental Shuttle Walk Test, mMRC Dyspnea Scale, Baseline Dyspnea Index, and Transitional Dyspnea Index, Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire score, and Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale-21 score. RESULTS: Significant improvement in dyspnea by mMRC (P = .01) and exercise capacity as measured by 6-Minute Walk Test (P &lt;.001) and Incremental Shuttle Walk Test (P = .025) was seen in the pulmonary rehabilitation group as compared to the control group. There was no significant improvement in quality of life and psychological parameters (Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale 21 score) after 6 weeks of pulmonary rehabilitation program as measured in our study. CONCLUSION: Pulmonary rehabilitation is feasible and appears promising in coronavirus disease acute respiratory distress syndrome survivors. However, data from other centers and a larger number of patients are required to imbibe conclusive results.","Khurana, A. K.; Hussain, A.; Goyal, A.; Karna, S. T.; Saigal, S.; Soman, R.

"Experiences and Psychosocial Difficulties of Frontline Health Care Workers Struggling With COVID-19 in Turkey: A Qualitative Study","AIM: This study was performed to explore the experiences and the psychosocial difficulties faced by nurses and physicians involved in the treatment and care for COVID-19 adult patients in the intensive care unit. METHOD: The interpretative phenomenological approach was used, and the data were gathered between June and July, 2020 in Rize using face-to-face interviews. The sample consisted of 10 nurses and 5 physicians. The thematic analysis was utilized to analyze the data. The Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) were followed in the study. RESULTS: The experiences of nurses and physicians were categorized under three themes and subcategories. The theme of ""Going Through Psychosocial Changes"" was divided into decreased emotional well-being and experiencing social changes, the theme of ""Work-Related Challenges"" was divided into losing the routines and economic concerns, and the theme of ""Felt Gains"" was divided into realizing one's worth and increased motivation. CONCLUSION: The study revealed that nurses and physicians are supported, respected, and described as heroes by Turkish society. However, they are psychologically and socially adversely affected, they display negative and positive emotions, and experience psychological growth. In addition, nurses complain about insufficient and unfair payment. Despite all these challenges, nurses and physicians continue to work with increasing emotional resistance. It is recommended to be aware of the problems that they experience during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, protect their mental health, provide adequate economic support, especially for nurses, and take necessary measures by collecting data that may be a guide for subsequent outbreaks.","Sahin, C.

"Using text analysis to assess the mental health impacts of COVID-19 on rural healthcare providers (Special Issue: Rural research in the time of COVID)","The pandemic increased the stress levels of frontline healthcare providers in every country across the globe, and continues to do so. Health care providers in the rural regions of the U.S. were more vulnerable to the impact of COVID-19 due to the lack of resources and the population they serve. A qualitative study of 25 rural healthcare providers in a western U.S. state was conducted during 2020. In this report, Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) was used to compare the use of emotion and reward words in 12 providers interviewed before the onset of COVID-19 on March 11, 2020, to 13 interviews conducted after COVID-19 onset. Results indicated that providers used fewer positive emotion words after COVID-19 onset compared to before COVID. Negative emotion words also decreased. Words related to the rewarding aspects of their work increased after COVID-19, but differed among the pre- and post-COVID groups. Positive emotion words was more strongly related to rewards in the post-COVID group. Providers reported concerns about access to care for those unable to be treated for the increased depression, anxiety and suicide ideation related to the pandemic.

"The influence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the first UK lockdown on older age presentations to a regional psychiatric liaison service: A retrospective observational study","Background: Loneliness and social isolation may have increased during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, possibly increasing mental health problems. However, due to fears of contracting COVID-19, patients may not have presented to hospitals. Aims: We assessed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic measures and lockdown on elderly (=65 years) presentations to a psychiatric liasion service. Settings and Design: A UK regional liasion psychiatry service. Materials and Methods: Mixed methods methodologies were used to assess data between 01/01/20 and 31/08/20, which were compared to data from the same time period in 2019. Statistical and thematic analyses were conducted to understand drivers of presentations. Statistical Analysis: Nonparametric testing and analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: Presentations to liaison psychiatry reduced by 13% for 01-08/2020 compared to 01-08/2019, with a 42% reduction during lockdown. Average weekly presentations significantly decreased during the main lockdown months only (April 2019 vs. 2020: 213.0 [12.3] vs. 110.3 [22.9] [adjusted P = 0.006], May 2019 vs. 2020: 209.5 [14.6] vs. 148.8 [12.3] [adjusted P = 0.006]). There was only a trend toward reduced elderly presentations from January to August 2020 and during lockdown. Lockdown pressures did not drive significantly more new elderly presentations. However, we still found a highly significant difference in the distribution of causal factors for the elderly presentations affected by the pressures of lockdown compared to those who were not. Conclusions: A trend toward reduced elderly presentations during lockdown and the pandemic was found. Thematic analysis supported by further statistical analysis of the drivers of elderly presentations showed that the pressures of lockdown clearly affected older age liaison psychiatry presentations.","Shinwari, Sara, Odejimi, Opeyemi, Bagchi, Dhruba","https://doi.org/10.4103/indianjpsychiatry.indianjpsychiatry_243_21","","Database: CINAHL; Publication type: article; Publication details: Indian Journal of Psychiatry; 64(2):178-184, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-08","",29806,""
"Prevalence of psychological outcomes and its associated factors in healthcare personnel working during COVID-19 outbreak in India","Background: Care of COVID-19 patients has been shown to affect the mental health of healthcare personnel (HCP), however, there is little data reflecting psychological health of HCP in India. Aims: The present study was undertaken to assess the prevalence of psychological outcomes and its association with various sociodemographic and occupational factors among the HCP in India. Methodology: A cross-sectional, online survey, using snowball sampling method was conducted between June 1, 2020, and June 22, 2020. The HCP working in COVID-19 designated hospitals across India were invited to participate. Patient Health Questionnaire-4 and 19-item stress-related questionnaire were used to evaluate symptoms of overall anxiety, depression, COVID-19 infection specific anxiety, exhaustion, and workload. Results: In this cross-sectional study with 2334 HCP from 27 states and 7 union territories of India;17.9% of participants had depression, 18.7% had overall anxiety, 26.5% had exhaustion, 30.3% reported heavy workload, and 25.4% had COVID-19 infection-specific anxiety, respectively. The HCP working in states with higher caseload was a common risk factor for overall anxiety (odds ratio [OR], 1.7;P &lt; 0.001), depression (OR, 1.6;P &lt; 0.001), COVID-19 infection-specific anxiety (OR, 2.5;P &lt; 0.001), exhaustion (OR, 3.1;P &lt; 0.001), and heavy workload (OR, 2.6;P &lt; 0.001). Nurses were more at risk for depression (OR, 2.2;P &lt; 0.001), anxiety specific to COVID-19 infection (OR, 1.3;P = 0.034), and heavy workload (OR, 2.9;P &lt; 0.001);while doctors were more at risk for overall anxiety (OR, 2.0;P = 0.001) and exhaustion (OR, 3.1;P &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Frontline workers, specifically nurses and doctors, and those working in states with high COVID-19 caseload are more at risk for adverse psychological outcomes. The relatively less prevalence compared with other countries, is perhaps a reflection of measures undertaken, including early lockdown, ensuring better all-round preparedness and social norms.","Sharma, Gautam, Sharma, Payal, Mohan, Bishav, Agarwal, Aman, Lama, Sudha, Jat, Mansingh, Biju, K.

"COVID-19 pandemic: Changes in the emotions, body weights and nutrition habits of individuals during social intervention measures","BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the increase in the anxiety levels of individuals is associated with the increase in body weight. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of changes in individuals' experiences and mood on eating habits and body weights in during social restrictions due to COVID-19. METHODS: The study included 623 adults in Turkey. Demographic characteristics, anthropometric measurements, information about nutritional habits during the pandemic period were questioned via an online survey. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was used to evaluate individuals' negative perspectives. RESULTS: The rate of patients who experienced body weight changes during the pandemic period was 61.4% (40.2% experienced increase), the mean BDI value was found to be higher in individuals whose body weight increased/decreased compared to those who experienced no change in body weight (p = 0.008, p = 0.02, respectively). Variables that positively affected the BDI scores, which was performed in individuals with increased body weight, main meal numbers (p &lt; 0.03), and change in dried fruit consumption (p = 0.05). The variables that negatively affected the BDI scores were body weight increase (p = 0.05) and changes in cheese consumption. CONCLUSIONS: We found that the changes in the emotional state during COVID-19 had an effect on dietary habits and body weight. There is a need for more comprehensive randomized studies on the interaction between lifestyle changes during the social intervention period due to the COVID-19 epidemic, quality of life, emotional state and eating habits.","Akkus, O.

"PUBG Ban and Issues of Online Child Safety During COVID-19 Lockdown in India: A Critical Review from the Indian Information Technology Act Perspectives","In June 2020 India opted for banning 59 Chinese Apps. Contrary to the apprehension of banning gaming apps including PUBG, the government did not do so when the Chinese apps were banned. But soon PUBG also got banned in India. Several stakeholders had raised their concerns in this regard as PUBG may affect the mental health of children who are the major users of this app. But on the other hand, it had been observed that PUBG had remained the biggest respite for children who were confined to homes due to COVID-19. S.69A of the Information Technology Act 2000 (amended in 2008) had been the main tool by the government to block access to Chinese apps. PUBG developers had however tried to outsmart S.69A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 (amended in 2008), which had been used primarily to block the website and by using Artificial Intelligence for preventing children below 18 from being engaged for a continuous period, being exposed to nudity, etc. This article aims to analyse the tussle between the scope and inherent meaning of S.69A and 79 of the Indian Information technology Act, 2000 (amended in 2008) and the ever-developing due diligence of the game developers with special concern for child safety and mental health of the children, which may make the later a winner or a loser in the legal battleground.","Halder, D.","https://doi.org/10.2298/tem2103303h","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Temida; 24(3):303-327, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-08","",29810,""

Wellbeing levels fluctuated along with the virus case numbers. Free childcare temporarily alleviated the disparity between carers and non-carers, but by its cessation, carers, in particular, reported lower wellbeing and higher psychological distress. Wage subsidies and income supports had opposing effects for carers' and non-carers' mental health but decreased the loneliness of both groups.

"Virtual care facing the COVID-19 outbreak in China","New ways of care have emerged as the COVID-19 pandemic sweeps the world, including virtual care exchanged in cyberspace. As people are physically isolated by travel restrictions and guidelines to avoid gatherings and keep at distance, cyberspace has become a major place in which people care about and for each other. When government-oriented medical and civil service systems malfunctioned upon the rapid outbreak in Hubei Province, China, Chinese people used online social platforms to provide individual and organised care activities - disseminating information, petitioning for access to healthcare, offering voluntary mental health interventions and facilitating embodied and material support - to respond to the challenges of local people at the epicentre. This article intends to acknowledge and showcase the virtual care that Chinese people demonstrated transnationally upon the outbreak of COVID-19 in China, and discusses the significance and impacts of this way of care in the cyberspace era.","Zhang, J.

"Gender Differences in Mental Health, Quality of Life, and Caregiver Burden among Informal Caregivers during the Second Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Germany: A Representative, Population-Based Study","This study aimed to compare the mental health, quality of life, and caregiving burden between male and female informal caregivers of older adults (Ã¢â€°Â¥60 years) during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. The sample consisted of 301 female and 188 male informal caregivers of older adults in need of care (Ã¢â€°Â¥60 years). Data were used from a cross-sectional study in March 2021 that questioned a representative sample of adults aged 40 years and older from Germany. Information on informal care provision, mental health (depressive and anxiety symptoms), caregiving burden, and quality of life was assessed for the period between December 2020 and March 2021. Regression analyses, adjusted for (1) the sociodemographic background and health of the caregivers, (2) the caregiving time and caregiving tasks, and (3) the perception of impairment and danger posed by the pandemic, were conducted. Findings of the fully adjusted model indicated a higher level of anxiety and lower quality of life among female caregivers, compared to male caregivers. Gender differences in depression and caregiver burden were not significant in analyses that controlled for care tasks and time. Moderator analyses indicated that gender differences in caregiver's anxiety levels were influenced by the danger perceived to be posed by the pandemic: among men the danger to the care recipient, and among women the danger to themselves, increased anxiety. Female informal caregivers were more negatively affected than male informal caregivers during the pandemic, as indicated by higher levels of anxiety and lower quality of life. Gender differences in anxiety depended on the perceived danger posed by the pandemic. Thus, policy and pandemic measures should focus on gender-specific support of female caregivers who seem to be particularly vulnerable during the pandemic. More caregiver-specific support and information around protecting themselves and their care recipients are recommended. Also, further research on gender differences in care performance and their relation to psychosocial health outcomes is recommended.","Zwar, KÃƒÂ¶nig, Hajek","https://doi.org/10.1159/000523846","20220407","COVID-19; Gender; Informal caregiving; Pandemic; Psychosocial health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-08","",29813,""
"Long COVID and Long Chain Fatty Acids (LCFAs): Psychoneuroimmunity implication of omega-3 LCFAs in delayed consequences of COVID-19","The global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to the lasting pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the post-acute phase sequelae of heterogeneous negative impacts in multiple systems known as the ""long COVID."" The mechanisms of neuropsychiatric complications of long COVID are multifactorial, including long-term tissue damages from direct CNS viral involvement, unresolved systemic inflammation and oxidative stress, maladaptation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and coagulation system, dysregulated immunity, the dysfunction of neurotransmitters and hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and the psychosocial stress imposed by societal changes in response to this pandemic. The strength of safety, well-acceptance, and accumulating scientific evidence has now afforded nutritional medicine a place in the mainstream of neuropsychiatric intervention and prophylaxis. Long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 or n-3 PUFAs) might have favorable effects on immunity, inflammation, oxidative stress and psychoneuroimmunity at different stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Omega-3 PUFAs, particularly EPA, have shown effects in treating mood and neurocognitive disorders by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines, altering the HPA axis, and modulating neurotransmission via lipid rafts. In addition, omega-3 PUFAs and their metabolites, including specialized pro-resolvin mediators, accelerate the process of cleansing chronic inflammation and restoring tissue homeostasis, and therefore offer a promising strategy for Long COVID. In this article, we explore in a systematic review the putative molecular mechanisms by which omega-3 PUFAs and their metabolites counteract the negative effects of long COVID on the brain, behavior, and immunity.","Yang, Chang, Yang, Pariante, Su","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2022.04.001","20220407","cognition; depression; immunity; inflammation; long COVID; mood; omega-3 PUFAs; sickness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-08","",29814,""
"Association between chronic physical conditions and depressive symptoms among hospital workers in a national medical institution designated for COVID-19 in Japan","This study aimed to investigate the cross-sectional association between the presence of chronic physical conditions and depressive symptoms among hospital workers at a national medical institution designated for COVID-19 treatment in Tokyo, Japan. We also accounted for the combined association of chronic physical conditions and SARS-CoV-2 infection risk at work in relation to depressive symptoms, given that occupational infection risk might put additional psychological burden among those with chronic physical conditions with risk of severe COVID-19 outcome. The study sample consisted of 2,440 staff members who participated in a health survey conducted at the national medical institution during period between October 2020 and December 2020. Participants who reported at least one chronic physical condition that were deemed risk factors of severe COVID-19 outcome were regarded as having chronic physical conditions. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). We performed logistic regression analysis to assess the association between chronic physical conditions and depressive symptoms. Our results showed that the presence of chronic physical conditions was significantly associated with depressive symptoms (odds ratio (OR) = 1.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.10-2.02). In addition, the prevalence of depressive symptoms was significantly higher among healthcare workers with chronic physical conditions who were at a higher occupational infection risk (OR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.04-3.16). Our findings suggest the importance of providing more assistance to those with chronic physical conditions regarding the prevention and control of mental health issues, particularly among frontline healthcare workers engaging in COVID-19-related work.","Fukunaga, Inoue, Yamamoto, Miki, Hoang, Manandhar Shrestha, Ishiwari, Ishii, Miyo, Konishi, Ohmagari, Mizoue","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0266260","20220407","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-08","",29815,""
"Changes in alcohol use and mood during the COVID-19 pandemic among individuals with traumatic brain injury: A difference-in-difference study","To evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic exposure on changes in alcohol use and mood from years 1 to 2 after traumatic brain injury (TBI). We used a difference-in-difference (DiD) study design to analyze data from 1,059 individuals with moderate-to-severe TBI enrolled in the TBI Model Systems (TBIMS) National Database. We defined COVID-19 pandemic exposure as participants who received their year 1 post-injury interviews prior to January 1, 2020, and their year 2 interview between April 1, 2020 and January 15, 2021. Pandemic-unexposed participants had both year 1 and 2 follow-up interviews before January 1, 2020. We measured current alcohol use as any past month alcohol use, average number of drinks per drinking occasion, and past month binge drinking. We measured depression symptoms using Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and anxiety symptoms using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7. We found persons with TBI exposed to the pandemic had greater increases in the average number of drinks per occasion from year 1 to 2 post-injury compared to pandemic-unexposed individuals (ÃŽÂ² = 0.36, 95% CI: 0.16, 0.57, p = 0.001), with males, adults &lt;65 years old, and Black and Hispanic subgroups showing the greatest increases in consumption. Though average consumption was elevated, changes in rates of any alcohol use or binge drinking by pandemic exposure were not observed. Overall, there were no significant changes in depressive and anxiety symptoms over time between pandemic exposed and unexposed groups; however, pandemic-exposed Hispanics with TBI reported significant increases in anxiety symptoms from year-1 to year-2 post-injury compared to pandemic-unexposed Hispanics (ÃŽÂ² = 2.35, 95% CI: 0.25, 4.47, p = 0.028). Among persons living with TBI, those exposed to the pandemic had significant increases in average alcohol consumption. Pandemic-exposed Hispanics with TBI had large elevations in anxiety symptoms, perhaps reflecting health inequities exacerbated by the pandemic, and suggesting a need for targeted monitoring of psychosocial distress.","Kumar, Esterov, Adams, Corrigan, Juengst, Chiaravalloti, Yew, Dreer, Dams-O'Connor","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0266422","20220407","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-08","",29816,""
"A qualitative study on the impact of death during COVID-19: Thoughts and feelings of Portuguese bereaved adults","As a global threat, the COVID-19 pandemic has been an important factor in increasing death rate worldwide. As the virus spreads across international borders, it causes severe illness, death, and disruptions in our daily lives. Death and dying rituals and customs aid bereaved people in overcoming their grief. In this sense, the purpose of this study was to access thoughts and feelings of Portuguese adults and the impact of the loss in daily life during COVID-19. A structured online questionnaire was applied (snowball sampling) and qualitative data on death and mourning namely the impact of the loss in daily life, was collected. One hundred and sixty-six individuals have lost someone since the beginning of the pandemic and were included. Analysis was inspired by Braun and Clark's content analysis. Most participants were female (66.9%), the median age was of 37.3 years, and 70.5% had a high education degree. Moreover, 30.7% of the participants present anxiety symptoms and 10.2% depression symptoms. The answers of studied participants gave insights on the extent of the loss in day-to-day life and four thematic themes were found: (1) The perceived inadequacy of the funeral rituality, (2) Sadness, fear and loneliness, (3) Changes in sleeping and concentration and increased levels of anxiety and (4) Concerns regarding the pandemic situation. We found a high prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms in the study sample. Also, the changes in post mortem procedures, have shown to be of great importance in the mourning procedure of the participants.","Aguiar, Pinto, Duarte","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0265284","20220407","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-08","",29817,""
"Centering mental health in society: A human rights approach to well-being for all","Applying a human rights lens to mental health and well-being will improve the systems that govern and operate U.S. society. Achieving this requires learning from successful approaches and scaling up the implementation of effective strategies that promote equity by actively addressing determinants and barriers across systems that impede overall health. As a country, the U.S. has shown significant success in innovation but has failed at taking successful programs and initiatives to scale. Having endured over a year of loss in education, social connection, and routines, the COVID-19 pandemic illuminated America's deeply rooted structural inequities that have worsened population mental health and well-being. Integrating mental health into institutions and systems, while recovering and rebuilding, must be at the forefront to provide a path for transformation. Three recommendations are derived from the strategies and initiatives described throughout this article that offer tangible steps for achieving wellbeing as a human right: 1. Embed mental health within and across all systems, and expand its definition across the continuum; 2. Prioritize prevention and health promotion through person-centered and community-driven strategies; and 3. Expand the diversification and training of the mental health workforce across sectors. The inequities addressed in this article are not the products of a global pandemic. Instead, they result from historical oppression, injustice, and inaction, exacerbated by the current context. Embedding a human rights approach to mental health in the United States is fundamental to individual and community well-being.

"The effects of COVID-19 victimization distress and racial bias on mental health among AIAN, Asian, Black, and Latinx young adults","U.S. young adult racial minorities have been disproportionately impacted by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in rates of infection and morbidity. Prepandemic racial discrimination has been associated with depression and general anxiety. However, the effect of coronavirus-specific forms of discrimination on mental health has not been examined. This study assessed the effect of social determinants of mental health and COVID-19-specific victimization and racial bias beliefs on depression and anxiety among young adults of color in the U.S. A national online survey of 399 American Indian/Alaskan Natives, Asian, Black, and Latinx adults (18-25 years) included demographic variables, COVID-19-health risks, and standardized measures of depression, anxiety, coronavirus-related victimization distress and perceptions of coronavirus-related racial bias across a range of contexts. Employment, financial and prescription insecurity, COVID-19-health risks, coronavirus-victimization distress and coronavirus racial bias beliefs were positively correlated with depression and anxiety. Scores on the Coronavirus Racial Bias Scale were significantly higher among Asian and Black respondents. Structural equation modeling controlling for race/ethnicity and demographic variables indicated coronavirus racial bias mediated the effect of coronavirus victimization distress on both mental health indices. Results suggest the COVID-19 pandemic has created new pathways to mental health disparities among young adults of color by reversing formerly protective factors such as employment, and by exacerbating structural and societal inequities linked to race. Findings highlight the necessity of creating mental health services tailored to the specific needs of racial minorities during the current and future health crises.

"County jails' responses to COVID-19: Practices, procedures, and provisions of behavioral health services","Michigan was one of the first states to feel the effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This exploratory, mixed-methods study describes 20 county jails' responses to the pandemic across Michigan and presents a case study of one rural jail to examine changes in booking trends and behavioral health needs and services. Qualitatively, jails decreased their population at the outset of the pandemic via early releases, reconsideration of bond, and reductions in arrests. Quantitatively, the greatest prevalence of serious mental illness was found during the spring (initial shutdown period), which had the lowest weekly booking rates. Significant differences were found when comparing charge severity and charge type between study periods. Bookings occurring during the spring were significantly related to felony charges and drug/alcohol charges while individuals were less frequently booked because of violations. Past year recidivism significantly decreased from the winter to summer phase. Policy should mandate that jails screen for behavioral health problems and provide access to behavioral health services, while also expanding diversion opportunities during and after a pandemic. Innovations in continuity of care are critical for both behavioral and public health needs given the high risk for suicide, overdose, and viral spread after release from jail.

"[Cardiac compromise in patients recovered from COVID-19 without troponin elevation assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging]","The disease caused by coronavirus (COVID-19) affects the cardiovascular system, whether by direct viral aggression or indirectly through systemic inflammation and multiple organ compromise. A widely used method to determine cardiac injury is troponin measurement. The aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of cardiac involvement (CINV) in a population recovered from COVID-19, referred to cardiac MRI (CMR), who did not present troponin elevation. There were 156 patients that recovered from COVID-19 and who did not present troponin elevation referred to CMR. CINV was considered to be the presence of: late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), edema, myocarditis, pericarditis, left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) and/or depressed right ventricular systolic dysfunction (RVSD). Prevalence of CINV was 28.8%, being more frequent in men (p=0.002), in patients who required hospitalization (p=0.04) and in those who experienced non-mild cases of infection (p=0.007). RVSD (17.9%) and LVSD (13.4%) were the most frequent findings. The rate of myocarditis was 0.6%. LGE manifested in 7.1% of patients and its presence was related to less left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (p=0.0001) and right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) (p=0.04). In patients who recovered from COVID-19, 28.8% of CINV was found. It was more frequent in men, in patients who required admission and in patients with cases of non-mild infection. The patients that presented LGE had less LVEF and RVSF.

"Restrictive interventions on a psychiatric admission ward before and after COVID-19","Restrictive interventions (seclusion, restraint and special observations) are used on psychiatric wards when there are no other means available to keep a patient or others safe. These measures can be traumatic, and the Mental Health Commission and the Health Service Executive are focused on minimising their use. We set out to determine whether, following a COVID related reduction in bed numbers on a high dependency psychiatric ward in St John of God Hospital in Dublin, there was a change in their incidence. Data on restrictive interventions and challenging behaviours were gathered for 9-month periods before and after March 2020 when COVID related ward changes took place. Figures were also collected on seclusion and restraint for the previous 18 months for a longer-term view. Ward and hospital occupancy levels were also recorded. Between the two time periods, episodes of seclusion fell by 53% and episodes of restraint by 56%. The hours devoted to special observation declined by 30% and incidents of challenging behaviours fell by 26%. Ward occupancy levels fell by only 5%. The longer-term comparison of figures for seclusion and restraint point towards a downward trend from mid-2019 that was accentuated in the post-COVID period. The changes found may relate to reduced crowding on the ward or other COVID related factors such as the emphasis on social distancing and a shared sense of purpose on the ward. The longer-term trend points towards an emerging cultural shift. The challenge now is to sustain and build upon these changes.","Feeney, Bonner, McAndrew","https://doi.org/10.1017/ipm.2022.9","20220407","aggression; challenging behaviour; mental health; psychiatry; restraint; seclusion; special observation; ward design","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-08","",29822,""
"EXPRESS: Far from the eyes, far from the heart COVID-19 confinement dampened sensitivity to painful facial features","In the last two years, governments of many countries imposed heavy social restrictions to contain the spread of the COVID-19 virus, with consequent increase of bad mood, distress, or depression for the people involved. Few studies investigated the impact of these restrictive measures on individual social proficiency, and specifically the processing of emotional facial information, leading to mixed results. The present research aimed at investigating systematically whether, and to which extent, social isolation influences the processing of facial expressions. To this end, we manipulated the social exclusion experimentally through the well-known Cyberball game (within-subject factor), and we exploited the occurrence of the lockdown for the Swiss COVID-19 first wave by recruiting participants before and after being restricted at home (grouping factor). We then tested whether either form of social segregation influenced the processing of pain, disgust or neutral expressions, across multiple tasks probing access to different components of affective facial responses (state-specific, shared across states). We found that the lockdown (but not game-induced exclusion) affected negatively the processing of pain-specific information, without influencing other components of the affective facial response related to disgust or broad unpleasantness. In addition, participants recruited after the confinement reported lower scores in empathy questionnaires. These results suggest that social isolation affected negatively individual sensitivity to other people's affect and, with specific reference to the processing of facial expressions, the processing of pain-diagnostic information.","Antico, Corradi-Dell'Acqua","https://doi.org/10.1177/17470218221094772","20220407","COVID_19 lockdown; Emotional facial processing; Empathy; Social exclusion","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-08","",29823,""
"Rise in depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic: results from a cross-sectional national survey","The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has introduced many mental stressors. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of depression and anxiety during the pandemic and characterize those at higher risk. We conducted a national cross-sectional telephone interview survey among Israeli adults from May to September 2020, between the first two national lockdowns. Mental health status was measured using the 5-item Mental Health Inventory (MHI-5). A score of Ã¢â€°Â¤60 was defined as poor mental health with moderate to high anxiety and depression symptoms. Multivariate analysis was used to identify demographic, health-related, and COVID-19-related risk factors associated with poor mental health. From 4,712 households that were eligible for inclusion in this study, 2,634 participants (55.9%) completed the survey. Levels of anxiety and depression symptoms increased significantly throughout the pandemic (from 12.9% to 20.3%, P &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001). Loneliness also increased over time (from 48.8% to 58.8%, P &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001), and fear of the pandemic remained high (66.5%) throughout the study. According to the multivariate analysis, poor mental health was associated with younger age, female gender, lower education, Arab ethnicity, decrease in household income during the pandemic, having a pre-existing chronic illness, obesity, smoking, ever being quarantined, feeling lonely and fear of the pandemic. Our findings show an increase in anxiety and depression over time among the Israeli population during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings highlight the need for strengthened mental health services and the flexibility of reallocation of funds and health resources to support the growing mental health needs during the health crisis.","Frankenthal, Keinan-Boker, Bromberg","https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2022.2057558","20220407","COVID-19; Israel; anxiety; depression; mental health; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-08","",29824,""
"ACT for Lupus: Pilot Feasibility and Acceptability Study of a Novel Web-Based Acceptance and Commitment Therapy Program for Patients With Lupus","Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) has demonstrated effectiveness in addressing symptoms of anxiety and depression, frequently experienced by patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The goal of this pilot study was to develop and assess the feasibility and acceptability of a novel web-based ACT skills training program tailored for patients with lupus: ACT for Lupus. The program served as a complementary approach to support the management of symptoms and stressors during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study employed a single-group pretest-posttest design. Participants with a diagnosis of SLE were primarily recruited through an institutional healthcare system between November 25, 2020 and December 17, 2020 and through an online national lupus organization listserv. Participants were invited to attend two 1-hour webinars delivered over a 2-week period. Educational ACT-based content was tailored for patients with lupus and delivered by an experienced clinical psychologist specializing in ACT. Surveys assessed patient-reported outcomes of anxiety, depression, and quality of life and evaluated program feedback, usability, and satisfaction. A total of 83 participants submitted the baseline survey, with 21 participants designated as study completers. The program was well received by participants, who reported feasibility and acceptability of the intervention, as reflected by high usability ratings. Participants reported favorable experiences with the program. Feedback included suggestions to include additional lupus-tailored content, increase the range and scope of sessions and activities, and improve program flexibility and availability to avoid scheduling conflicts. This study provides preliminary evidence for an adapted, ACT-based virtual skills training program as a feasible and acceptable intervention to support the well-being of patients with lupus.","McCormick, Englund, Cleveland, Dickson, Schiller, Sheikh","https://doi.org/10.1002/acr2.11433","20220407","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-08","",29825,""
"Parental Stress of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder During the Coronavirus Pandemic (COVID-19): Experience from Serbia","Taking care of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as of children with other developmental disorders, is associated with greater parental stress. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and impact of integrative and co-morbid ASD-related symptoms on parental stress levels during the COVID-19 pandemic at four time points. Testing was performed during significant changes related to the state of the COVID-19 pandemic in Serbia. The research sample included 67 parents of children with ASD 4 to 7 years and 6 months of age. The Autism Parenting Stress Index, Gilliam Autism Rating Scale - Third Edition, diagnostic criteria for ASD from DSM-5 and Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence - Fourth Edition were used to assess the tested abilities. Core behavior (problems of social development and communication skills) as well as co-morbid behaviors related to ASD (tantrums, aggressive behavior, self-injurious behavior and difficulties with transitions) caused the highest degree of parental stress. Post hoc tests that used Bonferroni correction found that parental stress caused by basic and co-morbid behaviors gradually decreased from first to fourth measurement, respectively. Sleep and toilet training problems, as well as co-morbid physical problems, caused the greatest degree of parental stress during the first measurement. Measuring total parental stress caused by integrative and co-morbid symptoms related to ASD showed that it was at the highest level during the first measurement, decreased during the second measurement and remained unchanged during the third and fourth measurements. Time, as a repeating factor, during the COVID-19 pandemic has an effect on lowering the levels of parental stress caused by all examined ASD-related domains. These results may be useful in creating individual programs to support parents of children with ASD during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"An evaluation of the veteran friendly practice accreditation programme","The Royal College of General Practitioners Veteran Friendly Practice Accreditation Programme launched in 2019, aiming to allow practices to better identify, treat and refer veterans, where appropriate, to dedicated NHS services. Evaluate the effectiveness of the accreditation programme, focusing on benefits for the veteran, the practice and the delivery of the programme itself. The study evaluated the views of Veteran Friendly Accredited GP Practices across England. Mixed-methods study collecting data via an online survey from 232 accredited Primary Healthcare (PHC) staff and 15 semi-structured interviews with PHC Veteran Leads. Interviews were analysed using modified Grounded Theory. 99% (N=228) of respondents would recommend the programme, 77% (N=124) reported improved awareness and 84% (N=193) a better understanding of veteran's needs. 72% (N=166) identified benefits for veterans who were engaging more with PHC but participants felt more time was needed, largely due to the Covid-19 pandemic, to fully assess the impact of the programme on help-seeking behaviour. Challenges included identifying veterans already registered, promoting the accreditation process and ensuring all PHC staff were kept up to date with veteran issues. The programme has increased signposting to veteran specific services and greater understanding of the NHS priority referral criteria for veterans. Recording of veteran status has improved and there was evidence of a better medical record coding system in PHC practices. These findings add to the limited empirical evidence exploring veteran engagement in PHC and demonstrate how accreditation results in better treatment and identification of veterans.","Finnegan, Salem, Ainsworth-Moore, Randles, West, Simpson, Grant","https://doi.org/10.3399/BJGPO.2022.0012","20220407","Health promotion and prevention; Mental health (general)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-08","",29827,""
"Physical activity domains, levels, and health-related quality of life among Nigerian adolescents during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic","The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic spurred unprecedented public health measures to curb its spread. Such measures might have negatively impacted adolescents' participation in physical activity and health-related quality of life. However, the evidence is unclear in Nigerian adolescents. This study assessed the physical activity domains, levels, and health-related quality of life in Nigerian adolescents during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. The sample consisted of 430 students in public secondary schools in Nsukka, Enugu State. The students were randomly selected to participate in the cross-sectional study between November 2020 and April 2021. The Demographic Profile Form, International Physical Activity Questionnaire, Short Form-36 Health Survey, and Perceived Susceptibility to coronavirus disease 2019 Infection Questionnaire were used for data collection. Descriptive statistics, Chi-square test, independent-samples <i>t</i>-test, univariate ANOVA, and multiple linear regressions were conducted using SPSS version 25. The mean score of total physical activity (MET-min/week) was 1651.3 (<i>SD</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°842.18). The mean overall score of health-related quality of life was 78.30 (<i>SD</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°16.43). The mental health component of health-related quality of life showed that adolescents had poor mental health status. Female adolescents had higher mean scores in physical component summary (<i>M</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°83.03; <i>SD</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°27.36) and mental component summary (<i>M</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°51.19; <i>SD</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°8.69) than the male adolescents, physical component summary (<i>M</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°69.0; <i>SD</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°21.65) and mental component summary (<i>M</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°46.15; <i>SD</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°10.71). The findings showed a significant positive association among gender, class of study, parental type, perceived susceptibility to coronavirus disease 2019, and physical activity domains, levels, and health-related quality of life. In addition, boys had a higher mean score of total physical activity (MET-min/week) than the girls. More girls were less active than the boys. However, concerning the health-related quality of life, girls had higher mean scores in physical component summary and mental component summary than boys. Physical activity interventions that specifically target female adolescents' physical activity participation are needed. Also, mental health interventions are needed to improve the mental health status of adolescents, especially boys in the post-coronavirus disease 2019 era.","Ugwueze, Agbaje","https://doi.org/10.1177/20503121221088808","20220407","COVID-19; Nigeria; Physical activity; adolescents; health-related quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-08","",29828,""
"Psychological Impact in Healthcare Workers During Emergencies: The Italian Experience With COVID-19 First Wave","The COVID-19 outbreak imposed an overwhelming workload as well as emotional burdens on Healthcare workers (HCWs). In May 2020, an online survey was administered to HCWs in Italy to assess the pandemic's psychological impact and to investigate possible predictive factors that led to individual differences. The psychological experience was measured based on the prevalence of self-reported feelings during the pandemic, including negative and positive emotional states. We analyzed the relationship between factors of gender, age, geographic region, professional role, and operational unit, and the four-point scale used to rate the frequency of each emotional state experienced by performing several multinomial logistic regressions, one for each emotion. Our findings suggest that more than half of HCWs experienced psychological distress during the first COVID-19 outbreak in Italy. Female and younger respondents, especially those operating in northern Italy experienced more frequently negative emotional states such as irritability, anxiety, loneliness, and insecurity. However, positive feelings, first of all solidarity, were also reported especially by female and older workers. The majority of the negative as well as positive emotional states were experienced almost equally by both doctors and nurses, and independently of the operational unit in which they operated. This study can be very useful as a contribution to the current literature on the psychological effects of this pandemic on health workers. Moreover, our findings can provide useful information in planning more tailored psychological interventions to support this category of workers in the ongoing and future emergencies.","Pisanu, Di Benedetto, Infurna, Rumiati","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.818674","20220407","COVID-19; healthcare workers (HCWs); mental health; pandemic; psychological impact","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-08","",29829,""
"Post-traumatic Growth and Psychological Resilience During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Serial Mediation Model","Although the World Health Organization (WHO) has issued guidelines for managing to contain, mitigate, and limit of the COVID-19. However, it is more essential to highlight the urgency and importance of evaluating social functioning and mental health status during the pandemic. College students have experienced serious problems and have had to overcome many negative situations brought about by the pandemic. Accordingly, the present study intended to use Chinese college students as sample to examine the positive adoption and changes during the ongoing COVID-19. Guided by literatures in this filed, we explored the internal mechanism of post-traumatic growth affecting psychological resilience, and considered about mediation roles of positive coping styles and cognitive reappraisal. A total of 463 college students from universities in China effectively completed online questionnaires. The result indicated that these four variables were positively correlated with each other (<i>p</i>s &lt; 0.001). More importantly, our findings proved a direct and positive effect on psychological resilience. Positive coping styles and cognitive reappraisal, respectively, mediated the relationship between post-traumatic growth and psychological resilience. Over all, the hypothesized serial model conclusively fits the data: students with high-level post-traumatic growth tended to report increased use of positive coping strategies, which further facilitated their cognitive reappraisal, and subsequently, promoted their psychological resilience. The findings obtained in this study will provide a theoretical basis and possible viable strategies for both targeted crisis intervention and psychological trauma recovery plans.","Li, Hu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.780807","20220407","cognitive reappraisal; college students; positive coping; post-traumatic growth; psychological resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-08","",29830,""
"Prevalence and Associated Factors of Depression, Anxiety and Insomnia Symptoms Among Patients Receiving Ophthalmic Consultation Online During the COVID-2019 Pandemic","This study aims to assess the prevalence and associated factors of depression, anxiety and insomnia symptoms among patients undergoing ophthalmic consultation online during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) pandemic. We reviewed the data of patients who received online ophthalmic consultations during the lockdown period from February to August 2020, and an online survey was conducted among them. We collected the respondents' demographic data and their attitudes toward the online consultation, assessed the depression, anxiety and insomnia symptoms and estimated associated factors by logistic regression analysis. The online service provided 425 consultations during the COVID-19 lockdown period. Of these eligible subjects, 139 patients responded to an invitation to participant in the study (105/75.5% were females, and 40/28.8% were health care workers). More than half of the participants reported that they trusted and were satisfied with the online consultation (109/78.4% and 82/59%, respectively). Fifty-two (37.4%), 32 (23.0%), and 53 (38.1%) patients showed symptoms of depression, anxiety, and insomnia, respectively. Depression was found to be significantly more common in health care workers (<i>P</i> = 0.019) and those who were basically satisfied with online consultation (<i>P</i> = 0.024). Anxiety was more common among participants who had used electronics for a long time (<i>P</i> = 0.038). Binary logistic regression showed health care work as a risk factor for depressive symptoms (odds ratio [OR]: 2.424; 95% CI: 1.143-5.143; <i>P</i> = 0.021). Psychological distress is highly prevalent among patients who were involved in online consultation for ocular manifestations during the COVID-19 lockdown period. In the context of a major public health event, ophthalmologists should focus not only on ocular symptoms but also on the mental health of their patients, and appropriate psychological support should be given.","Ding, Guo, Zhu, Tuxunjiang, Abudoukeremuahong, Zuo, Lin","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.855366","20220407","anxiety; coronavirus disease 2019; depression; insomnia; ophthalmic online consultation; patients","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-08","",29831,""
"COVID-19 pandemic and the consequential effect on patients with endometriosis","What was the effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on healthcare and quality of life in those suffering from endometriosis? Our study reveals a clear correlation between the deterioration of the reported physical and mental state and impaired medical care for patients suffering from endometriosis during the COVID-19 pandemic. The quality of life of patients suffering from endometriosis is compromised in a variety of aspects. In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, self-isolation practices aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19 have severely complicated the availability of proper medical care worldwide. The study involved a cross-sectional international self-reported online survey. Responses were accepted between November 2020 and January 2021. The survey was prepared by the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology in a medical university setting. The survey contained 17 questions and was placed online. Cooperation with different endometriosis organizations around the world enabled distribution of the survey through their social media platforms. The study participants (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3024 replies) originated from 59 countries. The questionnaire was created after a literature review and is partially based on the validated quality of life questionnaires, adjusted to the study question. The survey was then translated to 15 other languages following World Health Organization recommendations as closely as possible. Chi-square tests for independence were carried out for the analysis of the two variables: suspension of health services, and the patients mental and physical well-being. Out of 3024 participants from 59 countries who submitted the questionnaire between November 2020 and January 2021, 2964 (98.01%) provided information that enabled a full analysis. For the 1174 participants who had their medical appointments cancelled, 43.7% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°513) reported that their symptoms had been aggravated, and 49.3% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°579) reported that their mental state had worsened.In comparison, of the 1180 participants who kept their appointments, only 29.4% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°347) stated that their symptoms had been aggravated, and 27.5% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°325) stated their mental health had worsened. The results showed that there was a significant link between the reported deterioration of mental and physical wellbeing and impaired medical care (cancellation) (<i>P</i> Ã¢â€°Âª 0.001). A total of 610 participants did not have medical appointments scheduled, and these participants followed a similar pattern as the participants who kept their appointments, with 29.0% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°177) reporting aggravation of symptoms and 28.2% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°172) reporting that their mental state had worsened. Cultural differences among international participants are to be expected and this may have affected how participants from different countries interpreted and answered the questionnaire. Translating the questionnaire into 15 different languages, even though incorporating backwards translation, could possibly lead to different interpretations of given questions, simply based on different wording in the languages. The majority of respondents (around 90%) were from Europe and South America and therefore the findings may not be generalizable to other locations. Further research is needed to assess the true impact and long-term consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic for patients living with endometriosis. This study received no funding and the authors declare they have no relevant conflicts of interest.
