"Severe fatigue as symptom of long COVID is characterized by increased expression of inflammatory genes in monocytes, increased serum pro-inflammatory cytokines, and increased CD8+ T-lymphocytes A putative dysregulation of the immune-brain axis, the coagulation process, and auto-inflammation to explain the diversity of long COVID symptoms","Background. A significant proportion of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection develops long COVID with fatigue as one of the most disabling symptoms. We performed clinical and immunologic profiling of fatigued and non-fatigued long COVID patients and age and gender matched healthy controls (HCs). Methods. We included 37 long COVID patients with and 36 without severe fatigue and assessed inflammation-related monocyte gene expression, serum levels of inflammatory cytokines, and leukocyte and lymphocyte subsets 3-6 months after hospital discharge, and followed clinical symptoms up to one year. Results. Long COVID with fatigue represented a severe variant with many symptoms (median 9 [IQR 5.0-10.0] symptoms) and signs of cognitive failure (41%) and depression (>24%). Symptoms persisted up to one year follow-up. Fatigued patients showed increased expression of inflammatory genes in monocytes, increased serum IL-6, TNF-, galectin-9, and CXCL10, and increased CD8+ T-lymphocytes compared to HCs. Non-fatigued long COVID patients were arbitrarily divided in those with moderately severe disease (4 [2.5-5.0] symptoms, primarily impaired fitness, n=25) and those with mild disease (1 [1.0-2.0] symptom, n=11). Symptoms in non-fatigued long COVID patients persisted up to one year follow-up. Moderately severe patients showed reduced CD45RO- naive CD4+ T-lymphocytes and CD25+FOXP3+ regulatory CD4+ T-lymphocytes and limited monocyte and serum (galectin-9) inflammation. Mild patients showed monocyte and serum (IL-6, galectin-9) inflammation and decreased CD4+ T-lymphocyte subsets (T-helper 1 cells). Conclusion. Long COVID with fatigue is associated with many concurrent and persistent symptoms up to one year after hospitalization and with clear signs of low grade inflammation and increased CD8+ T-lymphocytes. We showed that long COVID is a clinical and immunologic heterogeneous disorder. Diagnostic tools and personalized therapies combatting the diverse immune abnormalities might be required to alleviate the persisting disabling complaints of the patients.","Julia C Berentschot; Hemmo A Drexhage; Daniel A Aynekulu Mersha; Annemarie JM Wijkhuijs; Corine H GeurtsvanKessel; Marion PG Koopmans; Jolanda Voermans; Majanka H Heijenbrok-Kal; L.

"A Review on the Impact of Covid-19 on Mental Health and Wellbeing of Health Care Workers","The front-line health care workers faced many challenges and risks during this COVID-19 pandemic. The HCWs has a direct effect and carried a major burden and consequences in the control of this virus. Apart from physical stress the HCW suffering from psychological complications. This systemic review highlights the adverse mental health outcomes and other identifiable risk factors that affect their psychological behaviour during this COVID-19 pandemic. In this review, three databases were reviewed in different time points and literature have done according to WHO guidelines and PRISMA guidelines. In this review, we included various observational, experimental, and published articles that reported the mental health or psychological affects of the COVID-19 pandemic on HCWs. This study indicates that the COVID 19 pandemic has a potential effect on front-line HCWs in their psychological well-being. The data obtained from 24 studies in this review mainly from HCWs working at urban hospitals in China. Till now there is no evidence comparison with primary care workers. Whereas nurses are at high risk of adverse mental health outcomes compared to other health care workers. Other factors like gender, socioeconomic factors, underlying illness, lack of systemic support were the risk factors of adverse mental health outcomes. Furthermore, it is evident that PPE, exposure, workplace setting, testing have an impact on HCWs with COVID 19 infection and affect their mental health outcomes. It was observed that the maximum number of HCWs reported this COVID 19 infection during the first six months of the pandemic. The prevalence of hospitalization is 15% and with psychological problems of 1.5%. Still, extensive data is needed to observe the mental health problems among HCWs.","Vemula, N.; Kasturi, S.

"Prevalence and predisposing factors of post-traumatic stress symptoms in anaesthetists during the COVID-19 outbreak in South Africa: a cross-sectional survey","Background: Post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSSs) have been described in healthcare workers after disease outbreaks. Anaesthetists are at high risk of exposure to COVID-19 due to the nature of the airway procedures they perform. Anaesthetists are also at increased risk of mental health disorders, substance abuse and suicidality. When PTSSs are sufficiently high in number and severity, they become the key elements of the diagnostic criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This study sought to explore the prevalence and predisposing factors of PTSSs in anaesthetists during the COVID-19 outbreak in South Africa. Methods: Members of the South African Society of Anaesthesiologists (SASA) completed an electronic survey including sociodemographic information and information regarding COVID-19 exposure. The PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) was used to measure PTSSs. The resultant score indicated symptom severity, with a score of 33 or higher indicating a provisional diagnosis of PTSD. Results: A total of 483 participants completed the survey (23.8% response rate). Three hundred and ninety-one respondents were included in the study, of which 17.6% received a provisional PTSD diagnosis. Younger anaesthetists with less experience, females, single participants and those without children exhibited a greater prevalence of PTSD. Anaesthetists with pre-existing mental health conditions (p = 0.009) and those who reported loneliness (p = &lt;0.001) and poor social support (p = 0.018) were more likely to receive a provisional PTSD diagnosis. Personal protective equipment (PPE) shortages were also associated with the development of PTSD (p = 0.009). Conclusion: The prevalence of PTSSs is unacceptably high amongst South African anaesthesia providers, especially those with pre-existing mental health conditions and poor social support. Findings from this study indicate the importance of supporting susceptible healthcare workers through interventions aimed at positive mental health promotion and PTSD prevention.","Lombard, T.; Spijkerman, S.; Van Rooyen, C.","https://doi.org/10.36303/SAJAA.2022.28.1.S2.2781","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Southern African Journal of Anaesthesia and Analgesia; 28(1):S6, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-16","",37660,""
"The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on caustic ingestion at a tertiary care center in South India","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the mental health of individuals which has sometimes led to attempts at deliberate self-harm including the ingestion of caustic substances. This study was aimed to compare the rates of caustic substance ingestion during the pandemic to a similar period in the preceding year at our center. Methodology: We carried out a retrospective analysis, in which patients' details (demographic, clinical, endoscopic, and outcomes) were collected and compared between April 2019 and December 2019 (pre-COVID-19 pandemic) and from April 2020 to December 2020 (during the COVID-19 pandemic). Results: A total of 41 patients were included in this study, 26 (63.4%) in the pandemic period and 15 (36.5%) in the prepandemic period. The majority were female in both the prepandemic (60%) and pandemic periods (53.9%). More adolescents (&lt;18 years of age) were seen in the pandemic period (15.3%) than in the prepandemic period (6.7%). The proportion of patients admitted with caustic substance ingestion in the pandemic period (3.53%) was significantly higher than in the prepandemic period (1.57%) (P = 0.0094). Conclusion: Caustic substance ingestion almost doubled in our center during the COVID-19 pandemic highlighting the burden of mental health issues during a pandemic.","Rao, N. V.; Simon, E.

"Differences in Long-COVID Symptoms between Vaccinated and Non-Vaccinated (BNT162b2 Vaccine) Hospitalized COVID-19 Survivors Infected with the Delta Variant","This study compared differences in the presence of post-COVID symptoms among vaccinated and non-vaccinated COVID-19 survivors requiring hospitalization due to the Delta (B.1.617.2) variant. This cohort study included hospitalized subjects who had survived SARS-CoV-2 infection (Delta variant) from July to August 2021 in an urban hospital in Madrid, Spain. Individuals were classified as vaccinated if they received full administration (i.e., two doses) of BNT162b2 ('Pfizer-BioNTech';) vaccines. Other vaccines were excluded. Those with just one dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine were considered as non-vaccinated. Patients were scheduled for a telephone interview at a follow-up around six months after infection for assessing the presence of post-COVID symptoms with particular attention to those symptoms starting after acute infection and hospitalization. Anxiety/depressive levels and sleep quality were likely assessed. Hospitalization and clinical data were collected from medical records. A total comprising 109 vaccinated and 92 non-vaccinated COVID-19 survivors was included. Vaccinated patients were older and presented a higher number of medical comorbidities, particular cardiorespiratory conditions, than non-vaccinated patients. No differences in COVID-19 onset symptoms at hospitalization and post-COVID symptoms six months after hospital discharge were found between vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups. No specific risk factor for any post-COVID symptom was identified in either group. This study observed that COVID-19 onset-associated symptoms and post-COVID symptoms six-months after hospitalization were similar between previously hospitalized COVID-19 survivors vaccinated and those non-vaccinated.

"Changes in Parents' COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy for Children Aged 3&ndash;17 Years before and after the Rollout of the National Childhood COVID-19 Vaccination Program in China: Repeated Cross-Sectional Surveys","China started to implement COVID-19 vaccination programs for children in July 2021. This study investigated the changes in parents' COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy for children before and after the vaccination program rollout. Repeated cross-sectional online surveys among full-time adult factory workers were conducted in Shenzhen, China. This analysis was based on 844 (first round) and 1213 parents (second round) who had at least one child aged 3&ndash;17 years. The prevalence of vaccine hesitancy for children aged 3&ndash;11 years dropped from 25.9% (first round) to 17.4% (second round), while such a prevalence for children aged 12&ndash;17 years dropped from 26.0% (first round) to 3.5% (second round) (p &lt; 0.001). Positive attitudes, a perceived subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control related to children's COVID-19 vaccination were associated with lower vaccine hesitancy in both rounds. In the second round and among parents with children aged 3&ndash;11 years, negative attitudes and exposure to information on SARS-CoV-2 infection after receiving a primary vaccine series were associated with higher vaccine hesitancy, while exposure to experiences shared by vaccine recipients and infectiousness of variants of concern were associated with lower vaccine hesitancy. Regular monitoring of vaccine hesitancy and its associated factors among parents should be conducted to guide health promotion.","Zhou, Xiaofeng, Wang, Shiyu, Zhang, Kechun, Chen, Siyu, Chan, Paul Shing-fong, Fang, Yuan, Cao, He, Chen, Hongbiao, Hu, Tian, Chen, Yaqi, Wang, Zixin","https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10091478","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Vaccines; 10(9):1478, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-16","",37664,""
"Stress, Anxiety, and Depression in Pre-Clinical Medical Students: Prevalence and Association with Sleep Disorders","Our aim was to assess sleep quality in different subgroups of preclinical medical students, and then to identify specific lifestyle factors, academic and social factors as well as Corona virus related factors that were associated with poor sleeping quality and poor psychological health. Study participants were all medical students at King Saud University of Medical Sciences in the first and second years (648 students), and the study was conducted from December 2021 to January 2022. We administered the survey on paper as well as online. We used three types of questionnaires in this study. The first was a self-administered questionnaire, the second was a validated Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) for finding sleeping problems, and the third was a validated DASS 10 for determining Depression, Anxiety, and Stress. A total of 361 pre-clinical medical students consisted of 146 (40.4%) males and 215 (59.5%) females. The majority of the students, 246 (68.1%), were in their second year. Furthermore, in the current study, students who had poor academic performance (15.8%), satisfactory academic performance (21.3%), or good academic performance (30.7%) had significant sleeping problems found (&chi;2 = 19.4;p = 0.001), among them poor academic performance students 21.6%, satisfactory academic performance students (29.3%), and good academic performance students (29.3%) had moderate to severe levelled sleeping problems.

"Threat Perception, Emotions and Social Trust of Global Bat Experts before and during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Speculations about the origin of SARS-CoV-2 have catapulted bats into the spotlight of scientific and societal attention, with unforeseen consequences for bat conservation. In two global surveys with bat experts before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, we assessed their (i) threat perceptions, emotions towards bats and social trust in decision makers and (ii) the predictive potential of emotions, social trust and socio-demographic variables on threat perceptions. We also discuss (iii) the potential influence of the pandemic on threat perception and antecedents (emotions and social trust). We received 495 responses from 65 countries in September 2019 and 320 responses in June 2020 from 77 countries. We identified three major threat categories (indirect, direct and prejudice). Comparing threat perception, emotions and social trust between both surveys, we found that indirect threats (e.g., habitat modification) were considered as crucial, yet less so during the pandemic. During the pandemic, experts rated indirect threats lower and the perceived threat through prejudice (e.g., myths) higher than before the pandemic. During the pandemic, bat experts also expressed more compassion and sadness related to bats and trust in researchers and NGOs, but less trust in laypeople than before the pandemic. Emotions were particularly important predictors for threats through prejudice besides social trust. Socio-demographic variables (e.g., cultural and professional background) had predictive potential predominantly for direct threats (e.g., hunting and trade, wind turbines) and threats through prejudice. Our study highlights the role of emotions and social trust on threat perception among bat experts who remained relatively invisible during the pandemic despite their key role for bat conservation. More importantly, we echo previous calls to be more attentive to ecological grief also within the scientific community;especially as discussions around zoonotic spillover with valued study animals intensify.","Straka, Tanja M.; Voigt, Christian C.","https://doi.org/10.3390/su141811242","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sustainability; 14(18):11242, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-16","",37666,""
"The Relationship between Quality of Life and Physical Exercise with Depression and Perceived Stress during the Second COVID-19 Lockdown in Greece","Anxiety, depression, and psychological stress were the most common mental health issues that surfaced during and after the COVID-19 lockdowns. The aim of this paper is to investigate the psychological impact of the second COVID-19 lockdown on the Greek population. A cross-sectional anonymous study was designed, which measured perceived stress, depression symptoms, physical activity, and quality of life. The sample was collected during the period of the second lockdown and consisted of 330 adult individuals (219 females and 111 males) with a mean age of 34.3 years, who were located in Greece. Four scales were applied to measure the constructs, the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14), Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI), Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF), and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). The main findings suggest that depression and perceived stress were more prevalent during the second lockdown compared to previous time periods. The psychological impact was elevated for women and younger individuals. Unemployed people dealt with more stress compared to full-time working individuals. The two quality-of-life domains, physical and psychological health, were negatively correlated with perceived stress and depression. We suggest targeted interventions in order to support the most vulnerable groups and enhance their well-being.","Kolias, Pavlos, Pliafa, Ourania","https://doi.org/10.3390/psych4030042","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psych; 4(3):549-559, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-16","",37667,""

Between 1 April 2020 and 30 May 2020, a Google form containing a questionnaire assessing socio-demographic information and the effects of MCO on mental health was made available to the public via email and a social media forum, and 762 responses were collected. Those who took the initiative to fill out the responses were therefore categorized as survey participants. City-dwelling Chinese-ethnic women between the ages of 18 and 25 who have mild to severe symptoms of sadness, anxiety, and stress were at the highest risk for developing mental health disorders, according to the study. The firms should be accorded appropriate consideration, acknowledgement, focus, and financial support. The goal of mental health programs for affected individuals should be to create a society free of the mental health difficulties, which can grasp the soul and mind and, eventually, improve the quality of life.","Ismail, Mohd Khairi, Sarifuddin, Syamsulang, Muhamad, Muhamad Zahid, Siwar, Chamhuri","https://doi.org/10.3390/proceedings2022082014","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Proceedings; 82(1):14, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-16","",37668,""
"Relationship between Mental Health and Socio-Economic, Demographic and Environmental Factors in the COVID-19 Lockdown Period-A Multivariate Regression Analysis","Amongst the several consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, we should include psychological effects on the population. The mental health consequences of lockdown are affected by several factors. The most important are: the duration of the social isolation period, the characteristics of the living space, the number of online (virtual) and offline (physical) contacts and perceived contacts' closeness, individual characteristics, and the spread of infection in the geographical area of residence. In this paper, we investigate the possible effects of environmental, social and individual characteristics (predictors) on mental health (response) during the COVID-19 lockdown period. The relationship between mental health and predictors can be studied with a multivariate linear regression model, because 'mental health';is a multidimensional concept. This work provides a contribution to the debate about the factors affecting mental health in the period of the COVID-19 lockdown, with the application of an innovative approach based on a multivariate regression analysis and a combined permutation test on data collected in a survey conducted in Italy in 2020.","Bonnini, Stefano, Borghesi, Michela","https://doi.org/10.3390/math10183237","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Mathematics; 10(18):3237, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-16","",37669,""
"Psychological Responses of Hungarian Students during the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic","(1) Background: Changes in daily life and academic training has led to uncertainty in the higher education student population during COVID-19. The goal of the study was to examine the impacts of the pandemic on Hungarian students. (2) Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted by using self-report questionnaires collected in Google Forms. Eight-hundred-and-twenty-seven students (25.29 &plusmn;8.09) took part anonymously. The respondents rate their overall physical and mental health on a 5-point Likert scale and validated scales were used: Well Being Index (WHO-5);Mindfulness Attention and Awareness Scale (MAAS);and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14). Statistical analyses were performed with IBM SPSS-14.24, results were considered at a significance level p &le;0.05. (3) Results: Positive correlation was found between MAAS and WHO-5 (r = 0.363, p &lt; 0.001) negative correlation between MAAS and PSS-14 (r = &minus;0.448, p &lt; 0.001), and negative correlation between WHO-5 and PSS-14 (r = &minus;0.671, p &lt; 0.001). Females had higher PSS-14 mean score (32.51 &plusmn;10.16) than males (27.71 &plusmn;10.19;p &lt; 0.001;Z = &minus;5703), males (60.92 &plusmn;12.10) had higher MAAS level than females (57.31 &plusmn;12.51;p &lt; 0.001;Z = &minus;3589). No difference was found in gender regarding WHO-5 mean scores. Athletes (7.03 &plusmn;3.27) differ significantly from non-athletes (6.00 &plusmn;3.04) in WHO-5 (p &lt; 0.001;Z = &minus;4.349) and MAAS level (p = 0.012;Z = &minus;2.498), but showed no difference in PSS-14 (p = 0.101;Z = &minus;1.641). Students rated mental (3.01 &plusmn;0.99) worse than physical health (3.49 &plusmn;0.98;p &lt; 0.001, r = 0.426) and the narrowing of social relationships worse (3.83 &plusmn;1.26) than physical (p &lt; 0.001, r = &minus;0.212) and mental health (p &lt; 0.001, r = &minus;0.408).

"The Beneficial Effects of Professional Identity: The Mediating Role of Teaching Identification in the Relationship between Role Stress and Psychological Distress during the COVID-19 Pandemic","At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, teachers and students rapidly transitioned to remote teaching and learning. In South Africa, this initial transition was followed by periods of reopening and closing of schools during the various waves of the pandemic. When schools were reopened, rotational schooling was implemented, with students attending in shifts. All this change created a climate of uncertainty for teachers. The current study investigates the relationship between role stress and indices of psychological distress, as well as the potential mediating role of teaching identification in this relationship, using a cross-sectional survey design. Participants (n = 355) were school teachers in South Africa who completed the Role Stress Questionnaire, the Professional Identification Scale, the trait scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Beck Hopelessness Scale during the second wave of the pandemic (May&ndash;July 2021). The results of a structural equation analysis indicate significant positive direct effects of role conflict and ambiguity on anxiety and hopelessness, as well as significant negative direct effects of teaching identification on anxiety and hopelessness. In addition, teaching identification was found to mediate the effect of role conflict and ambiguity on anxiety and hopelessness. The demonstrated role of teaching identification has implications that suggest the importance of leadership and supervisory support, as well as enhancing the societal value of teaching as a profession.","Pretorius, Tyrone Brian, Padmanabhanunni, Anita","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191811339","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(18):11339, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-16","",37671,""

"Spatial-Temporal Pattern Evolution of Public Sentiment Responses to the COVID-19 Pandemic in Small Cities of China: A Case Study Based on Social Media Data Analysis","The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on public mental health has become increasingly prominent. Therefore, it is of great value to study the spatial-temporal characteristics of public sentiment responses to COVID-19 exposure to improve urban anti-pandemic decision-making and public health resilience. However, the majority of recent studies have focused on the macro scale or large cities, and there is a relative lack of adequate research on the small-city scale in China. To address this lack of research, we conducted a case study of Shaoxing city, proposed a spatial-based pandemic-cognition-sentiment (PCS) conceptual model, and collected microblog check-in data and information on the spatial-temporal trajectory of cases before and after a wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The natural language algorithm of dictionary-based sentiment analysis (DSA) was used to calculate public sentiment strength. Additionally, local Moran's I, kernel-density analysis, Getis-Ord Gi* and standard deviation ellipse methods were applied to analyze the nonlinear evolution and clustering characteristics of public sentiment spatial-temporal patterns at the small-city scale concerning the pandemic. The results reveal that (1) the characteristics of pandemic spread show contagion diffusion at the micro level and hierarchical diffusion at the macro level, (2) the pandemic has a depressive effect on public sentiment in the center of the outbreak, and (3) the pandemic has a nonlinear gradient negative impact on mood in the surrounding areas. These findings could help propose targeted pandemic prevention policies applying spatial intervention to improve residents' mental health resilience in response to future pandemics.","Zhou, Yuye, Xu, Jiangang, Yin, Maosen, Zeng, Jun, Ming, Haolin, Wang, Yiwen","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191811306","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(18):11306, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-16","",37673,""
"Older Adults' Access to Care during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Results from the LOckdown and LifeSTyles (LOST) in Lombardia Project","The COVID-19 pandemic disproportionally affected older people in terms of clinical outcomes and care provision. We aimed to investigate older adults' changes in access to care during the pandemic and their determinants. We used data from a cross-sectional study (LOST in Lombardia) conducted in autumn 2020 on a representative sample of 4400 older adults from the most populated region in Italy. Lifestyles, mental health, and access to healthcare services before and during the pandemic were collected. To identify factors associated with care delays, reduction in emergency department (ED) access, and hospitalisations, we estimated prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using multivariable log-binomial regression models. During the pandemic, compared to the year before, 21.5% of the study population increased telephone contacts with the general practitioner (GP) and 9.6% increased self-pay visits, while 22.4% decreased GP visits, 12.3% decreased outpatient visits, 9.1% decreased diagnostic exams, 7.5% decreased ED access, and 6% decreased hospitalisations. The prevalence of care delays due to patient's decision (overall 23.8%) was higher among men (PR 1.16, 95% CI 1.05&ndash;1.29), subjects aged 75 years or more (PR 1.12, 95% CI 1.00&ndash;1.25), and those with a higher economic status (p for trend &lt; 0.001). Participants with comorbidities more frequently cancelled visits and reduced ED access or hospitalisations, while individuals with worsened mental health status reported a higher prevalence of care delays and ED access reductions. Access to care decreased in selected sub-groups of older adults during the pandemic with likely negative impacts on mortality and morbidity in the short and long run.","Vigezzi, Giacomo Pietro, Bertuccio, Paola, Amerio, Andrea, Bosetti, Cristina, Gori, Davide, Cavalieri dâ€™Oro, Luca, Iacoviello, Licia, Stuckler, David, Zucchi, Alberto, Gallus, Silvano, Odone, Anna, Investigators, Lost in Lombardia Project","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191811271","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(18):11271, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-16","",37674,""
"Stressors, Psychological States, and Relationship Quality among East Malaysian Adults with Partners Amid the COVID-19 Lockdown","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a huge impact not only on healthcare systems and economic threats but also on relationships. Due to the massive measures of the Movement Control Order, such as social distancing, strictly limited physical activities, and making adjustments to working from home-merged with the pandemic's fear-romantic partners may face challenges that affect the quality of their relationships. The purpose of this study was to (i) identify stressors experienced by participants during the COVID-19 lockdown, (ii) evaluate participants'psychological well-being before and during the lockdown, and (iii) see if participants' perceived relationship quality differed before and during the lockdown. An online self-report questionnaire was used to recruit 334 adults (58.1 percent female, 41.9 percent male) with partners (married = 304, engaged = 12, and in committed relationships = 17). Participants were asked about stressors they encountered as a result of COVID-19 using an open-ended question. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) were used to assess mental health, and the Perceived Relationship Quality Component (PRQC) Inventory was used to assess relationship quality. According to the findings, the top three common stressors reported by participants were financial problems, restricted movement, and fear of COVID-19 infection. Participants reported significantly higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression during the lockdown than before. The findings also revealed that participants' relationship quality improved during the lockdown compared to before the lockdown.

"A Longitudinal Study on Loneliness during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Japan","The prolonged COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing socioeconomic and health risk factors and added additional dimensions to the loneliness problem. Considering the temporal extension of COVID-19, which exposes people to various loneliness conditions, we examined the development of loneliness and changing risk factors based on age and gender. We used longitudinal data from Hiroshima University's nationwide survey in Japan, conducted before and during the pandemic, to categorize loneliness into three types: long-term (feeling of loneliness experienced both before and during the pandemic), post-pandemic (feeling of loneliness experienced throughout the whole pandemic period), and fresh (feeling of loneliness experienced only in the last year of the pandemic). Loneliness categorization is important because the prolonged existence of the COVID-19 pandemic has added additional dimensions to the loneliness problem, which existing studies rarely identify. As a result, the distinction between long-term and fresh loneliness remains unexplained. The weighted logit regression results revealed that many Japanese people have remained or became lonely during the pandemic and identified variations based on gender, age, and changes in socioeconomic and health characteristics. More precisely, almost 52% of the participants experienced long-term loneliness, while 8% of the participants experienced post-pandemic loneliness, and nearly 5% experienced fresh loneliness. Age and having children were associated with long-term loneliness;gender, age, leaving full-time employment, financial literacy, change in health status, and change in depression were associated with post-pandemic loneliness;and gender, having children, living in rural areas, change in household assets, financial literacy, changes in health status, and changes in depression were associated with fresh loneliness. These results indicated that long-term, post-pandemic, and fresh loneliness have distinct characteristics. The Japanese government should devise distinctive solutions for people suffering from varying loneliness before and during the pandemic rather than adopting a generalized approach.","Lal, Sumeet, Nguyen, Trinh Xuan Thi, Sulemana, Abdul-Salam, Yuktadatta, Pattaphol, Khan, Mostafa Saidur Rahim, Kadoya, Yoshihiko","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191811248","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(18):11248, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-16","",37676,""
"Physical Activity Levels and Psychological Well-Being during COVID-19 Lockdown among University Students and Employees","During the lockdown for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), entire populations were instructed to live in home confinement.

The international Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and the short version of the Psychological General Well-Being Index (PGWBI-S) were used. The lockdown had a negative effect on PA levels, with students exhibiting the greatest decrease (~34%;p &#706;0.001) compared to employees (~24%;p &#706;0.01). The analysis showed a greater change in PA behavior before and during the lockdown in highly active student participants (5750 vs. 5141 MET min/week;p &lt; 0.05). Additionally, the psychological assessment revealed a lower score in students compared to employees in the male (70.1 vs. 82.6) and female groups (60.2 vs. 79.6). Moreover, the results revealed an influence of sex, with only the female students exhibiting a state of distress.

"Physical Activity and Mental Health Declined during the Time of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Narrative Literature Review","(1) Introduction: Mental health (MH) and physical activity (PA) share a bi-directional relationship, but most studies report MH as the outcome. With diminishing pandemic-related MH, this review examines the impact of diminished MH on PA. (2) Methods: This narrative literature review included 19 empirical studies published since the COVID-19 pandemic. Electronic databases such as MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL were searched for English language articles in peer-reviewed journals using equivalent index terms: 'anxiety';, 'depression';, 'stress';, 'mental health';, 'exercise';, 'activity';, 'COVID-19';, 'coronavirus';, and '2019 pandemic';. The search reviewed 187 articles with double-rater reliability using Covidence. A total of 19 articles met the inclusion criteria. (3) Results: MH themes that impacted PA were depression and/or anxiety (n = 17), one of which identified inadequate coping and excessive pandemic stress (n = 2). In addition, women are more likely to suffer diminished MH and reduced PA throughout the pandemic. (4) Conclusion: Current research suggests that individuals with pre-pandemic MH episodes are correlated with more effective coping skills and fewer adverse effects from COVID-19 than expected. As we emerge from this pandemic, equipping all individuals, especially women, with positive coping strategies may accelerate a seamless return to PA.","Amo, Christina, Almansour, Najla, Harvey, Idethia S.","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191811230","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(18):11230, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-16","",37678,""
"How Do Perceived Changes in Child and Adolescent Activities Relate to Perceptions of Health during COVID-19? Exploring Heterogeneity during the Pandemic","COVID-19 affected child/adolescent activities (e.g., extra-curricular, screen time), along with physical health (PH) and mental health (MH);however, less is known about the relationship between changes in activities and PH and MH in the United States and how these relationships vary by race/ethnicity. To address this gap, data were used from a national survey (Socio-Economic Impacts of COVID-19 Survey) administered May&ndash;June 2021 (n = 853). Multinomial logistic regression explored changes in outdoor, school, extracurricular, friend, and screen time activities with changes in PH and MH;interactions explored moderation by race/ethnicity. Results showed increases in outdoor (RRR 2.36, p = 0.003), school (RRR 3.07, p &lt; 0.001), and extracurricular activities (RRR 3.05, p &lt; 0.001), which were associated with increases in chances of better PH. Better MH was more likely for children/adolescents where friend activities (RRR 3.34, p &lt; 0.001) and extracurriculars (RRR 4.48, p &lt; 0.001) increased. Except for extracurriculars, heterogeneous relationships were observed (e.g., increases and decreases in activities were simultaneously related to better and worse health). The relationship between outdoor activities and screen time with health were moderated by race/ethnicity. Findings support facilitating outdoor, school, extracurricular, and friend activities, which were positively related to health.

"Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on a Rural Opioid Support Services Program","During 2020, Kentucky saw the third highest increase in overdose deaths in the U.S. Employment issues, inadequate housing, transportation problems, and childcare needs present barriers to accessing treatment in rural areas. These barriers and others (e.g., technology) arose during the pandemic negatively affecting individuals in recovery and service providers as they adjusted services to provide primarily telehealth and remote services. This study examines the impact of COVID-19 in its early stages on an opioid use disorder (OUD) support services program in a nonprofit located in rural eastern Kentucky, part of the central Appalachia region. A qualitative design was applied, employing semi-structured interviews in early fall 2020. Participants were associated with one OUD support services program, including service recipients, program coordinators, and business vendors. Guided by the Social Determinants of Health framework, two-cycle coding&ndash;descriptive coding and pattern coding&ndash;was utilized. Codes were sorted into three patterns: changes to daily life;financial impacts;and service access and provision. Overall, early stages of COVID-19 brought increased stress for individuals in recovery, as they were taking on more responsibility and navigating a changing environment. Coordinators were under pressure to provide services in a safe, timely manner. Vendors vocalized their struggles and successes related to finances. These findings can help organizations make realistic adjustments and policymakers set reasonable expectations and consider additional financial support.","Walters, Jayme E.; Jones, Aubrey E.; Brown, Aaron R.; Wallis, Dorothy","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191811164","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(18):11164, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-16","",37680,""

The weekly Google Trends score for the six search terms, thus, mirroring Web popularity and probable prevalence, was compared between the two search periods, 'pre-COVID';(between July 2017 and February 2020) and COVID (between March 2020 and July 2022), thus, reflecting the volume of searches before and during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The median weekly Google Trends score of all these search terms significantly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, i.e., anxiety by 22%, distress by 13%, fear by 9%, rumination by 18%, stress by 13% and worry by 20%. With variable strength, the weekly Google Trends scores of each search term were found to be significantly associated (all p &lt; 0.001).

"Dispositional Resilience as Mediator in Psychological Stress on Healthcare Workers: A Multi-Group Analysis of Frontline and Non-Frontline Workers","The experiences of healthcare workers (HCWs) during COVID-19 have been characterized by psychological symptoms such as stress, anxiety and depression, compassion fatigue and post-traumatic stress, which are long-lasting. The general picture of HCWs, especially frontline workers, is that of a physically and psychologically exhausted group. The aim of the study was to examine the potential mediating role of dispositional resilience in the impact of depression, anxiety and stress on professional quality of life among HCWs during the pandemic period. We also investigated possible differences between the frontline and non-frontline HCWs. The study enrolled 487 participants from public Italian hospitals. The variables of stress and anxiety predicted all factors related to professional quality of life, against depression which positively predicted only burnout and secondary traumatic Stress. Resilience was an important mediator in all these paths and the multigroup analysis suggested statistically significant differences between frontline and non-frontline HCWs. Results emphasised the importance of caring and concern for frontline HCWs to improve their quality of life, satisfaction and have positive impacts on the quality of service and care provided.

"Association between SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Neuropsychiatric Manifestations","Coronaviruses are neurotropic viruses capable of entering the brain through various mechanisms and generating an important inflammatory response that is capable of triggering neuropsychiatric manifestations. Several reports describe the appearance of different conditions, such as sleep problems, anxiety and depression disorders, acute psychotic disorders, encephalitis, and delirium, among others, associated with COVID-19 infection. We performed a literature review in PubMed, Springer, Nature, MDPI, and other scientific journals on the relationship between COVID-19 infection with the development and aggravation of neuropsychiatric manifestations explained by molecular changes secondary to SARS-CoV-2 where it was found that there is a relationship between the virus and the development of these manifestations. Prospective neuropsychiatric follow-up of people exposed to SARS-CoV-2 at different points in their lives, as well as their neuroimmunological status, is necessary to fully understand the long-term impact of COVID-19 on mental health. It is required to identify the risk of developing neuropsychiatric problems due to COVID-19 infection to provide better medical care from a multidisciplinary team and improve the prognosis of these patients as well as the treatment of long-term sequelae.","Vidrio, Aranza Llorente, Nicolini, Humberto, Zarate, Carlos Tovilla, Castro, Thelma Gonzales, Rojop, Isela JuÃ¡rez, MagaÃ±a, Jaime MartÃ­nez, LÃ³pez, NicolÃ¡s MartÃ­nez, Mendoza, Alma Delia Genis","https://doi.org/10.3390/covid2090094","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: COVID; 2(9):1270-1286, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-16","",37683,""
"Capturing the Complexity of COVID-19 Research: Trend Analysis in the First Two Years of the Pandemic Using a Bayesian Probabilistic Model and Machine Learning Tools","Publications about COVID-19 have occurred practically since the first outbreak. Therefore, studying the evolution of the scientific publications on COVID-19 can provide us with information on current research trends and can help researchers and policymakers to form a structured view of the existing evidence base of COVID-19 and provide new research directions. This growth rate was so impressive that the need for updated information and research tools become essential to mitigate the spread of the virus. Therefore, traditional bibliographic research procedures, such as systematic reviews and meta-analyses, become time-consuming and limited in focus. This study aims to study the scientific literature on COVID-19 that has been published since its inception and to map the evolution of research in the time range between February 2020 and January 2022. The search was carried out in PubMed extracting topics using text mining and latent Dirichlet allocation modeling and a trend analysis was performed to analyze the temporal variations in research for each topic. We also study the distribution of these topics between countries and journals. 126,334 peer-reviewed articles and 16 research topics were identified. The countries with the highest number of scientific publications were the United States of America, China, Italy, United Kingdom, and India, respectively. Regarding the distribution of the number of publications by journal, we found that of the 7040 sources Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health, PLoS ONE, and Sci. Rep., were the ones that led the publications on COVID-19. We discovered a growing tendency for eight topics (Prevention, Telemedicine, Vaccine immunity, Machine learning, Academic parameters, Risk factors and morbidity and mortality, Information synthesis methods, and Mental health), a falling trend for five of them (Epidemiology, COVID-19 pathology complications, Diagnostic test, Etiopathogenesis, and Political and health factors), and the rest varied throughout time with no discernible patterns (Therapeutics, Pharmacological and therapeutic target, and Repercussion health services).","De La Hoz-M, Javier, Mendes, Susana, FernÃ¡ndez-GÃ³mez, MarÃ­a JosÃ©, GonzÃ¡lez Silva, Yolanda","https://doi.org/10.3390/computation10090156","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Computation; 10(9):156, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-16","",37684,""

"Moderators of pre-post changes in school-based mental health promotion: Psychological stress symptom decrease for adolescents with mental health problems, knowledge increase for all","Background: School-based mental health promotion aims to strengthen mental health and reduce stress. Results on the effectiveness of such programs are heterogeneous. This study realized a school-based mental health promotion program (StresSOS) for all students and aimed to identify moderators (mental health status, gender, grade level) of pre- to post-changes in stress symptoms and knowledge. Methods: Participants were N = 510 adolescents (from 29 classes;46.7% female) aged 12â€“18 years (M = 13.88, SD = 1.00;grade levels 7â€“10). They were without mental health problems (65.9%), at risk for mental health problems (21.6%), or with mental health problems (12.5%) and participated in a 90 min per week face-to-face training with 8 sessions in class at school. Demographic variables, mental health status, stress symptoms, and knowledge about stress and mental health were collected at baseline. Program acceptance, stress symptoms, and knowledge were collected post-intervention. Multilevel mixed effects models were conducted with the fixed effects time (within factor), mental health status, gender, and grade level (between factors). Random effects for students within classes were included. Results: In the pre-post comparison, mental health status moderated the changes on psychological stress symptoms (p &lt; 0.05). In adolescents with mental health problems the largest reduction in stress symptoms was observed between pre- and post-assessment. Gender and grade level were less relevant. For all adolescents knowledge gains were revealed (p &lt; 0.001). Program acceptance was moderated by mental health status and grade level (p &lt; 0.01). Mentally healthy adolescents and within the group of adolescents at-risk or with mental health problems, especially younger students (7th/8th grade), rated program acceptance higher. Conclusion: Psychological stress symptoms decreased among adolescents with mental health problems and not among adolescents at risk for or without mental health problems. Mental health-related knowledge increased for all adolescents. The results add to knowledge on school-based mental health intervention research and practice. Its implications for different prevention strategies (universal, selective or a combination of both) are discussed.","Lehner, L.; GillÃ©, V.; Baldofski, S.; Bauer, S.; Becker, K.; Diestelkamp, S.; Kaess, M.; KrÃ¤mer, J.; Lustig, S.; Moessner, M.; Rummel-Kluge, C.; Thomasius, R.; Eschenbeck, H.","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.899185","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Frontiers in Psychiatry; 13, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-16","",37686,""
"Psychosocial Impact of Lockdown on Children due to COVID-19: A Cross-Sectional Study","Background: Quarantine measures during the COVID-19 lockdown had a negative impact on childrenâ€™s psychology and development. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the psychological impact of quarantine on children due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia and to assess types of reported child maltreatment before and after the pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional survey among parents was performed along with a retrospective data review for anonymized data from the National Family Safety Program, Saudi Arabia. 436 children participated in this survey during June-November 2020. Results: The percentage of fathers with an organic or psychological illness in the children with elevated anxiety levels is 18.5% (p-value = 0.019). The anxiety level of the participants was assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7). Based on the scores, 10.1% had severe anxiety. The depression level of the participants was assessed using Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Based on the scores, 4.4% had severe depression. The anxiety level of the children was assessed using Spence Childrenâ€™s Anxiety Scale â€“ Parent (SCAS-Parent). Based on the overall score, 28.1% of the children had elevated anxiety levels. The anxiety level was elevated in a panic attack and agoraphobia for 36.8% of the kids, in separation anxiety for 26.8%, in physical injury fears for 35.1%, in social phobia for 19%, in obsessive-compulsive for 25.1%, and in generalized anxiety disorder/overanxious for 27.3%. Conclusion: Quarantine and lockdown during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic have had a negative impact and many adverse effects on the mental and intellectual development of children.

"The effectivity of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy on Gaming Disorder patients in an outpatient setting: Experience of a developing country","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increase in the use of the internet in the community, especially online games, increasing the risk of addiction. According to our research, the prevalence of internet addiction in Indonesian adolescents and adults was 19% and 15% in 2020. 30% of teenagers who started as regular online gamers were developing to be addicts. Currently, there are no specific regulations for online games in Indonesia while parents seek professional help. Therefore, Indonesia's national referral hospital has developed a behavioural addiction clinic based on CBT modalities and family therapy. Studies on the effectiveness of CBT for adolescents with gaming disorders are strongly needed to standardize internet gaming disorder management. Methods: This research is an experimental study that followed 20 patients given CBT for six months. The CBT was in a modified module adapted to Indonesian culture and performed for 12 sessions. On the sixth month of follow-up, the data analysis found decreased online games addiction scores and duration of online game usage, improvement of psychopathology, family relationships, self-image, and parenting styles. Results: There was a significant change (p&lt;0.05) in the duration of online games usage, online games addiction scores, relationships with family, parenting styles, selfimage, and psychopathology. This modified CBT modality can be used as a national guideline in Indonesia Conclusion: Modified CBT is effective for gaming disorder treatment for adolescents and young adults in Indonesia. This modality could be used as a treatment model for national management in Indonesia's various mental health service centres.","Siste, K.","https://doi.org/10.1556/2006.2022.00700","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Behavioral Addictions; 11:216, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-16","",37688,""
"Integration of geriatric assessment in cancer care for senior adults during COVID-19 pandemic","Background: Older patients with cancer are particularly vulnerable, and the risk of mortality and morbidity during this pandemic is high. Comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) helps in predicating toxicity and improve outcomes. SAOP3 is validated geriatric screening tool that can efficiently identify deficits in different GA domains. It was developed to determine when a multidisciplinary team consultation with GA-intervention is required. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of institutional cancer registry. We compared 2 groups of cancer patients = 70 years old who completed SAOP3 questionnaire in the pre-COVID (9/1/2019- 3/10/2020) and during the pandemic period (3/11/2020-12/ 31/2020). Fisher's exact test was used to statistical analysis. Analytical models were adjusted for age, cancer histology, stage, therapy type, and GA variables. Results: 951 patients were included (499 prepandemic, 452 during pandemic). Median age was 76.6 yrs. (range = 71-86). A 50.7% male, 48.3% female and 34% (323) have metastatic disease. The capture and completion rate of SAOP3 were 82% (779) and 86% (817) respectively. There was a significant psychosocial impairment during the pandemic. More patients were feeling depressed 26% (118) during Vs. 3% (15) prior pandemic (P &lt; 0.001). The caregiver availability was different with 47% (212) during pandemic compared to 52% (259) in pre-pandemic (P = 0.0013). There was a statistically significant difference in the fall history with 4% (20) in pre-, in contrast to 10% (45) during pandemic (P = 0.003). There was a numerical difference in the cognitive impairment during the pandemic in compared to the pre-COVID [34% (171), 52% (235) respectively], but it was not statistically significant (P = 0.154). There was no difference observed in nutritional domains between the two groups. Conclusions: Data regarding patients' domains of a CGA are crucial for optimal care. Screening with the SAOP3 questionnaire captured significant changes in CGA domains associated with the pandemic. These findings also suggest that Integration of high-yield brief geriatric screening tools such as SAOP3 is feasible in busy practice during the pandemic. It can help identify specific impairment of older cancer patients and trigger appropriate interventions to improve the quality of life and clinical outcomes.","Al-Jumayli, M.; Vonnes, C.; Sehovic, M.; Extermann, M.","https://doi.org/10.1200/JCO.2022.40.16_suppl.e24027","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Clinical Oncology; 40(16), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-16","",37689,""
"National organization addresses multidisciplinary oncology team burnout and resiliency through multifaceted presidential theme education initiative","Background: The 2021-2022 Association of Community Cancer Centers (ACCC) President's Theme centered on strengthening a work culture that supports professional well-being and workforce resilience. To support this theme and help ensure sustainable high quality cancer care delivery, ACCC -an education and advocacy organization for the multidisciplinary oncology care team (MDT)-designed a multifaceted professional development initiative. Educational interventions were designed to address team member burnout and building resilience, critical issues facing members of today's oncology workforce. Methods: ACCC designed a collaborative and bi-directional peer-support educational initiative to drive the mission of the 2021-2022 ACCC President's Theme. Professional Development opportunities included: 1) Expert-led mindfulness meditation series of 10 guided exercises tailored to help MDT members manage through social, emotional, physical, and mental health challenges. 2) Professional development themed virtual meetings, styled as â€œCoffee Chat Learning Sessions,â€ facilitated by the ACCC President, addressing emergent challenges and opportunities facing MDT members. 3) Podcast series featuring timely topics related to MDT well-being and resiliency amid the COVID-19 Pandemic. Podcast topics include a) The Business Case for Hiring Oncology Social Workers. b) Leading with Gratitude. c) Coping with Pandemic Grief. d) A Summer of Disconnect for Cancer Professionals. e) COVID-19 Self-Care. f) Real-World Lessons from COVID-19. Results: The education initiative reached a diverse cohort of oncology care community members. 76 unique professionals participated in the small group â€œCoffee Chat Learning Sessionsâ€ from 25 states and represented 72 unique cancer care programs, practices, and institutions. The meditation series engaged more than 1,100 users and the podcast series garnered 1,870 learners. The podcast episode titled â€œCOVID-19 Self Careâ€ was the third most accessed ACCC Podcast episode of all time with more than 680 views. Over 2,900 learners accessed and engaged with the ACCC President's Theme resources across the dedicated webpage from March 2021-January 2022. Conclusions: Anecdotal learner feedback has been overwhelmingly positive regarding this professional development educational initiative. In a climate of high burnout and health care worker fatigue, the ACCC 2021-2022 President's Theme Education program has served as a unique lifeline and resource to members of the oncology community to restore and develop resiliency, enhance well-being, and advance professional connections and peer-to-peer support to meet continued challenges.

"Patient-reported distress at a cancer center during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background: Assessments of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) are conducted by health systems to analyze and improve patient-centered care. Numerous studies have shown that the COVID-19 pandemic poses unique stressors for patients with cancer. However, the impact of the pandemic on HRQOL in patients with cancer is unknown. This study investigates change in self-reported global health scores in patients with cancer before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: In this single-institution retrospective cohort study, patients who completed the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) at a comprehensive cancer center before and during the COVID-19 pandemic were identified. Surveys were analyzed to assess change in the PROMIS global mental health (GMH) and global physical health (GPH) scores at different time periods (pre-COVID: 3/1/5/2019-3/ 15/2020, surge1: 6/17/2020-9/7/2020, valley1: 9/8/2020-11/16/2020, surge2: 11/17/2020-3/2/ 2021, and valley2: 3/3/2021-6/15/2021). Results: A total of 29,983 surveys among 7,209 patients were included in the study. Mean GMH scores for patients before the COVID-19 pandemic (50.57) were similar to that during various periods during the pandemic: surge1 (48.82), valley1 (48.93), surge2 (48.68), valley2 (49.19). Mean GPH score was significantly higher pre-COVID (42.46) than during surge1 (36.88), valley1 (36.90), surge2 (37.33) and valley2 (37.14) (Table). During the pandemic, mean GMH (49.00) and GPH (37.37) scores obtained through in-person were similar to mean GMH (48.53) and GPH (36.94) scores obtained through telehealth. Conclusions: In this single institution study, patients with cancer reported stable mental health and deteriorating physical health during the COVID-19 pandemic as indicated by the PROMIS survey.

"Telehealth delivered Tai Chi intervention for managing aromatase inhibitor-induced arthralgia in breast cancer patients: TaiChi4Joint during the COVID-19 pandemic a Pilot study","Background: Estrogen receptor positive breast cancer (BC) is the most common type of breast cancer in postmenopausal women and aromatase inhibitors (AI) are the endocrine therapy of choice recommended for these patients. Up to 50% of those treated with an AI develop Arthralgia often resulting in poor adherence and decreased quality of life. Methods: This is a single arm longitudinal pilot study aiming to evaluate the safety, feasibility, acceptability and potential efficacy of TaiChi4Joint, a remotelydelivered 12-week Tai Chi intervention designed for the relief of AI-induced joint pain. Women diagnosed with stage 0-III BC who have been receiving an AI for at least 2 months and reporting arthralgia with a = 4 score on a 0-10 scale for joint pain were eligible for study enrollment. Participants were encouraged to join Tai Chi classes delivered over ZOOM three times a week for 12 weeks. Program engagement strategies include the use of a private Facebook study group and box.com cloud for archiving live class recordings. The program utilizes Text messaging and emails with periodic positive quotes and evidence based information on Tai Chi for facilitating community bonding and class attendance. Participants were invited to complete the following assessments online at baseline, 1, 2 and 3 months intervals from study enrollment: Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis index (WOMAC), The Australian Canadian Osteoarthritis Hand Index (AUSCAN), Fatigue Symptom Inventory (FSI), Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale (HFRDIS), Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D). Results: 55 eligible patients were invited to participate and 39 consented and completed the baseline assessments. 61% (median) Participants attended the classes, with no Tai Chi related adverse events reported. 22 of the 39 participants completed the 3-month follow up assessments with a 56% retention rate. Study participants reported improvement from baseline compared to 3 month as follows: For BPI (P = .000), AUSCAN pain subscale (P =.000), AUSCAN function subscale for 35 patients (P = .000), WOMAC (P = .000), CES-D (P = 0.001), FSI (P = 0.00) and PSQI (P = .000). However HFRDIS improved in 11 patients (P = 0.00) for the other 22 patients (P = 0.154). Conclusions: The COVID-19 global pandemic has resulted in the need to rethink how mind-body therapies can be delivered. This study demonstrated the feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy of a Telehealth based Tai Chi intervention for reducing AI-induced arthralgia. The intervention decreased patient reported pain, stiffness and improved sleep quality and depressive symptoms.

"Evaluation of social connectedness, loneliness, and anxiety among cancer survivors during the 2020-2021 winter surge of COVID-19 pandemic","Background: Limited research is available about cancer survivors' level of stress, social connectedness and loneliness during the COVID-19 that can put them at increased risk for poor physical and mental health. We estimated relative decreased rate of social connectedness and increased rates of loneliness/ sadness and stress/anxiety among cancer survivors during the 2020-2021 winter surge of COVID- 19 and investigated whether decreased social connectedness is associated with increased feelings of loneliness/sadness and stress/anxiety. Methods: This cross-sectional study used data from Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey COVID-19 Winter 2021 Supplement, nationally representative phone survey of Medicare beneficiaries living in community, conducted in March-April 2021. We included 1,836 respondents who self-reported cancer history (other than skin cancer). Outcomes were self-reported feelings of loneliness/sadness and stress/anxiety over the past 4 months. The independent variable was social connectedness defined as feeling less socially connected to family/friends over the past 4 months. We used weighted descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression adjusting for self-reported socio-demographics (age, sex, race, income), region, metropolitan residency, Medicaid eligibility, living alone, depression, having access to internet and health care. We applied sample weights to account for complex survey design with results generalizable to 9.5 million cancer survivors. Results: Out of 9505626 cancer survivors, 6.8% self-reported as Black, 7.1% Hispanic, 80.4% White, 59% women, 42.7% reported decreased social connectedness, 20.3% increased feeling of loneliness/ sadness, and 40.0% increased feeling of stress/anxiety in the past 4 months. Women had higher rates of reporting increased feelings of loneliness/sadness (12.0% vs. 26.1%, P = &lt;.001), stress/anxiety (30.0% vs. 46.6%, P = &lt;.001), and decreased social connectedness (38.7% vs. 45.5% P =.028) than men in the past 4 months. Among self-reported racial and ethnic groups, Hispanics had the highest rates of reporting increased feelings of loneliness/sadness (31.2% vs. 20.5% of Whites vs. 10.2% of Blacks, P =.008) and stress/anxiety (54.0% vs. 39.4% of Whites vs. 31.2% of Blacks, P =.034). No statistically significant difference was found in social connectedness by self-reported race and ethnicity. Survivors who reported decreased social connectedness had higher odds of feeling more lonely/ sad (adjusted OR = 3.67, 95%CI 2.85-4.72, P = &lt;.001) and more stressed/anxious (adjusted OR = 2.63, 95%CI 2.1- 3.26, p = &lt;.001) over the past 4 months. Conclusions: Increased feelings of loneliness/ sadness and anxiety/stress in the past 4 months were prevalent among cancer survivors.

"A longitudinal study assessing the impact of ongoing COVID-19 pandemic among hematology-oncology trainees","Background: Hematology-Oncology (HO) trainees faced significant challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted by a previous survey (Durani, Urshila, et al. â€œImpact of COVID-19 on Hematology- Oncology Trainees: A Quantitative and Qualitative Assessment.â€ JCO Oncology Practice (2021): OP-21). Despite the positive impact of effective vaccines, the pandemic is still ongoing;thus, the challenges remain. Our aim is to evaluate how well the trainees have adapted to changes in their clinical training environment after the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional internet- based survey (Shih, Grace, et al. â€œThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the education and wellness of US Pediatric Anesthesiology Fellows.â€ Pediatric Anesthesia 31.3 (2021): 268-274) from December 10, 2021, to January 10, 2022, was obtained from the trainees enrolled in Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)-accredited HO fellowship programs in the United States in their fourth (PGY4), fifth (PGY5), and sixth (PGY6) postgraduate year. Results: The survey was completed by 102 trainees. Demographics of the participants are reported in Table. Interestingly, 51% reported an impact of COVD-19 on their employment plans, primarily due to the inability to interview in person (24%, n=23). Trainees experienced several stressors due to the pandemic, including fear of getting sick from a patient (71%) or a coworker (66%). Approximately 27% (n=26) experienced mental health issues requiring additional care. Less than one-third of the trainees were concerned about clinical expertise and procedural skills. Trainees also felt that the change of conference to virtual format impacted their learning activities compared to in-person education (66%, n=64). Most trainees (52%, n=53) reported limited involvement in COVID-related research and journal club education. Most had access to socialization (59%, n=60), virtual office hours (70%, n=72), and telehealth visits (83%, n=85). Female trainees (18%) were more likely to seek mental health care than the male trainees (7.8%) (P=.02). Female trainees (33%) also reported facing more challenges in their employment plans compared to males (16%) (P=.003). Conclusions: Our study highlights the challenges experienced by hematology-oncology trainees with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and reveals the gender gap related to employment plans and seeking mental health care.","Shikdar, S.; Saleem, R.; Alcid, J.; Mukherjee, S.; Hassan, A.; Keshava, V.

"The Recover Study: A Cross-Sectional Examination of the Relationship Between Ontario Parentsâ€™ Resilience and COVID-19-Related Stressors","Resilience, or the ability to bounce back despite facing adversities, may influence parentsâ€™ abilities to handle the multitude of parent-specific COVID-19-related challenges that have faced them. This cross-sectional study examined (1) the relationship between parentsâ€™ resilience and their COVID-19-related family stressors;(2) parentsâ€™ perceptions of their greatest stressors throughout the pandemic;and (3) non-school-related challenges and their resultant impact on parentsâ€™ and children's resilience. Via an online survey, data was collected from 63 parents (Mage = 37.09;82.54% female). A significant relationship was found between parentsâ€™ resilience and both their COVID-19-related stressors and family stressors. Parents described stressors challenging their resilience, including impacts on their mental health, managing occupational and educational responsibilities, social isolation, and economic setbacks, while also noting the impacts of social isolation, missing extracurricular activities, and lacking routines for their children. Overall, Ontario parents high in resilience are likely better positioned to adapt to pandemic-related stressors.","Yates, Julia, Irwin, Jennifer D.","https://doi.org/10.1177/10664807221123550","","Database: PMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: The Family Journal;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-16","",37695,""
"Running on empty: a longitudinal global study of psychological well-being among runners during the COVID-19 pandemic","Objectives: There are indications that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound negative effect on psychological well-being. Here, we investigated this hypothesis using longitudinal data from a large global cohort of runners, providing unprecedented leverage for understanding how the temporal development in the pandemic pressure relates to well-being across countries. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Global. Participants: We used data from the worldwide Garmin-RUNSAFE cohort that recruited runners with a Garmin Connect account, which is used for storing running activities tracked by a Garmin device. A total of 7808 Garmin Connect users from 86 countries participated. Primary and secondary outcome measures: From 1 August 2019 (prepandemic) to 31 December 2020, participants completed surveys every second week that included the five-item WHO Well-Being Index (WHO-5). Pandemic pressure was proxied by the number of COVID-19-related deaths per country, retrieved from the Coronavirus Resource Centre at Johns Hopkins University. Panel data regression including individual- and time-fixed effects was used to study the association between country-level COVID-19-related deaths over the past 14 days and individual-level self-reported well-being over the past 14 days. Results: The 7808 participants completed a total of 125 409 WHO-5 records over the study period. We found a statistically significant inverse relationship between the number of COVID-19-related deaths and the level of psychological well-beingâ€”independent of running activity and running injuries (a reduction of 1.42 WHO-5 points per COVID-19-related death per 10 000 individuals, p&lt;0.001). Conclusions: This study suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative effect on the psychological well-being of the affected populations, which is concerning from a global mental health perspective.","Vistisen, H.

"Attitudes towards coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine and sources of information across diverse ethnic groups in the UK: a qualitative study from June to October 2020","Objectives: Across diverse ethnic groups in the UK, explore attitudes and intentions towards COVID-19 vaccination and sources of COVID-19 information. Design: Remote qualitative interviews and focus groups (FGs) conducted Juneâ€“October 2020 before UK COVID-19 vaccine approval. Data were transcribed and analysed through inductive thematic analysis and mapped to the Theoretical Domains Framework. Setting: England and Wales. Participants: 100 participants from 19 self-identified ethnic groups. Results: Mistrust and doubt were reported across ethnic groups. Many participants shared concerns about perceived lack of information about COVID-19 vaccine safety and efficacy. There were differences within each ethnic group, with factors such as occupation and perceived health status influencing intention to accept a vaccine once made available. Across ethnic groups, participants believed that public contact occupations, older adults and vulnerable groups should be prioritised for vaccination. Perceived risk, social influences, occupation, age, comorbidities and engagement with healthcare influenced participantsâ€™ intentions to accept vaccination once available. All Jewish FG participants intended to accept, while all Traveller FG participants indicated they probably would not.Facilitators to COVID-19 vaccine uptake across ethnic groups included: desire to return to normality and protect health and well-being;perceived higher risk of infection;evidence of vaccine safety and efficacy;vaccine availability and accessibility.COVID-19 information sources were influenced by social factors and included: friends and family;media and news outlets;research literature;and culture and religion. Participants across most different ethnic groups were concerned about misinformation or had negative attitudes towards the media. Conclusions: During vaccination rollout, including boosters, commissioners and providers should provide accurate information, authentic community outreach and use appropriate channels to disseminate information and counter misinformation. Adopting a context-specific approach to vaccine resources, interventions and policies and empowering communities has potential to increase trust in the programme.","Sides, E.; Jones, L.

"Rates, Patterns, and Predictors of Follow-up Care for Adolescents at Risk for Substance Use Disorder in a School-Based Health Center SBIRT Program","Purpose To examine rates, patterns, and predictors of follow-up care for adolescents screened as being at risk for substance use disorder (SUD) in a school-based health center (SBHC) Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) program. Methods Electronic health records were extracted of adolescents who received health care services from one of three high school-based health centers implementing SBIRT. Patterns and predictors of engagement in follow-up care within 8 weeks following the week of a positive SUD risk screen were analyzed using item response theory (IRT) modeling. Results Out of 1,327 adolescents receiving SBHC services, 81.2% completed a health screening questionnaire. Of screened adolescents, 17.7% were positive for SUD risk. Across the 8-week follow-up period, 65.4% of adolescents at risk for SUD received at least one follow-up visit. IRT modeling indicated that high levels of engagement in follow-up care were characterized by contact with a behavioral health care (BHC) provider. The percentage of adolescents having follow-up contact with a BHC provider increased significantly after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Engagement in follow-up care was predicted by risk for depression, history of suicidal behavior, being female, and previous sexual activity. Discussion SBHCs provide a favorable setting for screening and detecting adolescents at risk for SUD. Adolescents at risk for SUD should receive follow-up contact with a BHC provider. Enhanced follow-up engagement efforts may be warranted for adolescents at risk for SUD without risk for depression or suicidal history, as well as for females and those with previous sexual activity.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2022.02.024","20221001","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-16","",37698,""

"The study of the dilemma on the control of COVID-19 spread and face-to-face learning and its trade-off solutions","To control the COVID-19 spread, face-to-face learning has been prohibited. Instead, some of the classes have been canceled and some are being conducted in an e-learning mode. Both teachers and students have encountered difficulties in the unusual and less-effective online learning environment. Particularly, the situation is getting worse from the senior group (university) to junior groups (secondary school, primary school, and kindergarten) as studentsâ€™ maturity levels are closely related to learning. Various research studies and surveys have summarized that the educational standard and learning outcomes are generally lowered during the pandemic. To address the dilemma between health and face-to-face learning, cutting-edge techniques should be introduced to provide trade-off solutions for school management and government. Case studies are discussed to examine the dilemma and trade-off solutions. The pros and cons of the solutions have been summarized. We have highlighted some emergent research directions as future works.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-821318-6.00009-8","20220101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-16","",37701,""

"Seeing One Another: The Creation of The Sawubona Healing Circles","In 2020, The Association of Black Psychologists (ABPsi) drew attention to how the history of racism in the U.S. had created and exacerbated extant medical racial inequities to the detriment of Black people. In recognition that solutions based solely in Western frameworks cannot fully address the mental health needs of Black people, ABPsi began devoting collaborative efforts to develop culturally-grounded healing responses for the unique experiences of race-based invisibility and trauma. Amid the pandemic, people of African-descent also experienced a number of other mass racial traumas, including a wave of widely publicized police violence. Beginning with COVID-19, these intersecting pandemics of racism elucidated the need for healing, particularly culturally-grounding healing. In consultation with the Black Family Summit, ABPsi developed a pilot investigation, the Sawubona Healing Circle (SHC) initiative, which are culturally-grounding healing circles to support Black first-responders. Using an African-centered worldview, the circles recognize and validate the specific constellation of anti- Black traumas and stressors, and equip them with African-centered healing methods. This paper outlines the theory, development, implementation, and initial evaluation of the SHC intervention.","Evan Auguste et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E015E-FFF-13F","20220915","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cultural Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-16","",37703,""
