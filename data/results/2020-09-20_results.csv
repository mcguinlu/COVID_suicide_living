"The conundrum of human immune system â€œsenescenceâ€","There is a great deal of debate on the question of whether or not we know what ageing is (Ref  Cohen et al)  Here, we consider what we believe to be the especially confused and confusing case of the ageing of the human immune system, commonly referred to as â€œimmunosenescenceâ€  But what exactly is meant by this term? It has been used loosely in the literature, resulting in a certain degree of confusion as to its definition and implications  Here, we argue that only those differences in immune parameters between younger and older adults that are associated in some definitive manner with detrimental health outcomes and/or impaired survival prospects should be classed as indicators of immunosenescence in the strictest sense of the word, and that in humans we know remarkably little about their identity  Such biomarkers of immunosenescence may nonetheless indicate beneficial effects in other contexts, consistent with the notion of antagonistic pleiotropy  Identifying what could be true immunosenescence in this respect requires examining: (1) what appears to correlate with age, though generality across human populations is not yet confirmed;(2) what clearly is part of a suite of canonical changes in the immune system that happen with age;(3) which subset of those changes accelerates rather than slows aging;and (4) all changes, potentially population-specific, that accelerate agig  This remains an immense challenge  These questions acquire an added urgency in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, given the clearly greater susceptibility of older adults to COVID-19","Pawelec, Graham; Bronikowski, Anne; Cunnane, Stephen C.; Ferrucci, Luigi; Franceschi, Claudio; FÃ¼lÃ¶p, Tamas; Gaudreau, Pierrette; Gladyshev, Vadim N.; Gonos, Efstathios S.; Gorbunova, Vera; Kennedy, Brian K.; Larbi, Anis; LemaÃ®tre, Jean-FranÃ§ois, Liu; Guang-Hui, Maier; Andrea B.; Morais, JosÃ© A.; NÃ³brega, OtÃ¡vio T.; Moskalev, Alexey; Rikkert, Marcel Olde; Seluanov, Andrei; Senior, Alistair M.; Ukraintseva, Svetlana; Van Haelen, Quentin; Witkowski, Jacek; Cohen, Alan A.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mad.2020.111357","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Mechanisms of Ageing and Development;2020.; Publication details: Mechanisms of Ageing and Development;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-20","",4941,""

"Acute, non-COVID related medical admissions during the first wave of COVID-19: A retrospective comparison of changing patterns of disease","Background: The COVID 19 pandemic was associated with social restrictions in the UK from 16th March 2020. It was unclear if the lockdown period was associated with differences in the case-mix of non-COVID acute medical admissions compared with the previous year. Methods: Retrospective data were collected for 1st to 30th April 2019 and 1st to 30th April 2020 from University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, one of the largest hospitals in the UK with over 2 million patient contacts per year. The latter time period was chosen to coincide with the peak of COVID-19 cases in the West Midlands. All patients admitted under acute medicine during these time periods were included. COVID-19 was confirmed by SARS-Cov-2 swab or a probable case of COVID-19 based on World Health Organization diagnostic parameters. Non-COVID patients were those with a negative SARS-Cov-2 swab and no suspicion of COVID-19. Data was sourced from the UHB in-house electronic health system (EHS). Results: The total number of acute medical admissions fell comparing April 2019 (n=2409) to April 2020 (n=1682). As a proportion of total admissions, those aged under 45 years decreased, while those aged 46 and over did not change. The number of admissions due to psychiatric conditions and overdoses was higher in April 2020 (p < 0.001). When viewed as a proportion of admissions, alcohol-related admissions (p = 0.004), psychiatric conditions and overdoses (p<0.001) increased in April 2020 than in April 2019. The proportion of patients who were in hospital due to falls also increased in April 2020 (p<0.001). In the same period, the absolute number and the proportion of admissions that were due to non-specific chest pain, to musculoskeletal complaints and patients who self-discharged prior to assessment decreased (p=0.02, p=0.01 and p = 0.002 respectively). There were no significant differences in non-COVID-related intensive care admissions or mortality between the same months in the two years. Conclusion: In this large, single-centre study, there was a change in hospitalised case-mix when comparing April 2019 with April 2020: an increase in conditions which potentially reflect social isolation (falls, drug and alcohol misuse and psychiatric illness) and a decrease in conditions which rarely require in-patient hospital treatment (musculoskeletal pain and non-cardiac chest pain) especially among younger adults. These results highlight two areas for further research; the impact of social isolation on health and whether younger adults could be offered alternative health services to avoid potentially unnecessary hospital assessment.","Bridget Riley; Mary Packer; Suzy Gallier; Elizabeth Sapey; Catherine Atkin; Dorothy Ng Hui Lin; Indumathi Venkatachalam; Jay Lim Kheng Sit; Ling Moi Lin; Lynette Oon; Bee Tin Goh; Jean Sim Xiang Ying; Michael Sonntagbauer; Maria JGT Vehreschild; Claudio Conrad; Florian Tran; Philip Rosenstiel; Robert Markewitz; Klaus-Peter Wandinger; Jan Rybniker; Matthias Kochanek; Frank Leypoldt; Oliver A Cornely; Philipp Koehler; Andre Franke; Alexander Scheffold","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.15.20194795","","Database: PREPRINT-MEDRXIV; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-20","",4946,""
"Association among income loss, financial strain and depressive symptoms during COVID-19: evidence from two longitudinal studies","Background. The COVID-19 pandemic has major ramifications for global health and the economy, with growing concerns about economic recession and implications for mental health. Here we investigated the associations between COVID-19 pandemic-related income loss with financial strain and mental health trajectories over a 1-month course. Methods. Two independent studies were conducted in the U.S and in Israel at the beginning of the outbreak (March-April 2020, T1; N = 4 171) and at a 1-month follow-up (T2; N = 1 559). Mixed-effects models were applied to assess associations among COVID-19-related income loss, financial strain, and pandemic-related worries about health, with anxiety and depression, controlling for multiple covariates including pre-COVID-19 income. Findings. In both studies, income loss and financial strain were associated with greater depressive symptoms at T1, above and beyond T1 anxiety, worries about health, and pre-COVID-19 income. Worsening of income loss was associated with exacerbation of depression at T2 in both studies. Worsening of subjective financial strain was associated with exacerbation of depression at T2 in one study (US). Interpretation. Income loss and financial strain were uniquely associated with depressive symptoms and the exacerbation of symptoms over time, above and beyond pandemic-related anxiety. Considering the painful dilemma of lockdown versus reopening, with the tradeoff between public health and economic wellbeing, our findings provide evidence that the economic impact of COVID-19 has negative implications for mental health.

"Longitudinal Mediators of Early Pandemic Distress","Previous cross-national research finds markedly elevated psychological distress during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic; however, distress-elevation among New Zealanders was mild. This trend is puzzling because New Zealand confronted distressing health and economic uncertainties resembling those in other countries. Additionally, New Zealand's March/April 2020 COVID-19 lockdown was among the world's most stringent, requiring strict social isolation with domestic cohabitants for an unspecified period of time and with unknown effectiveness. Here, we use Bayesian multilevel mediation models to systematically test previously theorised mechanisms of health, economic, political, and social concern on pandemic distress in a nationally diverse panel sample during the first 18 days of New Zealand's lockdown against within-participant baselines from the previous year (N = 940). We observe that health concerns were not markedly elevated and that the maintenance of health satisfaction buffered people from greater distress. There was more variation in economic concern; however, sustained satisfaction with standards of living and future security prevented greater distress. Although satisfaction with the government and institutional trust rose precipitously, these gains did not diminish distress. However, distress mitigation occurred from a greater sense of neighbourhood community. Surprisingly, reduced fatigue, a byproduct of the stringent lockdown, proved to be an even more powerful distress buffer; the magnitude of this buffering suggests that fatigue reduction is an important horizon for public mental health research. Finally, most of the distress that New Zealanders experienced can be explained by challenges to personal relationship satisfaction. Overall, these results clarify how mental health was sustained and challenged during a stringent pandemic lockdown across a demographically diverse population, with insights for the present and future pandemics.","Joseph A Bulbulia; Sofia D Piven; Fiona Kate Barlow; Don E.

To address this risk, substantial social support has been provided to relieve ASSs during the COVID-19 outbreak. However, the effectiveness of these support methods for relieving ASSs has not yet been assessed. Objective: The current study sought to examine the underlying mechanisms by which social support relieves ASSs, among primary and secondary school teachers. Method: Â A sample of 751 primary and secondary school teachers was selected to answer self-reported questionnaires regarding ASSs, social support, psychological needs, and the sense of control. Results: Structural equation modelling revealed that social support had a non-significant direct relationship with ASSs, and a significant indirect relationship with reduced ASSs via the needs for autonomy and relatedness, and via the paths from three types of psychological needs to the sense of control. Conclusion: These findings suggest that social support can play a relieving role in ASSs when the support satisfies individualsâ€™ psychological needs and improves their sense of control. To alleviate ASSs among primary and secondary school teachers, more attention should be paid to satisfying their specific psychological needs and improving their sense of control.","Zhou, Xiao; Yao, Benxian","https://doi.org/10.1080/20008198.2020.1779494","","Database: ELSEVIER; Publication details: Eur.

Twenty four people with experience of mental health challenges and people living with disabilities, of various ethnic and racial backgrounds, participated in the sessions.

"Management practices of emergency departments in general hospitals based on blockage of chain of infection during a COVID-19 epidemic","In a Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, management of the emergency department is a difficult task in terms of prevention and control of the disease in general hospitals. On top of meeting urgent needs of patients for medical treatment, the emergency department also has to devote resources into investigation and prevention of COVID-19. At the beginning of the epidemic, with the strategy to intercept the chain of infection, Peking University First Hospital (PKUFH) focused on three important aspects: controlling the source of infection, cutting off the route of transmission, and protecting vulnerable populations, to expeditiously draft scientific and proper management measures for the emergency department, followed by real-time dynamic adjustments based on the development trend of the epidemic. These measures effectively ensured a smooth, orderly and safe operation of the emergency department. As of the writing of this manuscript, there has been no active COVID-19 infection in patients and medical staff in the emergency department, and no infection in patients admitted to PKUFH through the emergency department. This study describes the prevention and control measures in the emergency department of PKUFH during the outbreak of COVID-19, aiming to provide some reference for domestic and international medical institutions.","Hu, Liu, Wang, Xiong, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11739-020-02499-6","20200919","Chain of infection; Coronavirus disease; Coronavirus disease 2019; Emergency department management; General hospitals; Prevention and control measures","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-20","",4952,""

Acute stress and depressive symptoms increased significantly over time as COVID-19 deaths increased across the U.S. Pre-existing mental and physical health diagnoses, daily hours of COVID-19-related media exposure, exposure to conflicting COVID-19 information in media, and secondary stressors were all associated with acute stress and depressive symptoms.

"Telepsychiatry and other cutting edge technologies in Covid-19 pandemic: bridging the distance in mental health assistance","At the end of 2019 a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was identified in China. The high potential of human to human transmission led to subsequent COVID-19 global pandemic. Public health strategies including reduced social contact and lockdown have been adopted in many countries. Nonetheless, social distancing and isolation could also represent risk factors for mental disorders, resulting in loneliness, reduced social support and under-detection of mental health needs. Along with this, social distancing determines a relevant obstacle for direct access to psychiatric care services. The pandemic generates the urgent need for integrating technology into innovative models of mental healthcare. In this paper we discuss the potential role of telepsychiatry and other cutting-edge technologies in the management of mental health assistance. We narratively review the literature to examine advantages and risks related to the extensive application of these new therapeutic settings, along with the possible limitations and ethical concerns. Telemental health services may be particularly feasible and appropriate for the support of patients, family members and health-care providers during this COVID-19 pandemic. The integration of telepsychiatry with other technological innovations (e.g., mobile apps, virtual reality, big data and artificial intelligence) opens up interesting future perspectives for the improvement of mental health assistance. Telepsychiatry is a promising and growing way to deliver mental health services but is still underused. The COVID-19 pandemic may serve as an opportunity to introduce and promote, among numerous mental health professionals, the knowledge of the possibilities offered by the digital era.","Di Carlo, Sociali, Picutti, Pettorruso, Vellante, Verrastro, Martinotti, di Giannantonio","https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.13716","20200918","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-20","",4957,""
"A UK survey of COVID-19 related social support closures and their effects on older people, people with dementia, and carers","The aim of this national survey was to explore the impact of COVID-19 public health measures on access to social support services and the effects of closures of services on the mental well-being of older people and those affected by dementia. A UK-wide online and telephone survey was conducted with older adults, people with dementia, and carers between April and May 2020.The survey captured demographic and postcode data, social support service usage before and after COVID-19 public health measures, current quality of life, depression, and anxiety. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to explore the relationship between social support service variations and anxiety and well-being. 569 participants completed the survey (61 people with dementia, 285 unpaid carers, and 223 older adults). Paired samples t-tests and X<sup>2</sup> -tests showed that the mean hour of weekly social support service usage and the number of people having accessed various services was significantly reduced post COVID-19. Multiple regression analyses showed that higher variations in social support service hours significantly predicted increased levels of anxiety in people with dementia and older adults, and lower levels of mental well-being in unpaid carers and older adults. Being unable to access social support services due to COVID contributed to worse quality of life and anxiety in those affected by dementia and older adults across the UK. Social support services need to be enabled to continue providing support in adapted formats, especially in light of continued public health restrictions for the foreseeable future.

"The psychological impact of fertility treatment suspensions during the COVID-19 pandemic","To examine the psychological impact of fertility treatment suspensions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and to clarify psychosocial predictors of better or worse mental health. 92 women from Canada and the United States (ages 20-45 years) whose fertility treatments had been cancelled were recruited via social media. Participants completed a battery of questionnaires assessing depressive symptoms, perceived mental health impact, and change in quality of life related to treatment suspensions. Potential predictors of psychological outcomes were also examined, including several personality traits, aspects of social support, illness cognitions, and coping strategies. 52% of respondents endorsed clinical levels of depressive symptoms. On a 7-point scale, participants endorsed a significant decline in overall quality of life (M(SD) = -1.3(1.3), p &lt; .0001) as well as a significant decline in mental health related to treatment suspensions on a scale from -5 to +5 (M(SD) = -2.1(2.1), p &lt; .001). Several psychosocial variables were found to positively influence these outcomes: lower levels of defensive pessimism (r = -.25, p &lt; .05), greater infertility acceptance (r = .51, p &lt; .0001), better quality social support (r = .31, p &lt; .01), more social support seeking (r = .35, p &lt; .001) and less avoidance of infertility reminders (r = -.23, p = .029). Fertility treatment suspensions have had a considerable negative impact on women's mental health and quality of life. However, these findings point to several protective psychosocial factors that can be fostered in the future to help women cope.","Gordon, Balsom","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239253","20200918","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-20","",4959,""

Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Significant changes in paranoid ideation (<i>z</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-2.45, <i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01) and interpersonal sensitivity (<i>z</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-2.01, <i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.04) dimensions were noted between those who were and those who were not authorized to leave their homes during quarantine. Similarly, for physical activity, significant changes in depression (<i>z</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-2.15, <i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.03), anxiety (<i>z</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-2.13, <i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.03), interpersonal sensitivity (<i>z</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-1.95, <i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05), and somatization (<i>z</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-2.11, <i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.03) were reported among the insufficiently active group compared with the more physically active group. From multiple regression analysis, variables correlated with general distress were type of quarantine, gender, age, education level, chronic disease, and smoking (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.80). With some variables, leisure-time physical activity domains appeared to be associated only with interpersonal sensitivity and somatization. Having to leave one's home during the outbreak was linked to distress, especially symptoms like suspiciousness, hostility, fearful thoughts of losing autonomy, and feelings of inadequacy, uneasiness, and discomfort during interpersonal interactions. Individuals who were moderately or sufficiently active physically reported less psychological distress.","Sfendla, Hadrya","https://doi.org/10.1089/hs.2020.0062","20200918","COVID-19; Morocco; Pandemic; Psychological distress; Quarantine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-20","",4960,""
"Psychiatric and General Health Effects of COVID-19 Pandemic on Children with Chronic Lung Disease and Parents' Coping Styles","We aim to assess the anxiety and depressive symptoms related to COVID-19 pandemic in children with chronic lung disease and their parents and also to evaluate parents' coping strategies. Parents of children aged 4-18 years, with chronic lung disease (study group n:113) and healthy control (n:108) were enrolled in the study. General Health Questionnaire-12, specific COVID-19 related anxiety questions, The Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced inventory, coronavirus-related psychiatric symptom scale in children - parental form were used to analyze the psychiatric effects of COVID-19. Parents were also asked about how online education affected their family life and children. All data were compared between children/parents in the study and control groups. Risk factors related with anxiety scores of children were also analyzed. Talking about pandemic, concern about coronavirus transmission, taking precaution to prevent coronavirus transmission, making pressure to protect from COVID-19 were significantly higher in parents within the study group (p&lt;0.05). Parents in study group used more problem focused coping than parents in control group (p=0.003). Anxiety symptoms score were higher in children of study group (p=0.007). Parents in study group found online education more useful than parents in control group. Children with chronic lung diseases and their parents have more anxiety due to COVID-19 pandemic and these parents use more mature coping strategies to manage the stress of pandemic. Longitudinal and larger studies should be done in all aspect of online education in children with chronic lung diseases. This article is protected by copyright.

"Promoting Health and Well-Being Through Mobile Health Technology (Roadmap 20) in Family Caregivers and Patients Undergoing Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation: Protocol for the Development of a Mobile Randomized Controlled Trial","Cancer patients who undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are among the most medically fragile patient populations with extreme demands for caregivers. Indeed, with earlier hospital discharges, the demands placed on caregivers continue to intensify. Moreover, an increased number of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantations are being performed worldwide, and this expensive procedure has significant economic consequences. Thus, the health and well-being of family caregivers have attracted widespread attention. Mobile health technology has been shown to deliver flexible, and time- and cost-sparing interventions to support family caregivers across the care trajectory. This protocol aims to leverage technology to deliver a novel caregiver-facing mobile health intervention named Roadmap 2.0. We will evaluate the effectiveness of Roadmap 2.0 in family caregivers of patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The Roadmap 2.0 intervention will consist of a mobile randomized trial comparing a positive psychology intervention arm with a control arm in family caregiver-patient dyads. The primary outcome will be caregiver health-related quality of life, as assessed by the PROMIS Global Health scale at day 120 post-transplant. Secondary outcomes will include other PROMIS caregiver- and patient-reported outcomes, including companionship, self-efficacy for managing symptoms, self-efficacy for managing daily activities, positive affect and well-being, sleep disturbance, depression, and anxiety. Semistructured qualitative interviews will be conducted among participants at the completion of the study. We will also measure objective physiological markers (eg, sleep, activity, heart rate) through wearable wrist sensors and health care utilization data through electronic health records. We plan to enroll 166 family caregiver-patient dyads for the full data analysis. The study has received Institutional Review Board approval as well as Code Review and Information Assurance approval from our health information technology services. Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, the study has been briefly put on hold. However, recruitment began in August 2020. We have converted all recruitment, enrollment, and onboarding processes to be conducted remotely through video telehealth. Consent will be obtained electronically through the Roadmap 2.0 app. This mobile randomized trial will determine if positive psychology-based activities delivered through mobile health technology can improve caregiver health-related quality of life over a 16-week study period. This study will provide additional data on the effects of wearable wrist sensors on caregiver and patient self-report outcomes.

"Competing Roles and Expectations: Preliminary Data from an Agricultural Extension Survey on COVID-19 Impacts","Agricultural Extension professionals play a critical role in outreach and translation of research to practice. Extension has not only been an audience for Agricultural Safety and Health Center work, but also an essential partner in promoting evidence-based farm health and safety in communities. This commentary stems from a collaborative effort among Center leaders across the nation who developed a set of surveys to explore the ways COVID-19 has affected Extension professionals. Preliminary data gathered from across the nation suggest that while many Extension professionals feel prepared to address challenges from the pandemic and are well supported by their State and Center's resources, over half also reported moderate to great difficulty in balancing personal and professional needs and, to a lesser extent, balancing remote work and family needs. Because Extension professionals act as connectors between Agricultural Safety and Health Centers and farmers and their families, they serve in a role similar to first-responders. COVID-19 has exacerbated the potential for anxiety, stress, and other mental health concerns among this group. With COVID-19 numbers rising at an especially fast rate among agricultural workers, it is important to attend to the wellbeing of the professionals who work with them.","Sampson, Mazur, Israel, Galindo, Ward","https://doi.org/10.1080/1059924X.2020.1815619","20200918","COVID-19; Extension; NIOSH; agricultural safety and health; collaboration","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-20","",4963,""
"Social Media Use and Mental Health during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Moderator Role of Disaster Stressor and Mediator Role of Negative Affect","Informed by the differential susceptibility to media effects model (DSMM), the current study aims to investigate associations of COVID-19-related social media use with mental health outcomes and to uncover potential mechanisms underlying the links. A sample of 512 (62.5% women; M<sub>age</sub> Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 22.12Ã‚Â years, SDÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2.47) Chinese college students participated in this study from 24 March to 1 April 2020 via online questionnaire. They completed measures of social media use, the COVID-19 stressor, negative affect, secondary traumatic stress (STS), depression, and anxiety as well as covariates. As expected, results from regression analyses indicated that a higher level of social media use was associated with worse mental health. More exposure to disaster news via social media was associated with greater depression for participants with high (but not low) levels of the disaster stressor. Moreover, path analysis showed negative affect mediated the relationship of social media use and mental health. These findings suggest that the disaster stressor may be a risk factor that amplifies the deleterious impact of social media use on depression. In addition, excessive exposure to disaster on social media may trigger negative affect, which may in turn contribute to mental health problems. Future interventions to improve mental health should consider elements of both disaster stressor and negative affect.","Zhao, Zhou","https://doi.org/10.1111/aphw.12226","20200918","COVID-19; disaster stressor; mental health; negative affect; social media use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-20","",4964,""
"Systematic review of extracellular vesicle-based treatments for lung injury: are EVs a potential therapy for COVID-19?","Severe COVID-19 infection results in bilateral interstitial pneumonia, often leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pulmonary fibrosis in survivors. Most patients with severe COVID-19 infections who died had developed ARDS. Currently, ARDS is treated with supportive measures, but regenerative medicine approaches including extracellular vesicle (EV)-based therapies have shown promise. Herein, we aimed to analyse whether EV-based therapies could be effective in treating severe pulmonary conditions that affect COVID-19 patients and to understand their relevance for an eventual therapeutic application to human patients. Using a defined search strategy, we conducted a systematic review of the literature and found 39 articles (2014-2020) that reported effects of EVs, mainly derived from stem cells, in lung injury models (one large animal study, none in human). EV treatment resulted in: (1) attenuation of inflammation (reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and neutrophil infiltration, M2 macrophage polarization); (2) regeneration of alveolar epithelium (decreased apoptosis and stimulation of surfactant production); (3) repair of microvascular permeability (increased endothelial cell junction proteins); (4) prevention of fibrosis (reduced fibrin production). These effects were mediated by the release of EV cargo and identified factors including miRs-126, -30b-3p, -145, -27a-3p, syndecan-1, hepatocyte growth factor and angiopoietin-1. This review indicates that EV-based therapies hold great potential for COVID-19 related lung injuries as they target multiple pathways and enhance tissue regeneration. However, before translating EV therapies into human clinical trials, efforts should be directed at developing good manufacturing practice solutions for EVs and testing optimal dosage and administration route in large animal models.","Khalaj, Figueira, Antounians, Lauriti, Zani","https://doi.org/10.1080/20013078.2020.1795365","20200919","Exosome; acute lung injury; ali; cell-free; coronavirus; miRNA; microRNA; pandemic; regenerative medicine; sars-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-20","",4965,""
"Role of Environmental Temperature on the Attack rate and Case fatality rate of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic","SARS-CoV-2 is a zoonotic <i>BetacoronavirusÃ‚Â </i>causing the devastating COVID-19 pandemic. More than twelve million COVID-19 cases and 500 thousand fatalities have been reported in 216 countries. Although SARS-CoV-2 originated in China, comparatively fewer people have been affected in other Asian countries than in Europe and the USA.Ã‚Â This study examined the hypothesis that lower temperature may increase the spread of SARS-CoV-2Ã‚Â by comparing attack rate and case fatality rate (until 21 March 2020) to mean temperature inÃ‚Â January-February 2020. The attack rate was highest in Luxembourg followed by Italy and Switzerland. There was a significant (p = 0.02) correlation between decreased attack rate and increased environmental temperature. The case fatality rate was highest in Italy followed by Iran and Spain. There was no significant correlation between the case fatality rate and temperature. This study indicates that lower temperature may increase SARS-CoV-2 transmission (measured as an increased attack rate), but there is no evidence that temperature affects the severity of the diseaseÃ‚Â (measured as case fatality rate). However, there are clearly other factors that affect the transmission of SARS-CoV-2,Ã‚Â and many of these may be sensitive to interventions, e.g. through increased public awarenessÃ‚Â and public health response.","Hassan, El Zowalaty, Khan, Islam, Nayem, JÃƒÂ¤rhult","https://doi.org/10.1080/20008686.2020.1792620","20200919","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; attack rate; case fatality rate; coronaviruses; environmental temperature; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-20","",4966,""
"PTSD and bipolar II disorder in Fukushima disaster relief workers after the 2011 nuclear accident","The global threat posed by the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need to accurately identify the immediate and long-term postdisaster impacts on disaster-relief workers. We examined the case of a local government employee suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and bipolar II disorder following the Great East Japan Earthquake. The complex and harsh experience provoked a hypomanic response such as elated feelings with increased energy, decreased need for sleep and an increase in goal-directed activity, which allowed him to continue working, even though he was adversely affected by the disaster. However, 3.5 years later, when he suffered further psychological damage, his PTSD symptoms became evident. In addition to treating mood disorders, trauma-focused psychotherapy was required for his recovery. Thereafter, we considered the characteristics of mental health problems that emerge in disaster-relief workers, a long time after the disaster, and the conditions and treatments necessary for recovery.","Hori, Takebayashi, Tsubokura, Kim","https://doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2020-236725","20200918","anxiety disorders (including OCD and PTSD); global health; mood disorders (including depression); psychotherapy; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-20","",4967,""
"Coronavirus and Its Implications for Psychiatry: A Rapid Review of the Early Literature","The coronavirus pandemic has changed health care rapidly and dramatically. To provide a critical synthesis of the scientific literature on the pandemic's implications for psychiatric practice. A rapid literature review was undertaken to identify scientific literature linking psychiatric outcomes and practice changes due to coronavirus and the disease it causes (COVID-19). A structured quality assessment was used to assess those articles reporting quantitative data. Fifty articles were identified for inclusion, but only 12 contained original data. Eleven of those twelve were rated as of weak quality. The literature described psychiatric sequelae of the coronavirus and related public health interventions through cross-sectional surveys among different populations; no studies include diagnostic or functional impairment data. Populations at risk include COVID-19 survivors, health care workers, the elderly, and those with preexisting psychiatric disease. Impacts on psychiatric practice were described, again without data on changes to quality or access of care. There is a quickly accumulating body of evidence on the psychiatric implications of coronavirus including psychological effects on the general public and at-risk subgroups. Similarly, psychiatric practice has witnessed substantial adaptation to the pandemic. However, there remain significant gaps in scientific knowledge. We suggest opportunities for consultation-liaison psychiatry to improve the understanding of the relationship between coronavirus and psychiatric care.","Cabrera, Karamsetty, Simpson","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psym.2020.05.018","20200918","COVID-19; anxiety; mental health; patients; psychiatry; telepsychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-20","",4968,""
"The Effect of COVID-19 on Interventional Pain Management Practices: A Physician Burnout Survey","Burnout has been a commonly discussed issue for the past ten years among physicians and other health care workers. A survey of interventional pain physicians published in 2016 reported high levels of emotional exhaustion, often considered the most taxing aspect of burnout. Job dissatisfaction appeared to be the leading agent in the development of burnout in pain medicine physicians in the United States. The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically affected the entire health care workforce and interventional pain management, with other surgical specialties, has been affected significantly. The COVID-19 pandemic has placed several physical and emotional stressors on interventional pain management physicians and this may lead to increased physician burnout. To assess the presence of burnout specific to COVID-19 pandemic among practicing interventional pain physicians. American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) administered a 32 question survey to their members by contacting them via commercially available online marketing company platform. The survey was completed on www.constantcontact.com. Of 179 surveys sent, 100 responses were obtained. The data from the survey demonstrated that 98% of physician practices were affected by COVID and 91% of physicians felt it had a significant financial impact. Sixty seven percent of the physicians responded that in-house billing was responsible for their increased level of burnout, whereas 73% responded that electronic medical records (EMRs) were one of the causes. Overall, 78% were very concerned. Almost all respondents have been affected with a reduction in interventional procedures. 60% had a negative opinion about the future of their practice, whereas 66% were negative about the entire health care industry. The survey included only a small number of member physicians. Consequently, it may not be generalized for other specialties or even pain medicine. However, it does represent the sentiment and present status of interventional pain management. The COVID-19 pandemic has put interventional pain practices throughout the United States under considerable financial and psychological stress. It is essential to quantify the extent of economic loss, offer strategies to actively manage provider practice/wellbeing, and minimize risk to personnel to keep patients safe.","Jha, Shah, Calderon, Soin, Manchikanti","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Effect+of+COVID-19+on+Interventional+Pain+Management+Practices:+A+Physician+Burnout+Survey.","20200918","Interventional pain management; anxiety; burnout; corona COVID 19; depression; financial stress; interventional pain physician","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-20","",4969,""
"Knowledge and Psychological Stress Related to COVID-19 Among Nursing Staff in a Hospital in China: Cross-Sectional Survey Study","Since December 2019, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been rapidly spreading worldwide. Nurses play a key role in fighting this disease and are at risk of COVID-19 infection. Therefore, there is an urgent need to assess the mental health condition of nurses and establish appropriate interventions to reduce the negative psychiatric outcomes of the pandemic. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the knowledge and psychological stress related to COVID-19 among nursing staff and to provide evidence of the need for targeted training and psychological intervention. This cross-sectional web-based survey study was performed in a class 3 grade A general hospital in a southwest province of China from March 1 to March 15, 2020. A self-designed questionnaire with questions about COVID-19-related prevention and control knowledge and the Triage Assessment Form (TAF) were used to assess nursing staff's knowledge of COVID-19 and their degree of psychological stress, respectively. SPSS 23.0 was applied for statistical analysis of the collected data. A total of 979 nurses completed the questionnaire. The results showed that the nursing staff provided the fewest correct answers to questions about continuous viral nucleic acid testing specifications (379/979 correct answers, 38.7%), isolation/discharge criteria (539/979 correct answers, 55.1%), and management measures for patients with suspected symptoms (713/979 correct answers, 72.8%). The median total score of the TAF was 7.0 (IQR 5.0-12.0), and there were statistically significant differences in scores between different nursing roles, years of work experience, and hospital departments (P&lt;.05). This study indicated that nursing staff have insufficient knowledge about COVID-19. Meanwhile, although the psychological damage to nurses during the pandemic was found to be low, nurse managers must continue to monitor the mental health of nursing staff and perform timely interventions.","Huang, Zhao, Li","https://doi.org/10.2196/20606","20200918","COVID-19; knowledge; nursing staff; psychological stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-20","",4970,""

"The Acute Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Childrenâ€™s Mental Health in Southwestern Ontario","Objective: COVID-19 is an unprecedented global crisis. Research is critically needed to identify the acute and long-term impacts of the pandemic to childrenâ€™s mental health including psychosocial factors that predict resilience, recovery, and persistent long-term distress. The present study collected data in June-July 2020 to enumerate the acute impact of the pandemic on childrenâ€™s mental health, including the magnitude and nature of psychiatric and psychological distress in children, and to evaluate social support as a putative psychosocial correlate of childrenâ€™s distress. Method: 190 families of children aged 8 to 13 from the Windsor-Essex region of Southwestern Ontario reported on the impact of the pandemic on childrenâ€™s well-being (e.g., worry, happiness); irritability; social support; and symptoms of anxiety, depressive, and posttraumatic stress disorder at baseline assessment of an ongoing longitudinal study of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Children and parents reported worsened well-being and psychological distress during the pandemic compared to retrospective report of pre-pandemic well-being. Children and parents also reported higher depressive and anxiety symptoms, but fewer PTSD symptoms, compared to epidemiological samples that used the same measures prior to the pandemic. Finally, child-perceived social support from family and friends was associated with lower symptom severity. Conclusions: Study findings indicate broad psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and are consistent with prior research that indicates a protective role of social support to mitigate the negative psychological impact of the pandemic.","Alexandra Mactavish et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4620C-F1D-3F2","20200919","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Clinical Child Psychology; child mental health; anxiety; depression; mental health; children; irritability; covid-19","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-20","",4972,""

Aims: We examined whether suicidal ideation levels among the general population changed owing to the COVID-19 pandemic by tracking individuals between January and April 2020. Method: We used a prospective observational longitudinal design (n = 6,683) to conduct online surveys of the general adult population in Japan before (baseline) and during the pandemic (follow-up). Results: Suicidal ideation levels were significantly lower during than before the pandemic; however, the effect size was small (r = .07). Participants who were younger, with unstable employment, without children, with low income, and receiving psychiatric care were more likely to have higher suicidal ideation levels during the pandemic. Limitations: The dropout rate may have affected the results. COVID-19 cases and deaths in Japan were relatively lower than in other developed countries. Conclusion: Although the short-term impact of COVID-19 on suicidal ideation is limited, relatively young and economically vulnerable individuals are more likely to show exacerbated suicidal ideation during the pandemic.","Hajime Sueki et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460A8-A1E-A07","20200919","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; novel coronavirus; mental health; suicide prevention; suicidal behaviors; public health","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-20","",4973,""
