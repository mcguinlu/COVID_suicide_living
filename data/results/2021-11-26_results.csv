"""One size does not fit all"" - lessons learned from a multiple-methods study of a residentÂ wellness curriculum across sites and specialties","BACKGROUND: There is growing recognition that wellness interventions should occur in context and acknowledge complex contributors to wellbeing, including individual needs, institutional and cultural barriers to wellbeing, as well as systems issues which propagate distress. The authors conducted a multiple-methods study exploring contributors to wellbeing for junior residents in diverse medical environments who participated in a brief resilience and stress-reduction curriculum, the Stress Management and Resiliency Training Program for Residents (SMART-R). METHODS: Using a waitlist-controlled design, the curriculum was implemented for post-graduate year (PGY)-1 or PGY-2 residents in seven residency programs across three sites. Every three months, residents completed surveys, including the Perceived Stress Scale-10, General Self-Efficacy Questionnaire, a mindfulness scale (CAMSR), and a depression screen (PHQ-2). Residents also answered free-text reflection questions about psychological wellbeing and health behaviors. RESULTS: The SMART-R intervention was not significantly associated with decreased perceived stress. Linear regression modeling showed that depression was positively correlated with reported stress levels, while male sex and self-efficacy were negatively correlated with stress. Qualitative analysis elucidated differences in these groups: Residents with lower self-efficacy, those with a positive depression screen, and/or female residents were more likely to describe experiencing lack of control over work. Residents with higher self-efficacy described more positive health behaviors. Residents with a positive depression screen were more self-critical, and more likely to describe negative personal life events. CONCLUSIONS: This curriculum did not significantly modify junior residents' stress. Certain subpopulations experienced greater stress than others (female residents, those with lower self-efficacy, and those with a positive depression screen). Qualitative findings from this study highlight universal stressful experiences early in residency, as well as important differences in experience of the learning environment among subgroups. Tailored wellness interventions that aim to support diverse resident sub-groups may be higher yield than a ""one size fits all"" approach.

"Bullying, Present Romantic Relationship and Depression as Predictive Factors of Non-Suicidal Self-Injury in Adolescent Psychiatric Patients (preprint)","Background: Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), as a major public health issue of high complexity, multifactorial causes and great socioeconomic and family impact, affects China now especially after COVID-19. The aim of this study was to explore the clinical and psychological characteristic in adolescent psychiatric patients with or without NSSI.Methods:: Adolescent psychiatric patients were recruited from psychiatric outpatient and inpatient unit in Guangdong mental Health Center between October and December 2020. NSSI was evaluated by the modified version of Adolescents Self-Harm Scale. Childhood trauma was assessed by the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form (CTQ-SF). Peer bullying experience was evaluated by The Revised Olweus Bully/Victim Questionnaire(BVQ-R). Depression was assessed by the Montgomeryâ€“Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Clinical data were collected from electronic medical record system.Results:: The sample included 157 adolescent psychiatric patients (72.6% female), aged 13-18 years (M=15.39, SD=0.145). NSSI group experienced more peer bullying (t=4.08, P <0.001), more likely to get into romantic relationship currently(<U+03C7>2=5.38, P =0.02), more times of hospitalization (t=0.36, P &lt;0.001), receiving more antipsychotic treatment (t=3.58, P &lt;0.001), benzodiazepine treatment (t=3.46, P <0.001), and mood-stabilizer treatment (<U+03C7>2 =8.53, P &lt;0.001). The significant predictor of NSSI for the last one year included being in romantic relationship currently (OR =4.27, 95% CI=[1.53,11.93]), outpatient (OR=0.38, 95%CI=[0.16,0.88]), BVQ-R total (OR=1.10, 95% CI=[1.02,1.18]),MARDS total (OR= 1.05, 95% CI=[1.01,1.09]), and benzodiazepine PDD/DDD (OR=5.79, 95% CI=[0.99,33.72]).Conclusions:: Adolescent psychiatric patients with NSSI have significantly higher incidences of life event such as peer bulling, childhood trauma experience, and they were more likely to get into a romantic relationship. Meanwhile, patients with NSSI had significantly severe level of depression, being more on benzodiazepine and mood-stabilizer use. This provides a valuable basis for our clinical treatment of adolescent mental patients with NSSI.","Zhang, Ji-Jie, Liu, Yin-Du, Zhang, Hua, Huang, Zhuo-Hui, Wang, Fei, Yang, Jing-JIng, Wang, Shi-Bin, Jia, Fu-Jun, Hou, Cai-Lan","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1080316/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-26","",22794,""
"Translating Imperative Sentences from English into Indonesian: COVID-19 Outbreak Text (preprint)","The imperative sentences in the source language are categorized as imperative instructions. World health organization instructs the general population not to over-take information when reading or searching for information about Corona Virus Disease 2019 because it affects our mentality. It also instructs to avoid using unhelpful coping strategies. The imperative structure rules for English and Indonesian are different. This paper aims to explore the translation techniques used in translating imperative sentences in the â€˜Mental health and psychosocial considerations during the COVID-19 outbreakâ€™ text into Indonesian. The authors use Molina and Albirâ€™s (2002) translation techniques. Data collection is done by taking twenty-three the imperatives in the source language of thirty imperative sentences in the text. The imperative sentences in the SL which have infinitive verbs without to are followed by a noun, verb-ing, past participle, adjective, and second person reflexive pronoun. It is found the suffix -lah to emphasize the verb in the TL. Twenty-two data consist of positive imperative sentences and one negative imperative sentence. The results show that from the twenty-three data, the authors found that there were six translation techniques used by the authors as the translators, namely: compensation, establish equivalent, reduction, transposition, literal, and modulation. The authors used literal translation mostly, and it is done because the starting point of the imperative sentences are at the initial of the sentence and they are readable in the TL. The imperative is the starting of meaning for the source language and the target language. The readers are more acceptable to understand the context of the text. They are expected to implement the instructions in their daily lives.","Sembiring, Milisi, Risnawaty, Siregar, Roswani, Arfanti, Yulia, Nita Wuntu, Ceisy","https://www.google.com/search?q=Translating+Imperative+Sentences+from+English+into+Indonesian:+COVID-19+Outbreak+Text+(preprint)","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-26","",22795,""
"Experiences with Technology and Telehealth Among Women with Perinatal Depression (preprint)","Background: Perinatal depression (PD) affects 10-20% of childbearing women. Telehealth is increasingly utilized for mental health services to increase access to care and overcome COVID-19 pandemic barriers. Womenâ€™s perspectives on telehealth services for PD is unknown, however. This study's primary objective was to obtain the perspectives of women who participated in an 8-week group videoconference intervention for PD symptoms, including how technology impacted their experience. Methods We utilized theoretical sampling and included perinatal women who had completed the 8-week mindfulness-based cognitive-behavioral intervention group. Semi-structured focus groups with four to six women were conducted on a videoconference platform. Primary analysis used grounded theory and a secondary analysis used qualitative description and was conducted by two coding teams. The teams collaborated on the final themes across the analyses. Results Three groups, with a total of 17 participants were conducted. Composition consisted of seven postpartum and ten pregnant women from the 47 total participants. Identified core themes regarding their experiences of the videoconference intervention were: positive experiences, negative experiences, suggestions and ideas, and screening and communication. Conclusion This study provides growing evidence informed by perinatal women of positive experiences with engagement in a videoconference intervention for PD. Telehealth may be a reasonable and acceptable platform to increase access and retention for mental health services in childbearing women. Further, this pilot work showcases videoconferencing delivery for a wide range of effective and affordable mental health services in low-resource communities.","Parameswaran, Uma, Pentecost, Ryoko, Williams, Marcia, Smid, Marcela, Latendresse, Gwen","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-999982/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-26","",22796,""

"Impact of COVID-19 on Nigeria Hospitality Workers: Risk Perception and Depression (preprint)","COVID-19 pandemic has done more harm than good to hospitality sector globally. It crippled all hospitality activities in many countries especially the moment government of many countries restricted social gathering and travels in a bid to curtail the spread of the pandemic. The moment the directive was enforced in Nigeria;hospitality sector began to experience the worst period in their business. Since no official adequate support from the Nigerian government to the hospitality sector to cushion the effect of the COVID-19 on the sector, hospitality owners and administrators had no other option than to either sack, suspend, reduced pay, reduced working days or out rightly refuse to pay salary to their workers throughout the period. With all these predicaments, Many Nigerian hospitality workers either stay at home without income or work without pay. The worst part of it was that despite been at home without income or proper support from their organization, family responsibilities like child and relatives cares never stops. All these negative incidences could aggravate pains and mental stress on Nigeria hospitality workers which could cause depressive symptoms. The research aims at examining the impact of COVID-19 on Nigeria hospitality workers;risk perception and depression. Theories CID induced stress and transactional theory of stress and coping are linked to the study which analyses stress and depressive symptoms on Nigeria hospitality workers during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown and what could have buffered the risk perception and mental stress on the Nigeria hospitality workers are discussed in the research too.

"A repeated-measures study on emotional responses after a year in the pandemic (preprint)","The introduction of COVID-19 lockdown measures and an outlook on return to normality are demanding societal changes. Among the most pressing questions is how individuals adjust to the pandemic. This paper examines the emotional responses to the pandemic in a repeated-measures design. Data (n=1698) were collected in April 2020 (during strict lockdown measures) and in April 2021 (when vaccination programmes gained traction). We asked participants to report their emotions and express these in text data. Statistical tests revealed an average trend towards better adjustment to the pandemic. However, clustering analyses suggested a more complex heterogeneous pattern with a well-coping and a resigning subgroup of participants. Linguistic computational analyses uncovered that topics and n-gram frequencies shifted towards attention to the vaccination programme and away from general worrying. Implications for public mental health efforts in identifying people at heightened risk are discussed.

"Impacts of a delayed and slow-paced vaccination on cases and deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic: a modelling study (preprint)","Background: In Brazil, vaccination has always been cutting across party political and ideological lines, which have delayed its start and brought the whole process into disrepute. Such divergences put the immunisation of the population in the background and create additional hurdles beyond the pandemic, mistrust and scepticism over vaccines.Methods: We conduct a mathematical modelling study to analyse the impacts of late vaccination and with slowly increasing coverage, as well as how harmful it would be if part of the population refused to get vaccinated or missed the second dose. We analyse data from confirmed cases, deaths caused by COVID-19, and vaccination in the state of Rio de Janeiro in the period between March 10, 2020, and October 27, 2021. The classical SIR model is extended to consider the effect of vaccination (efficacy, interval between doses, and vaccination rate) and data sets are regularised using Gaussian Process Regression. The model parameter distributions are estimated using Bayesian inference, aiming to obtain credible intervals in the simulations.Findings: We estimate that if the start of vaccination had been 30 days earlier, combined with efforts to drive vaccination rates up, 31,657 (25,801â€“35,117) deaths could have been averted. Our results also indicate that the slow pace of vaccination and the low demand for the second dose could cause a resurgence of cases as early as 2022. Interpretation : The government's inaction and lack of a strategic plan to fight the pandemic meant that vaccination started late, leading to thousands of deaths that could have been prevented. Even when reaching the expected vaccination coverage for the first dose, it is still challenging to increase adherence to the second dose and maintain a high vaccination rate to avoid new outbreaks.

"Effect of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Program on Mental Health Status Among Medical Student in Palestine During COVID Pandemic (preprint)","Background: Mental illnesses are widely acknowledged among medical students, at the same time, the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant effect on medical students. The main purpose of this study to (1) determine the prevalence of mental disorders among medical students and their associated factors, and (2) to examine the effectiveness of cognitive behaviour therapy on mental health problems among medical students.Methods: Between March and May 2021, we conducted a randomized controlled study on two phases among medical students at An-Najah National University. Data were collected using an online questionnaire and the Arabic version of the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). We also used the MEDAS tool to assess their Mediterranean Diet (MD) adherence. In the second phase, sixty-six student were recruited and assigned randomly to control and intervention groups. Intervention impact was assessed using 12-item General Health Questionnaire at two time points;baseline, and 8 weeks post-intervention. The interventional model used was the cognitive behavioral therapy, and the control group received no treatment.Results: A total of 329 students were included in the analysis of the first phase of the study. Approximately 28% of students had mental health problems. We found a significant relationship between good mental health status with higher level of physical activity level, longer sleeping hours and shorter entertainment time (p&lt; 0.05).

"The benefits and limits of social interactions during COVID-19 lockdown (preprint)","BACKGROUND: Social interactions are vital for our wellbeing, particularly during times of stress. PURPOSE: We investigated the real-time effect of social interactions on changes in stress and mood using an ecological momentary assessment approach in 732 participants during COVID-19 lockdown in spring 2020 and in a subsample of these participants (n= 281) during a further lockdown in winter 2020. METHODS: Participants reported their stress and mood in a smartphone app five times per day for seven days and indicated the nature and frequency of their recent social interactions. RESULTS: Overall, social interactions and their frequency were associated with enhanced momentary mood. In person interactions, but not those that were not in person (e.g., via audio, video, or text), were linked to lower stress, especially if they were with closer others. Individuals scoring high on trait loneliness benefited least from social interactions in terms of their momentary mood, whereas those scoring high on trait depressive symptoms benefited the most. Our key findings replicated across both lockdowns. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the benefits and limits of social interactions for improving momentary mood and stress during psychologically demanding periods and highlight how clinically relevant individual differences can modulate these effects.","Forbes, Paul, Pronizius, Ekaterina, Feneberg, Anja Christine, Nater, Urs, Piperno, Giulio, Silani, Giorgia, Stijovic, Ana, Lamm, Claus","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/ae6t9","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-26","",22803,""
"Research Evaluating Staff Training Online for Resilience (RESTORE):Â  Protocol for a single-arm feasibility study of an online Acceptance and Commitment Therapy intervention to improve staff wellbeing in palliative care settings (preprint)","Background Palliative care workers commonly experience workplace stress and distress. General stressors include unmanageable workloads and staff shortages. Â Stressors specific to palliative care include regular exposure to death, loss and grief.Â  The COVID pandemic exacerbated exhaustion and burnout across the healthcare system, including for those providing palliative care.Â  Evidence based psychological support interventions, tailored to the needs and context of palliative care workers, are needed. Â Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is an established form of cognitive behavioural therapy which uses behavioural psychology, values, acceptance, and mindfulness techniques to improve mental health and wellbeing. ACT is effective in improving workplace wellbeing in many occupational settings. Â Our study examines the acceptability and feasibility of an online ACT-based intervention to improve mental health and wellbeing in staff caring for people with an advanced progressive illness. Methods A single-arm feasibility trial.Â  We will seek to recruit 30 participants to take part in an 8- week online ACT-based intervention, consisting of three synchronous facilitated group sessions and five asynchronous self-directed learning modules.Â  We will use convergent mixed methods to evaluate the feasibility of the intervention. Quantitative feasibility outcomes will include participant recruitment and retention rates, alongside completion rates of measures assessing stress, quality of life, wellbeing, and psychological flexibility. Â Focus groups and interviews will explore participant perspectives on the intervention. We will run a stakeholder workshop to further refine the intervention and identify outcomes for use in a future evaluation. Results We will describe participant perspectives on intervention acceptability, format, content, and perceived impact alongside rates of intervention recruitment, retention, and outcome measure completion. Conclusion We will show whether a brief, online ACT intervention is acceptable to, and feasible for palliative care workers.

"Promoting Sustainable Responses to the US Opioid Epidemic with Community-Academic Partnerships: Qualitative Outcomes from a Statewide Program (preprint)","Background: Drug overdose deaths in the United States have continued to increase at an alarming rateThe United States is facing two devastating public health crisesâ€“ the opioid epidemic and the COVID-19 pandemic. Within this context, one of the most ambitious implementation studies in addiction research is moving forward. Launched in May 2019, the HEALing Communities Study (HCS) was developed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) as part of the Helping to End Addiction Long-termSM Initiative (National Institutes of Health, 2020). The goal for this research was to reduce opioid overdose deaths by 40 % in three years by enhancing and integrating the delivery of multiple evidence-based practices (EBPs) with proven effectiveness in reducing opioid overdose deaths across health care, justice, and community settings. This paper describes the initial vision, goals, and objectives of this initiative;the impact of COVID-19;and the potential for knowledge to be generated from HCS at the intersection of an unrelenting epidemic of opioid misuse and overdoses and the ravishing COVID-19 pandemic.. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration distributed more than $7 billion between January 2016 and June 2020 to address the drug overdose crisis. The funds were intended to support evidence-based responses, including medications for opioid use disorder, and other prevention, treatment and recovery activities. Although the SOR grants support much-needed community level interventions, many of the services they support may not be sustainable.Methods:: This paper describes a statewide effort to support local entities through SAMHSAâ€™s State Opioid Response (SOR) grants in Virginia. Our investigators conducted detailed needs assessment exercises with community agencies across the state, and collaboratively developed requests for proposals (RFPs) to sustain their SOR programs. We distributed the RFPs to prospective partners at universities across the state, and provided all responsive proposals to local agencies who selected the proposal most likely to meet their needs. Our investigators also conducted an inductive, three-phase content analysis approach to examine the RFPs submitted to the VHEOC to identify nominal categories of support requested of the academic partners.Results:: Our investigators received and coded 27 RFPs from ten community agencies representing four of five regions of the state. We identified six nominal categories of academic support with high inter-coder agreement. The six categories of support requested of the academic partners were program development and support, literature review and best practices, outreach and education, data analysis and interpretation, program evaluation, and grant writing assistance. Several RFPs requested up to three categories of support in a single project.Conclusions:: Our analysis of the requests received by the consortium identified several categories of academic support for SOR-grantees addressing the drug overdose crisis. The most common requests related to development and maintenance of supportive collaborations, which existing research has demonstrated is necessary for the long-term sustainability of SOR-funded services. In this way, the academic partners served as a source of support for sustainable SOR-funded programs.

Here we use the national healthcare databases of the US Department of Veterans Affairs to characterize 6-month risks of incident post-acute sequelae in people with breakthrough COVID-19 who survived for at least 30 days after diagnosis. We show that compared to people with no evidence of COVID-19, beyond the first 30 days of illness, people with breakthrough COVID-19 exhibit a higher risk of death and broad array of incident post-acute sequelae in the pulmonary system, as well as extrapulmonary sequelae that include cardiovascular disorders, coagulation disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, general disorders (e.g., fatigue), kidney disorders, mental health disorders, metabolic disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, and neurologic disorders. Our analyses by care setting of the acute phase of the disease show that people who were not hospitalized during the first 30 days after diagnosis with breakthrough COVID-19 exhibit a small but not insignificant increase in risk of death and post-acute sequelae;the risks are further increased in people who were hospitalized during the acute phase of the disease. Our comparative approach shows that people with breakthrough COVID-19 exhibit lower risks of death and post-acute sequelae than people with COVID-19 who were not previously vaccinated for it;and in analyses among individuals who were hospitalized during the acute phase of the disease, people with breakthrough COVID-19 exhibit higher risks of death and post-acute sequelae than people with seasonal influenza. Altogether, our findings show increased risks of death and post-acute sequalae in people with breakthrough COVID-19;the risks are evident among those who were not hospitalized during the acute phase of the disease. Our comparative approach provides context for understanding the risks in relation to COVID-19 without prior vaccination and seasonal influenza. The findings will inform the ongoing effort to optimize strategies for prevention of breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections and will guide development and optimization of post-acute care pathways for people with breakthrough COVID-19.","Al-Aly, Ziyad, Bowe, Benjamin, Xie, Yan","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1062160/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-26","",22806,""
"Family Law Reform: A Needed Cure for the Effects of a Pandemic (preprint)","In the winter of 2020, a rare respiratory disease struck the city of Wuhan, China. Causing severe illness and death, it quickly spread to other parts of the country, and soon throughout the world, devastating nearly two hundred countries. 1Link to the text of the noteLabeled COVID-19, physicians and scientists never before had seen this particular infectious disease. Because COVID-19 is highly contagious and new to the human immune system, all humans are susceptible to becoming ill from it. As of the time of this article being written, there are more than 46.4 million confirmed cases, and COVID-19 has claimed over 1.2 million lives. 4Link to the text of the noteIn the United States and its territories, the death toll has risen to more than 230,000, and there is no end in sight. 5Link to the text of the noteLabeled a pandemic by the World Health Organization, the virus has created universal havoc, changing life as people knew it. To curtail the spread of COVID-19, the United States government first encouraged social distancing, but the disease's easy transferability soon propelled many state and local governments to order non-essential businesses to close and people to stay at home. Stores, bars, restaurants, hair salons, and the like were shut down. Schools closed, and children engaged in online learning. College students left campus to finish semesters online. As life came to a standstill, the stock market plummeted, with the Dow Jones losing hundreds of points, similar in decline to the Great Depression. In a period of three weeks, over sixteen million people were laid off, with no signs of abatement. There is no precedent for such a sudden freeze in economic activity with the thaw date unknown. The closure of non-essential businesses affected both blue-and white-collar workers. Home construction workers could not go into people's homes. White-collar workers ceased going to their offices. Even if workers could work virtually from home, the same level of efficiency was unattainable;children were underfoot, or loved ones were ill. While the virus will eventually lose its herculean strength and restrictions will be lifted, the repercussions from this pandemic will reverberate for a long time, affecting social and economic lives. The advent of COVID-19 has raised many legal issues. This article will concentrate on COVID-19's impact on family law, with a New Jersey emphasis. During the lockdown, matrimonial attorneys were overwhelmed. Daily calls came in from parents who could no longer pay support and from parents who could not see their children as their former spouse feared the child leaving the home. Each state had different measures in place, and matters were resolved case-by-case, judge by judge. 1 New Jersey courts remained open only for emergency matters. If there were any such exigencies - a spouse committing domestic violence, liquidating assets, closing a business - attorneys could no longer automatically file an order to show cause. Instead, attorneys had to get court permission before filing an emergency application. Whether a court would hear a non-emergent matter varied across the counties. Some courts, but not all, handled non-emergent appearances via telephone and remote platforms. And in terms of the usual motion practice, no longer were there return dates. Instead, attorneys were advised that the court would let them know when the motion would be heard. Unfortunately, family courts do not have a disaster plan in place. While parties wait to go to court, domestic violence continues, assets are liquidated, businesses close, and support obligations accrue. COVID-19 continues to cause both economic and non-economic stresses, and family courts provide the stage for many of these to play out. From increases in divorce rates and domestic violence, to a magnified number of requests to modify support or change custody, family law judges will be asked to hear and decide a multitude of cases. This article is organized as follows: Section II discusses how COVID-19 affects several specific areas of family law. Section III then suggests ways in which the legislature should reform family law statutes to address the impact of COVID-19. Finally, Section IV concludes.","Soled, Amy","https://www.google.com/search?q=Family+Law+Reform:+A+Needed+Cure+for+the+Effects+of+a+Pandemic+(preprint)","","Database: SSRN; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-26","",22807,""
"Assessment of dental anxiety levels among dental emergency patients during the COVIDÂ­19 pandemic through the Modified Dental Anxiety Scale","BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVIDÂ­19) continues to affect dental emergency services worldwide. Dental anxiety (DA) is described as a common and distressing problem in terms of oral health maintenance. OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to evaluate DA levels as well as the COVIDÂ­19 fear and perception of control (COVIDÂ­19 FPC) in patients attending dental emergency clinics during the COVIDÂ­19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sociodemographic, dental and medical data was obtained from the participants. A face-to-face questionnaire with questions referring to the reasons for the emergency dental visit, the visual pain scale, the Modified Dental Anxiety Scale (MDAS), and the COVIDÂ­19 Fear and Perception of Control Scale (COVIDÂ­19 FPCS) as well as additional questions concerning bruxism and a previous diagnosis of anxiety/panic attacks or depression was administered. The &#967;2 test was used to analyze the data. RESULTS: A total of 1,439 patients were included in the study. The most common reason for the dental visit was pain (47.5%). The prevalence of DA was 5.1% (74/1,439). A significant association was found between DA and gender (p = 0.020). The incidence of severe pain was higher in patients with DA than in those without DA (p = 0.002). No significant differences in the MDAS scores were found between patients with and without a chronic disease (p = 0.804), with regard to the educational status (p = 0.364), or between the age groups (p = 0.600). The prevalence of a 'strongly agree' response to all questions in COVIDÂ­19 FPCS was higher in patients with DA as compared to those without DA. CONCLUSIONS: Females and patients with severe pain were more likely to exhibit DA. In general, patients with DA strongly agreed with the statements of COVIDÂ­19 FPCS, which may indicate a correlation between the 2 scales.","Berberoglu, Berke; KoÃ§, Nagihan; Boyacioglu, Hatice; AkÃ§iÃ§ek, GÃ¶kÃ§en; IriagaÃ§, Seyda; Dogan, Ã–zlem BÃ¼sra; Ã–zgÃ¼ven, Ayfer; Zengin, Hatice Yagmur; Dural, Sema; Avcu, Nihal","https://dx.doi.org/10.17219/dmp/139042","","Country: PL; POLÃ”NIA; POLAND; POLONIA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Dent Med Probl;2021 Nov 15.; Publication details: Dent Med Probl;2021 Nov 15.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-26","",22808,""
"Therapeutic Journey and Recent Advances in the Synthesis of Coumarin Derivatives","BACKGROUND: Coumarin is an oxygen-containing compound in medicinal chemistry. Coumarin plays an important role in both natural systems like plants and also in synthetic medicinal applications as drug molecules. Many structurally different coumarin compounds were found to show a big range of similarity with the vital molecular targets for their pharmacological action and small modifications in their structures resulted insignificant changes in their biological activities. OBJECTIVE: This review gives detailed information about the studies of the recent advances in various pharmacological aspects of coumarins. METHOD: Various oxygen-containing heterocyclic compounds represented remarkable biological significances. The fused aromatic oxygen-heterocyclic nucleus is able to change its electron density; thus changing the chemical, physical and biological properties respectively due to its multiple binding modes with the receptors, which play crucial role in pharmacological screening of drugs. A number of heterocyclic compounds have been synthesized which have their nucleus derived from various plants and animals. In coumarins, benzene ring is fused with pyrone nucleus which provides stability to the nucleus. Coumarins have shown a wide range of pharmacological activities such as anti-tumour, anti-coagulant, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, antiviral, anti-malarial, anti-HIV and antimicrobial activity etc. Results: Reactive oxygen species like superoxide anion, hydroxyl radical and hydrogen peroxide are a type of unstable molecule that contains oxygen, which reacts with other molecules in the cell during the metabolism process but it may produce cytotoxicity when reactive oxygen species increase in number, by the damage of biological macromolecules. Hydroxyl radical (Ã‹<U+0099>OH), is a strong oxidizing agent and it is responsible for the cytotoxicity by oxygen in different plants, animals and other microbes. coumarin is the oldest and effective compound having antimicrobial activity, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antidepressant activity, analgesic, anticonvulsant activity, etc. Naturally existing coumarin compounds act against SARS-CoV-2 by preventing viral replication through the targeting on active site against the Mpro target protein. CONCLUSION: This review highlights the different biological activities of coumarin derivatives. In this review we provide an updated summary of the researches which are related to recent advances in biological activities of coumarins analogue and their most recent activities against COVID -19. Natural compounds act as a rich resource for novel drug development against various SARS-CoV-2 viral strains including viruses like herpes simplex virus, influenza virus, human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B and C viruses, middle east respiratory syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome.","Sinha, Shweta; Singh, Kuldeep; Ved, Akash; Hasan, Syed Misbahul; Mujeeb, Samar","https://dx.doi.org/10.2174/1389557521666211116120823","","Country: NL; HOLANDA; NETHERLANDS; PAISES BAJOS; THE NETHERLANDS; HOLLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Mini Rev Med Chem;2021 Nov 16.; Publication details: Mini Rev Med Chem;2021 Nov 16.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-26","",22809,""
"Comparing mental health and well-being of US undergraduate and graduate students during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic","Objective: This study explored how COVID-related mental health and well-being varied between undergraduate and graduate students. Relationships with physical health behaviors were also examined. Participants: Undergraduate (n = 897) and graduate (n = 314) students were recruited from three US universities between mid-April and late-May 2020. Methods: Participants in this cross-sectional survey self-reported perceived stress, financial stress, resilience, repetitive negative thinking, mood, anxiety, diet, sleep, and physical activity using validated instruments. Results: Undergraduate students reported more perceived stress, more repetitive negative thinking, less positive mood, and less support from professors than graduate students. Perceived stress, repetitive negative thinking, negative mood, and anxiety increased among all students (p < .05 for all). Correlations between mental health outcomes and physical health behaviors were weak to moderate (r = .08 to .49). Conclusions: College students, particularly undergraduates, perceived negative mental health impacts during COVID.

"A closer look at the high burden of psychiatric disorders among healthcare workers in Egypt during the COVID-19 pandemic","OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to examine the prevalence of psychiatric disorders among Egyptian healthcare workers (HCWs) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: Six databases were searched for relevant papers. The quality of the selected articles was measured using the National Institute of Health quality assessment tool. We used a fixed-effects model when there was no heterogeneity and a random-effects model when there was heterogeneity. RESULTS: After screening 197 records, 10 studies were ultimately included. Anxiety was the most commonly reported psychiatric disorder among HCWs, with a prevalence of 71.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 49.4 to 86.9), followed by stress (66.6%; 95% CI, 47.6 to 81.3), depression (65.5%; 95% CI, 46.9 to 80.3), and insomnia (57.9%; 95% CI, 45.9 to 69.0). As measured using the 21-item Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale, the most common level of severity was moderate for depression (22.5%; 95% CI, 19.8 to 25.5) and stress (14.5%; 95% CI, 8.8 to 22.9), while high-severity anxiety was more common than other levels of severity (28.2%; 95% CI, 3.8 to 79.6). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative effect on Egyptian HCWs' psychological well-being. More psychological support and preventive measures should be implemented to prevent the further development of psychiatric illness among physicians and other HCWs.","El-Qushayri, Amr Ehab; Dahy, Abdullah; Reda, Abdullah; Mahmoud, Mariam Abdelmageed; Mageed, Sarah Abdel; Kamel, Ahmed Mostafa Ahmed; Ghozy, Sherief","https://dx.doi.org/10.4178/epih.e2021045","","Country: KR; CORÃ‰IA DO SUL; SOUTH KOREA; COREA DEL SUR; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Epidemiol Health;43: e2021045, 2021.; Publication details: Epidemiol Health;43: e2021045, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-26","",22811,""

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted through a virtual survey. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) was used. To evaluate associated factors, prevalence ratios (PR) were estimated using Poisson regression with robust variance. RESULTS: A total of 284 surveys were analysed (48.2% women; median age 22 years). Rates of (at least moderate) depression, anxiety and stress were 24.3%, 28.5% and 13.0%, respectively. Adjusted analyses found that having completed fewer years of study, being Catholic and having a chronic disease were associated with a higher rate of anxiety, while being of a younger age was associated with a higher rate of stress. The students reported mostly decreased physical activity, as well as increased Internet and social media use, hours of sleep, hours spent in front of a screen, food intake, and weight, during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: In the context of the pandemic, despite the changes in habits described, rates of depression, anxiety and stress were lower than in previous studies in students in the health sciences. The higher rate of anxiety was associated with being in an earlier academic year, Catholicism and chronic diseases, while the higher rate of stress was associated with being of a younger age.","Sandoval, Kenyo D; Morote-Jayacc, Pilar V; Moreno-Molina, Melissa; Taype-Rondan, Alvaro","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rcp.2021.10.005","","Country: CO; COLÃ”MBIA; COLOMBIA; COLOMBIA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Rev Colomb Psiquiatr;2021 Nov 09.; Publication details: Rev Colomb Psiquiatr;2021 Nov 09.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-26","",22813,""
"[Trauma and resilience associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in the cities of Bafoussam and Dschang in Cameroon]; Traumatisme et rÃ©silience associÃ©s Ã  la pandÃ©mie de la COVID-19Â dans les villes de Bafoussam et de Dschang au Cameroun","Introduction: The emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic in Cameroon, as in Africa and around the world, was marked by a suddenness and unpredictability that fascinated the imagination. The considerable psychic and social repercussions of the pandemic mobilized a significant anguish of death. The sudden onset of the pandemic was followed by spectacular, high-profile deaths that fascinated the imagination, listing it in the order of traumatic events, provoking reactions of astonishment, flight and avoidance. Goal: The objective of this study is to determine the symptomatology of post-traumatic stress disorder, as well as the resilience, associated with the Covid-19 pandemic in the Western Region of Cameroon. Methodology: The research was carried out following the model of general population mental health surveys. The availability of area frames (sampling) made it possible to opt for probabilistic calculations. First and second year master's students in clinical psychology from Dschang University were involved in data collection. They benefited from a two-day seminar on data collection techniques in the general population. The calculated sample size is 384 households. The anticipated response rate, set at 90%, made it possible to increase robustness and to anticipate a total sample of 424 households, spread over 3 districts of Bafoussam and Dschang, according to the choice previously made. The study followed the ethical provisions of the Helsinki Protocol. The data collection tools used are: the Impact of Event Scale-Revised and the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. Results: 409 subjects were recruited, representing a completion rate of 106.5%. 70.7% of subjects exhibited symptoms of PTSD. These symptoms are more often mild (40.9%) or moderate (25.6%). Women are more affected (73.7%) by PTSD than men (67.9%). In addition to sex and age, area of residence and marital status, appear to be significantly associated with symptoms of PTSD: subjects under 35 years of age have a significantly higher prevalence rate than those over 35; the rate of PTSD is significantly higher in subjects living in urban areas than in those living in rural areas; single subjects are more affected by PTSD (40.1%) than married subjects (26.7%). The average score recorded on the CD-RISC is 64.3, the standard deviation is 15.3 and the coefficient of variation is 24%. This average falls into the second quartile of the distribution, indicating average resilience. CD-RISC scores are not affected by gender, age, marital status, level of education, or occupational status. These characteristics are therefore not factors of resilience. Conclusion: The Covid-19 pandemic has had a psychological impact in Cameroon which has made it a major psychosocial stressor. More than 6 in 10 people have symptoms of PTSD. But this symptomatology is often weak or moderate, testifying to an effective resilience, to balance the traumatic effects of the pandemic.","Mboua, Pierre CÃ©lestin; Siakam, Christian; NguÃ©py Keubo, FranÃ§ois Roger","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2021.03.025","","Country: FR; FRANÃ‡A; FRANCE; FRANCIA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Ann Med Psychol (Paris);179(9): 812-817, 2021 Nov.; Publication details: Ann Med Psychol (Paris);179(9): 812-817, 2021 Nov.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-26","",22814,""
"Prevalence of depression, anxiety, and psychological distress in patients with epilepsy during COVID-19: A systematic review","OBJECTIVE: COVID-19 pandemic disease has profound consequences for physical and mental health. In this regard, health care for chronic diseases, especially epilepsy is neglected The purpose of this systematic review study was to investigate the epidemic effect of COVID-19 on increasing the prevalence of mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders in people with epilepsy (PWE). METHODS: We systematically searched MEDLINE, Cochrane, Embase, Web of science, Scopus, and Psych info databases for studies that estimate the prevalence of mental disorders in PWE during the COVID-19 until December 2020. Inclusion criteria included samples of population, with a confirmed diagnosis of epilepsy. RESULTS: Irrespective of PWE or people without epilepsy (PWOE), all experienced stress and anxiety during COVID-19 pandemic. Most of the studies showed that PWE and even PWOE during the pandemic, suffer from depression. The highest rate of depression was attributed to female PWE with financial problems (66.7%) and the lowest rate of depression in PWE was reported in 8.6%. 7.1-71.2% and 28.2% of patients reported sleep disorders and insomnia, respectively. Less than 2% experienced a sleep improvement. LIMITATIONS: Due to a large amount of heterogeneities across the results, we could not evaluate the exact rate of prevalence in spite of using effective measures. CONCLUSIONS: People with epilepsy were considered as a susceptible group to the impact of the pandemic. Therefore, great attention should be paid to PWE and adequate psychological supports provided in this period to relieve or inhibit risks to mental health in PWE.","Tashakori-Miyanroudi, Mahsa; Souresrafil, Aghdas; Hashemi, Paria; Jafar Ehsanzadeh, Seyed; Farrahizadeh, Maryam; Behroozi, Zahra","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2021.108410","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Epilepsy Behav;125: 108410, 2021 Oct 30.; Publication details: Epilepsy Behav;125: 108410, 2021 Oct 30.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-26","",22815,""
"Predicting the Number of Suicides in Japan Using Internet Search Queries: A Vector Autoregression Time Series Model","The number of suicides in Japan increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Predicting the number of suicides is critical to take timely preventive measures. This study aimed to clarify whether the number of suicides can be predicted by suicide-related search queries used before searching for the keyword ""suicide."" This study used the infoveillance approach for suicide in Japan by search trends in search engines. The monthly number of suicides by gender, collected and published by the National Police Agency, was used as an outcome variable. The number of searches by gender with queries associated with ""suicide"" on ""Yahoo! JAPAN Search"" from January 2016 to December 2020 was used as a predictive variable. The following five phrases highly relevant to suicide were used as search terms before searching for the keyword ""suicide,"" and extracted and used for analyses: ""abuse,"" ""work, don't want to go,"" ""company, want to quit,"" ""divorce,"" and ""no money."" The Augmented Dickey-Fuller and Johansen's tests were performed for the original series and to verify the existence of unit roots and cointegration for each variable, respectively. The vector autoregression model was applied to predict the number of suicides. The Breusch-Godfrey Lagrangian multiplier (BG-LM) test, autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity Lagrangian multiplier (ARCH-LM) test, and Jarque-Bera (JB) test were employed to confirm model convergence. In addition, a Granger causality test was performed for each predictive variable. In the original series, unit roots were found in the trend model, whereas in the first-order difference series, both men (minimum tau 3: -9.24, max tau 3: -5.38) and women (minimum tau 3: -9.24, max tau 3: -5.38) had no unit roots for all variables. In Johansen's test, a cointegration relationship was observed among several variables. The queries used in the converged models were ""divorce"" for men (BG-LM test: p = 0.55; ARCH-LM test: p = 0.63; JB test: p = 0.66) and ""no money"" for women (BG-LM test: p = 0.17; ARCH-LM test: p = 0.15; JB test: p = 0.10). In the Granger causality test for each variable, ""divorce"" was significant for both men (F= 3.29, p = 0.041) and women (F = 3.23, p = 0.044). Ã‚Â¬. The number of suicides can be predicted by search queries related to the keyword ""suicide."" Previous studies have reported that financial poverty and divorce are associated with suicide. The results of this study, in which search queries on ""no money"" and ""divorce"" predicted suicide, support the findings of previous studies. Further research on the economic poverty of women and those with complex problems is necessary.","Taira, Hosokawa, Itatani, Fujita","https://doi.org/10.2196/34016","20211125","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-26","",22816,""

Participants had little to moderate worries associated with COVID-19, with the greatest worries about the economy recession, followed by a family member catching COVID-19, lifestyle disruptions, and overwhelmed local hospitals. Bivariate correlation and tobit regression revealed that increases in worries associated with COVID-19 were associated with increased diabetes distress and depressive symptoms. Specifically, worries associated with COVID-19 increased diabetes-specific emotional burden and physician-related and regimen-related distress. Increased diabetes distress and depressive symptoms worsened by COVID-19 may ultimately lead to poor glucose control. Additional assessment by mental health experts should be considered for older adults with T2D during and after infectious disease pandemic.","Kim, Park, Sharp, Quinn, Bronas, Gruss, Fritschi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gerinurse.2021.11.006","20211125","COVID-19; Depression; Diabetes distress; Older adults; Tobit regression; Type 2 diabetes","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-26","",22817,""
"Daily lives of university students in the health area during the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic in Brazil","To determine the main changes that took place in the daily lives of students in the health area during the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic in Brazil. This is a cross-sectional study, carried out from May to June 2020, with 1786 students over 18 years old, regularly enrolled in health courses at higher education institutions in five regions of Brazil. Sampling was by convenience, typified as snowball. In order to collect data, an instrument to describe the sociodemographic profile and the daily lives of students during the pandemic period was used, which was applied via a digital platform on the web. The main changes that took place in the daily lives of academic students in the health area in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic in Brazil are related to lower productivity; difficulty concentrating; increased hours of sleep, use of electro-electronic equipment and weight; poorer quality of food; higher consumption of food, legal and illegal substances and medications (mainly analgesics, anxiolytics and antidepressants); less interest in personal appearance; and greater contact with relatives. Regarding emotional changes, it should be underlined the complaints of anxiety, stress, anguish, confusion, helplessness and depression. During the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic in Brazil, the students in the health area experienced several changes in their daily lives, which deserve special attention from higher education institutions and health systems, envisioning interventions to minimize health risks to this population.","Mata, Pessalacia, Kuznier, Neto, Moura, Santos","https://doi.org/10.17533/udea.iee.v39n3e07","20211125","COVID-19; higher education institutions; students, health occupations","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-26","",22818,""
"Socioeconomic Burdens of the COVID-19 Pandemic on LMIC Populations with Increased HIV Vulnerabilities","To review the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its public health response on key populations at risk of HIV infection, with a focus on sex workers. Since last year several groups have documented how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the livelihoods and health of sex workers. We focus on case studies from Kenya, Ukraine, and India and place these in the broader global context of sex worker communities, drawing on common themes that span geographies. COVID-19-associated lockdowns have significantly disrupted sex work, leading to economic and health challenges for sex workers, ranging from HIV-related services to mental health and exposure to violence. Several adaptations have been undertaken by sex workers and frontline workers, including migration, a move to mobile services, and struggling to find economic supports. Strengthening community-based responses for future pandemics and other shocks is critical to safeguard the health of marginalized populations.","McClarty, Lazarus, Pavlova, Reza-Paul, Balakireva, Kimani, Tarasova, Lorway, Becker, McKinnon","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11904-021-00591-w","20211125","COVID-19; Community responses; HIV; Key populations; Mental health; Violence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-26","",22819,""
"[VKA overdose in Covid-19 infected patients]","During the Covid-19 pandemic, four patients were admitted in a healthcare center. They were treated by vitamin K antagonists (VKA). We observed a substantially increased of their International Normalized Ratio (INR) The mean age of patients was 90 (Ã‚Â± 8). All had different usual long-term therapy treatments but had fixed doses of VKA to reach a stable INR. No change of background treatment were realized. One patient presented cough whereas the three others were asymptomatic. In the pandemic context, a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 was realized for each patients. RT-PCR were all positives and were associated with a substantially increased INR. Mr H. was admitted with an INR of 2.25 and it increased to 5.93 the day after RT-PCR positivity. The VKA treatment was stopped but the INR one day after was 7.89. Mrs J. presented INR value from 1.96 to 4.58, 10 days later. PCR have been realized and VKA treatment was stopped: INR still increased up to 5.85. The INR of Mr R. increased from 1.82 to 8.05, 24Ã‚Â h after positive PCR results. Mrs F. presented a gradually increase of INR from 1.5 to 3.36, 72Ã‚Â h after PCR results three days after VKA discontinuation. Finally, this study suggest a link between the Covid-19 infection and an increased INR. It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces hypercoagulability in severe forms. Inversely, these four cases show a hemorrhagic risk with the elevation of the INR. It could have a risk of overdose when patients treated with VKA and positive to Covid-19. This raises the question of discontinuing VKA and substituting them with another anticoagulant, or performing INR controls more frequently in the context of Covid-19. Moreover, an unexpected increase of INR could lead to realize a Covid-19 RT-PCR in this pandemic context.","Moine, Vasse, Jegaden, Boufares, Besson, Dodille, Jerome, Bonan, Ducasse","https://doi.org/10.1684/pnv.2021.0972","20211125","INR; PCR; SARS-CoV-2; VKA","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-26","",22820,""
"Substance abuse in times of COVID-19 pandemic: a ""perfect storm"" for substance use disorder and mental health?","Our lives and communities have been besieged by COVID-19 for almost two years, and society and its functioning have been turned upside down and upset, through limitations and restrictions aimed at stemming the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Severe levels of anxiety, distress and uncertainty have taken a huge toll on our daily lives from the social, professional and emotional perspectives, but it is still rather unclear how serious an impact the emergency has had on a class of particularly vulnerable individuals: those with substance abuse issues.

"Alleviating mental health disorders through doses of green spaces: an updated review in times of the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted issues due to mental health disorders, in particular the serious consequences derived from lockdown measures. This paper aims to analyse the literature on the potential direct impact of the natural environment on mental health disorders. We have systematically reviewed the studies analysing green spaces and mental health included in this review using PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and Cochrane Library. A retrospective time-frame is considered, covering the COVID-19 pandemic. We have found that exposure to, use and proximity to green spaces have a beneficial impact on mental health among elderly, students and patients with underlying pathologies. However, it has negative effects on the mental health of women and young adults. Exposure to and interaction with the natural environment can improve certain mental health disorders and should be taken into account for strategies and policies related to future threats to public health.","Lanza-LeÃƒÂ³n, Pascual-SÃƒÂ¡ez, Cantarero-Prieto","https://doi.org/10.1080/09603123.2021.2005780","20211125","Natural environment; mental health; systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-26","",22822,""
"""No Man Is an Island"": Perspectives of CHamorus in Guam on COVID-19","Guam is a United States territory situated in the western Pacific Ocean with a multiethnic population numbering approximately 168,000. The CHamorus, who are the Indigenous people of Guam, make up 37%. In this study, we sought to explore CHamorus' perspectives on and experiences of COVID-19. Interviews were conducted with 10 CHamoru adults in June-July 2020 via telephone for a larger study on understanding how the collective history of the CHamoru people is perceived relative to contemporary health beliefs and practices. This study is a secondary data analysis of questions that focused on COVID-19. We used thematic analysis techniques to analyze the data. Three themes were identified: self and other, or ""no man is an island""; trust in government; and focusing on the positives. A cross-cutting theme was commitment to the common welfare of the community through interconnectedness and inafa'maolek (doing good for others). Results indicated that CHamorus recognized a balance between community and individual, the need to protect the vulnerable while also considering personal choice, and the implications of enforced social distancing on community and economic stability.","Joo-Castro, Emerson","https://doi.org/10.1111/phn.13018","20211125","CHamorus; COVID-19; Guam; indigenous groups; transcultural nursing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-26","",22823,""
"Adult mental health and child maltreatment: An ecological study across rural-urban and economic continua with implications for post-pandemic human services","This ecological, county-level, cross-sectional study examines relationships between the mental health of adults (IV) and child maltreatment report rates (DV), as they vary by socioeconomic distress and rurality (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3015 counties), using the most recent available data from several linked sources. In a two-way model, maltreatment reports increased 20.1% for each additional half day of poor mental health in metro counties, 11.7% in nonmetro counties, and 13% in rural counties. Our zero-inflated negative binomial model, moderated by rurality and economic distress, showed a significant relationship between the number of poor mental health days and increased child maltreatment report rates in counties (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°145.52, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001). Investment in prevention and treatment of adult mental health concerns is imperative, especially in light of the increase in mental health problems caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and increased tension within national political debate.

"Age- and gender-related differences in the evolution of psychological and cognitive status after the lockdown for the COVID-19 outbreak: a follow-up study","Individuals experienced psychological symptoms in response to quarantine forÃ‚Â the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the possible effect of age and gender on the evolution of mental health status after the quarantine inÃ‚Â the Italian population and the baseline predictors of post-traumatic stress symptoms. An online follow-up questionnaire including an assessment of depression, anxiety, anger, post-traumatic stress, subjective cognitive failures, resilience, and coping style was completed by participants 2Ã‚Â months after the end of the quarantine (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°758). Individuals experienced psychological symptoms also 2Ã‚Â months after the end of the quarantine. No decrease in depression and anxiety scores emerged, but younger individuals and females experienced more severe symptoms. Anger symptoms decreased in young adults, whereas they increased in older adults. Moreover, individuals reported more cognitive failures at follow-up. No changes were observed in resilience, whereas participants reported adopting fewer coping strategies at follow-up. Finally, post-traumatic stress symptoms 2Ã‚Â months after the end of the lockdown were associated with more severe psychological symptoms and more fear of getting infected at baseline. Our findings demonstrate that the long-term psychological impact and the cognitive consequences of quarantine differ according to age and gender. The identification of more vulnerable groups allows the implementation of interventions to reduce psychological symptoms and the risk for cognitive impairment.","Maggi, Baldassarre, Barbaro, Cavallo, Cropano, Nappo, Santangelo","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10072-021-05768-0","20211125","COVID-19; Cognitive difficulties; Gender; Longitudinal changes; Mental Health; Young adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-26","",22825,""
"Telemental Health Use in the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Scoping Review and Evidence Gap Mapping","<b>Background:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted telemedicine use for mental illness (telemental health). <b>Objective:</b> In the scoping review, we describe the scope and domains of telemental health during the COVID-19 pandemic from the published literature and discuss associated challenges. <b>Methods:</b> PubMed, EMBASE, and the World Health Organization's Global COVID-19 Database were searched up to August 23, 2020 with no restrictions on study design, language, or geographical, following an <i>a priori</i> protocol (https://osf.io/4dxms/). Data were synthesized using descriptive statistics from the peer-reviewed literature and the National Quality Forum's (NQF) framework for telemental health. Sentiment analysis was also used to gauge patient and healthcare provider opinion toward telemental health. <b>Results:</b> After screening, we identified 196 articles, predominantly from high-income countries (36.22%). Most articles were classified as commentaries (51.53%) and discussed telemental health from a management standpoint (86.22%). Conditions commonly treated with telemental health were depression, anxiety, and eating disorders. Where data were available, most articles described telemental health in a home-based setting (use of telemental health at home by patients). Overall sentiment was neutral-to-positive for the individual domains of the NQF framework. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our findings suggest that there was a marked growth in the uptake of telemental health during the pandemic and that telemental health is effective, safe, and will remain in use for the foreseeable future. However, more needs to be done to better understand these findings. Greater investment into human and financial resources, and research should be made by governments, global funding agencies, academia, and other stakeholders, especially in low- and middle- income countries. Uniform guidelines for licensing and credentialing, payment and insurance, and standards of care need to be developed to ensure safe and optimal telemental health delivery. Telemental health education should be incorporated into health professions curricula globally. With rapidly advancing technology and increasing acceptance of interactive online platforms amongst patients and healthcare providers, telemental health can provide sustainable mental healthcare across patient populations. <b>Systematic Review Registration:</b> https://osf.io/4dxms/.","Abraham, Jithesh, Doraiswamy, Al-Khawaga, Mamtani, Cheema","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.748069","20211125","COVID-19; coronavirus disease; mental health; psychiatry; telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-26","",22826,""
"Three-month and six-month outcomes of patients with COVID-19 associated hyperinflammation treated with short-term immunosuppressive therapy: follow-up of the CHIC study","To prospectively investigate differences in medium-term patient-reported outcome measures and objective functional outcome measures, between patients receiving and those not receiving intensive short-term immunosuppressive therapy for coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19)-associated hyperinflammation. Patients previously included in the COVID-19 High-intensity Immunosuppression in Cytokine storm syndrome (CHIC) study who received immunosuppressive treatment versus standard of care for COVID-19-associated hyperinflammation were invited for follow-up at 3 and 6Ã¢â‚¬â€°months after hospitalisation. At both visits, patients were assessed by a pulmonologist, completed quality of life (QoL) questionnaires and performed pulmonary and exercise function tests. At 3Ã¢â‚¬â€°months, patients additionally completed questionnaires on dyspnoea, anxiety, depression and trauma. Outcomes were compared between patients receiving and those not receiving intensive short-term immunosuppressive therapy for COVID-19-associated hyperinflammation. 131 (66.5%) patients survived hospitalisation due to COVID-19-associated hyperinflammation and 118 (90.1%) were included. QoL questionnaires, pulmonary- and exercise function tests showed improvement between 3 and 6 months after discharge, which was similar in both groups. Assessed patients reached levels that were close to levels predicted from the normal population. In contrast, diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide was disturbed in both groups: 69.6% predicted (SD 16.2) and 73.5% predicted (SD 16.5) in control group and treated group, respectively. No differences in medium-term outcomes are demonstrated in survivors of COVID-19-associated hyperinflammation treated or not treated with methylprednisolone with or without tocilizumab during the acute phase.

"Aeromedical Implications of Long-Term COVID-19 Sequelae","<b>BACKGROUND:</b> While many COVID-19 studies focus on acute effects of the infection, few examine the intermediate and long-term sequelae of the illness. Studies have shown that a good portion of patients have chronic effects in several body systems for several months or longer. Such effects can potentially adversely impact pilot performance in flight. We sought to determine the long-term effects of COVID-19 infection, how such effects can affect pilot performance, and how to best evaluate pilots for aeromedical flight clearance.<b>METHODS:</b> We used the PubMed literature search engine to review peer-reviewed articles that focused on the intermediate and long-term effects of COVID-19 infection. Chronic signs and symptoms were subdivided based on the particular body organ system affected. Merging information obtained from case reviews, article reviews, and aeromedical standards, we created a risk stratification guide to assist with the aeromedical disposition of affected pilots.<b>RESULTS:</b> Long-term effects of COVID-19 infection can last for several months or longer. The most common effects are fatigue, weakness, pulmonary diffusion defects, depression, and anxiety.<b>DISCUSSION:</b> This review article focuses on the most common intermediate- and long-term COVID-19 conditions of aeromedical significance and the corresponding course of actions recommended for the aeromedical examiner. Aeromedical evaluation should take into consideration factors related to the pilot, aircraft type, and specific aviation environment. Such evaluation may include diagnostic testing, medical specialist consultation, preflight simulation in an altitude chamber, human centrifuge testing, and/or a flight simulator checkride.<b>Ko SY, Nguyen NK, Lee CL, Lee LA, Nguyen KUT, Lee EC. <i>Aeromedical implications of long-term COVID-19 sequelae</i>.

"COVID-19 Knowledge and Pandemic-Associated Distress among the Hospital Pharmacist Workforce in China","The unprecedented disruption brought about by the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had produced tremendous influence on the practice of pharmacy. Sufficient knowledge of pharmacists was needed to deal with the epidemic situation, however, outbreak also aggravated psychological distress among healthcare professionals. Therefore, this study aimed to determine knowledge about the pandemic and related factors, prevalence and factors associated with psychological distress among hospital pharmacists of Xinjiang Province, China. An anonymous online questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was conducted via WeChat, a popular social media platform in China, during the COVID-19 outbreak from 23th to 27th February 2020. The survey questionnaire consisted of 4 parts including informed consent section, demographic section, knowledge about COVID-19 and assessment of overall mental health through World Health Organization Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20). A score of 8 or above on SRQ-20 was used as cut-off to classify the participant as in psychological distress. SRQ-20 score and related knowledge score were used as dependent variables, demographic characteristics (such as gender, age, monthly income, etc) were used as independent variables, and univariate binary logistic regression was used to screen out the variables with p&lt;0.05. Then, the filtered variables were used as independent variables, multivariate logistic regression models were used to analyze associations with sufficient knowledge of COVID-19 and psychological distress. A total of 365 pharmacists participated in the survey, fewer than half (35.1%, n=128) of pharmacists attained a score of 6 or greater (out of 10) in overall disease knowledge, and most were able to select effective disinfectants and isolation or discharge criteria. In multivariable model, age ages 31-40(OR=3.25, p&lt;0.05), ages 41-50(OR=2.96, p&lt;0.05) vs &gt;50 (referent); primary place of practice in hospitals: drug supply (OR=4.00, p&lt;0.01), inpatient pharmacy(OR=2.06, p&lt;0.01), clinical pharmacy (OR=2.17, p&lt;0.05) vs outpatient pharmacy (referent); monthly income Renminbi (RMB, China's legal currency) 5000-10000 (OR=1.77, p&lt;0.05) vs &lt;5000 (referent); contact with COVID-2019 patients or suspected cases (OR=2.27, p&lt;0.01); access to COVID-19 knowledge remote work+ on-site work(OR=6.07, p&lt;0.05), single on-site work (OR=6.90, p&lt;0.01) vs remote work (referent) were related to better knowledge of COVID-19. Research found that 18.4% of pharmacists surveyed met the SRQ-20 threshold for distress. Self-reported history of mental illness (OR=3.56, p&lt;0.05) and working and living in hospital vs delay in work resumption (OR=2.87, p&lt;0.01) were found to be risk factors of psychological distress. Further training of COVID-19 knowledge was required for pharmacists. As specific pharmacist groups were prone to psychological distress, it was important for individual hospitals and government to consider and identify pharmacists' needs and take steps to meet their needs with regard to pandemic and other work-related distress.","Yang, Ma, Fu, Zhao, Aierken, Teng, Gao","https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2021.343","20211125","Corona Virus Disease 2019; Hospital pharmacist; knowledge; psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-26","",22829,""

"The impact of COVID-19 on people who inject drugs in New York City: increased risk and decreased access to services","While people who inject drugs (PWID) are vulnerable to the adverse outcomes of events like COVID-19, little is known regarding the impact of the current pandemic on PWID. We examine how COVID-19 has affected PWID in New York City across four domains: substance use, risk behaviors, mental health, and service utilization. As part of a randomized trial to improve access to HCV treatment for PWID, we recruited 165 participants. Eligibility criteria included detectable HCV RNA and recent drug injection. The present cross-sectional analysis is based on a subsample of 106 participants. We compared responses between two separate samples: 60 participants interviewed prior to the pandemic (pre-COVID-19 sample) and 46 participants interviewed during the pandemic (COVID-19 sample). We also assessed differences by study group [accessible care (AC) and usual care (UC)]. Compared to the pre-COVID-19 sample, those interviewed during COVID-19 reported higher levels of mental health issues, syringe reuse, and alcohol consumption and greater reductions in syringe-service programs and buprenorphine utilization. In the analysis conducted by study group, the UC group reported significantly higher injection risk behaviors and lower access to buprenorphine treatment during COVID-19, while during the same period, the AC group reported lower levels of substance use and injection risk behaviors. The current study provides insight on how COVID-19 has negatively affected PWID. Placing dispensing machines of harm-reduction supplies in communities where PWID live and increasing secondary exchange, mobile services, and mail delivery of supplies may help maintain access to lifesaving supplies during big events, such as COVID-19.
