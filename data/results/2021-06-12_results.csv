"Men and suicide: Primary care prevention in the era of COVID-19 and beyond","The COVID-19 pandemic has had detrimental effects on mental health, including a predicted increase in suicidality, making suicide prevention a high priority. The rate of men's suicide in the United States is significantly higher than that of women's suicide. This case study considers the role of primary care advanced practice nurses in addressing the risks of suicide in their practice with male patients. It is argued that a gender-sensitive approach is necessary to be effective in male suicide prevention efforts.","Adler","https://doi.org/10.1097/JXX.0000000000000614","20210611","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-12","",14770,""
"Topics and Sentiments in COVID-19 Vaccine-related Discussion on Twitter","Though vaccination is a cornerstone for the prevention of communicable infectious diseases, vaccination has traditionally faced public fears, hesitancy. COVID-19 vaccines are no exception. Social media use plays a role in low acceptance of vaccines. This study will identify the topics and sentiments in the public COVID-19 vaccine-related discussion on social media and discern the salient changes in topics and sentiments over time in order to better understand the public perceptions, concerns, and emotions that may influence the achievement of herd immunity goals. Tweets were downloaded from a large-scale COVID-19 Twitter chatter data set from March 11, 2020, when the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, to January 31, 2020. We used R (The R Foundation) to clean the tweets and retain tweets that contained the following keywords: &quot;vaccination&quot;, &quot;vaccinations&quot;, &quot;vaccine&quot;, &quot;vaccines&quot;, &quot;immunization&quot;, &quot;vaccinate&quot;, and &quot;vaccinated&quot;. The final data set included in the analysis consisted of 1,499,421 unique tweets from 583,499 different users. We used R to perform the latent Dirichlet allocation algorithm for topic modeling as well as the sentiment and emotion analysis using the NRC (National Research Council in Canada) Emotion Lexicon. Topic modeling COVID-19 vaccine tweets yielded 16 topics, which were grouped into 5 overarching themes. Opinions about vaccination (227,840 tweets, 15.2%) was the most tweeted topic and remained the most discussed topic in majority of the time of our examination. Vaccine progress around the world once became the most discussed topic around August 11, 2020 when Russia approved the world's first COVID vaccine. With the advancement of vaccine administration, the topic of instruction on getting vaccines gradually became more salient and leapt to the most discussed topic after the first week of January, 2021. Weekly mean sentiment scores showed that despite fluctuations, in general, the sentiment was increasingly positive. Emotion analysis further showed that trust was the most predominant emotion, followed by anticipation, fear, and sadness etc. Trust reached its peak on November 19, 2020 when Pfizer announced that its vaccine is 90% effective. Public COVID-19 vaccine-related discussion on Twitter was largely driven by major events about COVID-19 vaccines and mirrored the hot news in mainstream media. Discussion also demonstrated a global perspective. The increasingly positive sentiment around COVID-19 vaccines and the dominant emotion of trust shown in the social media discussion may imply a higher COVID-19 vaccine acceptance compared with previous vaccines.","Lyu, Han, Luli","https://doi.org/10.2196/24435","20210611","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-12","",14771,""
"Monitoring beliefs and physiological measures in students at risk for COVID-19 using wearable sensors and smartphone technology: Protocol for a mobile health study","The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted lives significantly and greatly affected an already vulnerable population, college students, in relation to mental health and public safety. Social distancing and isolation have brought about challenges to student's mental health. Mobile health apps and wearable sensors may help to monitor students at risk for COVID-19 and support their mental well-being. Through the use of a wearable sensor and smartphone-based survey completion, this study aimed to monitor students at risk for COVID-19. We conducted a prospective study of students, undergraduate and graduate, at a public university in the Midwest. Students were instructed to download the Fitbit, Social Rhythms, and Roadmap 2.0 apps onto their personal mobile devices (Android or iOS). Subjects consented to provide up to 10 saliva samples during the study period. Surveys were administered through the Roadmap 2.0 app at five timepoints - at baseline, 1-month later, 2-months later, 3-months later, and at study completion. The surveys gathered information regarding demographics, COVID-19 diagnoses and symptoms, and mental health resilience, with the aim of documenting the impact of COVID-19 on the college student population. This study enrolled 2,158 college students between September 2020 and January 2021. Subjects are currently being followed on-study for one academic year. Data collection and analysis are ongoing. This study examined student health and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. It also assessed the feasibility of wearable sensor use and survey completion in a college student population, which may inform the role of our mobile health tools on student health and well-being. Finally, using wearable sensor data, biospecimen collection, and self-reported COVID-19 diagnosis, our results may provide key data towards the development of a model for the early prediction and detection of COVID-19.

"The Implementation of Home Office Work in a Large Psychiatric University Hospital in Switzerland during the Covid-19 Pandemic: A Field Report","During the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, psychiatric hospitals all over the world had to adapt their services to the prevailing governmental regulations. As a consequence, home office (HO) and telepsychiatry boomed. To evaluate the potential of HO use, its adoption, and the association of HO use with employees' mental health in a large Psychiatric University Hospital in Switzerland. Information about the implementation and use of HO were gathered by analyzing routine data and information provided by our IT services. Moreover, a cross-sectional online survey was conducted to assess the employees' attitudes towards the clinic's crisis management during the Covid-19 pandemic in early 2020. Part of this online survey consisted of questions about HO use in the period between March and June 2020, the employees' attitude towards HO implementation and their mental health. Three mental health measures assessed depressive symptoms (PHQ-2), anxiety (GAD-2) and stress factors (stress module of the PHQ-D). 69 of the 200 participating employees reported to work at least partially from home (34.5%). HO use differed significantly across the professional groups (Chi2(16) = 72.72, P = &lt;.001, n = 200). Compared to the cut-off scores of Ã¢â€°Â¥ 3 for the PHQ-2 and the GAD-2, employees experienced no or mild depressive symptoms (M = 0.76, SD = 1.14) and anxiety (M = 0.70, SD = 1.03). The employees reported minor psychosocial stressors (M = 2.83, SD = 2.92). The number of reported stress factors varied significantly across the HO groups (Chi2(4) = 9.72, P = .04). HO appears to be generally feasible in large psychiatric hospitals. However, HO is not equally possible for all professional groups. Professional groups with personal contact to patients and technical or manual tasks have to work onsite. Further evaluation of HO use in psychiatric hospitals up to the development of virtual clinics will follow in future research. In conclusion, the worldwide pandemic served as a stepping stone that should be further used to promote HO use and to take full advantage of HO for employees as well as employers (e.g., to improve employees' work-life balance or to save costs).","KrÃƒÂ¼ckl, Moeller, Gaupp, Meier, Roth, Lang, Huber","https://doi.org/10.2196/28849","20210611","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-12","",14773,""
"Unguided iCBT for depression during the COVID-19 pandemic - Intervention usage and symptom change in a convenience sample compared to guided use in regular care","Internet- and mobile based interventions are most efficacious in the treatment of depression when they involve some form of guidance, but providing guidance requires resources such as trained personnel that might not always be available, e.g. during the lockdown to contain the COVID-19 Pandemic. The current analysis focusses on changes in symptoms of depression in a guided- compared to an unguided sample of patients with depression who registered for an internet-based intervention, the iFightDepression tool, including the extent of intervention use. The objective is to further understand the effect of guidance and adherence on the interventions' potential to induce symptom change. Log data from two convenience samples in German routine care was used to assess symptom change after 6-9 weeks of intervention as well as minimal dose (finishing at least two workshops). A linear regression model with changes in the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) as dependent variable and guidance and minimal dose as well as their interaction as independent variables was specified. Data from a of 1423 people with symptoms of depression (66.1% guided) were included in the current analysis. In the linear regression model predicting symptom change, a significant interaction of guidance and minimal dose revealed a specifically greater improvement for patients who received guidance and also worked with the intervention content (ÃŽÂ² = -1.75, t = -2.37, P = .018), while there was little difference in symptom change due to guidance in the group that did not use the intervention. In this model, the main effect of guidance was only marginally significant (ÃŽÂ² = -0.53, t = -1.78, P = .076). Guidance in internet-based interventions for depression is not only an important factor to facilitate adherence, but seems to further improve the effects for patients adhering to the intervention compared to those who do the same but without guidance.","Oehler, Scholze, Reich, Sander, Hegerl","https://doi.org/10.2196/28321","20210611","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-12","",14774,""

"Effects of respiratory training on pulmonary function, bad mood, and quality of life in patients with COVID-19: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis","At present, whether respiratory training can improve the lung function, quality of life, and mental health of patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still controversial. Therefore, in order to provide new evidence-based medicine for clinical treatment, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of respiratory training in improving lung function, quality of life, and mental health of patients with COVID-19. Relevant publications were searched from clinical trials. Computer was used to retrieve Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials Repositories, PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases. The retrieval time limit was from the establishment of the database to April 2021. Two researchers independently carried out data extraction and literature quality evaluation on the quality and meta-analysis of the included literature was performed with Revman 5.3 software. The results of this meta-analysis will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication. This study will provide reliable evidence-based evidence on the effects of breathing training on lung function, bad mood, and quality of life in patients with COVID-19. Ethical approval was not required for this study. The systematic review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal, presented at conferences, and shared on social media platforms.

"An Environmental Scan of Virtual &quot;Walk-In&quot; Clinics in Canada: Comparative Study","Canada has been slow to implement virtual care relative to other countries. However, in recent years, the availability of on-demand, &quot;walk-in&quot; virtual clinics has increased, with the COVID-19 pandemic contributing to the increased demand and provision of virtual care nationwide. Although virtual care facilitates access to physicians while maintaining physical distancing, there are concerns regarding the continuity and quality of care as well as equitable access. There is a paucity of research documenting the availability of virtual care in Canada, thus hampering the efforts to evaluate the impacts of its relatively rapid emergence on the broader health care system and on individual health. We conducted a national environmental scan to determine the availability and scope of virtual walk-in clinics, cataloging the services they offer and whether they are operating through public or private payment. We developed a power term and implemented a structured Google search to identify relevant clinics. From each clinic meeting our inclusion criteria, we abstracted data on the payment model, region of operation, services offered, and continuity of care. We compared clinics operating under different payment models using Fisher exact tests. We identified 18 virtual walk-in clinics. Of the 18 clinics, 10 (56%) provided some services under provincial public insurance, although 44% (8/18) operated on a fully private payment model while an additional 39% (7/18) charged patients out of pocket for some services. The most common supplemental services offered included dermatology (15/18, 83%), mental health services (14/18, 78%), and sexual health (11/18, 61%). Continuity, information sharing, or communication with the consumers' existing primary care providers were mentioned by 22% (4/18) of the clinics. Virtual walk-in clinics have proliferated; however, concerns about equitable access, continuity of care, and diversion of physician workforce within these models highlight the importance of supporting virtual care options within the context of longitudinal primary care. More research is needed to support quality virtual care and understand its effects on patient and provider experiences and the overall health system utilization and costs.","Matthewman, Spencer, Lavergne, McCracken, Hedden","https://doi.org/10.2196/27259","20210611","Canada; patients; physicians; primary care; virtual care; virtual health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-12","",14777,""
"Telemental health for reaching out to patients in a time of pandemic: Provider survey and systematic review with meta-analysis of patient satisfaction","The COVID-19 pandemic threatens to impact mental health, while disrupting access to care, due to physical distance measures and to the unexpected pressure on public health services. Telemental health (TM) was rapidly implemented to deliver healthcare services. The aims of this study were: i) to present state-of-the-art TM research; ii) to survey mental health providers about care delivery during the pandemic; iii) to assess patient satisfaction with TM. Document clustering was applied to map research topics within TM research. A survey was circulated among mental health providers. Patient satisfaction was investigated through a meta-analysis of studies retrieved from Web of KnowledgeSM and ScopusÃ‚Â® comparing satisfaction scores between TM and face-to-face (FtF) interventions for mental health disorders. Hedges' g was used as effect size measure. Effect sizes were pooled using a random-effect model. Sources of heterogeneity and bias were sought. Evidence about TM has been accumulating since 2000', especially regarding service implementation, depressive/anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, and special populations. Research was concentrated in a few countries. The survey (n=174 respondents from Italy, n=120 international) confirmed that, after the onset of COVID-19 outbreak, there was a massive shift from FtF to TM delivery of care. However, respondents held skeptical views about TM, and did not feel sufficiently trained and satisfied. Meta-analysis of 29 studies (n=2143) showed that patients would be equally satisfied with TM as compared to FtF (Hedges' g=-0,001, 95% CI: -0,116-0,114, p=0,985, Q=43,83, I2=36%, p=0,029), if technology-related issues were minimized. Mental health services equipped with TM will be more able to successfully cope with public health crises. Both providers and patients need to be actively engaged in digitization, to re-shape their reciprocal trust around technological innovations.

"The psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on fertility care: a qualitative systematic review","The objective of this systematic review was to characterise psychological impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic related to fertility care. We conducted a systematic search following PRISMA guidelines of five databases (EMBASE, Medline-OVID, CINAHL, Web of Science, and PsycINFO) from March 17<sup>th</sup> 2020 to April 10<sup>th</sup> 2021. Citing articles were also hand-searched using Scopus. Of the 296 original citations, we included fifteen studies that encompassed 5,851 patients seeking fertility care. Eleven studies only included female participants, while four included both male and female participants. The fifteen studies unanimously concluded that the COVID-19 pandemic caused negative psychological impacts on fertility care. Risk factors included female sex, single marital state, previous ART failure, prior diagnoses of anxiety or depression, and length of time trying to conceive. Specific concerns included the worry and frustration of clinic closure, concerns about pregnancy and COVID-19 infection, and advancing age. There were contrasting beliefs on whether the decision to stop fertility treatments during the COVID-19 pandemic was justified. In addition, we found that many patients preferred to resume fertility treatment, despite anxieties regarding the risk of the COVID-19 virus. We recommend that fertility providers screen patients for risk factors for poor mental health and tailor support for virtual care.","Kirubarajan, Patel, Tsang, Prethipan, Sreeram, Sierra","https://doi.org/10.1080/14647273.2021.1938245","20210611","COVID-19; assisted reproductive technology; fertility; in-vitro fertilization; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-12","",14779,""
"'The world somehow stopped moving': impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescent psychiatric outpatients and the implementation of teletherapy","The COVID-19 pandemic results in disproportional consequences for psychiatric patients. Due to restraints in physical contacts, providers switched from face-to-face contacts to teletherapy, but prior experiences were mostly limited. The study aimed at assessing symptom dynamics, potentially increased adversities and factors influencing a successful transition into teletherapy in adolescent psychiatric outpatients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thirty adolescent psychiatric outpatients participated in an interview-based study. The differential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was measured by integrating patients' and psychiatrists' judgements. Patients who reported deteriorated symptoms and patients who showed (partial) improvement of symptomatology could be separated by feelings of isolation (specific to deterioration) and perceived reduction in school-associated stress (unique to improvement). Patients with worsening symptomatology showed a significantly higher degree of psychosocial disability before lockdown and at the first interview. Patients who deteriorated in their level of psychosocial functioning also reported negatively on teletherapy. These patients were verbally less differentiated concerning emotions and affect, reported introspection and rumination, and stated distinctly lower levels of perceived social support. Concerning adversities, no clear trend could be identified, but some patients reported increased domestic violence and neglect. Patients with a higher degree of psychosocial disability suffer disproportionally from the crisis, so that an assessment of functioning should serve as a triage tool. Also, a screening of the perceived level of social support should be established before offering teletherapy. Additionally, the provision of strategies to enhance verbalisation and differentiation of emotions and affect might be beneficial.","Huscsava, Scharinger, Plener, Kothgassner","https://doi.org/10.1111/camh.12481","20210611","COVID-19; Child and adolescent psychiatry; adolescents; mental health; pandemic; psychiatric disorders; teletherapy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-12","",14780,""
"Weather, mental health, and mobility during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic","During the first United Kingdom wave of the COVID-19 outbreak, the first lockdown was announced on March 23, 2020, with a final easing of the restrictions on July 4, 2020. Among the most important public health costs of lockdown restrictions are the potential adverse effects on mental health and physical activity. Using data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study and Google COVID-19 Mobility Reports we find evidence of reduced park mobility during the initial period of the first UK lockdown and confirm existing evidence of worsening mental health. Linkage with weather data shows that contrary to popular belief, daily or weekly weather conditions do not exacerbate the mental health consequences of the pandemic, as we found no systematic associations during the first lockdown period; on the other hand, we find systematic links between park mobility and weather over the same period.","Burdett, Davillas, Etheridge","https://doi.org/10.1002/hec.4371","20210611","COVID-19; mental health; mobility; weather conditions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-12","",14781,""

"Suicide prevention and COVID-19","Suicide prevention during Covid 19 has become a global priority because the current pandemic has led to societal difficulties threatening the fabric of our lifestyle with increased morbidity and mortality. Modelling studies published since the COVID 19 pandemic was declared in March 2020 estimate that suicide rates will increase by anywhere between 1% to 145% globally in response to the pandemic and action needs to be taken. A narrative literature review on high quality evidence sources limited to human studies and publications written in English language only has been used to examine the relationship of COVID 19 and existing mental illness or history of mental illness, suicide prevention strategies and changes in overall suicide rates. A total of 39 papers are summarised and grouped using the headings aetiological factors, proposed interventions to increase access and national policies to provide a framework for suicide prevention during pandemics such as COVID 19. This review indicates that 1) investing in active labour market programmes will result in a decreased suicide rate during times of high unemployment 2) People in low paid and casual jobs require specific support because they are most financially vulnerable during a pandemic related crisis 3) Women require specific support during a pandemic because of the type of employment they have and because they often carry a greater proportion of the domestic burden and are at increased risk of domestic violence during lockdown and crisis 4) Mental health and substance misuse services need to be appropriately funded and prioritised during and post pandemic, due to the associated increase in substance misuse during a pandemic causing worsening mental health and increased risk of suicide 5) National Suicide Prevention Strategies should be developed by all countries and should anticipate response to a range of disasters, including a pandemic 6) Suicide prevention is everybody's business and National Suicide Prevention Strategies should adopt a whole-systems approach including mental health services, primary care, social care, NGO's and other community stakeholders 7) Suicide is preventable 8) It is essential to prioritise suicide prevention strategies in the COVID and post-COVID period to ensure that lives are saved. Increase in suicide is not inevitable and suicide prevention during pandemics and post COVID 19 pandemics requires a collaborative whole system approach.

"Suicide prevention in older adults","Suicide among older adults is a multifactorial problem with several interrelated factors involved that vary with age, gender and culture. The number of suicides is highest in those aged 70Ã¢â‚¬â€°years or older in almost all regions of the world. With the increase in life expectancy, and the decrease in mortality due to other causes of death, we could expect the absolute number of older adults' suicide continue increasing. Review of the literature on suicide protective factors of suicide among older adults. Improvements on social determinants of health and the timely detection and early treatment of affective disorders are key interventions. Prevention based on community actions and training of gatekeepers may have positive impact. Community programs that promote a sense of usefulness, belonging and that contribute to preserve social integration should be encouraged. Governments should develop the improvement of retirement programs and the development of support systems. The access to general health and mental health services should be facilitated and Primary Care professionals should receive proper training to detect and manage older persons at risk. Actively promoting a culture of coping to different stages of life and to the changes imposed by the advancing of age should form the essential part of a process bringing to better successful aging avenues. Suicide prevention in older adults should broaden its focus and pay attention to the many socio-environmental conditions that may be relevant in older age, especially social isolation, financial security and physical health.","de MendonÃƒÂ§a Lima, De Leo, Ivbijaro, Svab","https://doi.org/10.1111/appy.12473","20210611","COVID-19; older adults; suicide; suicide behavior; suicide prevention","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-12","",14784,""
"Giving birth during the COVID-19 pandemic, perspectives from a sample of the United States birthing persons during the first wave: March-June 2020","The COVID-19 pandemic forced hospitals in the United States to adjust policy and procedure in order to provide safe care and prevent the spread of disease. At the beginning of the pandemic, media and case reports described pressure for medical interventions, visitor restrictions, separation from newborns, and an increase in patient demand for community birth (home and birth center). The purpose of this study was to describe birth experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic centering the birthing person's perspective. A survey was e-mailed to users of the Ovia Pregnancy app reaching a national convenience sample who gave birth between March 1, 2020, and June 11, 2020. Survey topics included birth location, the Mothers on Respect index, and open-ended questions capturing patient perspectives on the pandemic's effect on their birth experiences. Differences were assessed based on state-level COVID rate and by race. Content analysis was performed to analyze open-ended responses. Respondents from highly impacted COVID-19 states more frequently changed or considered changing their birth location. Racial differences were also found with Black respondents reporting significantly more preterm births and lower respect scores when compared to White respondents. Six themes emerged from the content analysis: Institutional Policies, Changes in Care, Hospital Staff Interactions, Sub-par Care, Issues of Support, and Mental Health. The health care community must continue to adapt policies and procedures to best support birthing patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. The community must also continue to address the reality that Black patients receive less respectful care compared with White patients.","Breman, Neerland, Bradley, Burgess, Barr, Burcher","https://doi.org/10.1111/birt.12559","20210611","COVID-19; birth; survey","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-12","",14785,""
"The Impact of COVID-19 on Sexual Behavior and Psychosocial Functioning in a Clinical Sample of Men who have Sex with Men Using HIV Pre-exposure Prophylaxis","The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on sexual behavior, mental health, and substance use among men who have sex with men (MSM) engaged in pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) care. Generalized linear mixed models and logistic mixed-effect models examined change over time for number of sexual partners, mood, and alcohol consumption. From February 29, 2020 to July 31, 2020, 177 MSM actively engaged in PrEP care were evaluated. The median age was 37 [interquartile range (IQR 30, 51]. Patients in the sample were largely representative of the clinic population and identified as White (73.0%), Black/African American (9.2%), and other race (17.2%), and 11.8% identified as Hispanic/Latino ethnicity. Men reported an average of 2.60 fewer sexual partners (95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°-4.04,Ã¢â‚¬â€°-1.40) during the pandemic compared to pre-COVID-19. Rates of depressive symptoms and alcohol use remained stable and few patients reported substance use. The reduced number of sexual partners may be explained by patients' efforts to reduce risk of exposure to COVID-19 and low rates of psychosocial symptoms may be indicative of only the highest functioning patients continuing to engage in care. Reductions in sexual partners may offset reduced engagement in care and help mitigate risk of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). El propÃƒÂ³sito de este estudio fue evaluar el impacto que tuvo la pandemia causada por la enfermedad del coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) en el comportamiento sexual, la salud mental y el uso de sustancias en hombres que tienen sexo con hombres (HSH) que reciben profilaxis previa a la exposiciÃƒÂ³n (PrEP). Los modelos lineales mixtos generalizados y los modelos logÃƒÂ­sticos de efectos mixtos examinaron el cambio a travÃƒÂ©s del tiempo en el nÃƒÂºmero de parejas sexuales, el estado de ÃƒÂ¡nimo y el consumo de alcohol. Desde el 29 de febrero de 2020 hasta el 31 de julio de 2020, se evaluaron 177 HSH que recibÃƒÂ­an los servicios de la PrEP. La mediana de edad fue de 37 (rango intercuartÃƒÂ­lico (IQR: 30, 51). Los pacientes de la muestra eran en gran parte representativos de la poblaciÃƒÂ³n de la clÃƒÂ­nica y se identificaban como Blancos (73.0%), Negros/Afroamericanos (9.2%) y de Otra raza (17.2%) y el 11.8% se identificÃƒÂ³ de origen Hispano/Latino. Los hombres reportaron un promedio de 2.60 parejas sexuales menos (IC del 95%: -4.04, -1.40) durante la pandemia en comparaciÃƒÂ³n con antes de COVID-19. Las tasas de sÃƒÂ­ntomas depresivos y el uso de alcohol se mantuvieron estables y pocos pacientes reportaron uso de sustancias. El nÃƒÂºmero reducido de parejas sexuales puede explicarse por los esfuerzos de los pacientes para reducir su riesgo de exposiciÃƒÂ³n al COVID-19 y las bajas tasas de sÃƒÂ­ntomas psicosociales pueden ser indicativos de que solo los pacientes con mayor funcionamiento continÃƒÂºan participando. La reducciÃƒÂ³n en el nÃƒÂºmero de parejas sexuales puede contrarrestar la baja participaciÃƒÂ³n en la atenciÃƒÂ³n medica de la PrEP y ayudar a mitigar el riesgo de contraer el VIH y otras infecciones de transmisiÃƒÂ³n sexual (ITS).","Rogers, Tao, Darveau, Maynard, Almonte, Napoleon, Murphy, Chan","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10461-021-03334-5","20210611","Alcohol; COVID-19; Men who have sex with men (MSM); Mood; Pre-exposure prophylaxis; Sexual behavior","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-12","",14786,""

"Changes in Mental Health of Women Undergoing Assisted Reproductive Technology Treatment During the COVID-19 Pandemic Outbreak in Xi'an, China","<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the mental health of women undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatment during the novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) pandemic outbreak in Xi'an, China. <b>Methods:</b> A repeated cross-sectional study was administered to women undergoing ART treatment during the outbreak period (599 women in February 2020) and the control period (892 women in May 2020) at the Northwest Women's and Children's Hospital, Xi'an, China. <b>Results:</b> Both the ART-treated women surveyed during the outbreak period and those surveyed during the control period had high scores on the fear dimension (0.88, 0.51). The total scores for mental health among the participants during the control period were lower than those during the outbreak period (difference = -0.22; 95% CI = -0.25, -0.18). Lower scores were also seen during the control period, compared to those in the outbreak period, for depression (difference = -0.18; 95% CI = -0.23, -0.13), neurasthenia (difference = -0.31; 95% CI = -0.36, -0.25), fear (difference = -0.37; 95% CI = -0.43, -0.31), compulsion anxiety (difference = -0.13; 95% CI = -0.16, -0.09), and hypochondriasis (difference = -0.09; 95% CI = -0.12, -0.06). <b>Conclusions:</b> During the COVID-19 global pandemic, the mental health of women undergoing ART treatment in Xi'an, China, was primarily manifested as fear. As the pandemic was brought under control, the mental health of ART-treated women improved. As evidenced by these results, the COVID-19 pandemic influences the mental health of women undergoing ART treatment, and clinicians should be aware of this for similar future situations.","Qu, Zhao, Jia, Dang, Shi, Wang, Shi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.645421","20210611","COVID-19; assisted reproductive technology; cross-sectional study; mental health; women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-12","",14788,""
"Prevalence of Risk Factors Associated With Mental Health Symptoms Among the Outpatient Psychiatric Patients and Their Family Members in China During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic","<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the prevalence of and risk factors associated with mental health symptoms in psychiatric outpatients and their family members in China during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> This cross-sectional, survey-based, region-stratified study collected demographic data and mental health measurements for depression, anxiety and acute stress from 269 psychiatric patients and 231 family members in the Second Xiangya Hospital in China from April 27, 2020 to May 8, 2020. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors associated with mental health outcomes. <b>Result:</b> The results of this survey revealed that symptoms of depression, anxiety, and acute stress were highly prevalent symptoms in the psychiatric patient group. Respondents who were female, unmarried or highly educated were significantly more likely to have the above symptoms. In the family member group, more than half of them felt that the burden of nursing had increased during the epidemic. Subjects with a high degree of burden of care were significantly more likely to exhibit the above mental health symptoms, while females were significantly more likely to have acute stress. <b>Conclusions:</b> The results of this survey revealed a high prevalence of mental health disorder symptoms among psychiatric patients and an increased burden of nursing among their family members after the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Understanding the risk factors in those particular groups of people help improve the public health service system for mental health problems during public health events.

"Perceived Stress of Quarantine and Isolation During COVID-19 Pandemic: A Global Survey","<b>Aims:</b> Understanding of the perceived stress and coping strategies adopted by people is important for contemplating the consequences of a pandemic on mental health of people globally. In this study, we intended to assess the perceived stress status under quarantine/isolation globally during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> This is a multicentre, multinational cross-sectional study that recruited isolated/quarantined individuals suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 to assess the psychological impact of the quarantine/isolation experience by answering a survey distributed online. <b>Results:</b> The study was conducted across 63 participating countries, gaining 1,871 valid responses. There was a higher proportion of female participants in the Moderate to High Perceived Stress Scores (MH-PSS) group compared to the Low Perceived Stress Score group (66.0 vs. 52.0%) and a higher proportion of individuals whose marital status was single had MH-PSS (57.1%). Also, individual's religion (Christian, Hindu, and Muslim), no formal education level, being exposed to a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patient, being forced to be quarantined/isolated, uncomfortable feeling during quarantine period may significantly increase the risk of MH-PSS (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). <b>Conclusions:</b> Many factors can predict stress in COVID-19 pandemic including female sex, being single, religion, no formal education, involuntary quarantine, location and reason of quarantine/isolation, and place of exposure.","Huy, Duc, Mohammed Alhady, Mai, Hassan, Giang, Truong, Ravikulan, Raut, Dayyab, Durme, Trang, Loc, Thach","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.656664","20210611","COVID-19; mental health; perceived stress status; quarantine; survey","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-12","",14790,""
"Suicide and Suicidal Behaviors in the Context of COVID-19 Pandemic in Bangladesh: A Systematic Review","Without integration of the available information, appropriate suicide preventive actions can be hindered. Therefore, this study attempts to review the Bangladeshi COVID-19-related suicide studies for the first time. For conducting a systematic review, the PRISMA guideline was adhered. Bangladeshi literatures concerning the COVID-19 pandemic related to either suicide case or suicidal behavior were identified within 1 to 10 April 2021, from the databases like PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, Web of Science, CINAHL, etc. Finally, a total of 9Ã‚Â literatures were included in this review. Four literatures were cross-sectional studies assessing the prevalence and risk factors of suicidal behavior, and the rest five were retrospective suicide studies concerned with either case study (n=3) or case-series study (n=2). The prevalence of suicidal ideation was identified to be ranging between 5% and 19.0%, whereas the rate increased over time of the pandemic inception. Significant risk factors concerning suicidal behavior included the factors related to (i) socio-demographic variables: female gender, being divorced or widows or widowers or single in marital status, having lower levels of education, being urban residence, belonging to higher socioeconomic class, being unemployed, and having no children, (ii) behavior and health-related variables: lack of physical exercise, cigarette smoking, alcohol consuming, abnormal sleep status, more exposure to social media, and suffering from the higher number of physical health problems; (iii) COVID-19 pandemic-related variables: lower knowledge of COVID-19, lack of preventive COVID-19 behaviors, higher levels of COVID-19 fear, living in highly COVID-19 infected area, higher economic loss due to the pandemic, and experiencing relatives or acquaintances' death by the COVID-19; (iv) psychopathological variables: depression, anxiety, stress, insomnia, suicidal thought history, suicide attempt history, and family with a history of suicide. Implementing cost-effective mental health strategies along with social and community awareness for increasing help-seeking behaviors of suicide risky individuals is highly suggested.","Mamun","https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S315760","20210611","COVID-19 and psychological impact; hanging in Bangladesh; pandemic and suicide; prevalence and risk factors; suicide and self-harm; suicide deaths in Bangladesh; systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-12","",14791,""
"Implications of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Mental Health and Professional Psychomotor Skills of Dental Students","To estimate dental students' self-perception of mental well-being (MWB) and its effects on their clinical psychomotor skills (CPS) once they (or their family members) get infected with COVID-19. This is a cross-sectional (n =268) study from a public dental college in Riyadh. We collected data on MWB and CPS. An 18-item online survey was used to collect the responses from the participants. The inter-rater reliability for the finalised survey came out to be 0.86. The participants (54.3%) who were infected with COVID-19 recorded that their CPS were significantly affected (almost 4 times higher) as compared to others (<i>OR</i>= 4.02; <i>P</i>=0.0004). However, 42.2% reported infection control measures at clinics resulted in bringing significant (<i>OR</i>=2.22, <i>P</i>=0.04) psychological upsets, for those who were infected with COVID-19. Participants (45.1%) also reported that they have difficulty in recalling old memories or information due to the COVID-19 pandemic; among them, 46.7% were the ones who (and/or any family member) were exposed to COVID-19. The study spotlighted the extent of dental students' MWB and its significant effect on their CPS once (themselves or a family member) infected with COVID-19. Moreover, levels of infection control measures at clinics resulted in psychological upsets for dental students. The issue is fundamental as participants enter the clinical workforce and face the ever-increasing demands of dental practice.","Alrashed, Sattar, Habib, Ahmad, Al Rashoud, Safhi, Almajed, Alnafisah, Alharbi, Alsubiheen","https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S317641","20210611","COVID-19; clinical psychomotor skills; dental students; mental well-being; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-12","",14792,""
"Prevalence of Depression and Associated Factors Among Quarantined Individuals During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Tigrai Treatment and Quarantine Centers, Tigrai, Ethiopia, 2020: A Cross-Sectional Study","The global impact of COVID-19 on mental health increases from time to time. Several studies show that depression is highly prevalent among quarantined individuals. COVID-19 is a pandemic with a rapidly increasing incidence of infections and deaths. People are depressed and psychologically overwhelmed by the illness and possible loss of their friends and loved ones. To assess the prevalence and associated factors of depression symptoms among quarantined individuals in Tigrai treatment center, Tigrai, Ethiopia, 2020. A multicenter Institution-based cross-sectional study was employed among individuals in the Tigrai quarantine centers. A simple random sampling technique was used between April and October 2020 until an adequate sample size was reached. Depression was assessed by using the depression, anxiety, and stress scale (DASS). Epi data manager version 4.4 was used to enter data and data was analyzed using SPSS version 20. Logistic regression was carried out and an odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was computed to identify factors associated with depression. A P-value of less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant and the strength of the association was presented by an odds ratio of 95% CI. The finding of the present study on the prevalence of depression among quarantined individuals was 18.1 with 95% CI (14.8-22.9). Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed and factors such as being female, duration of quarantine, unemployment, and having perceived stigma were significantly associated with depression. The prevalence of depression symptoms among quarantined individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic was 18.1%. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, being female, duration of quarantine, unemployment, and having perceived stigma were significantly associated with depression. So, clinicians, mental health professionals, and policymakers should work together to address the problem.","Hagezom, Gebrehiwet, Haftom Goytom, Alemseged","https://doi.org/10.2147/IDR.S289659","20210611","COVID-19; Ethiopia; depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-12","",14793,""
"Psychiatric Emergencies During the Covid-19 Pandemic: A 6-Month Observational Study","The new SARS-CoV-2 has caused an ongoing pandemic. Health prevention measures to contain the outbreak are profoundly affecting the physical and mental health as well as personal freedom of the population. To evaluate psychiatric emergencies in a 6-month period during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 compared to those of the corresponding period of the previous year. This monocentric observational study preliminarily collected variables of the urgent psychiatric consultations (UPCs) carried out in emergency room (ER) from 1-3-2020 to 31-8-2020 and the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of patients who required UPCs in the 6-month period, comparing these data with those collected from 1-3-2019 to 31-8-2019. The data, collected in alpha-numeric code, were statistically analyzed through STATA 12-2011. This research reported a reduction of both UPCs and hospital psychiatric admissions. Concomitantly, we observed an increase of UPCs required by people already being treated by psychiatric and other health services, residents in psychiatric facilities and non-Italians. In 2020, differently from 2019, the most frequent reasons for urgent psychiatric consultations were aggressive behavior and adjustment disorders with anxiety and depressive mood. This preliminary study suggests that, during the COVID-19 epidemic, urgent psychiatric consultations in ER were reduced, except for the most vulnerable people due to their clinical and/or social conditions.","Di Lorenzo, Frattini, Dragone, Farina, Luisi, Ferrari, Bandiera, Rovesti, Ferri","https://doi.org/10.2147/NDT.S307128","20210611","COVID-19 pandemic; psychiatric emergencies; urgent psychiatric consultations","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-12","",14794,""
"Managing high frequency users of an electronic consultation system in primary care: a quality improvement project","The COVID-19 pandemic prompted a rapid change in primary care provision. There was a significant shift from face-to-face appointments to remote methods such as electronic consultation (e-consultation). Patients from a primary care provider in London were actively encouraged to use an online consultation platform called 'Dr iQ'. A group of high frequency users of Dr iQ emerged and clinicians were concerned their health needs were not being met through the platform. High frequency attendance in a traditional general practice setting is associated with increased time and healthcare costs.This project evaluated the number of high frequency users (identified as 10 or more consultations a month) of Dr iQ in one busy inner city practice over a 5-month period. We aimed to decrease the subsequent monthly usage frequency of all Dr iQ high frequency users from 10 or more consultations to less than 10 consultations. Our interventions included a semi-structured telephone interview, discussion among the multidisciplinary team, and regular scheduled telephone or face-to-face appointments. Following two Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles, all 12 high frequency users showed a decrease in the number of consultations submitted to Dr iQ to less than 10 consultations a month.This project proposes a method of case managing high frequency users of e-consultation. The majority of high frequency users had unmet health needs and felt a lack of continuity of care on Dr iQ. They often had complex physical and mental health problems. As remote consulting technology continues to develop, more research is required to understand the epidemiology and aetiology of e-consultation high frequency use in order to improve patient outcomes.","Leung, Qureshi","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjoq-2020-001310","20210611","general practice; information technology; mobile applications; quality improvement; telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-12","",14795,""
"Perceived Changes in Mood and Anxiety Among Male Youth During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Findings From a Mixed-Methods Study","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has changed almost every aspect of our lives. Young adults are vulnerable to pandemic-related adverse mental health outcomes, but little is known about the impact on adolescents. We examined factors associated with perceived changes in mood and anxiety among male youth in urban and Appalachian Ohio. In June 2020, participants in an ongoing male youth cohort study were invited to participate in an online survey that included questions about changes in mood, anxiety, closeness to friends and family, and the major impacts of the pandemic. Weighted log-binomial regression models were used to assess the risk of worsened mood and increased anxiety. Chi-square tests were used to examine the association between perceived changes in mood and anxiety and perceived changes in closeness to friends and family and open-ended responses to a question about COVID-19's impact on participants. Perceived worsened mood and increased anxiety during the pandemic were associated with higher household socioeconomic status, older age, feeling less close to friends and family, and reporting that COVID-19 negatively affected mental health. A perceived increase in anxiety was also associated with a history of symptoms of depression or anxiety. Specific subgroups of male youth may be at heightened risk of worsening mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interventions should target vulnerable adolescents and seek to increase closeness to social contacts. Such efforts could involve novel programs that allow youth to stay connected to friends, which might mitigate the negative impact on mental health.","Tetreault, Teferra, Keller-Hamilton, Shaw, Kahassai, Curran, Paskett, Ferketich","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2021.05.004","20210611","COVID-19; Mental health; Youth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-12","",14796,""
"Persistent behavioral and neurobiological consequences of social isolation during adolescence","Meaningful social interactions are a fundamental human need, the lack of which can pose serious risks to an individual's physical and mental health. Across species, peer-oriented social behaviors are dramatically reshaped during adolescence, a developmental period characterized by dynamic changes in brain structure and function as individuals transition into adulthood. Thus, the experience of social isolation during this critical developmental stage may be especially pernicious, as it could permanently derail typical neurobiological processes that are necessary for establishing adaptive adult behaviors. The purpose of this review is to summarize investigations in which rodents were isolated during adolescence, then re-housed in typical social groups prior to testing, thus allowing the investigators to resolve the long-term consequences of social adversity experienced during adolescent sensitive periods, despite subsequent normalization of the social environment. Here, we discuss alterations in social, anxiety-like, cognitive, and decision-making behaviors in previously isolated adult rodents. We then explore corresponding neurobiological findings, focusing on the prefrontal cortex, including changes in synaptic densities and protein levels, white matter and oligodendrocyte function, and neuronal physiology. Made more urgent by the recent wave of social deprivation resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, especially amongst school-aged adolescents, understanding the mechanisms by which even transient social adversity can negatively impact brain function across the lifespan is of paramount importance.","Li, Hinton, Gourley","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.semcdb.2021.05.017","20210611","Adolescent; Adversity; Orbitofrontal; Prefrontal; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-12","",14797,""
"Access to care and worsening eating disorder symptomatology in youth during the COVID-19 pandemic","Shelter-in-place orders and social distancing guidelines, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, have limited traditional face-to-face interactions and led to many clinical providers transitioning to the use of videoconferencing platforms. The present study aims to assess how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted adolescents'/young adults' (AYA) eating disorder (ED)-related care, and how access to, changes in, perceived disruptions to, and quality of care are associated with ED thoughts and behaviors. AYA enrolled in the RECOVERY study, a pre-existing web-based longitudinal study,Ã‚Â and completed a COVID-19-specific survey (nÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°89). We examined bivariate associations of four markers of care: i) access to care, ii) changes in care, iii) perceived disruption to care, and iv) quality of care. Using multiple logistic regression, we examined the associations of pandemic-related markers of care with changes in ED thoughts and behaviors. We excluded those not engaged in treatment pre-pandemic (nÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°16). In the remaining 73 participants, reported access to care was high, with 92% of respondents continuing care with at least one ED provider during the pandemic; however, 47% stopped some treatment during the pandemic. Nearly one-third (32%) perceived a disruption in treatment. Quality of care remained high with 67% reporting care to be better than or as good as pre-pandemic. Respondents acknowledged heightened symptomatology: 81% reported increased ED thoughts and 81% reported increased ED behaviors due to COVID-19-related factors. However, none of the markers of care described were significantly associated with ED thoughts or behaviors in regression analyses adjusting for demographic variables and baseline characteristics, except our quality of care measure which was approaching significance (pÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.07). Our findings show the majority of AYA who had care prior to the pandemic continued receiving some element of their multi-disciplinary ED treatment and perceived their care as high quality. None of the markers of care described were statistically associated with increased ED thoughts and behaviors. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on our global communityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mental health, in particular those struggling with psychiatric illnesses, such as eating disorders (ED). Stay-at-home orders and social distancing have limited in-person access to ED treatment and as a result, many care providers have transitioned to using videoconferencing platforms. Clinicians who care for patients with EDs worry that these sudden changes in accessing treatment, on top of mental health challenges associated with the pandemic, may contribute to worsening ED symptoms. In this study, we asked adolescent and young adult patients with EDs about their symptoms, access to treatment, changes in care, disruptions in treatment and quality of care since the pandemic started. Our results demonstrate that patients with established care teams have maintained treatment and perceive their care as high quality, though the majority are experiencing worsening ED thoughts and behaviors. Patients who perceive their quality of care as worse than usual might be more likely to have intrusive ED thoughts. Continued access to care could also be protective against increased ED behaviors. Ultimately, our study highlights the need for continued support of patients during this challenging time.","Spigel, Lin, Milliren, Freizinger, Vitagliano, Woods, Forman, Richmond","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40337-021-00421-9","20210611","Access; Adolescents; COVID-19; Eating disorders; Telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-12","",14798,""
"Does methotrexate influence COVID-19 infection?

Clinical assessment of symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in an initial case series of four families and confirmatory case series of seven families, within which one family member developed coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) and exposed another family member receiving methotrexate treatment; experimental part with methotrexate treatment of mice and organoids followed by the assessment of mRNA and protein expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2. In the initial case series, three of four women on a joint ski trip developed COVID-19, while the fourth woman, under treatment with methotrexate, remained virus-free. Two of the three diseased women infected their husbands, while the third husband treated with methotrexate remained virus-free. In addition, 7 other families were identified in a follow-up case series, in which one member developed COVID-19, while the other, receiving methotrexate, remained healthy. Experimentally, when mice were treated with methotrexate, ACE2 expression significantly decreased in the lung, in the intestinal epithelium, and in intestinal organoids. These clinical and experimental data indicate that methotrexate has certain protective effects on SARS-CoV-2 infection via downregulating ACE2.","SchÃƒÂ¤lter, DÃƒÂ¼rholz, Bucci, Burmester, Caporali, Figuereido, Cobra, Manger, Zaiss, Schett","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13075-021-02464-4","20210611","Coronavirus disease 19; Infection; Methotrexate","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-12","",14799,""
