"Covid-19 Pandemic and its Effect on Residents' Mental Well-Being","Concerns about COVID-19's long-term consequences on the mental health of frontline health professionals are mounting as the entire world strives anew to contain it. The primary objective of this research is to describe the impact of working during the COVID-19 pandemic on junior doctors' mental health and to investigate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on junior doctors' training and professional performance. A cross-sectional online survey using the Google Forms platform was conducted from May 1st to May 30th , 2021, in 311 healthcare workers who were currently enrolled in a residency program at the Kuwait Institutional of Medical Specialization (KIMS). Socio-demographic details of each health worker were collected and the scores related to depression, anxiety, and stress were measured using the previously validated depression anxiety stress scale-21 (DASS-21). Higher stress scores were seen in those who were devoid of the option to work with COVID-19 patients (adjusted {beta} 5.1 (95%CI:1.2-9);p=0.01), who reported that working during the pandemic affected their study schedule (adjusted {beta} 4.8 (95%CI:1.6-8.1);p= 0.004), and who lost off service training time (adjusted {beta} 2.7 (95%CI:0.13-5.2); p=0.034). Further, the anxiety scores were significantly higher in females. The impact of the ongoing pandemic on residents' mental health is grave, necessitating psychological treatment and support. The study discovered various factors linked to depression, anxiety, and stress. As a result, these aspects must be regarded to protect the residents' mental health.","Anwar Yazdani; Hend Esmaeili; Abdulla K AlSaleh; Ahmed Sultan; Esam Alamad; Ali Bandar; Hanouf Rawdhan; Mariam Ayed","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.11.12.21266292","20211114","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-15","",21845,""
"Editorial Perspective: The mental health impact of school closures during the COVID-19 pandemic","School closures were one of the earlier actions taken as the world tried to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, a decision impacting nearly three-fourths of the learners worldwide. One year into the pandemic, over 200 million students still faced disruptions to their education. Nearing the end of another academic year that has occurred entirely during the pandemic, many schools remained fully or partially closed for in-person education, altering routines and representing potential hardships to the next generation and their families. This article will explore the potential impacts of school closures on children and adolescents related to increased screen time, irregular sleep patterns, less balanced diets, learning difficulties, and changes in social interaction. In addition, we note broader familial difficulties likely accompanying the loss of the mitigating effects of schools and their associated support systems, such as parental stress and work responsibilities, loss of employment, intimate partner violence, child abuse and neglect, and parental substance abuse, which appear to have increased during the pandemic. Considering what is known about the impact from previous natural catastrophes, the populations at risk, and the early but not yet definitive data from the current pandemic, we stress the urgent need for robust data as we prepare for a new academic year in the Northern Hemisphere. Although we currently lack consistent and complete data, signs for concern include a rise in pediatric emergency room visits for mental health and substance use issues in many parts of the world. This paper aims to stimulate a discussion about the potential mental health effects of school closures for children and adolescents in the context of a pandemic.","Almeida, Challa, Ribeiro, Harrison, Castro","https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpp.13535","20211111","COVID-19; School closures; children and adolescents; inequities; mental health crisis; pandemic; remote education","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-15","",21846,""
"Female gender is associated with ""long COVID"" syndrome: a prospective cohort study","We explored the association between female gender and ""long COVID"" syndrome, defined as persistence of physical and/or psychological symptoms for more than 4Ã‚Â weeks after recovery from acute COVID-19 disease. Secondary aim was to identify predictors of ""long COVID"" syndrome by multivariable logistic regression analysis. This is a single-centre prospective cohort study conducted at San Paolo Hospital in Milan, Italy. We enrolled adult patients that were evaluated at the post-COVID outpatient service of our Infectious Diseases Unit between April 15<sup>th</sup> 2020 and December 15<sup>th</sup> 2020. Participants were individuals who had clinically recovered from COVID-19 and in whom virological clearance had occurred. Previous infection by SARS-CoV-2 was microbiologically documented by positivity at reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasopharyngeal swab. All enrolled patients underwent blood tests and a comprehensive medical examination at follow-up. Individuals were interviewed about resolved and persisting symptoms and were asked to fill in two questionnaires to allow assessment of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression symptoms (HADS) score and of the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) score. A total of 377 patients were enrolled in the study. The median time from symptom onset to clinical recovery and virological clearance was 79 (IQR 69-102) and 56 (IQR 47-74) days, respectively. A diagnosis of ""long COVID"" syndrome was made in 260/377 (69%) patients. The most common reported symptoms were fatigue (149/377, 39.5%), exertional dyspnoea (109/377, 28.9%), musculoskeletal pain (80/377, 21.2%) and ""brain fog"" (76/377, 20.2%). Anxiety symptoms were ascertained in 71/377 (18.8%) individuals, whereas 40/377 (10.6%) patients presented symptoms of depression. Post-traumatic stress disorder (defined by a pathological IES-R score) was diagnosed in one-third of patients (85/275, 31%). Female gender was independently associated with ""long COVID"" syndrome at multivariable analysis (AOR 3.3 versus males, 95%CI 1.8-6.2, p&lt;0.0001). Advanced age (AOR 1.03 for 10Ã‚Â years older, 95%CI 1.01-1.05, p=0.01) and active smoking (AOR 0.19 for former smokers vs active smokers, 95%CI 0.06-0.62, p=0.002) were also associated with a higher risk of ""long COVID"", while no association was found between severity of disease and ""long COVID"" (AOR 0.67 for Continuous Positive Airway Pressure [CPAP]/Non-Invasive Mechanical Ventilation [NIMV]/Orotracheal Intubation [OTI] vs no 02 therapy, 95%CI 0.29-1.55, p=0.85). Factors that were found to be associated with a higher risk of developing ""long COVID"" syndrome were female gender and active smoking, but not severity of the acute disease.

"Exploring the awareness, attitudes, and actions (AAA) of UK adults at high risk of severe illness from COVID-19","People at high risk of severe illness from COVID-19 have experienced greater restrictions during the pandemic, yet there is a paucity of research exploring their lived experience. This study explored the impact of COVID-19 on people identified as at high risk of severe illness by UK Government, and in particular, the impact of the first lockdown on access to healthcare, medications and use of technological platforms. 1038 UK adults who identified as at high risk of severe illness from COVID-19 in line with UK Government guidance or self-identified with acute or other chronic health conditions, completed the Awareness, Attitudes and Actions survey which explored the impact of COVID-19 on access to healthcare, management of long-term health condition, mental health, and health behaviours. Most participants reported feelings of vulnerability, anxiety and isolation, noticed that other people changed their behaviour towards them including a feeling of being stigmatised by people not categorised as high risk. Participants described the largely negative impact that the COVID-19 lockdown had on to health-related behaviours and access to healthcare, which had resulted in large declines in mental health and wellbeing. Participants also indicated disappointment at the UK Governments response and handling of the COVID-19 lockdown. This study provides novel evidence of the lived experience of the first COVID-19 lockdown for people identified as at high risk of severe illness. In the context of behavioural health interventions, the ubiquity of digital technologies and their adoption into day-to-day life translates into greater potential reach than traditional interventions, and consequently, greater potential for positive public health impact. Findings should be considered by policymakers and healthcare professionals to support people now and as we transition through the recovery phase with a particular emphasis on supporting mental health and changes to the management of long-term health conditions.","Flint, Brown, Sanders, Tahrani","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0259376","20211111","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-15","",21848,""

"Self-inflicted wounds","It has been a rough couple of weeks for scientific public relations regarding COVID-19. Missteps by researchers and funding agencies around the origins of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have provided fodder for conspiracy theorists, and caveats about the children's vaccine have provided more ammo for anti-vaxxers. None of these miscues say anything substantive about the science and the conclusion that the virus is almost certainly of zoonotic origin and that the vaccine is safe for children.

"Correlation between anxiety and resilience of healthcare workers during COVID-19 pandemic in the southwest of Iran","The pandemic of COVID-19 has had a negative impact on healthcare providers. Resilience is thought to protect against mental illnesses and to help people cope with stress more effectively. The purpose of this research is to determine the relationship between resilience and anxiety in healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional online survey was carried out on 184 eligible healthcare workers recruited from health centers in Bushehr and Borazjan cities. Data collection was performed using standard questionnaires that consist of sociodemographic and COVID-19-related information, the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale, and the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. The data were analyzed using SPSS software and descriptive statistics. The Mann-Whitney U test, Independet Sample t-test, Kruskal-Wallis , and Spearman correlation test were applied for analyzing data. Statistical significance was set at a P-value ofÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05. The age mean of the participants was 35.54Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°7.11, and 40% of them experienced moderate and high levels of anxiety. Significant negative relationship was found between anxiety and resilience (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.211, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.032). Those who experienced death from COVID-19 in family or friends were more anxious than their counterparts (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.004). This study showed more than one-third of the participants experienced moderate and high levels of anxiety in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Anxiety was found to be related to resilience, and the greater the resilience, the lower the overall anxiety score. In policy development, this can be used to improve the resilience of healthcare workers and prevent mental health illnesses.","Rayani, Rayani, Najafi-Sharjabad","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-17284-x","20211111","Anxiety; COVID-19; Healthcare worker; Resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-15","",21851,""
"Using social media for health information on COVID-19 risk perceptions and mental health: An online survey of 4,580 pregnant women in China","Background: Social media has become an important source of health information during the COVID-19 period. Very little is known about the potential mental impact of social media use on pregnant women. Objective: The present study examined the association between using social media for health information, risk perception for COVID-19, worry due to COVID-19 and depression among pregnant women in China. Methods: A total of 4,580 pregnant women were recruited from various provinces of China and completed an online survey in March 2020. Results: More than one-third (39.2%) reported always using social media for health information. Results from structural equation modeling showed that frequency of social media use for health information was positively associated with perceived susceptibility (ÃŽÂ² = .05, p &lt;.001) and perceived severity of COVID-19 (ÃŽÂ² = .12, p &lt; .001), which in turn, were positively associated with worry due to COVID-19 (ÃŽÂ² = .19 and .72, p &lt;.001). Perceived susceptibility (ÃŽÂ² = .09, p &lt;.001), perceived severity (ÃŽÂ² = .08, p &lt;.001), and worry due to COVID-19 (ÃŽÂ² = .15. p &lt;.001) all had a positive association with depression. Results from bootstrapping analysis showed that the indirect effects of frequency of social media use for health information on worry due to COVID-19 and depression were both significant. Conclusions: The present study provided empirical evidence on how social media use for health information might have a negative impact on pregnant women's mental health. Interventions are needed to equip them with the skills to use social media properly.","Wang, Xie, Song, Di, Wang, Mo","https://doi.org/10.2196/28183","20211111","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-15","",21852,""
"The Influence of Gender and Age on the Outcomes of and Adherence to a Digital Interdisciplinary Mental Health Promotion Intervention in an Australasian Nonclinical Setting: Cohort Study","The global prevalence of mental health disorders is at a crisis point, particularly in the wake of COVID-19, prompting calls for the development of digital interdisciplinary mental health promotion interventions (MHPIs) for nonclinical cohorts. However, the influence of gender and age on the outcomes of and adherence to MHPIs is not well understood. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of gender and age on the outcomes of and adherence to a 10-week digital interdisciplinary MHPI that integrates strategies from positive psychology and lifestyle medicine and utilizes persuasive systems design (PSD) principles in a nonclinical setting. This study involved 488 participants who completed the digital interdisciplinary MHPI. Participants completed a pre and postintervention questionnaire that used: (1) the ""mental health"" and ""vitality"" subscales from the Short Form 36 (SF-36) Health Survey; (2) the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21); and (3) Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWL). Adherence to the digital interdisciplinary MHPI was measured by the number of educational videos the participants viewed and the extent to which they engaged in experiential challenge activities offered as part of the program. On average, the participants (N=488; mean age 47.1 years, SD 14.1; 77.5% women) demonstrated statistically significant improvements in all mental health and well-being outcome measures, and a significant gender and age interaction was observed. Women tended to experience greater improvements than men in the mental health and well-being measures, and older men experienced greater improvements than younger men in the mental health and vitality subscales. Multiple analysis of variance results of the adherence measures indicated a significant difference for age but not gender. No statistically significant interaction between gender and age was observed for adherence measures. Digital interdisciplinary MHPIs that utilize PSD principles can improve the mental health and well-being of nonclinical cohorts, regardless of gender or age. Hence, there may be a benefit in utilizing PSD principles to develop universal MHPIs such as that employed in this study, which can be used across gender and age groups. Future research should examine which PSD principles optimize universal digital interdisciplinary MHPIs.

"Associations Between Substance Use Problems and Stress During COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic has produced major life disruptions and increased stress. We explored associations between pandemic-related stress and substance use problems. Adults (<i>N</i> = 180; 65% female) with problematic substance use (CAGE-AID &gt; 1) were recruited online June-August 2020. Measures included the 15-item Short Inventory of Problems-Alcohol and Drugs (SIP-AD), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) seven-item anxiety measure, Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8) eight-item depression measure, a three-item measure of pandemic life disruptions, a six-item measure of pandemic-related mental health effects, and a five-item measure of pandemic-related personal growth. Participants reported whether they frequented bars and attended large gatherings. Participants with children (&lt;18 years of age) in the home completed a four-item measure of pandemic-related worry about children's well-being. Pandemic-related measures with significant bivariate associations with SIP-AD, GAD, and PHQ scores were tested in multivariable linear regression, adjusting for sex, age, and race/ethnicity. Participants who struggled with responsibilities at home, had greater mental health impacts, had greater personal growth, and frequented bars or large gatherings had higher SIPAD scores (all <i>p</i>s &lt; .05).

"Fear, anxiety and depression among pregnant women during COVID-19 pandemic: impacts of healthy eating behaviour and health literacy","The COVID-19 pandemic has been influencing people's psychological health, especially in pregnant women. We aimed to examine associated factors of fear of COVID-19, anxiety and depression among pregnant women during the pandemic where the impacts of healthy eating behaviour (HES) and health literacy (HL) were emphasized. A cross-sectional study was conducted between 14 February 2020 and 31 May 2020 in 18 health centres and hospitals across Vietnam. Data of 518 pregnant women were analysed, including socio-demographics, pregnant-related factors, HES, HL, health-related behaviours, fear of COVID-19 scale (FCoV-19S), anxiety (using the generalized anxiety disorder (GAD-7)) and depression (using the patient health questionnaire with 9 items (PHQ-9)). Regression analysis was utilized to explore the associations. Pregnant women with higher scores of HES and HL had lower likelihood of anxiety (odds ratio, OR, 0.79; 95% confidence interval (95%CI), 0.73, 0.87; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001; and OR, 0.94; 95%CI, 0.90, 0.99; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.018) and depression (OR, 0.84; 95%CI, 0.78, 0.91; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001; and OR, 0.96; 95%CI, 0.91, 0.99; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.044), respectively. Pregnant women being employed had a lower FCoV-19S score (regression coefficient, <i>B</i>, -1.46; 95%CI, -2.51, -0.40; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.007). Besides, other significant predictors of anxiety were eating healthier during the pandemic, unchanged or more physical activity, elevated gestational age and smoking. Other significant predictors of depression were eating healthier during the pandemic, elevated gestational age and smoking. Among others, HES and HL had positive impacts on protecting pregnant women against anxiety and depression. Improving HES and HL should be addressed as a strategic approach to improve reproductive health during the pandemic.KEY MESSAGEThe COVID-19 pandemic influences antenatal mental disorders with the higher level as opposed to that before the pandemic.Healthy eating behaviour and better health literacy (HL) had critical roles in lowering prenatal anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 crisis.Strategic approaches for improving healthy eating and HL should be recommended for protecting pregnant women from mental health problems during the pandemic.","Luong, Pham, Nguyen, Do, Pham, Nguyen, Nguyen, Ha, Dao, Trinh, Do, Nguyen, Nguyen, Tran, Tran, Duong, Pham, Do, Nguyen, Tra, Phan, Do, Duong","https://doi.org/10.1080/07853890.2021.2001044","20211112","COVID-19; Fear; anxiety; depression; health literacy; healthy eating behaviour; pregnant women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-15","",21855,""
"The Persian COVID-19 Anxiety Syndrome Scale (C-19ASS): Psychometric Properties in a General Community Sample of Iranians","There is a potential for a long-lasting psychological and social impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. Recently, the COVID-19 Anxiety Syndrome Scale (C19-ASS) has been developed, which measures individuals' coping mechanisms in relation to the fear or threat of COVID-19. The C19-ASS was developed and has been used so far only in Western samples. Further psychometric evaluation is needed in ethnically diverse samples. Therefore, the current study sought to test the psychometric properties in a large sample of Iranians (n = 1429; female = 52.1%; Mean age = 35.83, Ã‚Â±12.89) who completed a cross-sectional survey. Exploratory factor analysis revealed that the Persian C19-ASS has a two-factor structure corresponding to the perseveration and avoidance subscales of the original scale. Confirmatory factor analyses also supported a two-factor solution, showed a firm model fit and high internal consistencies. Furthermore, it showed excellent divergent validity from generalized anxiety, indicating that it is concerned explicitly with COVID-19, supported by correlational analyses and exploratory factor analysis. Test of incremental validity indicated the Persian C19-ASS explained more variance in functional impairment and COVID-19 anxiety than the gender, marital and educational status, generalized anxiety, neuroticism, openness, consciousness, and having lost someone close due to COVID-19. Also, based on a mediation test, it was found that C19-ASS mediates the relationship between the Big Five personality traits (except openness and consciousness) and health anxiety, generalized anxiety, depression, and COVID-19 anxiety. Overall, the current findings provide further evidence for the construct of the COVID-19 anxiety syndrome. The COVID-19 anxiety syndrome is discussed in light of the S-REF model that provides an explanatory framework for this pandemic-related construct.","Akbari, Seydavi, Zamani, NikÃ„ÂeviÃ„â€¡, Spada","https://doi.org/10.1002/cpp.2686","20211111","COVID-19 Anxiety Syndrome Scale; avoidance; factor structure; perseveration; reliability; validity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-15","",21856,""
"Depression and Anxiety in Times of COVID-19: How Coping Strategies and Loneliness Relate to Mental Health Outcomes and Academic Performance","The link between depression, anxiety, and loneliness has been well established in the literature. Yet, the performance consequences of these negative mental health outcomes and the role of coping behaviors, as well as behavioral consequences such as procrastination as mediators have received far less research attention. Due to the COVID-19 social isolation restrictions, people are at risk of falling into a negative mental health spiral that can also affect their performance over time. The purpose of this longitudinal study among 881 first-year bachelor students is to explore the mechanisms by which loneliness, coping strategies in the context of COVID-19, mental health outcomes and procrastination sequentially mediate the relationship depression and anxiety on the one hand, and academic performance on the other hand. We measured mental health variables several times during the COVID-19 crisis and assessed how this translates into academic performance at the end of the academic year. By performing exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, three high-order factors for the coping strategies in the context of the COVID-19 crisis were identified, namely maladaptive coping, adaptive coping, and supportive coping. Structural equation modeling was used to test the sequential mediational model. The results showed that maladaptive coping strategies employed at T2 during the lockdown, but not adaptive or supportive coping partially mediate the trajectories of depression (T1) and anxiety (T1). Loneliness (T2) partially mediated the trajectory of depression and anxiety (T1), and procrastination fully mediated the impact of depression (T3) on academic performance (T4). These results help understand the mechanisms that influence mental health and academic performance outcomes in response to the COVID-19 crisis. Based on the study outcomes, educational researchers can test strategies to reduce the adverse effects of stressful situations in learning environments by targeting maladaptive coping behaviors and procrastination.","Freyhofer, Ziegler, de Jong, Schippers","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.682684","20211112","COVID-19; academic performance; anxiety; coping strategies; depression; loneliness; procrastination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-15","",21857,""
"Influencing Factors Associated With Mental Health Outcomes Among Dental Medical Staff in Emergency Exposed to Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Multicenter Cross-Sectional Study in China","<b>Background:</b> The epidemic infection of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may have a profound impact on dentistry, mainly due to the mode of transmission of the pathogen, which poses a risk to almost all dental operations. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the prevalence and influencing factors of anxiety, depression, perceived stress, and acute stress disorder among dental medical staff in emergency situations during the COVID-19 epidemic. <b>Methods:</b> From April 3, 2020, to April 10, 20204, a multicenter cross-sectional study was conducted among 808 first-line dental professionals at an emergency department in mainland China. A self-designed questionnaire was used to collect general demographic information. The 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), and Acute Stress Disorder Scale (ASDS) were used to assess the severity of symptoms of anxiety, depression, perceived stress, and acute stress disorder (ASD), respectively. <b>Results:</b> The prevalence rates of depression, anxiety, perceived pressure, and ASD among the frontline dental medical staff were 46.4, 36.3, 65.2, and 1.1%, respectively. The frontline dental medical staff who were working in the Wuhan area reported experiencing more anxiety (<i>p</i> = 0.038) and perceived stress (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) compared with those who were not working in the Wuhan area. The frontline dental medical staff who were working in a general hospital reported experiencing more dissociation symptoms (<i>p</i> = 0.001) compared with those working in a specialized or private hospital. Individuals with a past medical history reported experiencing more anxiety (<i>p</i> = 0.009), depression (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and perceived stress (<i>p</i> = 0.003) than those without, and individuals with lower levels of education showed higher levels of anxiety (<i>p</i> = 0.038). Binary logistic regression analysis results (after controlling for other confounders) suggested that having a past medical history was a risk factor for both anxiety (<i>p</i> = 0.002; OR = 2.441; 95% CI, 1.384-4.306) and perceived stress (<i>p</i> = 0.001; OR = 1.417; 95% CI, 1.145-1.754). <b>Conclusions:</b> The prevalence of mental symptoms was high among the first-line emergency dental staff. Male sex, working in the Wuhan area, working in a general hospital, a past medical history, and lower levels of education were risk factors. Therefore, we need to pay close attention to the mental health problems of frontline dentists during the COVID-19 outbreak and adopt active preventive strategies to maintain their physical and mental health.","Chen, Li","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.736172","20211112","COVID-19; Chinese; anxiety; dentist; depression; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-15","",21858,""
"Non-Pharmacological Measures in the Prevention and Treatment of COVID-19 Infection","Previous pandemic and catastrophic events significantly changed the life of every human being, bringing him/her into a state of stress and the need to quickly adapt to new ways of daily activity. COVID-19 has a negative impact on all elements of health: social, physical and mental. Pharmacotherapy, as well as protective measures (isolation, wearing masks and maintaining physical distance) did not give the expected results. Vaccination has not yet led to herd immunity, so it is still jeopardizing every aspect of human health (1, 2). Non-pharmacological methods, such as stress and sleep control, physical activity and contact with nature are of great importance since they can significantly contribute to staying healthy during a pandemic. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the impact of non-pharmacological measures such as stress and sleep control (with different measures against the negative effects of anxiety and depression on mental state) and the possible positive impact of ""forest bathing"" on improving the immune response to the virus and its consequences. Available evidence-based studies on ways to com- bat stress and the effect of the proposed measures on human mental health and the im- mune system were analyzed. From the mentioned studies, recommended measures have been registered, which refer to stress and sleep control, diet and eating habits, contact with nature (""forest bathing"", gardening), virtual communication and meditation (mindfulness practice). The combined results of these studies indicate that COVID-19 has a chronic course and complications that significantly affect the physical, mental and emotional state of the patient. Proven positive effects of non-pharmacological measures can be applied in the daily practice of primary health care in the comprehensive fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Non-pharmacological measures such as stress and sleep control, spending time in nature, healthy diet, and physical activity may improve the immune response to COVID-19. These measures, with their positive effects on all aspects of health, can make a major contribution to controlling and improving the quality of life during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Zildzic, Salihefendic, Masic","https://doi.org/10.5455/medarh.2021.75.307-312","20211112","COVID-19; PCSS; forest bathing; immune system; mental health; non-pharmacological","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-15","",21859,""
"Fear of COVID-19 lead to procrastination among Turkish university students: The mediating role of intolerance of uncertainty","The COVID-19 outbreak has not only increased mortality but has also negatively affected mental health among populations across the world. Furthermore, individuals are experiencing uncertainty about their current and future situation because of the pandemic. Therefore, the present study investigated the mediating role of intolerance of uncertainty in the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and procrastination among a sample of Turkish university students. Between October and November 2020, 450 university students (291 females and 159 males aged 17 to 24Ã‚Â years) from three state universities in Turkey completed an online survey. Correlation analysis and structural equation modeling methods were employed to examine a model for understanding the general procrastination during COVID-19 pandemic. The results of the correlation analysis indicated that the fear of COVID-19 was positively correlated with both intolerance of uncertainty (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.26, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) and procrastination (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.23, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). The mediation analysis also showed that intolerance of uncertainty had a significant mediating role in the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and procrastination (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.11, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). Reducing the fear of COVID-19 and intolerance of uncertainty is likely to contribute to reducing individuals' procrastination behaviors during the pandemic.","DoÃ„Å¸anÃƒÂ¼lkÃƒÂ¼, Korkmaz, Griffiths, Pakpour","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40359-021-00681-9","20211112","Fear of COVID-19; Intolerance of uncertainty; Procrastination; University students; COVID-19; Fear; Female; Humans; Male; Pandemics; Procrastination; SARS-CoV-2; Students; Turkey; Uncertainty; Universities","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-15","",21860,""
"From chaos to control - experiences of healthcare workers during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic: a focus group study","The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused overwhelming challenges to healthcare systems worldwide. Healthcare workers (HCWs) have faced particular challenges: being exposed to the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and caring for patients having a new and potentially life-threatening disease. The aim of this study was to explore how HCWs in the Swedish healthcare system perceived their work situation during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Focus group discussions and interviews with HCWs were performed from June to October 2020 in one Swedish healthcare region. A purposeful sampling approach was used to select a variety of professions (physicians, nurses, nurse aides and cleaners) and workplaces (hospital inpatient wards, emergency department, nursing home and home care service). Qualitative content analysis was used for data analysis. In total, 51 HCWs participated in eight focus group discussions and one HCW participated in an individual interview. The content analysis identified two main categories: 'Concerns about the risk of infection and transmission of infection to others', and 'Transition from chaos to managing in a new and challenging work situation'. The findings revealed how HCWs perceived working conditions, including experiences of fear for personal health, confusion and uncertainty regarding personal protective equipment and infection prevention and control (PPE/IPC), and fear of infecting others. Both fearful and appreciating attitudes were achieved from the surrounding community. Helpful strategies for transition from chaos to control were lifted i.e. present and supportive leadership, and finding comfort and strength in the working team. Both helplessness and meaningfulness were described when caring for COVID-19 patients. This study provides unique insights into HCWs experiences of an extremely challenging work situation during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, including feelings of stress and insecurity in a chaotic and hazardous working environment. But there is also mitigation of these challenges and even positive experiences including feelings of safety and meaningfulness. To enhance safety among HCWs in healthcare crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the findings highlight the importance of avoiding confusion about PPE/IPC, having a supportive healthcare leadership and ensuring accurate information provision about virus transmission to the public.","RÃƒÂ¼cker, HÃƒÂ¥rdstedt, RÃƒÂ¼cker, Aspelin, Smirnoff, Lindblom, Gustavsson","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-021-07248-9","20211112","Coronavirus disease 2019; Health personnel; Infection control; Mental health; Occupational health; Patient care; Qualitative research; COVID-19; Focus Groups; Health Personnel; Humans; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-15","",21861,""
"Adverse pregnancy outcomes during the COVID-19 lockdown A descriptive study","The ongoing spread coronavirus disease worldwide has caused major disruptions and led to lockdowns. Everyday lifestyle changes and antenatal care inaccessibility during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have variable results that affect pregnancy outcomes. This study aimed to assess the alterations in stillbirth, neonatal-perinatal mortality, preterm birth, and birth weight during the COVID-19 national lockdown. We used the data from the Jordan stillbirths and neonatal death surveillance system to compare pregnancy outcomes (gestational age, birth weight, small for gestational age, stillbirth, neonatal death, and perinatal death) between two studied periods (11 months before the pandemic (May 2019 to March 2020) vs. 9 months during the pandemic (April 2020 to March 1st 2020). Separate multinomial logistic and binary logistic regression models were used to compare the studied outcomes between the two studied periods after adjusting for the effects of mother's age, income, education, occupation, nationality, health sector, and multiplicity. There were 31106 registered babies during the study period; among them, 15311 (49.2%) and 15795 (50.8%) births occurred before and during the COVID-19 lockdown, respectively. We found no significant differences in preterm birth and stillbirth rates, neonatal mortality, or perinatal mortality before and during the COVID-19 lockdown. Our findings report a significantly lower incidence of extreme low birth weight (ELBW) infants (&lt;1kg) during the COVID-19 lockdown period than that before the lockdown (adjusted OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.3-0.5: P value &lt;0.001) CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 lockdown period, the number of infants born with extreme low birth weight (ELBW) decreased significantly. More research is needed to determine the impact of cumulative socio-environmental and maternal behavioral changes that occurred during the pandemic on the factors that contribute to ELBW infants.","Badran, Darwish, Khader, AlMasri, Al Jaberi, AlMasri, AlSa'di, Yosef, Al-Badaineh","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-021-04221-6","20211111","COVID-19; Extremely low birth weight; Lockdown; Neonates","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-15","",21862,""
"Prevalence and risk factors of anxiety, depression and sleeping disturbances in china during the COVID-19 outbreak: a web-based cross-sectional study","The rapid development of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has brought great harm to physical and mental health of the public. This study aims to investigate the psychological status and sleep quality of the Chinese public during the outbreak of the COVID-19 and its related factors. The survey was conducted from February 17<sup>th</sup> to February 26<sup>th</sup>, 2020 in southwestern China. The snowball sampling method was used to invite subjects. Demographic data were collected, and mental status and sleep quality were assessed by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Scale (GAD-7), the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Descriptive, univariate, and correlation analyses were used to investigate risk factors for psychological status and sleep patterns. A total of 1509 adults (713 males and 796 females) were enrolled in this study. The overall prevalence of anxiety, depression, and decreased sleep quality were 22.3%, 32.2% and 35.4%, respectively. Compared with females, male population has witnessed a higher prevalence of anxiety symptoms (25.1% vs 20.4%, <i>P</i>=Ã‚Â 0.007) and depressive symptoms (34.6% vs 30.0%, <i>P</i>=Ã‚Â 0.027). In addition, age, marital status, living situation, involvement in anti-pandemic work, basic health status and work status were significant risk factors for anxiety or depression (<i>P</i>&lt;Ã‚Â 0.05). During the COVID-19 outbreak, psychological problems and sleep disorders were prevalent among the Chinese public. More attention should be paid to males, the elderly, the solitary, the unemployed, front-line workers in pandemic prevention, and patients with chronic diseases.","Wu, You, Li, He, Huang","https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2021.2003829","20211111","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; risk factors; sleeping disturbances","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-15","",21863,""
