"The impact of COVID-19 employment shocks on suicide and poverty alleviation programs: An early-stage investigation","This paper examines whether the COVID-19-induced employment shock has increased suicides and the utilization of means-tested poverty alleviation programs in the first eight months of the COVID-19 crisis. We exploit plausibly exogenous regional variation in the magnitude of the employment shock in Japan and adopt a difference-in-differences (DID) research design to identify the employment-shock impact. Our preferred point estimates suggest that a one-percentage-point decrease in the employment rate in the second quarter of 2020 resulted in an additional 0.14-0.44 male suicides per one hundred thousand male population in June 2020 and an additional 5.3-7.9 Public Assistance recipients per one hundred thousand population in August 2020. The impacts on female suicides and other poverty alleviation programs are not precisely estimated, but there is suggestive evidence that the same employment shock has also increased the caseloads of the other poverty alleviation programs. We also examine the impact of the increase in the unemployment rate and find a positive impact on the poverty alleviation programs but not on suicides.","Michihito Ando; Masato Furuichi","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.16.20232850","20201118","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-19","",7270,""
"Public perceptions of non-adherence to COVID-19 measures by self and others in the United Kingdom","OBJECTIVE: To explore the perceptions of non-adherence to COVID-19 policy measures by self and others in the UK, focusing on perceived reasons for non-adherence. DESIGN: Qualitative study comprising 12 online focus groups conducted between 25th September and 13th November 2020. SETTING: Online video-conferencing PARTICIPANTS: 51 UK residents aged 18 and above, reflecting a range of ages, genders and race/ethnicities. RESULTS: Participants reported seeing an increase in non-adherence in others and identified a number of challenges to their own adherence to measures. Thematic analysis identified six main themes related to participants' reported reasons for non-adherence in self and others: (1) Alert fatigue (2) Inconsistent rules (3) Lack of trust in government (4) Helplessness (5) Resistance and rebelliousness (6) Reduced perception of risk and the prospect of a vaccine. Participants also raised concerns that adherence would be impacted by a desire to socialise over Christmas. Two forms of non-adherence were observed: overt rule-breaking and subjective rule interpretation. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence may be improved by: less frequent and clearer information on COVID-19 to reduce alert fatigue; implementing a more unified set of measures within and across countries in the UK; role modelling good adherence by authority figures; exploring ways to mitigate the impact that events like Christmas vaccine 'breakthroughs' may have on reducing adherence.","Simon N Williams; Christopher J Armitage; Tova Tampe; Kimberly Dienes","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.17.20233486","20201118","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-19","",7271,""
"Age Specific Months of Mortality (MOMa) from Endemic and Pandemic (Covid 19) diseases","People do not naturally understand risk. We fear things that happen rarely like kidnapping while ignoring common risks like motor vehicle crashes. We also do not fully comprehend the large effect that age has on risk. In this paper, I introduce a concept that I call age specific months of mortality, abbreviated MOMa, a statistic that will allow people to understand their risk of death within their age group. In a year without excess mortality, i.e. no pandemic, individual causes of death will add up to a total of 12 MOMa. Excess mortality, e.g. a pandemic, adds MOMa beyond 12. For people in their 20s, the MOMa is 5 for accidents, 1.9 for suicide, 1.6 for homicide, and 1.2 for Covid-19. For people in their 60s, the MOMa is 12 for Covid-19, 4 for cancer, 2.6 for coronary heart, and treatment of Covid-19 with dexamethasone reduces MOMa from 12 to 7 months.","Christopher Rembold","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.17.20233197","20201118","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-19","",7272,""
"Negative attitudes about facemasks during the COVID-19 pandemic: The dual importance of perceived ineffectiveness and psychological reactance","This study reports a comprehensive empirical investigation of the nature and correlates of anti-mask attitudes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Accumulating evidence underscores the importance of facemasks, as worn by the general public, in limiting the spread of infection. Accordingly, mask-wearing has become increasingly mandatory in public places such as stores and on public transit. Although the public has been generally adherent to mask-wearing, a small but vocal group of individuals refuse to wear masks. Anti-mask protest rallies have occurred in many places throughout the world, sometimes erupting violently. Few empirical studies have examined the relationship between anti-mask attitudes and mask non-adherence and little is known about how such attitudes relate to one another or other factors (e.g., non-adherence to social distancing, anti-vaccination attitudes). To investigate these issues, the present study surveyed 2,078 adults from the US and Canada. Consistent with other surveys, we found that most (84%) people wore masks because of COVID-19. The 16% who did not wear masks scored higher on most measures of negative attitudes towards masks. Network analyses indicated that negative attitudes about masks formed an intercorrelated network, with the central nodes in the network being (a) beliefs that masks are ineffective in preventing COVID-19, and (b) psychological reactance (PR; i.e., an aversion to being forced to wear masks). These central nodes served as links, connecting the network of anti-masks attitudes to negative attitudes toward SARSCoV2 vaccination, beliefs that the threat of COVID-19 has been exaggerated, disregard for social distancing, and political conservatism. Findings regarding PR are important because, theoretically, PR is likely to strengthen other anti-masks attitudes (e.g., beliefs that masks are ineffective) because people with strong PR react with anger and counter-arguments when their beliefs are challenged, thereby leading to a strengthening of their anti-mask beliefs. Implications for improving mask adherence are discussed.","Steven Taylor; Gordon J. G.

"Ethical and Psychosocial considerations for hospital personnel in the COVID-19 crisis: Moral Injury and Resilience","This study aims at investigating the nature of resilience and stress experience of health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thirteen healthcare workers from Italian and Austrian hospitals specifically dealing with COVID-19 patients during the first phase of the pandemic were interviewed. Data was analysed using grounded theory methodology. Psychosocial effects on stress experience, stressors and resilience factors were identified. We generated three hypotheses. Hypothesis one is that moral distress and moral injury are main stressors experienced by healthcare workers. Hypothesis two states that organisational resilience plays an important part in how healthcare workers experience the crisis. Organisational justice and decentralized decision making are essential elements of staff wellbeing. Hypothesis three refers to effective psychosocial support: Basic on scene psychosocial support based on the Hobfoll principles given by trusted and well-known mental health professionals and peers in an integrated approach works best during the pandemic.","Alexander Kreh; Rachele Brancaleoni; Sabina Chiara Magalini; Daniela Pia Rosaria Chieffo; Barbara Flad; Nils Ellebrecht; Barbara Juen","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.18.20232272","20201118","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-19","",7274,""

"The psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis on young Swiss men participating in a cohort study","Aims The COVID-19 pandemic caused many disturbances to daily life worldwide and may also have significantly affected peopleâ€™s psychological well-being. The present study aimed to describe the psychological impact of the crisis on our sample of young Swiss men and to examine differences due to their linguistic region, experiencing COVID-19 symptoms and living arrangements. Method Based on an ongoing cohort study, we assessed a general-population sample of young Swiss men (n = 2345; average 29 years old) shortly before (from April 2019) and early on during the COVID-19 crisis (between 13 May and 8 June 2020). This was a unique opportunity to estimate the crisisâ€™ psychological impact in form of depression, perceived stress and sleep quality (assessed before and during COVID-19), and any crisis-induced fears, isolation or psychological trauma. Associations of psychological impact with living arrangements, experiencing COVID-19 symptoms and linguistic region (German-speaking vs French-speaking) were investigated using linear regression models. Findings By the time participants responded to our questionnaire, less than 1% had been tested positive for COVID-19, 2.6% had been tested negative, and 14.7% had had some COVID-19 symptoms but had not been tested. About 8.2% of the sample reported at least some symptoms of psychological trauma (= 24 points on the Impact of Event Scale). On average, participants reported higher levels of fear for others (43.6% at least moderate) and economical fear (12.7% at least moderate) than fear for themselves (5.8% at least moderate). Those living alone and those who reported having COVID-19 symptoms themselves, or knowing someone with symptoms, reported higher overall psychological impact in the form of depression, perceived stress, sleep quality, psychological trauma, fear and isolation. Associations with linguistic region varied by outcome, with higher levels of depression and fear in French-speaking regions and higher levels of perceived stress and isolation in German-speaking regions. Interpretation The crisis had a considerable impact on the psychological well-being of our sample of young Swiss men, and some groups were more affected than others: those living alone and those who had shown COVID-19 symptoms themselves; or had known someone with symptoms, may have felt a greater psychological impact from the crisis. Supporting those at a higher risk of psychological consequences in such crises, whether through structural measures or via individual support, should be an important aspect of crisis management and could help reduce the overall impact of the current pandemic on Switzerlandâ€™s population.","Simon Marmet et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461C7-39C-082","20201119","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; mental health; covid-19; psychological impact; switzerland","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-19","",7281,""
"Understanding COVID-19 through a complex trauma lens: Implications for effective psychosocial responses","DO NOT CITE WITHOUT AUTHOR PERMISSION. The psychosocial impact of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) on individuals, families, and communities will likely persist for years to come. While briefing notes informed by disaster psychology and crisis management have been released to guide social workers and other mental health professionals in their work during the pandemic, the far-reaching impacts of COVID-19 may require inclusion of additional theories of trauma and resilience. Thus, we first examine the application of complex trauma theory as an effective framework for assessing the psychosocial impacts of the pandemic, especially among individuals with prior trauma exposure, those with pre-existing mental illness, and communities affected by marginalization and historical trauma. We then discuss the importance of using trauma-informed practice to address the effects of the pandemic on both the individual and community levels during this unprecedented moment in history.","Lcsw J.
