"The United Kingdom Research study into Ethnicity And COVID-19 outcomes in Healthcare workers (UK-REACH): Protocol for a prospective longitudinal cohort study of healthcare and ancillary workers in UK healthcare settings","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant morbidity and mortality, and has devastated economies in many countries. Amongst the groups identified as being at increased risk from COVID-19 are healthcare workers (HCWs) and ethnic minority groups. Emerging evidence suggests HCWs from ethnic minority groups are at increased risk of adverse COVID-19-related physical and mental health outcomes. To date there has been no large-scale analysis of these risks in UK healthcare workers or ancillary workers in healthcare settings, stratified by ethnicity or occupation type, and adjusted for potential confounders. This paper reports the protocol for a prospective longitudinal questionnaire study of UK HCWs, as part of the UK-REACH programme (The United Kingdom Research study into Ethnicity And COVID-19 outcomes in Healthcare workers). Methods and analysis A baseline questionnaire with follow-up questionnaires at 4 and 8 months will be administered to a national cohort of UK healthcare workers and ancillary workers in healthcare settings, and those registered with UK healthcare regulators. With consent, data will be linked to health records, and participants followed up for 25 years. Univariate associations between ethnicity and primary outcome measures (clinical COVID-19 outcomes, and physical and mental health) and key confounders/explanatory variables will be tested, followed by multivariable analyses to test for associations between ethnicity and key outcomes adjusted for the confounder/explanatory variables, with interactions included as appropriate. Using follow-up data, multilevel models will be used to model changes over time by ethnic group, facilitating understanding of absolute and relative risks in different ethnic groups, and generalisability of findings. Ethics and dissemination. The study is approved by Health Research Authority (reference 20/HRA/4718), and carries minimal risk to participants. We aim to manage the small risk of participant distress due to being asked questions on sensitive topics by clearly indicating on the participant information sheet that the questionnaire covers sensitive topics and that participants are under no obligation to answer these, or indeed any other, questions, and by providing links to support organisations. Results will be disseminated with reports to Government and papers uploaded to pre-print servers and submitted to peer reviewed journals. Registration details.

"Neuroisualization of Pharmaco-EEG Effects of Leutragine by Normalized Cat Brain Electrograms","The central mechanisms of leutragine during inhalational administration were investigated by analyzing normalized brain cat electrograms obtained by the method of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)  According to the conducted pharmaco-electroencephalography (pharmaco-EEG) analysis, Leutragine demonstrates a maximum effect on the parameters of brain electrograms approximately 30 minutes after administration followed by its persistence for about 2 hours  The observed effect is characterized predominantly by a deprimation of all analyzed rhythms compared to the initial values  Normalized brain electrograms (NBE) are less pronounced in the area of the hippocampus, although being more pronounced in the area of the cingulate gyrus and posterior hypothalamus  This may indicate the leucinencephaline regulation of intracentral relations of the brain  The most signi<U+FB01>cant effects obtained in high-frequency beta- and gamma-rhythms (about 20-25, 40 and 60 Hz) indicate an increase in the gamma-activity of interneurons and inhibition of pyramidal cells, which may indicate an anti-anxiety, antidepressant, antiepileptic, analgesic and similar actions of the substance under study  The NBE parameters were found to identical under the action of Leutragine and the derivatives of gamma-aminobutyric acid (glutamine, gabapentin, pregabalin, and phenibut), mainly at frequencies of about 40 and 60 Hz  Similar NBE parameters were obtained under the action of nootropics (semax), which is expressed in the activation of the hippocampus and the hypothalamus posterior at frequencies of about 60-65 Hz  This suggests that the action of Leutragine re<U+FB02>ects the mechanisms of GABAergic modulation of the hippocampus and prefrontal neocortex, at the same time as having a positive effect on mental performance, memory consolidation and cognitive function  Leutragine can be used to model and study mechanisms exhibiting a positive effect in the treatment of diseases caused, among other things, by the new coronavirus infection COVID-19

"CHALLENGES OF ONLINE TEACHING IN THE BUSINESS LANGUAGE CLASS","With escalating SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, the fight against the disease has become an absolute priority and social distancing measures have been adopted both at the level of the community and at the level of higher education in Romania  The present article emphasizes the advantages and disadvantages of online language teaching for economics students while taking into consideration various aspects such as the flexibility of the program, saving information on the platform for the benefit of the teacher's focus on teaching materials, planning courses and communicating with students, adopting a new assessment system, improving time management, use of internet resources but also drawing attention to the fluctuating internet connection, the crash of the devices or of the platform, potential disturbing factors, students' passivity, the lack of motivation and real connection, the lack of a sense of belonging to a group or an institution, etc  The present paper brings forth several solutions while advocating the integration of the online experience within the traditional teaching system","Armasar, Ioana Paula","https://doi.org/10.31926/but.es.2020.13.62.2.16","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Bulletin of the Transilvania University of Brasov.

"Human Intestinal Microbiome and Immune System: The Role of Probioticsin Shaping an Immune System Unsusceptible to COVID-19 Infection","The human gastrointestinal microbiota (HGM) is today seen as an organ orchestrating the activity of all other organs and systems, namely the brain, and playing a major role in maintaining homeostasis of the host organism  One of the HGMâ€™s remarkable abilities as a key player in the development of a normal immune system, is its ability to recognize stress signals in its environment, for instance triggered by viruses and other pathogenic microorganisms, and react accordingly  SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19 disease, represents an unfamiliar type of virus to the human organism due to a lack of regular encounters between them over the course of evolution  This is one possible explanation of the disproportionate response of both innate and acquired immune systems seen in many people  In this review, we analyzed certain immunomodulatory aspects of the HGM  We also assessed the state of research in the field of next-generation probiotics, such as pharmabiotics and postbiotics, and their potential use for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19  The range of symptoms typical of COVID-19 infection are presented in a concise form  The impact of COVID-19 infection on various organs and systems will be taken on in a future study  Nevertheless, despite being in the early stages of the pandemic, we can still predict a large impact of COVID-19 on the incidence of tuberculosis and depression in various populations around the world  A personâ€™s gut microbiota, depending on whether it is normal or dysfunctional (dysbacteriosis), can be an important predictor of the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines  These factors need to be taken into account and perhaps a set of measures for the rehabilitation of certain groups of the population should be adopted  These measures should include the development of next-generation pharmabiotics (psychobiotics, probiotics exhibiting antioxidant properties, immunobiotics), as well as specialized functional foods  <U+041C><U+0438><U+043A><U+0440><U+043E><U+0431><U+0438><U+043E><U+0442><U+0430>

"The Gangwon-do case as an example of the regional policy of the Republic of Korea","In the Republic of Korea, equal spatial development is considered as one of the state priorities  The traditional object of Seoulâ€™s regional policy is Gangwon Province, a typical depressed region that specialized in coal mining during the rapid industrial growth of the RoK and suffered from changes in the energy balance and macroeconomic conditions at the turn of the 80s and 90s  In this article, we analyze the key problems of the socio-economic development of the province, the approaches and instruments for resolving these problems and their effectiveness  The recovery policy for Gangwon-do has been implemented over the past two decades  The central, regional and municipal authorities, as well as the local community, putting forward a variety of initiatives and demands, are engaged in an intensive dialogue on the development of Gangwon-do  At first sight, a radical improvement did not happen  However, the decline in population has been stopped and even a slight growth began  Structural reorganization of the regional economy was implemented, and in preparation for the 2018 Olympic Games, most transport problems were solved, the infrastructure of sports and outdoor activities reached a high level, and real estate prices rose significantly  Gangwon-doâ€™s lagging behind the average level of the South Korean regions has ceased, which is a decent result of the regional policy, taking into account the existing geographical and macroeconomic restrictions  However, we assume that the COVID-19 epidemic will cause severe damage to the service sector of the provincial economy, so in the future the authorities will pay more attention to the development of industry and agriculture  <U+0412> <U+0420><U+0435><U+0441><U+043F><U+0443><U+0431><U+043B><U+0438><U+043A><U+0435> <U+041A><U+043E><U+0440><U+0435><U+044F>

peer support, a greater focus on collaboration and team input, and positive expectations for the administration  The leading motivation in making a decision to work with COVID-19 was the attitude of duty - 25 4% emphasized the particular importance of their activities  Management decisions in a situation of limited time and human resources were made;this decisions aimed at managing internal and external communications, enhancing the professional component in an interdisciplinary team and preventing burnout  Conclusions  A number of timely personnel, administrative, organizational and

"Features Contact with the Doctor and Satisfaction with the Quality of Care for Patients Hospitalized with COVID-19","Background  The number of hospitalized patients diagnosed with coronavirus infection in March-May 2020 increased in almost all countries  Of course, such a pandemic has become a challenge for the entire health care system  In the current conditions, maintaining high standards of quality of medical care, establishing contact between specialists and the patient is a separate difficult task;at the same time, it is precisely the contact with specialists and the subjectively perceived quality of care that plays an important role in establishing compliance, and, therefore, in the success of patient treatment  Our research is devoted to the search for ways to solve this problem  Aims - to study the features of the emotional state of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and describe the contribution of these features to interaction in the doctor-patient dyad and satisfaction with the medical care received  Methods  The study involved 127 people hospitalized with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19  The research methods used: 1) a questionnaire developed by the authors, which included socio-demographic data and a block of questions about interaction with a doctor and medical personnel;2) the Russian-language version of the Beck Depression Inventory;3) Russian-language version of the GAD-7 anxiety questionnaire  Results  25 4% of participants have pronounced signs of anxiety, 24 13% - signs of depression;54% of patients indicate that the help they receive in the framework of hospitalization is sufficient;7% speak of the need for support from a psychologist  Formulated information about what is happening with the patient is the key factor in contact with a doctor (for 62 9%), and a visible improvement in well-being is important only for 43 4%  The presence of anxious and depressive symptoms makes a qualitative difference in establishing contact with a doctor and assessing the severity of oneâ€™s own condition  Conclusions  Based on the results of the study, in the future, it is possible to formulate various strategies for working with patients showing high rates of depressive and anxious experiences: such strategies should take into account the importance of close contact with the doctor and detailed information for patients

"ANALYSIS OF ONLINE INFORMATION ON SUPPORT GROUP MEETINGS FOR CROHN'S DISEASE PATIENTS","Background: In 2018, the American College of Gastroenterology published guidelines for Crohnâ€™s disease management that emphasized the importance of addressing the patientâ€™s quality of life (QOL)  Due to the unique challenges that they face, afflicted patients and their families benefit from support groups that provide psychosocial support  Hospitals have traditionally preferred in-person support group meetings, but there has recently been a great increase in the need for online meetings amidst the COVID-19 pandemic  With increasing usage of the Internet for health advice and assistance, it is important to assess the availability of information on support groups online  Methods: Two independent investigators queried the terms â€œCrohnâ€™s support groupâ€ using the Google search engine  The first 100 websites were analyzed and categorized into either informational websites (IW) or professional websites (PW) depending on their association  The mode of support group meetings was categorized as either online or in-person  Websites that included outdated events, were inaccessible, did not specify the mode of meeting, required additional contact, or were irrelevant were excluded  Statistical analyses were performed using the chi-squared test of independence with significance level at p&lt;0 05  Results: A total of 56 websites (33 IW, 23 PW) met our inclusion criteria  IW offered online meetings more often than PW (60 6% and 39 1%, respectively;p=0 11)  In contrast, PW offered in-person meetings more often than IW (73 9% and 69 7%, respectively;p=0 73)  Excluded websites (30 IW, 14 PW) were further analyzed for their reason for elimination  For IW, the most frequent causes of exclusion in descending order were as follows: irrelevance (30 0%), outdated (26 7%), inaccessible (20 0%), did not specify the mode of meeting (13 3%), and redirected for further information (10 0%)  Listing of outdated sessions was the most common reason for exclusion of PW from the study (57 1%), and the proportion was significantly higher than IW (26 7%) (p=0 01)  Conclusion: Crohnâ€™s disease patients face unique challenges that require special attention  Support groups are an important means of alleviating stress, depression, and anxiety in order to improve their QOL  Yet, due to the COVID-19 social distancing policies, many are refrained from participating in in-person sessions  This study illustrates that more online support group meetings are needed and that professional websites should improve on making regular updates for future meeting sessions  [Formula presented]","Moon, J.; Moon, H.","https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2021.01.176","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Gastroenterology;160(3):S71-S72, 2021.; Publication details: Gastroenterology;160(3):S71-S72, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-25","",11152,""

"Effect of first three months of COVID pandemic on HIV services in Greece: A short survey among HIV physicians","Background/purpose: The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic was successfully contained in Greece with a low infection attack rate  Strict lockdown measures were implemented from March to May 2020  ID physicians were amongst the frontline healthcare workers  The purpose of this survey was to assess the operational effect of COVID-19 on HIV clinics in Greece  Materials/methods: Information was gathered in June 2020, after the lockdown lift, via an anonymous questionnaire distributed to an expert panel of HIV/ID physicians (n = 9)  Results: Participants' clinics provided care in total for 4335 PLWHIV  Of the nine panelists, 80% worked in a COVID-19 reference hospital, 90% had direct involvement in COVID-19 patient care, devoting an average of 90% of their working time on COVID-19  Four COVID-19 cases in PLWHIV were reported (approx  0 1%);one was hospitalised and all recovered without complications  During lockdown all clinics had to cancel scheduled visits (25% completely, 50% covering only emergencies and prescriptions)  All centres stopped routine checks for cardiovascular and other comorbidities and 75% also stopped routine laboratory testing as well as mental health services  Overall there was an 82% drop in routine appointments during lockdown compared to Jan-Feb  Significantly fewer PEP cases were recorded, and there was an approximate 50% drop in new HIV cases (34% were late presenters) compared to the monthly average of Jan-Feb  For 62 5% of the panel there was no concern about poorer adherence to ART or higher risk sexual behaviour for their patients during lockdown;however, all were concerned either moderately (87 5%) or seriously (12 5%) about an increase in substance use  After the first wave some centres limited scheduled appointments to avoid overcrowded clinics, while others considered adding extra ones to compensate for lost visits  Policy was also dictated by the local epidemic situation  Conclusions: This short survey demonstrates that in Greece, in the context of a successful early containment of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a major disruption in HIV services, mainly due to the low number of HIV/ID physicians having to cover multiple roles (including HIV care) and the healthcare system's insufficient capacity to deal with routine care under pressure","Lourida, G.; Leonidou, L.; Psichogiou, M.; Chrysanthidis, T.; Protopappas, K.; Katsarolis, I.; Xylomenos, G.; Panagopoulos, P.; Chini, M.; Papastamopoulos, V.","https://doi.org/10.1002/jia2.25616","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Journal of the International AIDS Society;23(SUPPL 7), 2020.; Publication details: Journal of the International AIDS Society;23(SUPPL 7), 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-25","",11157,""

A mindfulness practice curriculum for the pharmacy workforce","Introduction: Stress and burnout can develop when student pharmacists are still in school  It is imperative to give pharmacists tools to manage their stress early in their career  Mindfulness practice has been shown to reduce stress and improve quality of life (QoL);however, little is known about its utility in pharmacy students  Research Question or Hypothesis: By teaching mindfulness practice through a mindfulness course, pharmacy student stress will be decreased and quality of life will increase at the end of the course curriculum  Study Design: Prospective, case-control, mixed-methods study Methods: A mindfulness curriculum was developed using the Six-Step Approach for Medical Education and offered as an 8-week elective for pre-clinical (PC) pharmacy students from the University of Illinois at Chicago College of Pharmacy  Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), SF 12 v2 Health Related QoL Scale (SF12 v2), and the 5-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (5FMQ) was administered to participants at baseline, week 8 (post-course), and week 12  The primary outcome was change in 5FMQ results from baseline to week 12  Secondary outcomes included comparisons in PSS and SF12 v2 scores between participants and a control group of PC pharmacy students at week 12  Results: Eighteen of 25 students from the mindfulness course consented to participate  Scores increased from baseline to week 12 for four of the five mindfulness facets of observing (3 3-3 5, P = 0 02), awareness (2 6-3 0, P = 0 01), nonjudging (3 0-3 4, P = 0 03), and nonreactivity (2 9-3 5, P &lt; 0 0001) among participants  Compared to controls (n = 20), participants in the mindfulness elective had statistically lower PSS scores at week 12 (18 0 participants versus 19 9 controls, P = 0 037)  Mental health-related QoL was also higher in the participant group versus control group (45 7 versus 36 8 respectively, P = 0 003)  Conclusion: An 8-week mindfulness curriculum significantly increased students' self-report of mindfulness facets and significantly decreased stress and improved mental health-related quality of life compared to controls  This difference was seen during the time of COVID-19 changes","McQuade, B.

"Mental health in populations of different countries during COVID-19 pandemic","The review paper examines the results of studies of symptoms of mental disorders, as well as traumatic and protective factors during the onset of the pandemic of coronavirus infection (COVID-19) in populations in different countries  The results of screening studies using telephone and Internet surveys suggest a significant increase in the incidence of symptoms of anxiety, depressive, stress disorders, as well as addictions to psychoactive substances in 2020  The traumatic effect of complex and long-term risk factors and uncertainties has been established  Among the protective factors are reliable social support, professional employment, lack of financial problems

"Suicide prevention during COVID-19: identification of groups with reduced presentations to emergency departments","Reductions in suicidal and self-harm presentations to emergency departments (EDs) since COVID-19 indicate changes in help-seeking behaviours, but it is unknown if hospital avoidance equally affects all population groups. Socio-demographic and clinical information relating to suicidal and self-harm presentations to EDs in Queensland, Australia, were compared for the period before (March-August 2019) and since the COVID-19 outbreak (March-August 2020). Since COVID, Indigenous Australians and persons with less severe suicidal and self-harm presentations had significantly reduced presentations, while persons younger than 18 years had more presentations. Less suicidal presentations resulted in an admission to inpatient care. Patterns of reduced attendance to ED in some groups suggest the need for innovative and community-based models of care to help prevent suicides during the pandemic.","Sveticic, Stapelberg, Turner","https://doi.org/10.1177/1039856221992632","20210224","COVID-19; emergency department; presentation; suicide; triage score","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-25","",11162,""
"COVID-19 related mental health issues: a narrative review of psychometric properties of scales and methodological concerns in scale development","The global crisis of COVID-19 and its consequential strict public health measures placed around the world have impacted mental health. New scales and tools have been developed to measure these mental health effects. This narrative review assesses the psychometric properties of these scales and tools and methodological aspects of their development. PubMed, PubMed Central, and Google Scholar were searched for articles published from 15 May 2020 to 15 August 2020. This search used three groups of terms (&quot;tool&quot; OR &quot;scale&quot; AND &quot;mental&quot; OR &quot;psychological&quot;; AND &quot;COVID-19&quot; OR &quot;coronavirus&quot;). The identified scales were further evaluated for their psychometric properties and methodological aspects of their development. Though the studies developing these scales (<i>n</i> = 12) have demonstrated their robust psychometric properties, some methodological concerns are noteworthy. Most of the scales were validated using internet-based surveys, and detailed descriptions of the mode of administration, sampling process, response rates, and augmentation strategies were missing. The heterogeneous and inadequate reporting of methods adopted to evaluate the psychometric properties of the identified scales can limit their utility in clinical and research settings. We suggest developing guidelines and checklists to improve the design and testing, and result in reporting of online-administered scales to assess the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ransing, Dashi, Rehman, Mehta, Chepure, Kilic, Hayatudeen, Orsolini, Vahdani, Adiukwu, Gonzalez-Diaz, Larnaout, Pinto da Costa, Grandinetti, Soler-Vidal, BytyÃƒÂ§i, Shalbafan, Nofal, Pereira-Sanchez, Ramalho","https://doi.org/10.1177/1039856221992645","20210224","COVID-19; assessment; instruments; mental health; tools","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-25","",11163,""
"How does COVID-19 affect electoral participation? evidence from the French municipal elections","This article investigates the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on electoral participation. We study the French municipal elections that took place at the very beginning of the ongoing pandemic and held in over 9,000 municipalities on March 15, 2020. In addition to the simple note that turnout rates decreased to a historically low level, we establish a robust relationship between the depressed turnout rate and the disease. Using various estimation strategies and employing a large number of potential confounding factors, we find that the participation rate decreases with city proximity to COVID-19 clusters. Furthermore, the proximity has conditioned impacts according to the proportion of elderly -who are the most threatened- within the city. Cities with higher population density, where the risk of infection is higher, and cities where only one list ran at the election, which dramatically reduces competitiveness, experienced differentiated effects of distance.","Noury, FranÃƒÂ§ois, Gergaud, Garel","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0247026","20210224","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-25","",11164,""

"The Building Educators' Skills in Adolescent Mental Health Training Program for Secondary School Educators: Protocol for a Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial","In Australia, secondary school educators are well positioned to recognize mental illness among students and provide support. However, many report that they lack the knowledge and confidence to do so, and few mental health training programs available for educators are evidence based. To address this gap, the Black Dog Institute (BDI) developed a web-based training program (Building Educators' Skills in Adolescent Mental Health [BEAM]) that aims to improve mental health knowledge, confidence, and helping behaviors among secondary school educators in leadership positions. A pilot study of the training program found it to be positively associated with increased confidence and helping behaviors among educators and reduced personal psychological distress. An adequately powered randomized controlled trial (RCT) is needed. The primary objective of this cluster RCT is to evaluate the effectiveness of the BEAM program for improving educators' confidence in managing student mental health. The trial will also evaluate the effect of the BEAM program in increasing educators' frequency of providing help to students and improving their mental health knowledge and reducing educators' psychological distress and stigma toward students with mental health issues. The target sample size is 234 educators from 47 secondary schools across New South Wales, Australia. Four waves of recruitment and enrollment into the trial are planned. Schools will participate in one wave only and will be randomized to the intervention or waitlist control conditions. Participants from the same school will be assigned to the same condition. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, posttest (10 weeks after baseline), and follow-up (22 weeks after baseline) using the BDI eHealth research platform. Intervention participants will receive access to the BEAM program for 10 weeks upon completion of baseline, and the control condition will receive access for 10 weeks upon completion of the follow-up assessment. Recruitment for this trial began on July 21, 2020, with the first baseline assessments occurring on August 17, 2020. To date, 295 participants from 71 schools have completed baseline. Due to the unexpected success of recruitment in the first 3 waves, the final fourth wave has been abandoned. Intervention participants are currently receiving the program, with follow-up due for completion in March 2021. This is one of the first RCTs to examine the effectiveness of a web-based adolescent mental health training program for Australian secondary school educators in leadership positions. If found to be effective, this training program will offer a sustainable and scalable delivery method for upskilling educators in caring for students' mental health.

"COVID-19 and rheumatoid arthritis","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) face unique challenges during the pandemic, including concerns regarding infection risk, drug shortages, limited access to care, social isolation, and mental health. This review will examine the multifaceted impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients living with RA. In patients with RA, risk factors for severe COVID-19 outcomes include older age and comorbidities, similar to those in the general population. Glucocorticoids, but not other classes of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), appear to be associated with a higher risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes. RA patients have been affected by changes in access to care, telemedicine, drug shortages, anxiety, and social isolation, which may contribute to disease flares. Glucocorticoids, but not other DMARDs, are associated with a higher risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes in RA patients. Further studies are needed to explore the impact of specific DMARDs on COVID-19 outcomes, understand the broader implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on RA disease activity, and optimize the use of telemedicine in RA management.","D'Silva, Wallace","https://doi.org/10.1097/BOR.0000000000000786","20210224","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-25","",11167,""

Logistic regression identified factors associated with treatment, infection, and financial worry. Thematic qualitative analysis generated information around participants' experiences and worries related to COVID-19 and healthcare. Characteristics including marital status, race/ethnicity, cancer type, time since last treatment, education, and age were associated with health and healthcare worry outcomes. Survivors commonly expressed uncertainty about future care, fears about in-person appointments, rationed COVID-19 care, recurrence due to care delays, and distress about untreated symptoms, including mental health issues. Early in the pandemic, survivors worried about and experienced cancer care delays, COVID infection, and how the pandemic would affect their prognosis.

AÃ‚Â systematic search was carried out for studies investigating the psychosocial consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic for residents, their visitors and families as well as nursing home staff. Results were analyzed by narrative synthesis. A total of 756 studies were screened and 15Ã‚Â studies were included. These studies were conducted between February and June 2020 with participants from 14Ã‚Â countries. Participants reported loneliness, grief and depressive symptoms among residents. Some gave an account of fear as aÃ‚Â reaction of residents to social distancing. Residents with cognitive impairment suffered more although there are conflicting reports. The well-being of visitors and friends was compromised and their feeling of loneliness increased. Nursing home personnel reported fear of getting infected and of infecting residents or their own families. Infected workers in the USA expressed anger about aÃ‚Â lack of protection. Furthermore, an increase in workload was reported. Studies conducted during the first months of the pandemic reported negative consequences for the psychosocial well-being of residents, their visitors and nursing home staff.

"Genetic Correlates of Psychological Responses to the COVID-19 Crisis in Young Adult Twins in Great Britain","We investigated how the COVID-19 crisis and the extraordinary experience of lockdown affected young adults in England and Wales psychologically. One month after lockdown commenced (T2), we assessed 30 psychological and behavioural traits in more than 4000 twins in their mid-twenties and compared their responses to the same traits assessed in 2018 (T1). Mean changes from T1 to T2 were modest and inconsistent. Contrary to the hypothesis that major environmental changes related to COVID-19 would result in increased variance in psychological and behavioural traits, we found that the magnitude of individual differences did not change from T1 to T2. Twin analyses revealed that while genetic factors accounted for about half of the reliable variance at T1 and T2, they only accounted forÃ¢â‚¬â€°~Ã¢â‚¬â€°15% of individual differences in change from T1 to T2, and that nonshared environmental factors played a major role in psychological and behavioural changes. Shared environmental influences had negligible impact on T1, T2 or T2 change. Genetic factors correlated on average .86 between T1 and T2 and accounted for over half of the phenotypic stability, as would be expected for a 2-year interval even without the major disruption of lockdown. We conclude that the first month of lockdown has not resulted in major psychological or attitudinal shifts in young adults, nor in major changes in the genetic and environmental origins of these traits. Genetic influences on the modest psychological and behavioural changes are likely to be the result of gene-environment correlation not interaction.","Rimfeld, Malanchini, Allegrini, Packer, McMillan, Ogden, Webster, Shakeshaft, Schofield, Pingault, Stringaris, von Stumm, Plomin","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10519-021-10050-2","20210224","COVID-19; Depression; Life satisfaction; Psychological stress; Psychopathology; Response to global pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-25","",11170,""
"Impact of a Yogic Breathing Technique on the Well-Being of Healthcare Professionals During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has created unprecedented challenges for healthcare globally, the brunt of which has been borne by the health care providers (HCPs). These challenges are felt more keenly in India, as they stretch an insufficiently resourced healthcare system. The long hours, cross over of responsibilities, lack of resources to adequately care for patients, and concerns around safety of self and loves ones, have led to a spike in anxiety, depression, insomnia and other stress - related disorders in healthcare providers. Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY) is a mind-body intervention that has been studied in multiple clinical populations. Prior to this study, there has been no exploration of the impact of SKY on healthcare providers, specifically the impact of a mind-body intervention like SKY on HCPs during a pandemic. This study aims to investigate the impact of SKY on the well-being of HCPs during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a pilot feasibility study with a single arm pre-post design. SKY was taught to participants in a 4-day online breath and meditation workshop. We measured outcomes related to depression, anxiety, resilience, life satisfaction, and quality of sleep. Ninety-two subjects completed the study survey before and after the intervention. A significant reduction was observed in the levels of stress, anxiety and depression immediately after the program. In addition, the participants reported sig1nificant improvement in life satisfaction, resilience, and the quality of their sleep. The results indicate that SKY breathing technique had a positive impact on the well-being of healthcare professionals during the pandemic. Participants experienced improved quality of sleep, enhanced satisfaction with life, and increased resilience after SKY. This pilot study provides important data for future multi-site randomized controlled trials to study the impact of yogic techniques on well-being of the HCPs.","Divya, Bharathi, Somya, Darshan","https://doi.org/10.1177/2164956120982956","20210224","Sudarshan Kriya Yoga; healthcare providers; pandemic; resilience; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-25","",11171,""
"Depression and anxiety in the Malaysian urban population and their association with demographic characteristics, quality of life, and the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic","The prevalence of depression and anxiety has been shown to be higher in the urban population compared with the rural population.

This includes how the clinic has initially responded to the crisis as well as recommendations for providing services to refugee newcomers as the COVID-19 crisis evolves. Recommendations include the following actions: (1) consider social determinants of health in the new context of COVID-19; (2) provide services through a trauma-informed lens; (3) increase focus on continuity of health and mental health care; (4) mobilize International Medical Graduates for triaging patients based on COVID-19 symptoms; and (5) diversify communication efforts to educate refugees about COVID-19.","Smith, Basabose, Brockett, Browne, Shamon, Stephenson","https://doi.org/10.3122/jabfm.2021.S1.200115","20210224","Access to Health Care; COVID-19; Community Health Centers; Community Medicine; Cross-Cultural Comparison; Family Medicine; Mental Health; Minority Health; Ontario; Refugees; Social Determinants of Health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-25","",11177,""
"Capacity of Primary Care to Deliver Telehealth in the United States","Because of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) pandemic, many primary care practices have transitioned to telehealth visits to keep patients at home and decrease the transmission of the disease. Yet, little is known about the nationwide capacity for delivering primary care services via telehealth. Using the 2016 National Ambulatory Medical Survey we estimated the number and proportion of reported visits and services that could be provided via telehealth. We also performed cross-tabulations to calculate the number and proportion of physicians providing telephone visits and e-mail/internet encounters. Of the total visits (nearly 400 million) to primary care physicians, 42% were amenable to telehealth and 73% of the total services rendered could be delivered through telehealth modalities. Of the primary care physicians, 44% provided telephone consults and 19% provided e-consults. This study underscores how and where primary care services could be delivered. It provides the first estimates of the capacity of primary care to provide telehealth services for COVID-19 related illness, and for several other acute and chronic medical conditions. It also highlights the fact that, as of 2016, most outpatient telehealth visits were done via telephone. This study provides an estimate of the primary care capacity to deliver telehealth and can guide practices and payers as care delivery models change in a post-COVID 19 environment.","Jetty, Jabbarpour, Westfall, Kamerow, Petterson, Westfall","https://doi.org/10.3122/jabfm.2021.S1.200202","20210224","COVID-19; Child Health; Family Medicine; Mental Health; Pandemics; Primary Care Physicians; Primary Health Care; Rural Health; Social Determinants of Health; Telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-25","",11178,""
"Psychological distress in the Greek general population during the first COVID-19 lockdown","SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread worldwide, threatening public health and financial and social life. The current study's aim was to determine the prevalence of psychological distress and post-traumatic stress symptoms in the Greek population during the first COVID-19 lockdown, and to detect potential correlates. An anonymous online survey was conducted between 10 April and 4 May 2020, to collect information regarding people's psychological functioning and COVID-19-related perceptions. A total of 1443 individuals completed the survey; 293 (20%) reported clinically significant anxiety symptoms, 188 (12.9%) reported clinically significant depressive symptoms and 506 (36.4%) suffered from definite post-traumatic stress disorder. Anxiety symptoms were independently associated with female gender (ÃŽÂ² = 1.281, 95% CI 0.808-1.755, P &lt; 0.001), educational level (ÃŽÂ² = -1.570, 95% CI -2.546 to -0.595, P = 0.002), perceived severity (ÃŽÂ² = -1.745, 95% CI -3.146 to -0.344, P = 0.015) and COVID-19-related worry (ÃŽÂ² = 7.633, 95% CI 6.206-9.060, P &lt; 0.001). Depressive symptoms were strongly correlated with educational level (ÃŽÂ² = -1.298, 95% CI -2.220 to -0.377, P = 0.006), perceived severity (ÃŽÂ² = -1.331, 95% CI -2.579 to -0.082, P = 0.037) and COVID-19-related worry (ÃŽÂ² = 4.102, 95% CI 2.769-5.436, P &lt; 0.001). Finally, post-traumatic stress symptoms were linked to female gender (ÃŽÂ² = 6.451, 95% CI 4.602-8.299, P &lt; 0.001), educational level (ÃŽÂ² = -5.737, 95% CI -9.479 to -1.996, P = 0.003), psychiatric history (ÃŽÂ² = -4.028, 95% CI -6.274 to -1.782, P &lt; 0.001) and COVID-19-related worry (ÃŽÂ² = 23.865, 95% CI 18.201-29.530, P &lt; 0.001). A significant percentage of the population reported clinically important anxiety, depressive and post-traumatic stress symptoms. Women, less-educated individuals and people with a psychiatric history appeared more vulnerable to the pandemic's psychological impact.","Karaivazoglou, Konstantopoulou, Kalogeropoulou, Iliou, Vorvolakos, Assimakopoulos, Gourzis, Alexopoulos","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2021.17","20210224","COVID-19; lockdown measures; post-traumatic stress; psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-25","",11179,""
"COVID-19, Structural Racism, and Mental Health Inequities: Policy Implications for an Emerging Syndemic","The complex interactions between the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, structural racism, and mental health inequities have led to devastating health, economic, and social consequences. The intersection of these three conditions, which meets criteria for a syndemic (synergistic epidemics), presents numerous policy challenges-and opportunities. Addressing these issues in a unified manner, using a syndemic theory approach, can lead to significant progress and effective solutions for otherwise intransigent problems in society. This article proposes steps that can be taken to protect &quot;essential workers&quot; and other &quot;vulnerable&quot; populations; engage and empower communities; optimize community-led crisis response interventions; improve data collection about the intersection of COVID-19, structural racism, and mental health inequities; support school-based interventions; expand financial supports for mental health service delivery; expand health care insurance coverage to increase access and lower out-of-pocket costs; and promote workforce diversity. Emphasis on local, state, and federal policy interventions that prioritize equity and justice and focus on collective health and well-being will ultimately lead us on a more sustainable and equitable path.","Shim, Starks","https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.202000725","20210224","Coronavirus/COVID-19; Public policy issues; Racism; Sociopolitical issues","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-25","",11180,""
"Frontline Health Care Workers' Mental Workload During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study","Workload is an essential factor affecting the performance of health care workers (HCWs). High level of mental workload increased their risks of insomnia, anxiety, and depression. This study committed to investigate frontline HCWs' mental workload and analyze its influencing factors during the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A total of 802 frontline HCWs completed the online questionnaires. Their total mental workload score was 69.7 Ã‚Â± 16.4. Frontline HCWs were satisfied with their performance (4.0 Ã‚Â± 3.3) and showed a low level of frustration (8.3 Ã‚Â± 5.7). The most important dimensions of mental workload were &quot;effort&quot; (16.4 Ã‚Â± 13.7), &quot;physical demand&quot; (15.7 Ã‚Â± 4.7), and &quot;mental demand&quot; (12.9 Ã‚Â± 5.2). Frontline nurses and HCWs who have higher education level, longer working years, and higher professional title perceived higher mental workload scores (<i>P</i> &lt; .05). In conclusion, frontline HCWs' mental workload was not high as seen during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. They have made tremendous efforts and dedication to caring for COVID-19 patients. Job-related factors, some of which can be eliminated by proper management skills, increased frontline HCWs mental workload.","Du, Hu","https://doi.org/10.1177/1010539521997257","20210224","COVID-19; NASA-TLX; cross-sectional study; health care workers; mental workload","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-25","",11181,""
"Self-reported impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, affective responding, and subjective well-being - A Swedish survey","A rapid stream of research confirms that the COVID-19 pandemic is a global threat to mental health and psychological well-being. It is therefore important to identify both hazardous and protective individual factors during the pandemic. The current research examined the relationships between self-reported affective responding, perceived personal consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, and subjective well-being. An online survey (N = 471) conducted in Sweden between June and September, 2020, showed that higher levels of irritability, impulsivity, and the tendency to experience and express anger were generally associated with more severe personal consequences of the pandemic, particularly in areas related to family life, work/study, and finances. While more severe impacts of the pandemic in these areas of life were directly associated with lower subjective well-being, emotion regulation through cognitive reappraisal appeared to moderate the extent to which consequences of the pandemic in other areas of life (i.e., social, free-time and physical activities) translated into decreased well-being. This suggests that cognitive reappraisal may serve to protect against some of the debilitating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. Overall, the results indicate that the perceived consequences of the pandemic are multifaceted and that future research should examine these consequences using a multidimensional approach.","Maria GrÃ¶ndal et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4603C-DA5-49A","20210225","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-25","",11182,""
"Spatial maps of emotions reveal links between environment, mental health, and interoception","People reason, feel, and interact in extensive environments. As they explore their surroundings, their space becomes intertwined with emotional experiences. Yet, beyond navigational behaviours, little is known about the distribution of emotions and cognition in topographical space. Here we developed a novel method that, even in the absence of mobility (i.e., during the national Covid-19 lockdown), allowed us to sample the link between emotions, environment, mental health, and the capability to sense/interpret inner bodily sensations (interoception). We gave participants maps of the region on which they lived and asked them to indicate, by applying shade to the map, the areas where they had happy and sad memories, and where they wanted to go after the nationwide Covid-19 lockdown. We also asked them to complete two self-report questionnaires on mental health and interoceptive awareness. By adapting neuroimaging methods, we examined shaded pixels instead of voxels in the brain to quantify where in the maps and how strong different emotions relate to oneâ€™s geographical space. The results revealed that positive emotions, mental health, and internal bodily regulation were associated with discrete, yet partially overlapping spatial locations. Importantly, participantsâ€™ mapping response and where they wanted to go after the lockdown overlapped significantly with natural environments (vs. non-natural). Considering that environments feature relevant resources for the attainment of psychophysiological balance, our results provide new evidence that supports contemporary models of allostasis in topographical space. Revealing spatial maps of emotions and linking these to individualsâ€™ differences provides a novel spatially contextualised biomarker for physical and mental disorders.","Alejandro Galvez-Pol et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4602B-8D6-7B7","20210205","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Psychology|Natural Environments; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Physiology; interoception; covid-19; nature; mental health; environment; emotions; allostasis","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-25","",11183,""
"The Parents are Not Alright: A Call for Parental Mental Health Screening During the COVID-19 Pandemic","This commentary provides an overview and rationale for additive screening and prevention of mental health issues in caregivers (e.g. parents, etc.) during the COVID-19 pandemic. While universal screening is recommended, particular emphasis is placed on enhancing screening for caregivers more likely to experience increased or prolonged emotional distress during this extraordinary time, such as those with pre-existent mental health symptoms, those experiencing racism, financial challenges, health difficulties and/or bereavement. Specific recommendations for ways in which medical providers and other specialty care providers working with youth might enhance their screening procedures to be inclusive of caregivers are provided, along with prevention and intervention steps that may be initiated if mental health concerns are detected.","Tara Peris et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46211-F9C-226","20210114","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Clinical Child Psychology; prevention; covid-19; caregivers; screening; parents","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-25","",11184,""
"Reflections on running online expert advisory groups with young people with lived experience of depression","Service user involvement is fundamental to healthcare research, including knowledge transfer, advising on study protocols and the development of interventions. However, to date, service user involvement within child and adolescent mental health research is still uncommon and there is limited focus on best practice within the literature. Furthermore, consultations and advisory groups have traditionally been held face-to-face; however, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated a shift towards online research involvement as an alternative. This paper will examine our experience of conducting online expert advisory groups with young people (aged 14-24) with lived experience of depression and describe challenges and adaptations that need to be considered in order to make the events safe and accessible. Based on our own reflections of the process and feedback from young people taking part, we highlight the grouping of young people, facilitating pre-session nerves, intergroup communication and accessibility of online engagement. Young peoplesâ€™ reflections on the value of the advisory groups are also discussed. We conclude by offering suggestions, based on our reflections, for future online research consultations.","Juliette Westbrook et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460AD-A9D-83B","20210225","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; view of self; consultation; ppi; self-evaluation; online; service user involvemen; young people; depression; ypag","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-25","",11185,""
