"Uncovering Survivorship Bias in Longitudinal Mental Health Surveys","To our knowledge, survivorship bias in longitudinal mental health survey studies has not been systematically assessed. We therefore assessed potential survivorship bias among 4,039 respondents invited to complete multiple surveys in 2020 for The COVID-19 Outbreak Public Evaluation (COPE) Initiative. Demographic differences in follow-up survey participation included lower retention of younger adults. Adjusting for demographics, individuals who completed only one or two out of four surveys had higher prevalences of anxiety and depression symptoms in April 2020 (e.g., one-survey versus four-survey, anxiety symptoms, aPR=1.30, 95%CI=1.08-1.55, P=0.0045; depression symptoms, aPR=1.43, 95%CI=1.17-1.75, P=0.0005). Among respondents who completed April-2020 and May-2020 surveys, individuals who experienced incident anxiety or depression symptoms significantly higher odds of lower participation in subsequent follow-up surveys (aOR=1.68, 95%CI=1.49-2.48, aOR=1.56, 95%CI=1.15-2.12, respectively, both P<0.005). These findings indicate that longitudinal mental health survey studies may be subject to survivorship bias, which could lead to overly optimistic interpretations of mental health trends.","Mark Ã‰.

"Impact of COVID-19 restrictions on the postpartum experience of women living in Eastern Canada: A mixed method cohort study","OBJECTIVES: To (1) compare changes in self-efficacy, social support, postpartum anxiety and postpartum depression in Canadian women collected before (Cohort 1) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (Cohort 2); (2) explore the women felt related to having a newborn during the pandemic; and (3) explore ways that women coped. METHODS: Prior to the pandemic (October 1, 2019-January 1, 2020), an online survey was conducted with women had given birth within the past six months in one of the three Eastern Canadian Maritime provinces (Cohort 1). A second, similar survey was conducted between August 1, 2020 and October 31, 2020 (Cohort 2) during a period of provincial pandemic response to COVID-19. RESULTS: For Cohort 1, 561 women completed the survey and 335 women in Cohort 2. Cohorts were similar in terms of age of women, parity, and age of newborn. There were no significant differences for self-efficacy, social support, postpartum anxiety, and depression between the cohorts. Difficulties that women reported as a result of COVID-19 restrictions included lack of support from family and friends, fear of COVID-19 exposure, feeling isolated and uncertain, negative impact on perinatal care experience, and hospital restrictions. Having support from partners and families, in-person/virtual support, as well as self-care and the low prevalence of COVID-19 during the summer of 2020 helped women cope. CONCLUSION: While there was no significant difference in pre-pandemic and during pandemic psychosocial outcomes, there were still challenges and negative impacts that women identified. Consideration of vulnerable populations is important when making public health recommendations.","Justine Dol; Brianna Richardson; Megan Aston; Douglas McMillan; Gail Tomblin Murphy; Marsha Campbell-Yeo","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.30.21250555","20210201","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-01","",10060,""

"Anticipated mental health consequences of coronavirus in a nationally-representative sample: Context, coverage, and economic consequences","The COVID-19 pandemic will have long-term consequences due to social and economic disruption. This study aimed to understand the contextual, media, and economic factors associated with anticipated mental health consequences from the COVID-19 pandemic among Americans. A nationally representative survey of 1001 respondents was conducted in April 2020. Chi-square tests and logistic regressions examined anticipated emotional or psychological effects on respondents or members of their households should social distancing measures continue. Specific analyses focused on: 1) COVID-19 experience - knowing someone or being infected; living in a state with a high death rate; or state social distancing policies; 2) media exposure - source of coronavirus information and time spent on coronavirus news; and 3) economics - current economic effects; and anticipated long-term financial effects. 41% of respondents anticipated mental health consequences. Living in a state with a greater COVID-19 death rate (OR 1.73; 95% CI 1.10, 2.72) and anticipating long-term financial difficulties (OR 2.98; 95% CI 1.93, 4.60) were both associated with greater likelihood of anticipated mental health consequences. Those whose primary news source was television, as opposed to print or online, were almost 50% less likely to anticipate mental health challenges (OR 0.52 CI 0.33, 0.81), while those who reported spending two or more hours daily on COVID-19 news were 90% more likely (OR 1.90; 95% CI 1.27, 2.85). Aspects of community health, media consumption, and economic impacts influence anticipated poor mental health from the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting each domain is relevant to interventions to address the consequences.","Piltch-Loeb, Merdjanoff, Meltzer","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2021.106441","20210201","COVID-19; Communications media; Economic status; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-01","",10063,""
"Patient Volume and Dispositions in a VA Psychiatric Emergency Room During COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic led to a decline in emergency department visits in the United States. Less is known about how COVID-19 has impacted psychiatric emergency services (PES). This report compares visits to the Connecticut Department of Veterans Affairs psychiatric emergency room from March-August 2020 to the same period from three prior years (2017, 2018, 2019) to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on patient volume and dispositions. Compared to prior years, there was a decline in visits in March-August 2020, particularly in April. This coincided with the peak of COVID-19 in the state. Rates of hospitalizations remained consistent, while rates of referrals to residential programs decreased. The decline in visits likely indicates that many veterans postponed necessary mental health and substance use treatment. This delay could have significant clinical ramifications for veterans and may lead to an eventual surge in demand for emergency mental health care.","Mitchell, Fuehrlein","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10597-021-00778-w","20210130","COVID-19; Emergency; Mental health; Patient volume; Veterans","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-01","",10064,""
"Words matter: political and gender analysis of speeches made by heads of government during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has put a spotlight on political leadership around the world. Differences in how leaders address the pandemic through public messages have practical implications for building trust and an effective response within a country. We analysed the speeches made by 20 heads of government around the world (Bangladesh, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Dominican Republic, Finland, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, New Zealand, Niger, Norway, Russia, South Africa, Scotland, Sint Maarten, United Kingdom, United States and Taiwan) to highlight the differences between men and women leaders in discussing COVID-19. We used an inductive analytical approach, coding speeches for specific themes based on language and content. Five primary themes emerged across a total of 122 speeches on COVID-19, made by heads of government: economics and financial relief, social welfare and vulnerable populations, nationalism, responsibility and paternalism, and emotional appeals. While all leaders described the economic impact of the pandemic, women spoke more frequently about the impact on the individual scale. Women leaders were also more often found describing a wider range of social welfare services, including: mental health, substance abuse and domestic violence. Both men and women from lower-resource settings described detailed financial relief and social welfare support that would impact the majority of their populations. While 17 of the 20 leaders used war metaphors to describe COVID-19 and the response, men largely used these with greater volume and frequency. While this analysis does not attempt to answer whether men or women are more effective leaders in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, it does provide insight into the rhetorical tools and types of language used by different leaders during a national and international crisis. This analysis provides additional evidence on the differences in political leaders' messages and priorities to inspire citizens' adhesion to the social contract in the adoption of response and recovery measures. However, it does not consider the influence of contexts, such as the public audience, on leaders' strategic communication approaches.","Dada, Ashworth, Bewa, Dhatt","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2020-003910","20210201","Public health; communication; health policy; health systems; leadership","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-01","",10065,""
"Prevalence and its associated factors of depressive symptoms among Chinese college students during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a mental health crisis around the world. The psychological health of college students also faces great challenges. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and the related factors of depressive symptoms among Chinese college students. This online cross-sectional survey was conducted via Wenjuanxing platform from March 3-15, 2020 and received 1681 effective questionnaires. Each questionnaire contains the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale, the Multi-Dimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, the Herth Hope Index, and the self-designed items. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to determine the significantly associated factors of depressive symptoms. The prevalence of depressive symptoms among college students was 56.8%. Sleep problems (OR 2.678, 95%CI 2.094-3.424), family members' going out (OR 1.775, 95%CI 1.089-2.894), perceived more stress for online education (OR 1.642, 95%CI 1.191-2.263), fear of COVID-19 (OR 1.450, 95%CI 1.121-1.876), influence on social interaction (OR 1.354, 95%CI 1.053-1.741) and higher grade (OR 1.378, 95%CI 1.046-1.816) were considered as risk factors of depressive symptoms. Perceived social support (OR 0.354, 95%CI 0.259-0.484), hope (OR 0.052, 95%CI 0.034-0.080), female (OR:0.557, 95%CI 0.427-0.725) and higher monthly disposable income (OR 0.666, 95%CI 0.447-0.993) were identified as protective factors against depressive symptoms.

"Reduction of roadway noise in a coastal city underwater soundscape during COVID-19 confinement","Confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic drastically reduced human activities. Underwater soundscape variations are discussed in this study, comparing a typical and confinement day in a coastal lagoon near a popular tourist city in Mexico. Recording devices were located at 2Ã¢â‚¬â€°m in depth and 430Ã¢â‚¬â€°m away from the main promenade-a two-way avenue for light vehicle traffic-where main tourist infrastructure is located. The nearby marine environment is habitat to birds and dolphins as well as fish and invertebrates of commercial importance. Medium and small boats usually transit the area. The main underwater sound level reduction was measured at low frequencies (10-2000Ã¢â‚¬â€°Hz) because of the decrease in roadway noise. Vessel traffic also decreased by almost three quarters, although the level reduction due to this source was less noticeable. As typical day levels in the roadway noise band can potentially mask fish sounds and affect other low frequency noise-sensitive marine taxa, this study suggests that comprehensive noise analysis in coastal marine environments should consider the contribution from nearby land sources.","Leon-Lopez, Romero-Vivas, Viloria-Gomora","https://doi.org/10.1121/10.0003354","20210201","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-01","",10067,""
"Anxiety and Panic Buying Behaviour during COVID-19 Pandemic-A Qualitative Analysis of Toilet Paper Hoarding Contents on Twitter","<i>Background</i>: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had increased population-level anxiety and had elicited panic buying behaviour across the world. The over-hoarding of toilet paper has received a lot of negative public attention. In this work, we used Twitter data to qualitatively analyse tweets related to panic buying of toilet paper during the crisis. <i>Methods</i>: A total of 255,171 tweets were collected. Of these 4081 met our inclusion criteria and 100 tweets were randomly selected to develop a coding scheme in the initial phase. Random samples of tweets in folds of 100 were then qualitatively analysed in the focused coding phase until saturation was met at 500 tweets analysed. <i>Results</i>: Five key themes emerged: (1) humour or sarcasm, (2) marketing or profiteering, (3) opinion and emotions, (4) personal experience, and (5) support or information. About half of the tweets carried negative sentiments, expressing anger or frustration towards the deficiency of toilet paper and the frantic situation of toilet paper hoarding, which were among the most influential tweets. <i>Discussion</i>: Panic buying of toilet paper was seen during the 2020 pandemic period with a mass amount of related content spread across social media. The spontaneous contagion of fear and panic through social media could fuel psychological reactions in midst of crises. The high level of negative social media posts regarding the toilet paper crisis acts as an emotional trigger of public anxiety and panic. <i>Conclusions</i>: Social media data can provide rapid infodemiology of public mental health. In a pandemic or crisis situation, real-time data could be monitored and content-analysed for authorities to promptly address public concerns.","Leung, Chung, Tisdale, Chiu, Lim, Chan","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18031127","20210201","COVID-19; anxiety; pandemic; panic buying; psychological phenomena; snowball effect; social media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-01","",10068,""
"Assessing Mental Health in Emerging Adulthood through a Mental Health Navigator: A Study Protocol","Even the same psychological disorders present themselves differently among individuals, underscoring the need for a personalized model approach to the study of psychopathology. Emerging adulthood is a developmental phase wherein individuals experience unique vulnerability to the development of psychopathology given their exposure to repeated stressors and their disruptions in routine, making them a population worthy of investigation. This prospective study aims to leverage multimodal assessments to examine the feasibility of an individualized approach to understanding contextual factors relevant to changes in daily affect, sleep, physiology, and activities in the service of using event mining to predict changes in mental health. Recruited participants (expected final N = 20) will be monitored for a period of time (between 3 and 12 months). Participants will download the Personicle application on their smartphone to track activities (e.g., home events, cycling) and be given wearable sensor devices to wear continuously (monitors sleep, physiology, and physical activity). They will be asked to report daily mood and complete weekly open-ended text responses as well as a battery of questionnaires every 3 months. Our study has been approved by the Institutional Review Board and is currently undergoing data collection. Adjustments were made due to the COVID-19 pandemic to enable remote data collection and assess for COVID-19-related stress.

"Efficacy of a Six-Week Therapist-Guided Online Therapy Versus Self-Help Internet-Based Therapy on COVID-19 Invoked Anxiety and Depression Among Individuals in Oman: An Open-Label, Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial","The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a notable increase in psychological distress, globally. Oman is no exception to this, with several studies indicating high levels of anxiety and depression among the Omani public. There is a need for adaptive and effective interventions aiming at improving the increased levels of psychological distress arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed at assessing the efficacy of therapist guided Online-Therapy versus self-help, e-mail delivered, therapy focusing on COVID-19-induced symptoms of anxiety and depression among individuals living in Oman during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was a 6-week pragmatic randomized controlled trial involving 60 participants who were recruited from a study sample surveyed for symptoms of anxiety/depression among the public in Oman amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The participants in the intervention group were allocated to receive 1 online session per week for 6 weeks from certified psychotherapists in Oman in Arabic or English. The Psychotherapists utilized Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) interventions. The participants in the control group received an automatic weekly newsletter via e-mail containing self-help information and tips to cope with distress associated with COVID-19. The information mainly consisted of behavioral tips revolving around the principles of CBT and ACT. The primary outcome was measured by comparing the change in the mean Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scores from baseline to the end of the study (after six sessions) between the two arms. The secondary outcome was comparing the proportions of participants with depression and anxiety in the two groups. Data from 46 participants were analyzed (22 in intervention arm and 24 in control arm). There was no statistical difference in baseline characteristics between both arms. Analysis of covariance indicated a significant reduction in the GAD scores (F(1,43) = 7.307; P=.010) between the two arms after adjusting for baseline scores. The intervention arm GAD scores reduced more than those of the control arm (B = -3.27; P=.010). The intervention arm had a greater reduction in PHQ-9 mean scores (F(1,43) = 8.298; P=.006) when compared to the control arm (B = -4.311; P=.006). While the levels of anxiety and depression reduced in both study arms, the reduction was higher in the intervention group (P values of .049 and .022, respectively). This study provides preliminary evidence to support the efficacy of Online-Therapy for improving the symptoms of anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 crisis in Oman. Therapist guided Online-Therapy was noted to be superior to self-help Internet-based therapy, however, both therapies could be considered as viable options.

In addition, COVID-19 patients also exhibit a wide range of neurological manifestations (neuro-COVID) which could also benefit from cytokine-based treatments. In fact, these drugs showed some clinical efficacy also in neuroinflammatory diseases. On the other hand, anti-cytokine drugs are endowed with significant neurological risks, mainly attributable to their immune-depressant effects. Therefore, the aim of the present manuscript is to briefly describe the role of specific cytokines in neuroinflammation, to summarize the efficacy in preclinical models of neuroinflammatory diseases of drugs targeting these cytokines, and to review the clinical data regarding the neurological effects of these drugs currently being investigated against COVID-19, in order to raise awareness about their potentially beneficial and/or detrimental neurological consequences.","Pignataro, Cataldi, Taglialatela","https://doi.org/10.1111/bph.15397","20210129","COVID-19; SARS; coronaviruses; neuroinflammation; viral encephalitis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-01","",10075,""

"Mental Health and Coping in the Shadow of the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Israeli Case","The COVID-19 pandemic caught the entire world off guard. Israel, similar to all other nations, was forced to cope with the unknown. &quot;Flattening the curve&quot; of infections has become a common term among specialists and decision makers, while explaining restricting measurements taken toward the population. Israelis, who had previously learned to deal with life under constant security threat, are now facing a new reality. The purpose of the study was to check how Israelis are psychologically affected by and coping with the COVID-19 pandemic. The study included 925 Israelis divided into three groups: ages 18-29, 30-59, and 60-88. The data were collected between March 31 and April 8, 2020, when it was already clear that this is a global plague, the country's borders were closed, and the government's directive for citizens was to remain at home while imposing limitations on the public and private sectors. The current study examined psychological distress among the three age groups as well as the associations between levels of distress, resilience, and coping strategies. Levels of distress were measured via the BSI-18 that measures anxiety, depression, and somatization. Resilience was measured using the Connor-Davidson CD-RISC scale. Coping was measured by the short version of the COPE. Psychological distress was associated with being in a younger age group, being a woman, having economic concerns, use of emotion and problem focused coping, and lower resilience. The study also found that concern for the health of family members was the strongest concern among all age groups but was highest among the younger age group. It was also found that those in the younger age group suffered from higher levels of depression, anxiety, and somatization compared to the older age group. The middle age group suffered from elevated levels of anxiety and somatization compared to the older age group. Although the older age group was the most vulnerable to the coronavirus, in this study age was found to be a protective factor from psychological distress. The results of the study suggest the need to consider the younger age group as a risk group, which hence needs to be addressed as the focus of intervention programs.

In September 2020 most schools and universities in Spain reopened and teachers felt great uncertainty due to this unprecedented situation. Teachers have accumulated psychological symptoms since the beginning of the pandemic. During the lockdown they had to introduce online teaching and in view of the reopening of schools they have shown great concern for the new unprecedented teaching situation. The present study aims to measure the symptomatology shown by teaching staff in the Basque Autonomous Community at the time when schools were reopened. To do this, we recruited a sample of 1,633 teachers who were given an online questionnaire which, in addition to collecting socio-demographic data, measured stress, anxiety and depression using the DASS-21scale. The results revealed that a high percentage of teachers showed anxiety, depression and stress symptoms. Furthermore, variables such as gender, age, job stability, the level of education at which they teach and parental status also influence this symptomatology. We argue for the need to safeguard the mental health of teachers in order to improve both the quality of teaching and the mental health of students.","Ozamiz-Etxebarria, Berasategi Santxo, Idoiaga Mondragon, Dosil SantamarÃƒÂ­a","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.620718","20210130","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; education; stress; teachers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-01","",10078,""
"Compulsive Internet Pornography Use and Mental Health: A Cross-Sectional Study in a Sample of University Students in the United States","The sustained rise in negative mental health reports among university students is a source of continued global concern, and investigation continues into potential contributors to this rise. This includes the increased prevalence of risky sexual behaviors. Related is the increased prevalence of pornography use. Our study sought to explore the potential relationship between compulsive use of pornography and mental health in university students. Our sample consisted of university students (<i>N</i> = 1031; 34% male, 66% female) from Franciscan University of Steubenville, Steubenville, Ohio. An anonymous survey was sent to all students at the university over the age of 18. The survey was comprised of the following: (1) demographic questions, (2) questions on pornography use and perception, (3) a modified version of the Compulsive Internet Use Scale (mCIUS) assessing various factors associated with compulsive internet pornography use, (4) questions assessing emotional and sexual states relative to pornography use (EmSS), and (5) the 21-question version of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Our results indicate that 56.6% of those surveyed reported lifetime pornography use, with a significantly higher proportion of males than females reporting such use. The majority of students reported accessing pornography through internet-related technologies. Additionally, 17.0, 20.4, and 13.5% of students reported severe or extremely severe levels of depression, anxiety and stress, respectively, with compulsive pornography use significantly affecting all three mental health parameters in both sexes. Exploratory Factor Analysis identified three factors suggesting emotional coping, dependence and preoccupation for the mCIUS items and three factors reflecting interoceptive, impotent, and extrinsic characteristics for the EmSS items. Regression analysis indicated that various demographics, items pertaining to reduced control and social impairment, and other variables pertaining to pornography use predicted mental health outcomes. Faith, morals and personal motivation were the primary variables reported to help reduce pornography use. Our analyses indicate a significant relationship between mental health and pornography use, including behaviors reflecting behavioral addictions, highlighting the necessity for a better understanding and consideration of the potential contribution of internet pornography to negative mental health among university students.","Camilleri, Perry, Sammut","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.613244","20210130","COVID-19; addictive behavior; anxiety; compulsivity; depression; mental health; pornography; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-01","",10079,""
"A Cross-Cultural Exploratory Study of Health Behaviors and Wellbeing During COVID-19","This study explored the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on perceived health behaviors; physical activity, sleep, and diet behaviors, alongside associations with wellbeing. Participants were 1,140 individuals residing in the United Kingdom (<i>n</i> = 230), South Korea (<i>n</i> = 204), Finland (<i>n</i> = 171), Philippines (<i>n</i> = 132), Latin America (<i>n</i> = 124), Spain (<i>n</i> = 112), North America (<i>n</i> = 87), and Italy (<i>n</i> = 80). They completed an online survey reporting possible changes in the targeted behaviors as well as perceived changes in their physical and mental health. Multivariate analyses of covariance (MANCOVA) on the final sample (<i>n</i> = 1,131) revealed significant mean differences regarding perceived physical and mental health &quot;over the last week,&quot; as well as changes in health behaviors during the pandemic by levels of physical activity and country of residence. Follow up analyses indicated that individuals with highest decrease in physical activity reported significantly lower physical and mental health, while those with highest increase in physical activity reported significantly higher increase in sleep and lower weight gain. United Kingdom participants reported lowest levels of physical health and highest increase in weight while Latin American participants reported being most affected by emotional problems. Finnish participants reported significantly higher ratings for physical health. The physical activity by country interaction was significant for wellbeing. MANCOVA also revealed significant differences across physical activity levels and four established age categories. Participants in the oldest category reported being significantly least affected by personal and emotional problems; youngest participants reported significantly more sleep. The age by physical activity interaction was significant for eating.

"Compassion-Focused Group Therapy for Treatment-Resistant OCD: Initial Evaluation Using a Multiple Baseline Design","Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a debilitating mental health disorder that can easily become a treatment-resistant condition. Although effective therapies exist, only about half of the patients seem to benefit from them when we consider treatment refusal, dropout rates, and residual symptoms. Thus, providing effective augmentation to standard therapies could improve existing treatments. Group compassion-focused interventions have shown promise for reducing depression, anxiety, and avoidance related to various clinical problems, but this approach has never been evaluated for OCD individuals. However, cultivating compassion for self and others seems crucial for OCD patients, given the accumulating research suggesting that fear of guilt, along with isolation and self-criticism, can strongly contribute to the development and maintenance of OCD. The primary aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the acceptability, tolerability, and effectiveness of an 8-week group compassion-focused intervention for reducing OCD symptoms, depression, fear of guilt and self-criticism, and increasing common humanity and compassionate self-reassuring skills in treatment-resistant OCD patients. Using a multiple baseline experimental design, the intervention was evaluated in a sample of OCD patients (<i>N</i> = 8) who had completed at least 6 months of CBT treatment for OCD, but who continued to suffer from significant symptoms. Participants were randomized to different baseline assessment lengths; they then received 8 weekly, 120-min group sessions of compassion-focused therapy for OCD (CFT-OCD), and then were tested again at post-treatment and at 1 month follow up. Despite the adverse external circumstances (post-treatment and follow-up data collection were carried out, respectively, at the beginning and in the middle of the Italian lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic), by the end of treatment, all participants demonstrated reliable decreases in OCD symptoms, and these improvements were maintained at 4-week follow-up for seven of eight participants. The intervention was also associated with improvements in fear of guilt, self-criticism, and self-reassurance, but less consistent improvements in depression and common humanity. Participants reported high levels of acceptability of and satisfaction with the intervention. Results suggest that the intervention may be beneficial as either a stand-alone treatment or as an augmentation to other treatments.","Petrocchi, Cosentino, Pellegrini, Femia, D'Innocenzo, Mancini","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.594277","20210130","compassion-focused therapy; compassionate mind training; fear of guilt; multiple baseline design; obsessiveÃ¢â‚¬â€œcompulsive disorder; self-compassion; self-criticism; self-reassuring","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-01","",10081,""
"Impact of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic on Psychological Well-Being of the Pakistani General Population","<b>Background and Objectives:</b> In order to curb the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the countries took preventive measures such as lockdown and restrictions of movements. This can lead to effects on mental health of the population. We studied the impact of COVID-19 on psychological well-being and associated factors among the Pakistani general population. <b>Methods:</b> An online cross-sectional survey was conducted between 26th April and 15th May and included participants from all over the Pakistan. Attitudes and worriedness about COVID-19 pandemic were assessed using a structured questionnaire. A validated English and Urdu version of the World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5) was used to assess the well-being. Factor analysis was done to extract the attitude item domains. Logistic regression was used to assess the factors associated with poor well-being. <b>Results:</b> A total of 1,756 people participated in the survey. Almost half 50% of the participants were male, and a similar proportion was employed. About 41% of the participants were dependent on financial sources other than salary. News was considered a source of fear as 72% assumed that avoiding such news may reduce the fear. About 68% of the population was worried about contracting the disease. The most common coping strategies used during lockdown were spending quality time with family, eating healthy food, adequate sleep, and talking to friends on phone. Prevalence of poor well-being was found to be 41.2%. Female gender, being unemployed, living in Sindh and Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), fear of COVID-19, and having chronic illness were significantly associated with poor well-being. Similarly, coping strategies during lockdown (doing exercise; spending time with family; eating healthy food; having good sleep; contributing in social welfare work and spending time on hobbies) were also significantly associated with mental well-being. <b>Conclusion:</b> We found a high prevalence 41.2% of poor well-being among the Pakistani general population. We also investigated risk factors of poor well-being which included female gender, unemployment, being resident of ICT and Sindh, fear, chronic illness, and absence of coping strategies. This calls for immediate action at population level in the form of targeted mass psychological support programs to improve the mental health of population during the COVID-19 crises.","Khan, Lodhi, Rabbani, Ahmed, Abrar, Arshad, Irum, Khan","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.564364","20210130","COVID-19; Pakistan; mental health; psychological impact; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-01","",10082,""

"Factors associated with work-related burnout in NHS staff during COVID-19: a cross-sectional mixed methods study","To measure work-related burnout in all groups of health service staff during the COVID-19 pandemic and to identify factors associated with work-related burnout. Cross-sectional staff survey. All staff grades and types across primary and secondary care in a single National Health Service organisation. 257 staff members completed the survey, 251 had a work-related burnout score and 239 records were used in the regression analysis. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: (1) Work-related burnout as measured by the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory; (2) factors associated with work-related burnout identified through a multiple linear regression model; and (3) factors associated with work-related burnout identified through thematic analysis of free text responses. After adjusting for other covariates (including age, sex, job, being able to take breaks and COVID-19 knowledge), we observed meaningful changes in work-related burnout associated with having different COVID-19 roles (p=0.03), differences in the ability to rest and recover during breaks (p&lt;0.01) and having personal protective equipment concerns (p=0.04). Thematic analysis of the free text comments also linked burnout to changes in workload and responsibility and to a lack of control through redeployment and working patterns. Reduction in non-COVID-19 services has resulted in some members of staff feeling underutilised, with feelings of inequality in workload. Our analyses support anecdotal reports of staff struggling with the additional pressures brought on by COVID-19. All three of the factors we found to be associated with work-related burnout are modifiable and hence their effects can be mitigated. When we next find ourselves in extraordinary times the ordinary considerations of rest and protection and monitoring of the impact of new roles will be more important than ever.","Gemine, Davies, Tarrant, Davies, James, Lewis","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-042591","20210131","mental health; qualitative research; quality in health care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-01","",10084,""
"A portrait of the early and differential mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada: Findings from the first wave of a nationally representative cross-sectional survey","Evidence on the population-level mental health impacts of COVID-19 are beginning to amass; however, to date, there are significant gaps in our understandings of whose mental health is most impacted, how the pandemic is contributing to widening mental health inequities, and the coping strategies being used to sustain mental health. The first wave of a repeated cross-sectional monitoring survey was conducted between May 14-29, 2020 to assess the mental health impacts of the pandemic and to identify the disproportionate impacts on populations or groups identified as experiencing increased risks due to structural vulnerability and pre-existing health and social inequities. Respondents included a nationally representative probability sample (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 3000) of Canadian adults 18Ã‚Â years and older. Overall, Canadian populations are experiencing a deterioration in mental health and coping due to the pandemic. Those who experience health, social, and/or structural vulnerabilities due to pre-existing mental health conditions, disability, income, ethnicity, sexuality, and/or gender are more likely to endorse mental health deterioration, challenging emotions, and difficulties coping. This monitoring study highlights the differential mental health impacts of the pandemic for those who experience health, social, and structural inequities. These data are critical to informing responsive, equity-oriented public health, and policy responses in real-time to protect and promote the mental health of those most at risk during the pandemic and beyond.","Jenkins, McAuliffe, Hirani, Richardson, Thomson, McGuinness, Morris, Kousoulis, Gadermann","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2020.106333","20210129","COVID-19; Inequities; Mental health; Public health; Social determinants of health; Structural vulnerability; Survey; Syndemics theory","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-01","",10085,""
"Depressive, anxiety, and burnout symptoms on health care personnel at a month after COVID-19 outbreak in Indonesia","Health care personnel (HCP) who demonstrated close contact with Corona virus disease (COVID-19) patients might experience a higher risk of infection and psychological problems. This study aims to explore depressive, anxiety, and burnout symptoms among HCP with a higher risk for psychological trauma. This study was a cross-sectional study using secondary data from an online assessment, which was conducted 1 month after the COVID-19 outbreak. A total of 544 respondents from 21 provinces in Indonesia were included. Data on depressive, anxiety, and burnout symptoms were transformed first using the Rasch model and then categorized. Data from HCP in the higher risk group and the lower risk group were analyzed. A higher percentage of HCP experiencing depressive symptoms (22.8%), anxiety (28.1%), and burnout (26.8%) are found in the higher risk group. The chance for the higher risk group's HCP to present with moderate and severe depressive symptoms, anxiety, and burnout are: 5.28 (Confidence interval (CI): 2.01-13.89; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05), 1.36 (CI: 0.09-1.96; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â 0.05), and 3.92 (CI: 2.08-7.40; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05) times higher, respectively. The probability for patient-induced burnout is 2.13 (CI: 1.51-3.007; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05) times higher and highest among the other burn out dimensions. The depressive symptoms complained were similar between groups: loneliness, sleep disturbances, difficulty concentrating, and inability to initiate activities. Loneliness demonstrates the highest logit value among the symptoms. HCP with direct contact and responsibility to treat COVID-19 patients exhibit a higher risk to experience depressive symptoms and burnout. Communication with peers and staying in contact with family needs to be encouraged. Psychological well-being should be considered for high-risk HCP.

"Domestic violence and its relationship with quality of life in pregnant women during the outbreak of COVID-19 disease","During the COVID-19 pandemic, pregnant women bear considerable physical and psychological stress because of their special conditions, which combined with other stress factors such as violence, makes their situation even more critical. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of domestic violence and its relationship with quality of life in pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sectional study was performed with the participation of 250 pregnant women in the obstetrics clinic of 29-Bahman Hospital, Tabriz city. Using a three-part questionnaire consisting of the socio-demographic and obstetrics information, the domestic violence questionnaire developed by WHO, and the SF-12 quality of life questionnaire, the required information was collected. A general linear model was then used to determine the relationship between domestic violence and quality of life, while adjusting the socio-demographic and obstetrics information. According to the data, more than one-third of pregnant women (35.2Ã¢â‚¬â€°%) had experienced domestic violence. The most common type of violence experienced was emotional violence (32.8Ã¢â‚¬â€°%), followed by sexual violence (12.4Ã¢â‚¬â€°%), and physical violence (4.8Ã¢â‚¬â€°%). The mean score of the physical health department of quality of life in the group of women exposed to violence (50.21) was lower compared to the unexposed group (53.45), though there was no significant difference between them (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.25). However, the mean score of the mental health department of quality of life in women exposed to violence (46.27) was significantly lower compared to unexposed women (61.17) (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Based on the general linear model, the mean score for quality of life in the mental health dimension was significantly higher among unexposed women compared to those exposed to violence (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°9.3, 95Ã¢â‚¬â€°%CI: 3.5 to 15.0, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.002). The findings of this study indicate a high prevalence of domestic violence and its relationship with a low quality of life during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"&quot;Advocating Every Single Day&quot; so as Not to Be Forgotten: Factors Supporting Resiliency in Adult Day Service Centers Amidst COVID-19-Related Closures","Adult day centers (ADCs) are nonresidential settings that support the health and social needs of vulnerable older adults. Due to ADCs' congregate nature and participants' compromised health status, many ADCs have been forced to close during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is unknown how closures have impacted service delivery at ADCs. Guided by the Resiliency Activation Framework, we (a) identified consequences resulting from closures of ADCs during the COVID-19 pandemic and (b) described factors that have enabled the ADC community to remain resilient in the wake of challenges brought on by the pandemic. We conducted 2 focus groups in California (<i>n</i> =Ã‚Â 12), and individual interviews with ADC staff members (<i>n</i> =Ã‚Â 8) in 7 other states. The results of a directed content analysis revealed perceived declines in physical, cognitive, and mental health of ADC users and increased caregiver strain. Access to human, social, economic, and political capital were essential for supporting ADCs in buffering the impacts of the pandemic on the older adults they serve but were not consistently available. Research is urgently needed that quantifies the impacts of the pandemic on ADC users and their caregivers to inform policy and advocacy efforts in the wake of the pandemic.","Sadarangani, Zhong, Vora, Missaelides","https://doi.org/10.1080/01634372.2021.1879339","20210129","Adult day centers; COVID-19; caregivers; dementia; older adults; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-01","",10088,""
"Ketamine's rapid antisuicidal effects are not attenuated by Buprenorphine","Ketamine's rapid antisuicidal action has gathered significant clinical interest in treatment of depression though concerns exist that its actions occur through the Opioid pathway. A recent study additionally reported that Naltrexone blocks antisuicidal effects of Ketamine suggesting that its antisuicidal effects are also due to opioid mechanisms. We present a case of treatment refractory depression with recent suicide attempt and active suicidal ideations who was on an Opioid partial agonist, Buprenorphine, for management of pain. Patient responded to a trial of IV ketamine treatment with rapid improvement in suicidal thoughts. Patient's suicidal ideations decreased after first Ketamine treatment and resolved after second treatment while maintained on Buprenorphine. Our finding shows that Buprenorphine does not block Ketamine's effects on suicidal ideations and therefore Ketamine treatment could be provided safely in controlled environment to those with substance use disorders or with chronic pain while being maintained on Buprenorphine. Additionally, our case suggests that non-Opioid mechanisms may be involved in Ketamine's antidepressant effects and its response to suicidal ideations in those on Opioid partial agonists.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.120","20210301","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-01","",10089,""

"Mental Health and Wellbeing Implications of the COVID-19 Quarantine for Disabled and Disadvantaged Children and Young People: Evidence from a Cross-cultural Study in Zambia and Sierra Leone","Background The mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and quarantining on children and young people (CYP) living in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) has yet to be fully comprehended. CYP in LMICs are at utmost risk, given the COVID-19-related restrictions and social distancing measures, resulting in reduced access to school-based services for nutritional and mental health needs. This study examined mental health of CYP during the first COVID-19 lockdown in Zambia and Sierra Leone. Method In this cross-sectional study which conducted from 21st June to 8th August 2020, 468 disabled and disadvantaged CYP aged 12 to 25 completed a planning tool that comprised the short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (SWEMWBS), as well as open-ended questions covering social connectedness, physical distancing and outdoor activities during the lockdown. The community coaches screened individuals and families who could be eligible to receive emergency aid, and based on a convenience sample following distribution of aid, recipients were invited to complete the online planning tool. The participants were vulnerable children and adolescents (e.g. disadvantaged or living with a disability) living in different provinces of Zambia and Sierra Leone. Results Mean (SD) SWEMWBS scores for all participants in Zambia and Sierra Leone, were 19.61 (3.45) and 21.65 (2.84), respectively. Mental wellbeing scores were lower in women, younger children and participants with two or more disabilities. Factors significantly associated with poor mental wellbeing in the sample were: type of disability, nationality, peer relationships, connection to others during the pandemic, knowledge about COVID-19, worry about the long-term impact of COVID-19, and the types of self-isolating. Conclusion The results show that participants who self-reported low levels of COVID-19 health literacy also scored low on the mental wellbeing self-assessment. Yet, despite undoubted limited resources, these CYP are doing well in identifying their needs and maintaining hope in the face of the problems associated with COVID-19 in countries where stigma persists around mental ill-health.","Darren Sharpe et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4619D-0F0-D9C","20210131","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|School Psychology; sierra leone; zambia; disadvantaged; covid-19 pandemic; disabled; cross-cultural study; mental health; children and young people","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-01","",10093,""
"Association of COVID19-induced Anosmia and Ageusia with Depression and Suicidal Ideation","Background. Clinical reports from patients suffering from the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) reflect a high prevalence of sensory deprivation or loss pertaining to smell (dysosmia/anosmia) and/or taste (dysgeusia/ageusia). Given the importance of the senses to daily functioning and personal experience, the mental health consequences of these symptoms warrant further attention. Methods. A cohort of Reddit users posting within the /r/covid19positive subforum (N=15,821) was leveraged to analyze instantaneous risk of transition to a state of suicidal ideation or depression using Cox proportional-hazards models. Risk transition was defined by posts made in suicide- or depression-related forums, or mentions of relevant phrases with and without mention of anosmia/ageusia in /r/covid19positive. Self-diagnosis of COVID-19 was also modeled as a separate and simultaneous predictor of mental health risk. Results. Mention of anosmia/ageusia was significantly associated with transition to a risk state. Users with a history of anosmia/ageusia-related posts and who self-identified as COVID-19 positive had 30% higher instantaneous risk relative to others. The highest increase in instantaneous risk of suicidal ideation or depression occurred more than 100 days after first posting in /r/covid19positive. Limitations.
