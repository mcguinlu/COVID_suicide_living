"Associations between Affect, Physical Activity, and Anxiety Among US Children During COVID-19","We investigated how emotional responses (positive and negative affect), physical activity (PA), and sedentary behaviors related to anxiety among US children during the COVID 19 pandemic. Sixty four typically developing children (63% girls) age 9 to 15 years old completed two virtual visits during height of stay at home measures between April 22 to July 29, 2020. Children completed 24 hour PA recalls, state portion of State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC), and the shortened 10 item Positive and Negative Affect Schedule for Children (PANAS C). Children reported state anxiety scores that were more than 5 standard deviations greater than values from healthy pediatric populations prior to the pandemic. Children with higher positive affect and who reported more time in PA reported less state anxiety. Sedentary and leisure screen time were positively correlated with negative affect. Our findings suggest that maintaining positive affect, engaging in PA, and limiting leisure screen time may be important for child mental health during stressful periods.","Jasmin M Alves; Alexandra G Yunker; Alexis W Defendis; Anny H Xiang; Katie A Page","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.20216424","20201023","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-23","",6239,""
"Prevalence of Depressive Disorders and Associated Demographic Factors Among Refugees Amidst COVID-19 in Nakivale Refugee Camp in Southwestern Uganda","Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic and health measures to prevent it have unprecedented effects on the mental health of the refugees. However, the situation of refugees in developing countries is unclear. Thus, this study estimated the prevalence of and associated demographic factors during COVID-19 pandemic. The methodology employed a cross-sectional survey carried out in June 2020 in which 146 adult refugees from Nakivale settlement camp were randomly selected to fill out a questionnaires-demographics and PHQ9. Results revealed that the majority of respondents were female (53%) and 47% had a depressive disorder. There was no statistical relationship between demographics (gender, age and marital status) and depressive disorders. In Conclusion, findings indicate that depressive disorders are prevalent among refugees in Nakivale settlement and it is important to identify refugees affected mentally and given proper treatment.","Lucas Goodgame Anyayo; Amir Kabunga","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.21.20216754","20201023","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-23","",6240,""
"Anti-vaccine attitudes and risk factors for not agreeing to vaccination against COVID-19 amongst 32,361 UK adults: Implications for public health communications","Background Negative attitudes towards vaccines and an uncertainty or unwillingness to receive vaccinations are major barriers to managing the COVID-19 pandemic in the long-term. We estimate predictors of four domains of negative attitudes towards vaccines and identify groups most at risk of uncertainty and unwillingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine in a large sample of UK adults. Methods Data were from 32,361 adults in the UCL COVID-19 Social Study. Ordinary least squares regression analyses examined the impact of socio-demographic and COVID-19 related factors on four types of negative vaccine attitudes: mistrust of vaccine benefit, worries about unforeseen effects, concerns about commercial profiteering, and preference for natural immunity. Multinomial logistic regression examined the impact of socio-demographic and COVID-19 related factors, negative vaccine attitudes, and prior vaccine behaviour on uncertainty and unwillingness to be vaccinated for COVID-19. Findings 16% of respondents displayed high levels of mistrust or misinformation about vaccines across one or more domains. Distrustful attitudes towards vaccination were higher amongst individuals from ethnic minority backgrounds, with lower levels of education, lower annual income, poor knowledge of COVID-19, and poor compliance with government COVID-19 guidelines. Overall, 14% of respondents reported unwillingness to receive a vaccine for COVID-19, whilst 22% were unsure. The largest predictors of both COVID-19 vaccine uncertainty and refusal were low income (< 30,000 GBP a year), having not received a flu vaccine last year, poor adherence to COVID-19 government guidelines, female gender, and living with children. Amongst vaccine attitudes, intermediate to high levels of vaccine benefit mistrust and concerns about future unforeseen side effects were the most important determinants of both uncertainty and unwillingness to vaccinate against COVID-19. Interpretation Negative attitudes towards vaccines are major public health concerns in the UK. General mistrust in vaccines and concerns about future side effects in particular will be barriers to achieving population immunity to COVID-19 through vaccination. Public health messaging should be tailored to address these concerns.

"Trends in suicide rates during the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions in a major German city","Background It remains unclear whether the COVID-19 pandemic is having an impact on suicide rates. Social distancing, economic insecurity and increasing prevalence rates of mental disorders may cause an increase in risk factors for suicide. Methods Data on suicide events in a major city in Germany, and the corresponding life years were provided by the local authorities. For the year 2020, periods without restrictions on freedom of movement and social contact were compared with periods of moderate and severe COVID-19 restrictions. To avoid distortions due to seasonal fluctuations in suicide risk, data from 2020 were compared to data from 2010 to 2019. Outcomes A total of 333 suicides were registered and 2,791,131 life years (LY) were spent between 2010 and 2020. Of these, 42 suicides and 300,834 LY accounted for the year 2020. In 2020, suicide rates (SR, suicides per 100,000 LY) were lower in periods with moderate (SR = 8.5, X^2 = 4.374, p = 0.037) or severe COVID-19 restrictions (SR = 7.0, X^2 = 3.999, p = 0.046) compared with periods without restrictions (SR = 18.0). A comparison with preceding years showed that differences cannot be attributed to seasonal variations. No age- or gender differences were found. Interpretation SR decreased during the COVID-19 restrictions; we expect SR to rise in the medium term. Careful monitoring of SR in the further course of the COVID-19 crisis is therefore urgently needed. The findings have regional reference and should not be over-generalized. Funding This study was conducted without external funding.","Daniel Radeloff; Rainer Papsdorf; Kirsten Uhlig; Andreas Vasilache; Karen Putnam; Kai von Klitzing","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.21.20187419","20201023","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-23","",6242,""
"Broad transcriptional dysregulation of brain and choroid plexus cell types with COVID-19","Though SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets the respiratory system, it is increasingly appreciated that patients may suffer neurological symptoms of varied severity. However, an unbiased understanding of the molecular processes across brain cell types that could contribute to these symptoms in COVID-19 patients is still missing. Here, we profile 47,678 droplet-based single-nucleus transcriptomes from the frontal cortex and choroid plexus across 10 non-viral, 4 COVID-19, and 1 influenza patient. We complement transcriptomic data with immunohistochemical staining for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. We find that all major cortex parenchymal and choroid plexus cell types are affected transcriptionally with COVID-19. This arises, in part, from SARS-CoV-2 infection of the cortical brain vasculature, meninges, and choroid plexus, stimulating increased inflammatory signaling into the brain. In parallel, peripheral immune cells infiltrate the brain, microglia activate programs mediating the phagocytosis of live neurons, and astrocytes dysregulate genes involved in neurotransmitter homeostasis. Among neurons, layer 2/3 excitatory neurons--evolutionarily expanded in humans--show a specific downregulation of genes encoding major SNARE and synaptic vesicle components, predicting compromised synaptic transmission. These perturbations are not observed in terminal influenza. Many COVID-19 gene expression changes are shared with those in chronic brain disorders and reside in genetic variants associated with cognitive function, schizophrenia, and depression. Our findings and public dataset provide a molecular framework and new opportunities to understand COVID-19 related neurological disease.","Andrew Chris Yang; Fabian Kern; Patricia M Losada; Christina A Maat; Georges Schmartz; Tobias Fehlmann; Nicholas Schaum; Davis P Lee; Kruti Calcuttawala; Ryan T Vest; David Gate; Daniela Berdnik; M.

"What predicts adherence to COVID-19 government guidelines? Longitudinal analyses of 51,000 UK adults","In the absence of a vaccine, governments have focused on social distancing, self-isolation, and increased hygiene procedures to reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). Compliance with these measures requires voluntary cooperation from citizens. Yet, compliance is not complete, and existing studies provide limited understanding of what factors influence compliance; in particular modifiable factors. We use weekly panel data from 51,000 adults across the first three months of lockdown in the UK to identify factors that are related to compliance with COVID-19 guidelines. We find evidence that increased confidence in government to tackle the pandemic is longitudinally related to higher compliance, but little evidence that factors such as mental health and wellbeing, worries about future adversities, and social isolation and loneliness are related to changes in compliance. Our results suggest that to effectively manage the pandemic, governments should ensure that confidence is maintained, something which has not occurred in all countries.","Liam Wright; Andrew Steptoe; Daisy Fancourt","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.19.20215376","20201021","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-23","",6244,""
"Experiences of Women Who Gave Birth in US Hospitals During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The purpose of this study was to describe the experiences of women who gave birth in a US hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic. Women who gave birth between March and July 2020 completed a survey on the experience of giving birth during a pandemic. 885 women were consented and participated in the study. 22.5% of women reported hypertension, 33.8% reported anxiety, 18.6% reported depression, and 1.13% reported testing positive for COVID-19. 61% of women reported inadequate support for childbirth, and 20.5% reported that they did not feel safe giving birth in the hospital. Women who tested positive for COVID-19 were more likely to be of Asian race, have a cesarean section, not have a birth partner present, and discontinue breastfeeding before 6 weeks.

Pandemic related changes to maternity care practices may have impacted birthing womens perceptions of safety and support in the hospital environment and affected symptoms of stress.

"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Suicide and Self Harm among Patients Presenting to the Emergency Department of a Teaching Hospital in Nepal","BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic is a global challenge that is not just limited to the physical consequences but also a significant degree of a mental health crisis. Self-harm (SH) and suicide are its extreme effects. The aim of this study was to provide an overview of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the occurrence and clinical profile of suicide and SH in our ED.

MethodsThis is a cross-sectional observational study conducted in the ED of a tertiary care center. Records of all fatal and nonfatal SH patients presenting to the ED during the lockdown period (March 24-June 23, 2020; Period1), matching periods in the previous year (March 24-June 23,2019; Period 2) and 3 months period prior (December 24 2019-March 23, 2020; Period 3) was included by searching the electronic medical record (EMR) system. The prevalence and the clinical profile of the patients were compared between these three periods.

ResultsA total of 125 (periods 1=55, 2=38, and 3=32) suicide and SH cases were analyzed. The cases of suicide/SH had increased by 44% and 71.9% during the lockdown period in comparison to the period 2 and 3. Organophosphate poisoning was the most common mode. Females were predominant in all three periods with a mean age of 32 (95%CI: 29.3-34.7). There was a significant delay in arrival of the patients in period 1 (p-value=0.045) with increased hospital admission (p-value =0.009) and in-hospital mortality (18.2% vs 2.6 % and 3.1%) (p-value=.001).

ConclusionWe found an increase in patients presenting with suicide and SH in our ED during the pandemic which is likely to reflect an increased prevalence of mental illness in the community. We hope that the result will prime all mental health care stakeholders to initiate mental health screening and intervention for the vulnerable population during this period of crisis.","Roshana Shrestha; Shisir Siwakoti; Saumya Singh; Anmol Purna Shrestha","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.20213769","20201020","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-23","",6246,""
"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures on mental health of children and adolescents in Greece","BackgroundMental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown measures are expected to be profound.

AimThe aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of the pandemic and the lockdown on childrens and adolescents mental health in Greece.

MethodsA cross-sectional survey of 1,232 Greek parents of children and adolescents aged < 18 years was conducted in March and May 2020. Parents provided information about sociodemographic characteristics, family everyday life during the lockdown and the pandemic psychological impact on their children.

ResultsApproximately one-third (35.1%) of parents reported that the psychological health of their children was considerably affected. The most significant concern was social isolation. Unemployment, increased family conflicts, no opportunity for tele-work and a deteriorating psychological health of the parent, as well as childrens previous history of physical health conditions were all significantly associated with adverse mental health impact.

ConclusionA considerable proportion of children and adolescents may experience adverse mental health effects due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown measures, and socioeconomic inequalities may be associated with these effects.","Konstantina Magklara; Helen Lazaratou; Anastasia Barbouni; Konstantinos Poulas; Konstantinos Farsalinos; - Coronavirus Greece Research Group","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.18.20214643","20201020","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-23","",6247,""
"LOCKDOWN FATIGUE AMONG COLLEGE STUDENTS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC: PREDICTIVE ROLE OF PERSONAL RESILIENCE, COPING BEHAVIOURS, AND HEALTH","BackgroundThe lockdown measures imposed by many countries since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic have been useful in slowing the transmission of the disease; however, there is growing concern regarding their adverse consequences on overall health and well-being, particularly among young people. To date, most studies have focused on the mental health consequences of the lockdown measures, while studies assessing how this disease control measure influences the occurrence of fatigue are largely absent.

AimThe aims of this study are two-fold: (a) to examine the levels of lockdown fatigue, and (2) to determine the role of coping behaviours, personal resilience, psychological well-being and perceived health in fatigue associated to the lockdown measure.

MethodsThis is an online cross-sectional study involving 243 college students in the Central Philippines during the sixth month of the lockdown measure implemented due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Five standardised scales were used to collect the data.

ResultsOverall, college students reported moderate levels of lockdown fatigue, with a mean score of 31.54 (out of 50). Physical exhaustion or tiredness, headaches and body pain, decreased motivation and increased worry were the most pronounced manifestations of fatigue reported. Gender and college year were identified as important predictors of fatigue. Increased personal resilience and coping skills were associated with lower levels of lockdown fatigue.

ConclusionCollege students experience moderate levels of fatigue during the mandatory lockdown or home confinement period. Resilient students and those who perceive higher social support experience lower levels of fatigue during the lockdown period compared to students with low resilience and social support. Lockdown fatigue may be addressed by formulating and implementing interventions to enhance personal resilience and social support among college students.","Leodoro Labrague; Cherry Ann Ballad","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.18.20213942","20201020","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-23","",6248,""
"Suicide Deaths during the Stay-at-Home Advisory in Massachusetts","Many believe that shelter-in-place or stay-at-home policies might cause an increase in so-called deaths of despair. While increases in psychiatric stressors during the COVID-19 pandemic are anticipated, whether suicide rates changed during stay-at-home periods has not been described.

This was an observational cohort study that assembled suicide death data for persons aged 10 years or older from the Massachusetts Department of Health Registry of Vital Records and Statistics from January 2015 through May 2020. Using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and seasonal ARIMA to analyze suicide deaths in Massachusetts, we compared the observed number of suicide deaths in Massachusetts during the stay-at-home period (March through May, 2020) in Massachusetts to the projected number of expected deaths. To be conservative, we also accounted for the deaths still pending final cause determination

The incident rate for suicide deaths in Massachusetts was 0.67 per 100,000 person-month (95% CI 0.56-0.79) versus 0.81 per 100,000 person-month (95% CI 0.69-0.94) during the 2019 corresponding period (incident rate ratio of 0.83; 95% CI 0.66-1.03). The addition of the 57 deaths pending cause determination occurring from March through May 2020 and the 33 cases still pending determination from the 2019 corresponding period did not change these findings.

The observed number of suicide deaths during the stay-at-home period did not deviate from ARIMA projected expectations using either preliminary data or an alternate scenario in which deaths pending investigation (exceeding the average remaining number of deaths still pending investigation which occurred during the corresponding 2015-2019 period) were ascribed to suicide. Decedent age and sex demographics were unchanged during the pandemic period compared to 2015-2019.

The stable rates of suicide deaths during the stay-at-home advisory in Massachusetts parallel findings following ecological disasters. As the pandemic persists, uncertainty about its scope and economic impact may increase. However, our data are reassuring that an increase in suicide deaths in Massachusetts during the stay-at-home advisory period did not occur.","Jeremy Faust; Sejal B Shah; Chengan Du; Shu-Xia Li; Zhenqiu Lin; Harlan M Krumholz","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.20215343","20201020","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-23","",6249,""

"The Cross-Talk between Age, Hypertension and Inflammation in COVID-19 Patients: Therapeutic Targets","This paper presents a brief overview of the complex interaction between age, hypertension, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), inflammation, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) infection  Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is more frequent and more severe in comorbid elderly patients, especially those with hypertension, diabetes, obesity, or cardiovascular diseases  There are concerns regarding the use of RAAS inhibitors in patients with COVID-19  Some physicians have considered the need for interrupting RAAS inhibition in order to reduce the possibility of SARS-CoV2 entering lung cells after binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors  We offer a different point of view in relation to the need for continuing to use RAAS inhibitors in patients with COVID-19  We focused our article on elderly patients because of the distinctive imbalance between the immune response, which is depressed, and the exacerbated inflammatory response, 'inflammaging', which makes the geriatric patient an appropriate candidate for therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating the inflammatory response  Indeed, COVID-19 is an inflammatory storm that starts and worsens during the course of the disease  During the COVID-19 pandemic, various therapeutic approaches have been tested, including antiviral drugs, interferon, anti-interleukins, hydroxychloroquine, anti-inflammatories, immunoglobulins from recoveredÂ patients, and heparins  Some of these therapeutic approaches did not prove to be beneficial, or even induced serious complications  Based on current evidence, in the early stages of the disease modulation of the inflammatory response through the inhibition of neprilysin and modulation of the RAAS could affect the course and outcome of COVID-19","Casucci, G.; Acanfora, D.; Incalzi, R.

"IVF TREATMENT PRE- AND POST- THE ASRM COVID-19 PAUSE","Objective: The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has forever reshaped the United States health care system  However, assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatment remains an essential form of medicine  Reproductive practices have since incorporated vigilant practices regarding social distancing, ample use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), and consistent decontamination protocols in order to mitigate risk of COVID-19 infection  Altogether, changes to standard operating procedures within ART treatment centers are anticipated to support patient safety without compromising quality of reproductive care  Finally, there is ample evidence of the mental health burden stemming from this pandemic with regard to anxiety and depression in both healthcare workers and patients  Given the current uncertainty, our study evaluates IVF cycle outcome in a New York City patient cohort prior to and subsequent to the ASRM COVID-19 task forceâ€™s recommended treatment pause  Design: Retrospective cohort analysis  Materials and Methods: The study includes patients who underwent a single, euploid frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET) from January 1st, 2020 to May 18th, 2020  Cohorts were separated into two groups based on period of IVF treatment (Group 1: Treatment prior to the COVID-19 pandemic pause;Group 2: Treatment subsequent to the COVID-19 pause)  Primary outcome included early pregnancy rates  Chi squared test was used and statistically significance was considered at p= &lt;0 05  Results: A total of 601 single, euploid FET cycles in which pregnancy outcomes coming prior to the COVID-19 pandemic pause (n=526) were compared to outcomes subsequent to COVID-19 (n=75)  No differences were found in early pregnancy rates among cohorts (Table 1)  [Formula presented] Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has placed an unprecedented burden on patients, physicians, and the entire healthcare system  Urgent treatments, including reproductive care, were postponed, as scarce resources needed to be re-directed  Resumption of treatment required modification in workflow, staffing, decontamination protocols, and utilization of PPE  Although the patient experience has changed, our study is first to demonstrate implantation rates were not compromised in an era of COVID-19  Importantly, our preliminary data suggests that the stress and anxiety that pervade modern COVID-era reproductive care do not alter outcomes  With an abundance of caution, a modern fertility clinic can work to â€œflatten the curve,â€ abide by guidelines, and deliver safe and effective patient care","Lee, J.

"Psychiatric Disorders and Hydroxychloroquine for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): A VigiBase Study","INTRODUCTION: In the stressful context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, some reports have raised concerns regarding psychiatric disorders with the use of hydroxychloroquine  In this study, we reviewed all psychiatric adverse effects with hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients, as well as in other indications, reported in VigiBase, the World Health Organization's (WHO) global database of individual case safety reports  METHODS: First, we analyzed all psychiatric adverse effects, including suicide, of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients reported to 16 June 2020  We also performed disproportionality analysis to investigate the risk of reporting psychiatric disorders with hydroxychloroquine compared with remdesivir, tocilizumab, or lopinavir/ritonavir prescribed in COVID-19 patients  We used reporting odds ratios (RORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to calculate disproportionality  Second, we sought to examine the psychiatric safety profile of hydroxychloroquine in other indications (before 2020)  RESULTS: Among the 1754 reports with hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients, we found 56 psychiatric adverse effects  Half of these adverse effects were serious, including four completed suicides, three cases of intentional self-injury, and 12 cases of psychotic disorders with hallucinations  Compared with remdesivir, tocilizumab, or lopinavir/ritonavir, the use of hydroxychloroquine was associated with an increased risk of reporting psychiatric disorders (ROR 6 27, 95% CI 2 74-14 35)  Before 2020, suicide was the main cause of death among all adverse drug reactions reported with hydroxychloroquine, followed by cardiac adverse effects (cardiomyopathy) and respiratory failure  CONCLUSIONS: This pharmacovigilance analysis suggests that COVID-19 patients exposed to hydroxychloroquine experienced serious psychiatric disorders, and, among these patients, some committed suicide  Further real-world studies are needed to quantify the psychiatric risk associated with hydroxychloroquine during the COVID-19 pandemic","Garcia, P.; Revet, A.; Yrondi, A.; Rousseau, V.; Degboe, Y.; Montastruc, F.","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40264-020-01013-3","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Drug Saf;2020.; Publication details: Drug Saf;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-23","",6329,""

"Standing on the shoulders of giants: 100 years of neurology and epidemic infections","Histopathology of most cases in the acute phase showed reddish-grey discolouration of the brainstem grey matter with lymphocytic infiltrates surrounding vessels and diffuse inflammation with haemorrhage 1 In the chronic phase, persistent inflammation was evident with generalised brain atrophy and degeneration of the substantia nigra 1 The aetiology remains unproven, and it is not clear whether all the cases in the literature truly represent a single disease 5 The prevailing contemporary hypothesis was that proposed by von Economo himselfâ€”that the disease was owing to an infectious agent, although he observed that cases appeared to predate the emergence of the 1918 influenza pandemic 2 5 von Economoâ€™s view that the disease was the result of direct viral infection of the central nervous system (CNS) has now been largely superseded by the proposition that the disease reflected a para/post-infectious inflammatory process 5 Although evidence for this is lacking, it fits neatly with the modern view of other neurological syndromes such as Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome (GBS), acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) antibody encephalitis, the latter of which may be triggered by herpes simplex virus in some 6 7 Indeed, NMDA-R antibodies were present in serum (and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) when available for study) in around 50% of 20 children with dyskinetic â€˜encephalitis lethargicaâ€™ (collected over many years),8 and antibodies to the dopamine receptor in a proportion of the remaining more akinetic cases  Many of the clinical features overlap, although encephalitis lethargica is more heterogeneous in both its acute symptoms and its natural history 2 A para/postinfectious pathogenesis, rather than direct viral infection, is in keeping with the observations that single members of families were often affected, which puzzled epidemiologists at the time;and that an infectious agent was not readily detected in CSF or brain tissue 2 It is possible that encephalitis lethargica represented a final common pathway of brain inflammation potentially triggered by several different infectious agents, although were this the case the reasons for the diseaseâ€™s decline remain obscure  A young patient had been admitted in April 1918 with self-inflicted laceration across the neck, preceded by headache and sleeplessness for 2 weeks 10 Six months after the initial presentation, they developed neck and back pain with reduced mobility, 2 months later developing expressive aphasia with retained comprehension, and death occurred less than a month later 10 The postmortem results describe a widespread meningoencephalomyelitis with vascular proliferation, perivascular inflammation, thrombosis, haemorrhage and destruction of nervous tissue 10 A subsequent case series collated by Sir Thomas Horder, also published in 1920, comprises 25 cases described by several neurologists from Bristol, and is notable for detailed and varied descriptions of cases of encephalitis lethargica in patients of all ages 11 Their dilemmas trying to unify these disparate clinical presentations are clearly evident  The 2009 H1N1 pandemic was associated with complications of the nervous system in up to 4% of those diagnosed with H1N1 influenza infection and most commonly included altered mental status, seizures, narcolepsy and encephalopathy, particularly in children 16â€“18 Several seemingly pathognomic encephalopathy syndromes have emerged, including acute necrotising encephalopathy with bilateral thalamic involvement 16â€“18 The virus is rarely identified by molecular tests of the CSF in these patients, and it has been suggested that the mechanism for the complications may be a parainfectious cytokine storm 18 Coronaviruses The severe CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and MERS, have been associated with limited reports of both central and peripheral nervous system disease, including ADEM 19 Sporadic, seasonal CoV have also occasionally been implicated in neurological disease 20 COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, represents the most devastating respiratory pandemic since the influenza pandemics of 1918 (â€˜Spanish fluâ€™;H1N1), 1957 (â€˜Asian fluâ€™;H2N2) and 1968 (â€˜Hong Kong fluâ€™;H3N2) 21 Reports of neurological syndromes associated with SARS-CoV2 are frequent, initially reported where the virus began in Wuhan,22 and continued in case reports and series from across the world 21 23 24 A UK-wide surveillance study identified 153 cases with CNS disorders reflecting cerebrovascular events, altered mental status including 7 patients with encephalitis, and a surprising number of psychiatric syndromes, such as psychosis and catatonia 21 It is currently unclear how many cases are causally related to SARS-CoV-2 and in what proportion this is a coincidental infection 23 It is becoming apparent that dysfunction of the clotting cascade, together with possible endotheliopathy, is in some cases associated with cerebrovascular disease in COVID-19 21 23 24 The number of patients with encephalopathy is also striking, and in a few cases the virus has been detected in CSF 21 25 Many cases of GBS and its variants are also emerging 26 Conclusion The historical

Between 18 March and 18 April 2020, as illness and death escalated in the United States, we assessed acute stress, depressive symptoms, and direct, community, and media-based exposures to COVID-19 in three consecutive representative samples from the U.S. probability-based nationally representative NORC AmeriSpeak panel across three 10-day periods (total N = 6514). Acute stress and depressive symptoms increased significantly over time as COVID-19 deaths increased across the United States. Preexisting mental and physical health diagnoses, daily COVID-19-related media exposure, conflicting COVID-19 information in media, and secondary stressors were all associated with acute stress and depressive symptoms. Results have implications for targeting public health interventions and risk communication efforts to promote community resilience as the pandemic waxes and wanes over time.","Holman, E Alison; Thompson, Rebecca R; Garfin, Dana Rose; Silver, Roxane Cohen","https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abd5390","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Sci Adv;6(42)2020 Oct.; Publication details: Sci Adv;6(42)2020 Oct.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-23","",6343,""

"PNEUMOMEDIASTINUM AS A COMPLICATION OF COVID-19: MAY NOT NEED INTERVENTION","SESSION TITLE: Late-breaking Abstract Posters SESSION TYPE: Original Investigation Posters PRESENTED ON: October 18-21, 2020 PURPOSE: Evaluate patients with pneumomediastinum (PTM) as a complication of coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19) infection and their outcomes  METHODS: Data was obtained by retrospective analysis of a database of Covid-19 patients, admitted to two New York hospitals from March 25th to April 26th, 2020  Identified 13 patients with PTM as a complication of Covid-19  RESULTS: Median age of patients was 67 years, 7 (54%) were men, and 1 patient had pre-existing emphysema  Presenting symptoms included dyspnea (13/13, 100%), fever (10/13, 77%), and cough (9/13, 69%);none had chest pain  Median presenting SaO2/FiO2 ratio was 359  Pneumomediastinum was diagnosed on presentation in 2 patients (15%), during hospitalization but prior to invasive mechanical ventilation in 4 patients (31%), and after invasive mechanical ventilation in 7 patients (54%)  Six patients had CT scans confirming the diagnosis of PTM  Twelve of the 13 patients were initiated on mechanical ventilation at median 5 5 days  Four patients (31%) developed pneumothoraces and 1 patient required bilateral chest tube drainage  Tension pneumothorax, tension pneumopericardium, and chest wall compartment syndrome were not observed in our cohort  Pneumomediastinum self-resolved in 5 patients (38%) while on mechanical ventilation  (Fig  1) Seven out of 12 intubated patients (58%) underwent prone ventilation without worsening of PTM  One patient was discharged home, 10 patients expired, and 2 patients remain hospitalized  CONCLUSIONS: Pneumomediastinum is a known sequelae of noncompliant lungs in severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), typically in the setting of positive pressure delivered with invasive mechanical ventilation  Our cohort had a low prevalence of predisposing risk factors such as emphysema, and a high mortality  Pneumomediastinum was not strongly associated with mechanical ventilation, as nearly half (6/13) of the patients developed PTM prior to intubation  CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: In our cohort, findings of PTM may be attributed to two main etiologies converging: damage from Covid-19 and self-inflicted increases in transpulmonary pressures  We postulate that impaired surfactant production from type II pneumocytes may predispose to atelectrauma leading to diffuse alveolar injury and risk of rupture, unlike in typical ARDS where barotrauma occurs in the context of poorly compliant lungs  Moreover, the increased work of breathing and pronounced cough seen in Covid-19 pneumonia may lead to increased transpulmonary pressures resulting in PTM  Reductions in transpulmonary pressures after intubation with initiation of sedation and neuromuscular blockade may explain the resolution of PTM in spite of invasive ventilation  Given the high mortality we observed, early identification and initiation of methods to reduce transpulmonary pressures is imperative to reduce risk of further complications  DISCLOSURES: No relevant relationships by Young Im Lee, source=Web Response No relevant relationships by Nan Li, source=Web Response No relevant relationships by Joseph Mathew, source=Web Response No relevant relationships by Lina Miyakawa, source=Web Response No relevant relationships by Paru Patrawalla, source=Web Response No relevant relationships by Paru Patrawalla, source=Web Response No relevant relationships by Adam Rothman, source=Web Response No relevant relationships by Vishad Sheth, source=Web Response No relevant relationships by David Steiger, source=Web Response No relevant relationships by Jigna Zatakia, source=Web Response","Miyakawa, L.; Rothman, A.; Sheth, V.; Patrawalla, P.; Steiger, D.; Li, N.; Zatakia, J.; Mathew, J.; Lee, Y.

The presentation mechanism is: reactive-adaptive to the pandemic; triggering factor, before a previous affective-emotional instability; decompensation of a pre-existing process. The clinical features have had their initial phase, fundamentally, in confinement: somatoform disorders, behavioral disorders, emotional symptoms, reactivation of child abuse and dysfunctional grief reactions. The most prevalent symptoms are of the anxious or anxious-depressive type. The response to chronic stress, including that of low profile and intensity but maintained over time, has significant repercussions for childhood and adolescence. Few percentage that present prominent mental disorders, but we must recognize that when projected to the whole the child-adolescent population, there could be a significant number that could be subsidiary of a more specific help. The return to schooling is going to represent another important moment, the repercussions of confinement being of capital importance, especially in terms of addictive behaviors with information and communication technologies.

"Undergraduate Neuroscience Education: Meeting the Challenges of the 21 st Century","The dedication of undergraduate neuroscience faculty to their students could not have been more evident than what these educators demonstrated when the COVID-19 pandemic impacted colleges and universities across the United States. These faculty faced the crisis head-on to provide their students with exceptional instruction in virtual formats that many faculty had never used for instruction before the pandemic. This same tenacious attitude has been reflected in pedagogical efforts that undergraduate neuroscience faculty have undertaken since the mid-1990s. The challenges of providing cutting-edge neuroscience education to undergraduates in a dynamic field have produced a series of curricular designs and approaches that capitalize on discipline-based education research. This article reviews curricular models and pedagogical strategies aimed at enhancing the educational experiences of undergraduate neuroscience students whose lived experiences and academic backgrounds reflect the richly kaleidoscopic demographics of college students in the 21st century. The future of undergraduate neuroscience education is bright as faculty and their students collaborate on their journey of discovery in neuroscience.","Ramirez, Julio J","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neulet.2020.135418","","Country: IE; IRLANDA; IRELAND; IRLANDA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Neurosci Lett;: 135418, 2020 Oct 13.; Publication details: Neurosci Lett;: 135418, 2020 Oct 13.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-23","",6363,""
"The health scare of COVID-19 amidst pandemics and the immune-related pharmaceutical products spillovers in the USA","In view of the sector-wide effect of the nCOVID-19 pandemic in the USA and the probable effect on certain over-the-counter (OTC) pharmaceutical products, the current study examined potential inflation in the pharmaceutical industry arising from the pandemic-related uncertainty. In this case, the USA's producer price indexes vis-Ã -vis inflation of the immune-related pharmaceutical items: multivitamin, vitamins nutrients and hematinic (V-N-H), other vitamins (other-V), antidepressant, and antidiabetic were examined alongside the uncertainties arising from the world pandemic and economic policy. Thus, the (Diebold and Yilmaz in Int J Forecast 28(1): 57-66, 2012) result implied that the world pandemic uncertainty contributed a significantly huge shock to the examined pharmaceutical compounds, thus affirming the vulnerability of certain pharmaceuticals to pandemic-related uncertainty. The total spillover increased from 34.2% (with economic policy uncertainty) to 47.6% (when pandemic uncertainty is incorporated). In specific, there are negative net spillovers from the multivitamins, other vitamins, antidiabetic, and antidepressant especially due to high pandemic and economic policy uncertainties. However, the statistical evidence implied that higher uncertainty arising from the pandemic is responsible for the severity of shock received by the indicated pharmaceutical products as against economic policy uncertainty. Thus, a relevant policy inference is posited from the result of the study.","Alola, Andrew Adewale; Olowu, Funmilayo Boluwatife","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-11195-z","","Country: DE; ALEMANHA; GERMANY; ALEMANIA; DEUSTCHLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Environ Sci Pollut Res Int;2020 Oct 16.; Publication details: Environ Sci Pollut Res Int;2020 Oct 16.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-23","",6364,""
"Introduction to the special issue on the HEALing Communities Study","The severity of the overdose epidemic underscores the urgent need for innovative and high impact interventions that promote the rapid penetration and scale up of evidence-based practices (EBPs) in communities profoundly affected by fatal opioid overdose. This special issue shares scientific advancements in implementation research design and evaluation of a novel data-driven community-based intervention. The HEALing (Helping End Addiction Long-Term) Communities Study (HCS) is a four-year study that is designed to examine the effectiveness of the Communities That HEAL (CTH) intervention. The CTH intervention supports the dissemination of EBPs in 67 communities across four high-burdened states-Kentucky, Massachusetts, New York, and Ohio. The diversity in these communities in terms of rural-urban status, race-ethnicity and other social determinants of health facilitates generalizability of results to other communities across the US. The nine papers in this special issue describe critical elements that constitute the HCS framework and design. This includes the implementation of EBPs that have a substantial impact on fatal and non-fatal opioid overdose, the Opioid-overdose Reduction Continuum of Care Approach, communication campaigns to increase awareness and demand for EBPs and reduce stigma against people with OUD and MOUD interventions, and the process of community engagement. This includes how to form community coalitions and gain their commitment, and steps taken to mobilize coalitions to pursue EBP implementation and ensure EBPs are adapted for community needs. The collective papers in this issue demonstrate that the design of any complex study must adapt to unanticipated temporal events, including the rapidly emerging COVID-19 crisis. Readers will learn about the scientific process of the design and implementation of a community-engaged intervention, its methodologies, guiding conceptual models, and research implementation strategies that can be applied to address other health issues.","El-Bassel, Jackson, Samet, Walsh","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108327","20201022","HEALing Communities Study; Helping to End Addiction Long-Term; evidence-based practice; implementation science; intervention; opioid use disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-23","",6365,""
"Psychological impact of mass quarantine on population during pandemics-The COVID-19 Lock-Down (COLD) study","Quarantine often is an unpleasant experience. The aim of this study is to explore the degree of psychological distress in terms of-Depression, Anxiety and Stress among the adult population in India during the strict 21 days mandatory lockdown. We hypothesize that quantification of psychological impact of current situation will help us to modify the policies and implementation strategies. This assessment might also help in future to keep targeted services in place, to cope up with the psychological distress of the quarantined population. A cross sectional survey design was adopted to assess the psychological state of general population in India, during the COVID-19 mandatory lockdown period, with the help of a validated questionnaire. The reported prevalence of depression was around 30.5%, which was the highest among the variables of psychological health. Anxiety was reported by 22.4%, followed by stress which was seen in 10.8% of respondents. In the third week the incidence of depression (37.8% versus 23.4%; p&lt;0.001), anxiety (26.6% versus 18.2%; p&lt;0.001) and stress (12.2% versus 9.3%; p&lt;0.045) was reported to be significantly higher as compared to second week. Our results suggest a progressively detrimental impact of lockdown on various aspects of psychological health. We noticed around eight to ten fold increase in the prevalence of depression (30.5%) and anxiety (22.4%) during lockdown, as compared to baseline statistics in Indian population (3Ã‚Â·1-3Ã‚Â·6% for depressive disorders and 3Ã‚Â·0-3Ã‚Â·5% for anxiety disorders).","Pandey, Bansal, Goyal, Garg, Sethi, Pothiyill, Sreelakshmi, Sayyad, Sethi","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0240501","20201022","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-23","",6366,""
"Socioeconomic status and well-being during COVID-19: A resource-based examination","The authors assess levels and within-person changes in psychological well-being (i.e., depressive symptoms and life satisfaction) from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic for individuals in the United States, in general and by socioeconomic status (SES). The data is from 2 surveys of 1,143 adults from RAND Corporation's nationally representative American Life Panel, the first administered between April-June, 2019 and the second during the initial peak of the pandemic in the United States in April, 2020. Depressive symptoms during the pandemic were higher than population norms before the pandemic. Depressive symptoms increased from before to during COVID-19 and life satisfaction decreased. Individuals with higher education experienced a greater increase in depressive symptoms and a greater decrease in life satisfaction from before to during COVID-19 in comparison to those with lower education. Supplemental analysis illustrates that income had a curvilinear relationship with changes in well-being, such that individuals at the highest levels of income experienced a greater decrease in life satisfaction from before to during COVID-19 than individuals with lower levels of income. We draw on conservation of resources theory and the theory of fundamental social causes to examine four key mechanisms (perceived financial resources, perceived control, interpersonal resources, and COVID-19-related knowledge/news consumption) underlying the relationship between SES and well-being during COVID-19. These resources explained changes in well-being for the sample as a whole but did not provide insight into why individuals of higher education experienced a greater decline in well-being from before to during COVID-19.

"Mental health and counseling intervention for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) during the COVID-19 pandemic: perspectives from Italy","Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an inherited disorder of fibrovascular tissue, transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait. This rare disease can involve one or more organs and clinical manifestations interest several medical specialties. A review of recent literature and our clinical experience shows that COVID-19 pandemic greatly influences the autonomy and psychic sphere of patients with HHT, causing them further distress. Often patients affected by HHT experience a sense of loneliness due to the rarity of this pathology and COVID-19 pandemic adds a burden for them and their caregivers who have to face emotional experiences that interfere with personal, social and working functioning. Multidisciplinary approach and web-mediated counseling intervention could offer a valid and personalized support for patients affected by HHT and their caregivers during quarantine due to COVID-19 pandemic.","Marano, Gaetani, Gasbarrini, Janiri, Sani, Mazza","https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202010_23246","20201022","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-23","",6368,""
"Putatively lethal ingestion of isopropyl alcohol-related case: interpretation of post mortem isopropyl alcohol and acetone concentrations remains challenging","Isopropyl alcohol, or propan-2-ol (IPA), is found in numerous chemicals including alcohol-based hand rubs whose use has been recently widely extended to the general population since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. This widespread of IPA use could potentially, but not necessarily, be responsible for an increase in IPA poisoning cases (e.g., in alcoholics and/or for suicide attempt, even more in a lockdown situation). Forensic identification of IPA-related fatalities remains challenging as IPA post mortem detection can also result from antemortem or post mortem production, or post mortem contamination. In order to illustrate this issue, we report the case of a 33-year-old man found dead with a bottle of pure IPA liquid close to him. Toxicological positive results only consisted in IPA (464, 260, 465 and 991Ã‚Â mg/L) and acetone (1560, 2340, 3040 and 1360Ã‚Â mg/L) in blood, vitreous humour, urine and bile, respectively (determinations using headspace gas chromatography with flame ionization detection). These IPA absolute concentrations and IPA-to-acetone ratios appear inferior to those usually reported in the literature (higher than 1000Ã‚Â mg/L and 1.1, respectively) in IPA poisoning cases. In conclusion, this death can be cautiously regarded as an IPA ingestion-related fatality in the hypothesis of a survival time which have promoted IPA metabolism to acetone: this hypothesis is supported by the putative limited IPA-ingested dose. This report emphasizes the fact that post mortem IPA and acetone concentration interpretation involves to take account of (i) results in multiple biological specimens, (ii) complete case history, and (iii) a search of possible IPA presence at the scene of death.","Dumollard, Wiart, Hakim, Demarly, Morbidelli, Allorge, Gaulier","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00414-020-02444-4","20201022","Acetone; Fatality; Forensic; Isopropanol; Toxicology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-23","",6369,""

"A Randomized Study Using Telepresence Robots for Behavioral Health in Interprofessional Practice and Education","<b> <i>Background:</i> </b> The events of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic forced the world to adopt telemedicine frameworks to comply with isolation and stay-at-home regulations. Telemedicine, in various forms, has been used by patients and medical professionals for quite some time, especially telepsychiatry. To examine the efficacy and role of telesimulation as a method to educate health sciences students via telepresence robots. The study recruited students from the above health science disciplines. All participants were trained to administer a contextual interview to a standardized patient (SP) for mental health concerns. <b> <i>Methods:</i> </b> The completion of the contextual interview observation form adult (CIOF-A), National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index, self-efficacy in patient centeredness questionnaire (SEPCQ), and communication skills attitude scale with or without a telepresence robot. All participants completed baseline metrics and were trained to conduct a contextual interview to an SP. Researchers block-randomized the participants to either the telepresence robot group (TP) or in-person (IP) group. <b> <i>Results:</i> </b><i>The study recruited</i> n<i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°43 participants to the IP group (</i>n<i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°21) or TP group (</i>n<i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°22).

"Prevalence of mental health problems and associated risk factors among military healthcare workers in specialized COVID-19 hospitals in Wuhan, China: A cross-sectional survey","China has been severely affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) since December 2019. Military healthcare workers in China have experienced many pressures when combating COVID-19. This study aimed to investigate the current psychological status and associated risk factors among military healthcare workers. We collected data from 194 military healthcare workers from three inpatient wards in two specialized COVID-19 hospitals using a web-based cross-sectional survey. The survey covered demographic information, the patient health questionnaire-9, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, and the patient health questionnaire-15. Hierarchical regression analysis was used to explore potential risk factors for mental health problems. The overall prevalence rates of depressive, generalized anxiety, and somatic symptoms were 37.6%, 32.5%, and 50%, respectively. Rates of severe depression, generalized anxiety, and somatic symptoms were 5.2%, 3.6%, and 15.5%, respectively. In 22.7% of cases, comorbidities existed between depression, generalized anxiety, and somatization. A junior-grade professional title was associated with depression, older age was associated with generalized anxiety and somatization, and short sleep duration and poor sleep quality were associated with all three symptoms. The prevalence of depression, generalized anxiety, and somatic symptoms among military healthcare workers in specialized COVID-19 hospitals is high during the current COVID-19 outbreak. A junior-grade professional title, older age, short sleep duration, and poor sleep quality significantly affect military healthcare workers' mental health. Continuous surveillance and monitoring of the psychological consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak should be routine to promote mental health among military healthcare workers.","Pan, Xiao, Ren, Xu, Zhang, Yang, Liu, Hao, Zhao, Bai","https://doi.org/10.1111/appy.12427","20201022","coronavirus disease 2019; depressive symptoms; generalized anxiety; mental health; somatic symptoms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-23","",6372,""
"Right atrial thrombus in a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia: a case report","Significant coagulopathy and hyperinflammation are found in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Expert consensus has recommended prophylactic anticoagulation in COVID-19 patients due to the risk of thrombo-embolism. However, the use of therapeutic anticoagulation in these patients is still a matter of debate. We describe a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia and a clinical hyperinflammatory state. He developed early respiratory depression and required ventilation, and he subsequently developed haemodynamic instability. Point-of-care echocardiography demonstrated a right atrial thrombus and right ventricular dysfunction suggestive of acute massive pulmonary embolism. He was managed with veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and local thrombolysis. Critical cases of COVID-19 pneumonia are associated with hypercoagulation, and these patients should be monitored closely for complications. Therapeutic anticoagulation may play a role in the management and prevention of thrombo-embolism.","Shamsah, Bitar, Alfoudri","https://doi.org/10.1093/ehjcr/ytaa296","20201022","COVID-19; Case report; Pneumonia; Pulmonary embolism; Thrombosis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-23","",6373,""

"Coping with Health Threats: The costs and benefits of managing emotions","How people respond to health threats can influence their own health and, when facing communal risks, even their community's health. We propose that people commonly respond to health threats by managing their emotions with cognitive strategies like reappraisal, which can reduce fear and protect mental health. However, because fear can also motivate health behaviors, reducing fear may also jeopardize health behaviors. In two diverse U.S. samples (N=1,241) tracked across three months, sequential and cross-lag panel mediation models indicated that reappraisal predicted lower fear about an ongoing health threat (COVID-19), and in turn, better mental health, but fewer recommended physical health behaviors. This trade-off was not inevitable, however: using reappraisal to increase socially-oriented positive emotions predicted better mental health without jeopardizing physical health behaviors. Examining the costs and benefits of how people cope with health threats is essential for promoting better health outcomes for individuals and communities.","Angela Moriah Smith et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4614A-DE4-685","20201020","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; positive emotions; reappraisal; emotion regulation; fear; health behaviors; mental health; covid-19","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-23","",6376,""
