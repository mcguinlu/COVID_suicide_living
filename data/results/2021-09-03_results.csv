"Stress and associated factors with received and needed support in medical students during COVID-19 pandemic: a multicenter study","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a global health crisis that has impacted daily life due to the policies created to contain the outbreak. Recent studies showed that medical students, a high-stress population, experienced deteriorated mental well-being during the pandemic. The aim of the present study was to assess stress and the need for support among Thai medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic, as a multicenter study. The present study was a cross-sectional questionnaire-based study which collected data from second through sixth year medical students. Data was collected during the pandemic from multiple medical schools spanning all six regions of Thailand. Questionnaires included: demographic data; the Thai version of the Perceived Stress Scale-10 (T-PSS-10) assessing stress level and the sources of stress; and the received supports from medical schools, the satisfaction with the supports, and the further necessary needs. There were 1,395 medical students who responded to the questionnaires. Mean T-PSS-10 score was 17.8. Most of the sources of stress were related to the changing of teaching and evaluation system. Students residing in larger medical schools were significantly more satisfied with received support and tended to gain greater support than those in medium and small sized schools. Stress-relieving activities arrangement was considered the most sought after additional support by students. Medical student stress levels were higher during the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic levels. Stress relieving activities, availability and access to mental health resources, and other strategies to reduce stress among medical students are urgently needed.","Puranachaikere, Hataiyusuk, Anupansupsai, In-Iw, Saisavoey, Techapanuwat, Arunrodpanya, Charonpongsuntorn, Wiwattanaworaset, Siripongpan, Pruttithavorn, Wonglertwisawakorn, Pojanapotha, Rueangrong, Pattrakornkul, Piyawattanametha, Piyawattanametha, Ratanapichayachai","https://doi.org/10.3946/kjme.2021.200","20210902","COVID-19; Medical students; Psychological stress; Psychosocial support systems","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-03","",17622,""
"Psychosocial factors associated with preventive pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic","Identifying the factors that predict non-adherence to recommended preventive pediatric care is necessary for the development of successful interventions to improve compliance. Given the substantial decline in well-child visits and influenza vaccinations, we sought to examine sociodemographic (i.e., parent age, education, employment status, child age, insurance coverage, household size, race and ethnicity, income, COVID-19 incidence in state) and psychosocial (i.e., child temperament, parent mental health, parent personality traits) factors associated with preventative pediatric care (well-child visits, influenza vaccines) during the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of a larger, ongoing study, 1875 parents (96% mothers, 65% age 35 or younger, 58% with a college degree) reported whether they had missed any recommended or scheduled well-child visits since the pandemic and whether they had vaccinated their child against the flu. Using data collected during fall 2020, we examine differences in these health outcomes across social/demographic factors and psychological profiles. In addition, we use lasso logistic regression models to (1) estimate the accuracy with which we can predict adherence from these characteristics and (2) identify factors most strongly, independently associated with adherence. Parent psychological factors were associated with outcomes above and beyond known demographic and social factors. For example, parent industriousness and orderliness were associated with greater likelihoods of attending well-child visits and vaccinating children, while parent conservatism and creativity were associated with lower rates. We also replicate prior work documenting that health insurance, income, and household size are major factors in receiving adequate pediatric care. Adherence to preventive pediatric care varies as a function of psychological factors, suggesting that the current system of pediatric care favors some psychological profiles over others. However, the specific traits associated with non-adherence point to potentially fruitful interventions, specifically around increasing functional proximity.","Weston, Condon, Fisher","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.114356","20210902","Demographic; Pediatric care; Personality; Vaccine; Well-child","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-03","",17623,""
"Healthcare workers' sleep quality after COVID-19 infection: a cross-sectional study","The COVID-19 pandemic not only affected physical health but also caused high levels of mental health problems including sleep disturbances, depression, and post-traumatic stress symptoms. The aim of this study was to examine the sleep parameters of healthcare workers before COVID-19 infection and after recovery. Healthcare workers who were infected with COVID-19 and whose treatment was completed at least 30 days ago were included in the study. A web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted on the participants. The median PSQI score increased significantly after COVID-19 infection (7.0) compared to the level before COVID-19 infection (5.0). The increases in median scores for subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep disturbance, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction were all significant.

"Stakeholder efforts to mitigate antiretroviral therapy interruption among people living with HIV during the COVID-19 pandemic in China: a qualitative study","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected antiretroviral therapy (ART) continuity among people living with HIV (PLHIV) worldwide. We conducted a qualitative study to explore barriers to ART maintenance and solutions to ART interruption when stringent COVID-19 control measures were implemented in China, from the perspective of PLHIV and relevant key stakeholders. Between 11 February and 15 February 2020, we interviewed PLHIV, community-based organization (CBO) workers, staff from centres for disease control and prevention (CDC) at various levels whose work is relevant to HIV care (CDC staff), HIV doctors and nurses and drug vendors from various regions in China. Semi-structured interviews were conducted using a messaging and social media app. Challenges and responses relevant to ART continuity during the COVID-19 pandemic were discussed. Themes were identified by transcript coding and mindmaps. Sixty-four stakeholders were recruited, including 16 PLHIV, 17 CBO workers, 15 CDC staff, 14 HIV doctors and nurses and two drug vendors. Many CDC staff, HIV doctors and nurses responsible for ART delivery and HIV care were shifted to COVID-19 response efforts. Barriers to ART maintenance were (a) travel restrictions, (b) inadequate communication and bureaucratic obstacles, (c) shortage in personnel, (d) privacy concerns, and (e) insufficient ART reserve. CBO helped PLHIV maintain access to ART through five solutions identified from thematic analysis: (a) coordination to refill ART from local CDC clinics or hospitals, (b) delivery of ART by mail, (c) privacy protection measures, (d) mental health counselling, and (e) providing connections to alternative sources of ART. Drug vendors contributed to ART maintenance by selling out-of-pocket ART. Social and institutional disruption from COVID-19 contributed to increased risk of ART interruption among PLHIV in China. Collaboration among key stakeholders was needed to maintain access to ART, with CBO playing an important role. Other countries facing ART interruption during current or future public health emergencies may learn from the solutions employed in China.","Sun, Zhan, Li, Yuan, Gao, Liang, Feng, Li, Zheng, Fitzpatrick, Wu, Zhai, Zou","https://doi.org/10.1002/jia2.25781","20210902","COVID-19; HIV; antiretroviral therapy; antiretroviral therapy maintenance; community-based organization; people living with HIV","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-03","",17625,""
"Domestic Violence Police Reporting and Resources During the 2020 COVID-19 Stay-at-Home Order in Chicago, Illinois","Domestic violence (DV) has become a growing public health concern during the COVID-19 pandemic because individuals may be sheltering in place with abusers and facing mounting economic and health-related stresses. To analyze associations of the 2020 COVID-19 stay-at-home (SH) order with DV police reporting and resource availability, including differences by community area racial/ethnic composition. This longitudinal cohort study assessed DV police reports (January-June 2020) obtained from the Chicago, Illinois, Police Department and DV resource availability (March and August 2020) obtained from the NowPow community resource database, both for 77 community areas in Chicago. Data were analyzed July through December 2020. The COVID-19 SH order effective March 21, 2020. Monthly rates of DV police reports and DV resource availability per 100Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000 persons. Of 77 community areas in Chicago, 28 (36.4%) were majority Black, 19 (24.7%) majority Hispanic/Latinx, 18 (23.4%) majority White, and 12 (15.6%) a different or no majority race/ethnicity, representing an estimated population of 2Ã¢â‚¬Â¯718Ã¢â‚¬Â¯555 individuals. For each community area, the SH order was associated with a decrease in the rate of DV police reports by 21.8 (95% CI, -30.48 to -13.07) crimes per 100Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000 persons per month relative to the same months in 2019. Compared with White majority community areas, Black majority areas had a decrease in the rate of DV police reports by 40.8 (95% CI, -62.93 to -18.75) crimes per 100Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000 persons per month relative to the same months in 2019. The SH order was also associated with a decrease in DV resource availability at a rate of 5.1 (95% CI, -7.55 to -2.67) resources per 100Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000 persons, with the largest decreases for mental health (-4.3 [95% CI, -5.97 to -2.66] resources per 100Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000 persons) and personal safety (-2.4 [95% CI, -4.40 to -0.41] resources per 100Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000 persons). The Black majority south side of Chicago had a larger decrease in resource availability (-6.7 [95% CI, -12.92 to -0.46] resources per 100Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000 persons) than the White majority north side. In this longitudinal cohort study, the rate of DV police reports decreased after the SH order was implemented in Chicago. This decrease was largely observed in Black majority communities, whereas there was no significant change in White majority communities. These findings may reflect decreased DV incidence but may also reflect an exacerbation of underreporting. In addition, DV resource availability decreased disproportionately on the predominantly Black south side of Chicago.","Baidoo, Zakrison, Feldmeth, Lindau, Tung","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.22260","20210902","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-03","",17626,""
"Objective and Subjective Behavioral Measures in Myopic and Non-Myopic Children During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic required a shift to electronic devices for education and entertainment, with children more confined to home, which may affect eye growth and myopia. Our goal was to assess behaviors during COVID-19 in myopic and non-myopic children. Parents completed a questionnaire for their children (ages 8.3 Ã‚Â± 2.4 years, n = 53) regarding visual activity in summer 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as during school time and the summer before COVID-19. Children also wore an Actiwatch for 10 days in summer 2020 for objective measures of light exposure, activity, and sleep. Data were analyzed with repeated-measures analysis of variance. Subjective measures showed that during COVID-19, children exhibited increased electronic device use and decreased activity and time outdoors (P &lt; 0.05 for all), while time spent doing near work was not different than during a typical school or summer session before COVID-19 (P &gt; 0.05). Objective measures during COVID-19 showed that myopic children exhibited lower daily light exposure (P = 0.04) and less activity (P = 0.04) than non-myopic children. Children demonstrated increased electronic device use and decreased activity and time outdoors during COVID-19, with myopic children exhibiting lower light exposure and activity than non-myopes. Long-term follow-up is needed to understand if these behavioral changes ultimately contribute to myopia progression. Children's behaviors changed during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have implications in eye growth and myopia.","Mirhajianmoghadam, PiÃƒÂ±a, Ostrin","https://doi.org/10.1167/tvst.10.11.4","20210902","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-03","",17627,""
"Anxiety and intimate relationships in times of lockdown due to COVID-19","The virulence of COVID-19 has been particularly problematic in countries such as Spain. This led the government to decide that the population should be locked down at home to reduce the spread of the disease and avoid the collapse of the health system. Considering this, this study analyzed the changes in intimate relationships that occurred during lockdown in terms of dyadic adjustment, conflict, and quality of the relationship, as well as their relationship with anxiety symptoms. Cross-sectional questionnaire-based study with adults (<i>N</i> = 342) aged 20-67 years who lived in Spain. Each participant completed self-report measures of anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory state and trait subscales), dyadic adjustment (Dyadic Adjustment Scale), relationship conflict and quality, and sociodemographic variables. The results showed significant levels of state anxiety, which was associated with poorer dyadic adjustment and a decrease in the perceived quality of relationships since the start of lockdown. Increased partner conflict seems to be an important predictor of dyadic adjustment and relationship quality during social isolation. This study suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected the mental health of the population, especially women. This finding is closely associated with difficulties with one's cohabiting partner (e.g., worse dyadic adjustment), but the most determining factor seems to be the previous state of the relationship.

"Daily routines, parent-child conflict, and psychological maladjustment among Chinese children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic","Family lives have been changed dramatically due to the stay-at-home orders implemented during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. A variety of factors serve to increase the risk for children and adolescents in developing mental health issues during the prolonged stay-at-home period. The primary aim of this study was to examine a complex conceptual model linking daily routines, parent-child conflict, and indices of psychological maladjustment during the COVID-19 pandemic in a large sample of Chinese children and adolescents. Participants were <i>N</i> = 1,594 children and adolescents (50.6% girls; <i>M</i><sub>age</sub> = 13.13, <i>SD</i><sub>age</sub> = 1.54) and their mothers, from Zhengzhou in Mainland China. Multisource assessments include youth self-reports of loneliness, depressive symptoms, and perceived conflict with parents during the stay-at-home period, as well as maternal reports of their child's daily routines during this time. Among the results, parent-child conflict mediated the relations between daily routines and indices of psychological maladjustment, such that a <i>lack</i> of routine predicted greater parent-child conflict, which in turn was associated with higher levels of loneliness and symptoms of depression. Further, results from multiple group analyses revealed that associations between daily routines and maladjustment were stronger among boys than girls-as well as stronger among primary school children than middle school adolescents. Findings highlighted the importance of maintaining regular routines for children's and adolescents' mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Analysis of Psychosocial Impact on Health Care Workers and General population of India during COVID 19 Pandemic using HAM-A scale","The frequency of outbreaks, pandemics is increasing across the globe which can be probably due to increased medical tourism, expansion of international exchange, travel and global warming. COVID-19 outbreak spread across the world within a few months of initiation from Wuhan City of China and affected all the countries across the globe except Antarctica. From the psychopathological view, this current COVID -19 is a stressor, trauma or stigma for health care workers as well as general population. Mental health and psychosocial consequences of COVID 19 has a serious impact on various categories of people : a) those directly involved with viral overload b) health care workers c) general population who are following social media d) quarantined individuals and their family members. The aim of our study was to determine the unforeseen psychosocial impact of COVID 19 pandemic on mental status of health care workers and general population. A cross sectional online survey using an anonymous questionnaire using snowball sampling strategy was done. The study included 480 respondents, out of which 197 were health care workers and 283 were general population. The participation was totally voluntary. Data collection took place over fifteen days .We included additional questions which were related to COVID-19 outbreak. The structured questionnaire used, consisted of questions that covered several areas. Anxiety level was assessed based on Hamilton Anxiety Rating scale ranging from 0-4 , consisted of 14 items.

"Children's Sleep During COVID-19: How Sleep Influences Surviving and Thriving in Families","The COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to disrupt the lives of families and may have implications for children with existing sleep problems. As such, we aimed to: (1) characterize sleep changes during the COVID-19 pandemic in children who had previously been identified as having sleep problems, (2) identify factors contributing to sleep changes due to COVID-19 safety measures, and (3) understand parents' and children's needs to support sleep during the pandemic. Eighty-five Canadian parents with children aged 4-14Ã¢â‚¬â€°years participated in this explanatory sequential, mixed-methods study using an online survey of children's and parents' sleep, with a subset of 16 parents, selected based on changes in their children's sleep, participating in semi-structured interviews. Families had previously participated in the Better Nights, Better Days (BNBD) randomized controlled trial. While some parents perceived their child's sleep quality improved during the COVID-19 pandemic (14.1%, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°12), many parents perceived their child's sleep had worsened (40.0%, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°34). Parents attributed children's worsened sleep to increased screen time, anxiety, and decreased exercise. Findings from semi-structured interviews highlighted the effect of disrupted routines on sleep and stress, and that stress reciprocally influenced children's and parents' sleep. The sleep of many Canadian children was affected by the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the disruption of routines influencing children's sleep. eHealth interventions, such as BNBD with modifications that address the COVID-19 context, could help families address these challenges.","MacKenzie, Keys, Hall, Gruber, Smith, Constantin, Godbout, Stremler, Reid, Hanlon-Dearman, Brown, Shea, Weiss, Ipsiroglu, Witmans, Chambers, Andreou, Begum, Corkum","https://doi.org/10.1093/jpepsy/jsab075","20210902","COVID-19; children; eHealth; mental health; parents; sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-03","",17631,""

"Exploring Factors That Influence Children's Growth and Development During a Pandemic","The potential long-term impacts of natural or man-made disasters on children and adolescents have been the subject of numerous scientific research studies over the past decades. Since the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, it has become even more important to continue these investigations in order to address the special needs of our youth. While the virus itself appears to cause less pathology in them compared to adults, the effects go beyond the disease itself. The pandemic has caused extremely high levels of stress for both the children and their families. As a result, special attention has to be given to the possible long-term impacts on their growth and development. It is very important for physicians and other healthcare providers to recognize the signs and symptoms of stress and monitor for physical and mental health inequities, and to be able to provide support when help is needed. Identifying culturally effective solutions and reaching out to community based organizations or partners for resources and programs with which families identify is an important part of this healing provision. Mind-body therapies and practices such as meditation, visualization, breathing exercises, MovazenehÃ‚Â®, and TamarkozÃ‚Â® are effective complementary therapies that can be utilized in pediatrics and help children and adolescents learn self-care skills that they could apply throughout their lives. Health providers should become educated in these safe and noninvasive techniques themselves, and consider them as possible therapeutic approaches for the treatment of stress in their pediatric patients.","Amjadi","https://doi.org/10.1177/2333794X211042464","20210902","Covid-19; TamarkozÃ‚Â®; children; development; growth; meditation; mental health; mind-body therapies; pandemic; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-03","",17633,""

"Risk factors for depression during the COVID-19 pandemic: a longitudinal study in middle-aged and older adults","The COVID-19 pandemic and resultant social restrictions have had widespread psychological ramifications, including a rise in depression prevalence. However, longitudinal studies on sociodemographic risk factors are lacking. To quantify longitudinal changes in depression symptoms during the pandemic compared with a pre-pandemic baseline, in middle-aged and older adults, and identify the risk factors contributing to this. A total of 5331 participants aged Ã¢â€°Â¥50 years were drawn from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Self-reported depression symptoms in June/July 2020 were compared with baseline data from 2-3 years prior. Regression models investigated sociodemographic and lifestyle variables that could explain variance in change in depression. Within-participant depression scores increased significantly from pre-pandemic levels: 14% met the criteria for clinical depression at baseline, compared with 26% during the pandemic. Younger age, female gender, higher depression scores at baseline, living alone and having a long-standing illness were significant risk factors. Gender-stratified regression models indicated that older age was protective for women only, whereas urban living increased risk among women only. Being an alcohol consumer was a protective factor among men only. Depression in UK adults aged Ã¢â€°Â¥50 years increased significantly during the pandemic. Being female, living alone and having a long-standing illness were prominent risk factors. Younger women living in urban areas were at particularly high risk, suggesting such individuals should be prioritised for support. Findings are also informative for future risk stratification and intervention strategies, particularly if social restrictions are reimposed as the COVID-19 crisis continues to unfold.","Rutland-Lawes, Wallinheimo, Evans","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2021.997","20210902","COVID-19; depression; mental health; older adults; social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-03","",17635,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on liver transplant recipients A single center observational study","The impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown in liver transplant (LT) patients remains unknown. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to assess the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on the physical and mental health of LT patients during the lockdown period. Between August and October 2020 a Web-based questionnaire was emailed to 238 LT patients undergoing regular follow-up at our unit. This pseudonymized survey explored demographic and lifestyle variables (i.e. eating and physical habits), disruptions in routine medical care, and different dimensions of mental health, COVID-19-related mood and coping (worries/anxiety, depression, insomnia, fear of Covid, resilience, etc.), and health perception using different validated instruments. 48.7% (116 of 238) LT recipients accepted to participate, 104 of whom gave their consent to publish the data. The median age was 63 years. Up to 39.4% presented worrying scores indicating moderate/severe generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), whereas 25.5% exhibited moderate/severe insomnia and only 10.5% moderate/severe depression. Forty patients (38.5%) gained weight, 24% experienced a worsening in their eating habits and 63.4% referred to practice less or much less exercise during the lockdown. Only 25% perceived a worsening in the control of their chronic comorbidities. Missed medical appointments (0.9%) or worsening adherence to therapy (1.9%) were exceptional. COVID-19 lockdown has negatively impacted the mental and physical health of LT patients. Long-term consequences remain unclear.","Cuadrado, Gaite, Odriozola, Oloriz, Herrera, Fortea, Amigo, Anderson, Artal, Crespo, FÃƒÂ¡brega","https://doi.org/10.17235/reed.2021.8173/2021","20210902","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-03","",17636,""
