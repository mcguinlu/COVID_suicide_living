"Coping with COVID-19 Pandemic: A Population-Based Study in Bangladesh","This study aims to investigate coping strategies used by Bangladeshi citizens during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design: Prospective, cross-sectional survey of adults (N=2001) living in Bangladesh. Methods: Participants were interviewed for socio-demographic data and completed the Bengali translated Brief-COPE Inventory. Statistical data analysis was conducted using SPSS (Version 20). Results: Participants (N=2001), aged 18 to 86 years, were recruited from eight administrative divisions within Bangladesh (mean age 31.85, SD 14.2 years). Male to female participant ratio was 53.4% (n=1074) to 46.6% (n=927). Higher scores were reported for approach coping styles (29.83, SD 8.9), with lower scores reported for avoidant coping styles (20.83, SD 6.05). Humor coping scores were reported at 2.68, SD 1.3, and religion coping scores at 5.64, SD 1.8. Both men and women showed similar coping styles. Multivariate analysis found a significant relationship between the male gender and both humor and avoidant coping (p <.01). Male gender was found to be inversely related to both religion and approach coping (p<.01). Marital status and education were significantly related to all coping style domains (p<.01). The occupation was significantly related to approach coping (p <.01). Rural and urban locations differed significantly in participant coping styles (p <.01). Factor analysis revealed two cluster groups (Factor 1 and 2) comprised of unique combinations from all coping style domains. Conclusion: Participants in this study coped with the COVID-19 pandemic by utilizing a combination of coping strategies. Factor 1 revealed both avoidant and approach coping strategies and Factor 2 revealed a combination of humor and avoidant coping strategies. Overall, higher utilization of approach coping strategies was reported, which has previously been associated with better physical and mental health outcomes. Religion was found to be a coping strategy for all participants. Future research may focus on understanding resilience in vulnerable populations, including people with disabilities or with migrant or refugee status in Bangladesh.","K M Amran Hossain; Karen Saunders; Mohamed Sakel; Lori Maria Walton; Veena Raigangar; Zakir Uddin; Mohammad Anwar Hossain; Asma Islam; Faruq Ahmed; Rafey Faruqui; Tamanna Tasnim; Shohag Rana; Shafin Rubayet; Md.

"Psychological distress and resilience in a sample of Adolescents and Young Adults with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic","BACKGROUND: Adolescents and young people (AYA) with cancer are at greater risk of psychological distress which can impact treatment. COVID-19 has resulted in changes to cancer care delivery and AYA have been disproportionately affected by economic and educational effects of COVID-19, potentially impacting on mental health. Understanding the impact of COVID-19 on AYA with cancer is important to inform care. METHODS: Online survey of 16-24 year olds receiving cancer treatment at 8 cancer centres in the UK in December 2020. We measured: self-perceived increased anxiety since COVID-19, impact of COVID-19 on treatment, life and relationships and used the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire(PHQ-8), 7-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale(GAD) and the 2-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale(CD-RISC). RESULTS: 112 AYA participated (17.8% of total eligible). 62.8% were female, 67.3% were 21-24 years. 83% were white. 59.8% had previously experienced mental health difficulties. 67.9% received cancer treatment during the pandemic and 33.9% were diagnosed during the pandemic. 78.6% reported COVID-19 having a significant impact on their life, 55.4% on their key relationship and 39.3% on their treatment. 79% reported experiencing some degree of increased anxiety since COVID-19.43.4% had moderate-severe PHQ-8 scores and 37.1% for GADS-7. Self-report of impact on life was associated with greater anxiety during COVID-19 and moderate-severe PHQ-8 score (OR 3.64, 95% CI 2.52 to 19.40, p <0.01; OR 5.23, 95%CI 1.65 to 16.56, p < 0.01). Impact on relationships was associated with greater anxiety and moderate-severe GADS-7and PHQ-8 score (OR 2.89, 95% CI 1.11 to 7.54, p = 0,03; OR 3.54, 95% CI 2.32 to 15.17, p<0.01; OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.11 to 5.25, p =0.03). Greater CD-RISC score was associated with lower risk of anxiety and mod-severe GADS-7and PHQ-8 scores (OR 0.58, 95%CI 0.41 to 0.81, p <0.01; OR 0.55 95% CI 0.4 to 0.72, p <0.01; OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.69, p <0.01) CONCLUSIONS: We found high levels of psychological distress in AYA with cancer, which is important knowledge for clinical teams working with this age group. Perceived impact of COVID-19 on relationships and life was predictive of poorer mental health, with resilience a potential protective factor.","Clare Jacobson; Rebecca Rebecca Mulholland; Laura Baker; Daniel Glazer; Emily Betts; Louise Brown; Vera Elders; Olufunmilola Ogundiran; Robert Carr; Lee D Hudson","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.29.21254529","20210331","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-01","",12519,""
"Development of clinical virtual care pathways to engage and support families requiring neonatal intensive care in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (COVES Study)","Background: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, family presence restrictions in neonatal intensive care units (NICU) were enacted to limit disease transmission and protect infants, families, and healthcare providers. The effects of pandemic parental restrictions on providing optimal family integrated neonatal care is unknown. Aim: To ensure optimal neonatal care using virtual care pathways to engage and support families in response to parental presence restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic. The research had two objectives: (1) conduct a needs assessment with families and healthcare providers (HCPs) of infants in the NICU to understand the impact of COVID-19 restrictions; and (2) develop virtual clinical care pathways to meet identified needs. Methods: This study used focus groups and individual semi-structured interviews with families and HCPs for the needs assessment and identification of barriers and facilitators, and co-design for the development of the clinical virtual care pathways. For objective 1, content analysis was conducted by two independent reviewers to categorize findings and identify important barriers and facilitators of family-integrated care. For objective 2, an agile, co-design process utilizing expert consensus of a large interdisciplinary team was used to develop the care pathways. Results: A total of 23 participants were included in the needs assessment (objective 1): 12 families and 11 HCPs. Themes identified were: (1) the need to maintain and build relationships and support systems; (2) challenges in accessing education and resources to integrate families in care; and (3) lack of standardized, accessible messaging related to COVID-19. For objective 2, we used the themes identified in the needs assessment to co-design three clinical virtual care pathways: (1) building and maintaining relationships between family and healthcare providers; (2) awareness of resources; and (3) standardized COVID-19 messaging. Conclusion: Families reported that restrictive parental presence policies affected their mental health, well-being and social support. Families and HCPs reported the restrictions impacted delivery of family integrated care, education, transition to home, and standardized messaging. Clinical care virtual pathways were designed to meet these needs to ensure more equitable family centred care.","Marsha Campbell-Yeo; Justine Dol; Brianna Richardson; Holly McCulloch; Amos Hundert; Sarah Foye; Jon Dorling; - COVES Team","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.29.21254567","20210331","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-01","",12520,""
"When Crisis Strikes, Handle With CARE","The decision to continue a career advancement program in midst of our health system's response to the COVID-19 pandemic was made after weighing the pros and cons. At a time when high priority was placed on educating the frontline nurses on rapidly changing protocols and supporting mental health, our organization reallocated resources and ways of doing things in order to maintain some form of normalcy. By doing so, we were able to demonstrate our commitment to professional development even in the face of adversity and highlight the resourcefulness of nursing professional development practitioners. As the COVID-19 crisis has laid bare, we live in an increasingly complex and interconnected world, and agility will be essential to future nursing professional development practice.","Sites, Templin","https://doi.org/10.1097/NND.0000000000000707","20210331","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-01","",12521,""
"Rapid Mobilization of Medical Students to Provide Health Care Workers with Emergency Childcare During the COVID-19 Pandemic","In March of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic spread rapidly within the United States and began overwhelming the health care system. To conserve PPE, reduce the spread of the virus, and keep student learners safe, leaders of medical schools across the country made the difficult decision to suspend in-person clinical experiences. As medical students were sent home and hospital systems ramped up their response to the virus, many essential health care workers (HCWs) faced an immediate challenge. As &quot;non-essential&quot; services such as schools and daycare centers abruptly closed, HCWs serving on the frontlines in inpatient settings needed a way to both fight the pandemic and care for their children. Medical students at Oregon Health &amp; Science University were able to rapidly organize to provide childcare for essential HCWs. For roughly eight weeks following the state of emergency (March 13 through May 15, 2020) students used Twitter and emerging technology to match families in need of childcare with a trainee volunteer. By May 15th, the service had successfully fulfilled 181 of the 202 requests for childcare (90%) over the course of 8 weeks. Of the 181 completed childcare requests, 172 (95%) were fulfilled by an individual (1:1 volunteer-to-household pairing), and 9 (5%) were fulfilled by two or more volunteers. The trainees who provided childcare will apply the skills learned (e.g., clear communication, grassroots organizing, triaging, leveraging new technology) to patient care. Broader applications for this system include organizing volunteers to conduct contract tracing or to provide public health information in languages other than English. Future research includes examining the effect of the service on the productivity, morale, and mental health of both those who provided and received childcare.","Lane, Tran, Graulty, Bumsted","https://doi.org/10.1097/ACM.0000000000004115","20210331","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-01","",12522,""
"The mediating effect of meditation and physical activity behaviors on the associations of COVID-19 related worry, attention to news, and stress with mental health in mobile app users in the United States: Cross-sectional survey","The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been declared an international public health emergency with potentially long-lasting effects on mental health. There is a need to identify effective health behaviors to mitigate the negative mental health impact of COVID-19. The objectives were to: (1) examine the regional differences in mental health and COVID-19 related worry, attention to news, and stress, in light of the state-level prevalence of COVID-19 cases, (2) estimate the associations between COVID-19 related worry, attention to news, and stress and health behavior engagement (i.e., physical activity, mindfulness meditation) and mental health, and (3) explore the mediating effect of health behavior engagement on the associations between COVID-19 related worry, attention to news, and stress with mental health. A cross-sectional survey was distributed to a sample of US adult paying subscribers to the Calm app (data collection April 22 to June 3, 2020). The survey assessed COVID-19 related worry, attention to news, and stress, health behavior engagement, and mental health (i.e., perceived stress, post-traumatic stress disorder, and anxiety and depression). Statistical analyses were performed using R software. Differences in COVID-19 related worry, attention to news, and stress and mental health by location were assessed using t-tests and chi-square tests. Logistic and OLS models regressed mental health and health behavior on COVID-19 related worry, attention to news, and stress, and Causal Mediation Analysis was used to estimate the significance of mediation effects. The median age (N=8392) was 47 (SD=13.8) years. Mid-Atlantic region (New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania) participants reported higher levels of stress, more severe depression symptoms, were more worried about COVID-19, paid more attention to COVID-19 news, and had more stress-related to social distancing recommendations than participants living in other regions. The association between worry about COVID-19 and perceived stress was significantly mediated by changes in physical activity (P&lt;.001), strength of meditation habit (P&lt;.001), and stopping meditation (P=.046). The association between worry about COVID-19 and PTSD symptoms was significantly mediated by changes in physical activity (P&lt;.001) and strength of meditation habit (P&lt;.001). Our findings describe the mental health impact of COVID-19 and outline how continued participation in health behaviors such as physical activity and mindfulness meditation reduce worsening mental health due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These data have important implications for public health agencies and health organizations to promote the maintenance of health habits to reduce the residual mental health burden of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Green, Huberty, Puzia, Stecher","https://doi.org/10.2196/28479","20210331","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-01","",12523,""
"How fast should social restrictions be eased in England as COVID-19 vaccinations are rolled out?","Vaccination against the COVID-19 virus began in December 2020 in the UK and is now running at 5% population/week. High Levels of social restrictions were implemented for the third time in January 2021 to control the second wave and resulting increases in hospitalisations and deaths. Easing those restrictions must balance multiple challenging priorities, weighing the risk of more deaths and hospitalisations against damage done to mental health, incomes and standards of living, education and provision of non-Covid-19 healthcare. Weekly and monthly officially published values in 2020/21 were used to estimate the influence of seasonality and social restrictions on the spread of COVID-19 by age group, on the economy and healthcare services. These factors were combined with the estimated impact of vaccinations and immunity from past infections into a model that retrospectively reflected the actual numbers of reported deaths closely both in 2020 and early 2021. The model was applied prospectively to the next 6 months to evaluate the impact of different speeds of easing social restrictions. The results show vaccinations as significantly reducing the number of hospitalisations and deaths. The central estimate is that relative to rapid easing, the avoided loss of 57,000 life-years from a strategy of relatively slow easing over the next 4 months comes at a cost in terms of GDP reduction of around Ã‚Â£0.4 million/life-year loss avoided. This is over 10 times higher than the usual limit the NHS uses for spending against Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) saved. Alternative assumptions for key factors affecting the spread of the virus give significantly different trade-offs between costs and benefits of different speeds of easing. Disruption of non-Covid-19 Healthcare provision also increases in times of higher levels of social restrictions. In most cases, the results favour a somewhat faster easing of restrictions in England than current policy implies.","Miles, Heald, Stedman","https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14191","20210331","Consequences; Covid-19; GDP; Life Years; Unlock","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-01","",12524,""
"Impact of COVID-19 lockdown on suicide attempts : AÃ‚Â retrospective analysis of the springtime admissions to the trauma resuscitation room at the Medical University of Vienna from 2015-2020","In response to the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic the Austrian government issued aÃ‚Â lockdown from 16 March to 15 May 2020. As periods of economic and emotional burden have proven to detrimentally affect people's psychological health, healthcare officials warned that the strict measures could have aÃ‚Â serious impact on psychological health, leading to an increase in suicide attempts. Thus, the objective was to provide evidence for this assumption. All adult patients admitted to the trauma resuscitation room of the Medical University of Vienna during the lockdown period following aÃ‚Â suicide attempt were included in this analysis, forming the study group. Suicidal patients treated during the same period in 2015, 2016, 2018, and 2019 were pooled to create the control group. The year 2017 was excluded because another major hospital in Vienna was partially closed due to aÃ‚Â change in infrastructure, resulting in an increased number of severely injured patients treated at our department. As the lockdown caused aÃ‚Â markedly decreased number of patients admitted due to other reasons than suicide the actual number was replaced with the average number of patients admitted in the relevant previous 4 years. By comparing the study and the control group based on this realistic estimate we revealed an increase in attempted suicides during the lockdown period (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Demographic, mental health-related, and injury specific patient data did not differ between the groups. The results strongly urge for an improvement in crisis intervention and suicide prevention measures in the event of aÃ‚Â future lockdown.","Carlin, Baumgartner, Moftakhar, KÃƒÂ¶nig, Negrin","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00508-021-01839-6","20210331","COVID-19 pandemic; Coronavirus lockdown; Polytrauma; Suicide attempts during lockdown; Suicide prevention","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-01","",12525,""
"Cost-effectiveness of Treatments for Opioid Use Disorder","Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the US, yet many individuals with OUD do not receive treatment. To assess the cost-effectiveness of OUD treatments and association of these treatments with outcomes in the US. This model-based cost-effectiveness analysis included a US population with OUD. Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) with buprenorphine, methadone, or injectable extended-release naltrexone; psychotherapy (beyond standard counseling); overdose education and naloxone distribution (OEND); and contingency management (CM). Fatal and nonfatal overdoses and deaths throughout 5 years, discounted lifetime quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and costs. In the base case, in the absence of treatment, 42 717 overdoses (4132 fatal, 38 585 nonfatal) and 12 660 deaths were estimated to occur in a cohort of 100 000 patients over 5 years, and 11.58 discounted lifetime QALYs were estimated to be experienced per person. An estimated reduction in overdoses was associated with MAT with methadone (10.7%), MAT with buprenorphine or naltrexone (22.0%), and when combined with CM and psychotherapy (range, 21.0%-31.4%). Estimated deceased deaths were associated with MAT with methadone (6%), MAT with buprenorphine or naltrexone (13.9%), and when combined with CM, OEND, and psychotherapy (16.9%). MAT yielded discounted gains of 1.02 to 1.07 QALYs per person. Including only health care sector costs, methadone cost $16Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000/QALY gained compared with no treatment, followed by methadone with OEND ($22Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000/QALY gained), then by buprenorphine with OEND and CM ($42Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000/QALY gained), and then by buprenorphine with OEND, CM, and psychotherapy ($250Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000/QALY gained). MAT with naltrexone was dominated by other treatment alternatives. When criminal justice costs were included, all forms of MAT (with buprenorphine, methadone, and naltrexone) were associated with cost savings compared with no treatment, yielding savings of $25Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000 to $105Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000 in lifetime costs per person. The largest cost savings were associated with methadone plus CM. Results were qualitatively unchanged over a wide range of sensitivity analyses. An analysis using demographic and cost data for Veterans Health Administration patients yielded similar findings. In this cost-effectiveness analysis, expanded access to MAT, combined with OEND and CM, was associated with cost-saving reductions in morbidity and mortality from OUD. Lack of widespread MAT availability limits access to a cost-saving medical intervention that reduces morbidity and mortality from OUD. Opioid overdoses in the US likely reached a record high in 2020 because of COVID-19 increasing substance use, exacerbating stress and social isolation, and interfering with opioid treatment. It is essential to understand the cost-effectiveness of alternative forms of MAT to treat OUD.","Fairley, Humphreys, Joyce, Bounthavong, Trafton, Combs, Oliva, Goldhaber-Fiebert, Asch, Brandeau, Owens","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2021.0247","20210331","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-01","",12526,""

"COVID-19 and the teacher's voice: self-perception and contributions of speech therapy to voice and communication during the pandemic","We aimed to analyze the vocal self-perception of Brazilian teachers and their communication needs, vocal signs and symptoms, and voice-related lifestyles during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and, based on this information, to develop guidance materials intended for dissemination to these teachers and the general community. An online questionnaire designed for this survey was distributed via the researchers' networks and was available for completion by any teacher, except those who were not working at the time. There were 1,253 teachers from all over Brazil, of both sexes, covering a wide age range, working at different levels of education, and most with more than ten years of experience. Descriptive and inferential analyses of the data were performed. On comparing the prepandemic period with the current one, participants indicated voice improvements. In contrast, they presented symptoms such as dry throat, effort in addressing remote classes, hoarseness after classes, and difficulties with the use of headphones, among others. They further indicated stress, general fatigue, impact of the pandemic on mental health, and the overlapping of many home tasks with professional tasks. Some smoked, and others hydrated insufficiently. Although teachers generally noticed voice improvements during the pandemic, a proportion of them perceived worsening of voices. Many indicated several factors in which speech-language pathologists could guide them with the aim of improving performance and comfort during remote and hybrid classes, an initiative that will positively impact not only their voice and communication but also their quality of life.","Nemr, SimÃƒÂµes-Zenari, Almeida, Martins, Saito","https://doi.org/10.6061/clinics/2021/e2641","20210331","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-01","",12528,""
"Rural-urban disparities in knowledge, behaviors, and mental health during COVID-19 pandemic: A community-based cross-sectional survey","To examine the knowledge level, behaviors, and psychological status of the Chinese population during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to explore the differences between urban and rural areas.We carried out a cross-sectional survey of the knowledge, behaviors related to COVID-19, and mental health in a probability sample of 3001 community residents in 30 provinces or districts across China from February 16-23, 2020. Convenience sampling and a snowball sampling were adopted. We used General Anxiety Disorder (GAD), the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and knowledge and behaviors questionnaire of community residents regarding COVID-19 designed by us to investigate the psychological status, disease-related knowledge, and the behavior of Chinese urban and rural residents during the pandemic.The average score of anxiety and depression among urban residents was 9.15 and 11.25, respectively, while the figures in rural areas were 8.69 and 10.57, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference in the levels of anxiety (PÃ¢â‚¬Å &lt;Ã¢â‚¬Å .01) and depression (PÃ¢â‚¬Å &lt;Ã¢â‚¬Å .01). Urban participants reported significantly higher levels of knowledge regarding COVID-19 in all aspects (transmission, prevention measures, symptoms of infection, treatment, and prognosis) (PÃ¢â‚¬Å &lt;Ã¢â‚¬Å .01), compared to their rural counterparts.

"COVID-related fear maintains controlling parenting behaviors during the pandemic","The direct threat posed by the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), uncertainty surrounding best safety practices, and secondary consequences of the virus have led to widespread stress and declining mental health across communities and individuals. These stresses may impact parenting behaviors, potentially leading to negative consequences for children. Controlling parenting behaviors increase in the face of perceived environmental threat and are associated with adverse mental health outcomes for children; however, determinants of parenting behaviors have not been investigated during the COVID-19 pandemic. The current study prospectively evaluated parenting behaviors during the pandemic (N=87). Results indicated that all negative affect emotions investigated were positively associated with controlling parenting behaviors. However, only COVID-related fear predicted changes in controlling parenting behaviors across timepoints. Specifically, although controlling parenting behaviors decreased in the overall sample from time 1 to time 2, higher COVID-related fear scores at time 1 predicted maintenance of high levels of controlling parenting behaviors at time 2. Additionally, this effect was specific to controlling, as opposed to more adaptive, parenting behaviors. Future studies should investigate the association between parents' COVID-related fear, controlling parenting behaviors, and adverse mental health outcomes for children in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Wissemann, Mathes, Meyer, Schmidt","https://doi.org/10.1080/16506073.2021.1878274","20210331","Parenting; child anxiety; controlling; development; fear; prospective","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-01","",12530,""
"Insomnia during the COVID-19 pandemic: the role of depression and COVID-19-related risk factors","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in dramatic changes to sleep patterns and higher prevalence of insomnia, which threaten overall mental and physical health. We examined whether safety behaviors in response to COVID-19, worry in response to COVID-19, and depression predicted insomnia, with age, race, and sex as covariates. A community sample from the United States (<i>n</i> =Ã‚Â 321, <i>M</i>ageÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 40.02, <i>SDÃ‚Â </i>=Ã‚Â 10.54; 53.6% female) recruited using online crowdsourcing completed self-report measures in May of 2020 and again three months later. At baseline, our model accounted for 68.1% of the variance in insomnia, with depression as the only significant predictor (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â .70, <i>p</i> &lt;Ã‚Â .001). In the longitudinal analyses, only baseline insomnia symptoms predicted 3-month follow-up insomnia symptoms (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â .70, <i>p</i> &lt;Ã‚Â .001; 67.1% of variance). Of note, COVID-19 worry and some COVID-19 safety behaviors were related to 3-month follow-up safety behaviors, but not insomnia. Our findings demonstrated that depression is an important factor to consider for concurrent insomnia symptoms. Our results have implications regarding the development of interventions for insomnia during the COVID-19 pandemic and suggest that clinicians should consider depression when assessing for and treating insomnia symptoms.","Pizzonia, Koscinski, Suhr, Accorso, Allan, Allan","https://doi.org/10.1080/16506073.2021.1879241","20210331","COVID-19 worry; Insomnia; SEM; depression; transdiagnostic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-01","",12531,""
"Stress of university students before and after campus closure in response to COVID-19","Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, universities were forced to adopt a remote learning model, which introduced a number of stressors into college students' everyday life and study habits. The current study investigates if students' study-related stress increased after the pandemic's onset and how individual and contextual factors moderate this potential stress increase. Longitudinal survey data about students' stress levels and self-efficacy in self-regulation were collected before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic at a public university (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°274). Regression analysis results show an overall increase in study-related stress levels after the onset of the pandemic. Students with self-efficacy in self-regulation reported lower stress increases; students with higher mental health impairment and limited time for coursework reported larger stress increases. To address students' stress levels and strengthen coping resources, universities should consider providing students with resources to improve their self-regulation and time-management skills.","von Keyserlingk, Yamaguchi-Pedroza, Arum, Eccles","https://doi.org/10.1002/jcop.22561","20210331","COVID-19; college students; longitudinal data; mental health; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-01","",12532,""
"Impact of COVID-19: urging a need for multi-domain assessment of COVID-19 inpatients","To retrospectively analyse data obtained from the multi-domain assessment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, to describe their health status at discharge, and to investigate whether subgroups of patients, more specific ICU patients and older adults (&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°70Ã‚Â years), had more (or less) risk to experience specific impairments. Retrospective case series in the University Hospitals Leuven, Belgium of confirmed COVID-19 patients 'after surviving an ICU-stay', 'agedÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°70Ã‚Â years', or 'agedÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°70Ã‚Â years with a length of hospitalizationÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°7Ã‚Â days'.

Older adults had more physical, functional, and cognitive impairments. ICU patients had a lower hand grip force. The high prevalence of physical, cognitive, psychological, and functional impairments in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, both ICU and non-ICU patients, indicates that assessment of impairments is imperative.

"Psychological impact of COVID-19 on health workers in Ghana: A multicentre, cross-sectional study","The COVID-19 pandemic has exacted an appreciable burden on health systems globally including adverse psychological impacts on health workers. This study sought to assess COVID-19-related fear, depression, anxiety and stress among hospital staff, potential factors that may help reduce its psychological effects and their personal coping strategies. The study will help to highlight the psychological impact of COVID-19 on Ghanaian health workers and indirectly serve as a needs assessment survey for input to support affected staff and the broader health system. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among health workers in three hospitals in the Ashanti Region of Ghana from 11 July 2020 to 12 August 2020. Demographic data and scores from the validated DASS-21 and Fear of COVID-19 scales and two other scales developed de novo were entered from 272 self-administered questionnaires and analyzed for means, frequencies and proportions. Fisher's exact test analysis was done to ascertain associations between selected independent variables and depression, anxiety, stress and fear. Parametric and non-parametric tests were used to compare the mean and median scores of the outcome variables across the three study hospitals. Over 40% of respondents had fear while 21.1%, 27.8% and 8.2% had depression, anxiety and stress, respectively. Positive attitudes from colleagues and the government's tax-free salary relief were some factors said to reduce the psychological effects while over half of participants indicated praying more often as a coping strategy. There is a need for the health system to recognize the presence of these adverse psychological effects in health workers and take pragmatic steps to address them.","Ofori, Osarfo, Agbeno, Manu, Amoah","https://doi.org/10.1177/20503121211000919","20210331","COVID-19; Ghana; depression; fear; health workers; psychological effects","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-01","",12534,""
"Diagnosis and Management of Cognitive Concerns in the Oldest-Old","The fastest-growing group of elderly individuals is the &quot;oldest-old,&quot; usually defined as those age 85Ã‚Â years and above. These individuals account for much of the rapid increase in cases of dementing illness throughout the world but remain underrepresented in the body of literature on this topic. The aim of this review is first to outline the unique contributing factors and complications that must be considered by clinicians in evaluating an oldest-old individual with cognitive complaints. Secondly, the evidence for management of these cognitive concerns is reviewed. In addition to well-established associations between impaired cognition and physical disability, falls, and frailty, there is now evidence that exercise performed decades earlier confers a cognitive benefit in the oldest-old. Moreover, though aggressive blood pressure control is critical earlier in life for prevention of strokes, renal disease, and other comorbidities, hypertension started after age 80 is in fact associated with a decreased risk of clinical dementia, carrying significant implications for the medical management of oldest-old individuals. The oldest-old are more likely to reside in care facilities, where social isolation might be exacerbated by a consistently lower rate of internet-connected device use. The COVID-19 pandemic has not only highlighted the increased mortality rate among the oldest-old but has also brought the increased social isolation in this group to the forte. Differing from the &quot;younger-old&quot; in a number of respects, the oldest-old is a unique population not just in their vulnerability to cognitive disorders but also in the diagnostic challenges they can pose. The oldest-old are more likely to be afflicted by sensory deficits, physical disability, poor nutrition, frailty, and depression, which must be accounted for in the assessment of cognitive complaints as they may confound or complicate the presentation. Social isolation and institutionalization are also associated with impaired cognition, perhaps as sequelae, precipitants, or both. Ante-mortem diagnostic tools remain particularly limited among the oldest-old, especially given the likelihood of these individuals to have multiple co-occurring types of neuropathology, and the presence of neuropathology in those who remain cognitively intact. In addition to the symptomatic treatments indicated for patients of all ages with dementia, management of cognitive impairment in the oldest-old may be further optimized by use of assistive devices, augmentation of dietary protein, and liberalization of medication regimens for risk factors such as hypertension.","Borders, Sajjadi","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11940-021-00665-5","20210331","Cognition; Dementia; Oldest-old; Sensory deficit","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-01","",12535,""
"Evaluation <i>of a primary care based collaborative care model (PARTNERS2) for people with diagnoses of</i> schizophrenia, bipolar or other psychoses: Study protocol for a cluster randomised controlled trial","Current NHS policy encourages an integrated approach to provision of mental and physical care for individuals with long term mental health problems. The 'PARTNERS2' complex intervention is designed to support individuals with psychosis in a primary care setting. The trial will evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the PARTNERS2 intervention. This is a cluster randomised controlled superiority trial comparing collaborative care (PARTNERS2) with care as usual, with an internal pilot to assess feasibility. The setting will be primary care within four trial recruitment areas: Birmingham &amp; Solihull, Cornwall, Plymouth and Somerset. GP practices are randomised 1:1 to either (a) the PARTNERS2 intervention plus modified standard care (intervention) or (b) standard care only (control). PARTNERS2 is a flexible general practice based person-centred coaching based intervention aimed at addressing mental health, physical health and social care needs. Two hundred eligible individuals from 39 GP practices are taking part. They were recruited through identification from secondary and primary care databases. The primary hypothesis is quality of life. Secondary outcomes include: mental wellbeing, time use, recovery and process of physical care. A process evaluation will assess fidelity of intervention delivery, test hypothesised mechanisms of action and look for unintended consequences. An economic evaluation will estimate the cost-effectiveness. Intervention delivery and follow up have been modified during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on remote mental healthcare and prescribing in psychiatry: an electronic health record study","The recent COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted mental healthcare delivery, with many services shifting from in-person to remote patient contact. We investigated the impact of the pandemic on the use of remote consultation and on the prescribing of psychiatric medications. The Clinical Record Interactive Search tool was used to examine deidentified electronic health records of people receiving mental healthcare from the South London and Maudsley (SLaM) NHS Foundation Trust. Data from the period before and after the onset of the pandemic were analysed using linear regression, and visualised using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing. All patients receiving care from SLaM between 7 January 2019 and 20 September 2020 (around 37 500 patients per week). (i) The number of clinical contacts (in-person, remote or non-attended) with mental healthcare professionals per week.(ii) Prescribing of antipsychotic and mood stabiliser medications per week. Following the onset of the pandemic, the frequency of in-person contacts was significantly reduced compared with that in the previous year (ÃŽÂ² coefficient: -5829.6 contacts, 95% CI -6919.5 to -4739.6, p&lt;0.001), while the frequency of remote contacts significantly increased (ÃŽÂ² coefficient: 3338.5 contacts, 95% CI 3074.4 to 3602.7, p&lt;0.001). Rates of remote consultation were lower in older adults than in working age adults, children and adolescents. Despite this change in the type of patient contact, antipsychotic and mood stabiliser prescribing remained at similar levels. The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with a marked increase in remote consultation, particularly among younger patients. However, there was no evidence that this has led to changes in psychiatric prescribing. Nevertheless, further work is needed to ensure that older patients are able to access mental healthcare remotely.","Patel, Irving, Brinn, Broadbent, Shetty, Pritchard, Downs, Stewart, Harland, McGuire","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-046365","20210331","epidemiology; health informatics; mental health; psychiatry; telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-01","",12537,""

"Meaningful activities during COVID-19 lockdown and association with mental health in Belgian adults","The spread of COVID-19 has affected people's daily lives, and the lockdown may have led to a disruption of daily activities and a decrease of people's mental health. To identify correlates of adults' mental health during the COVID-19 lockdown in Belgium and to assess the role of meaningful activities in particular. A cross-sectional web survey for assessing mental health (General Health Questionnaire), resilience (Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale), meaning in activities (Engagement in Meaningful Activities Survey), and demographics was conducted during the first Belgian lockdown between April 24 and May 4, 2020. The lockdown consisted of closing schools, non-essential shops, and recreational settings, employees worked from home or were technically unemployed, and it was forbidden to undertake social activities. Every adult who had access to the internet and lived in Belgium could participate in the survey; respondents were recruited online through social media and e-mails. Hierarchical linear regression was used to identify key correlates. Participants (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1781) reported low mental health (MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°14.85/36).

"Changes in Workers' Sedentary and Physical Activity Behaviors in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic and Their Relationships With Fatigue: Longitudinal Online Study","Sedentary behaviors and physical activity are likely to be affected by the COVID-19 outbreak, and sedentary lifestyles can increase subjective fatigue. The nonpharmaceutical policies imposed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic may also have adverse effects on fatigue. This study has two aims: to examine the changes in sedentary behaviors and physical activity of company workers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan and to examine relationships between changes in these sedentary behaviors and physical activity and changes in fatigue. Data from a nationwide prospective online survey conducted in 2019 and 2020 were used. On February 22, 2019, an email with a link to participate in the study was sent to 45,659 workers, aged 20 to 59 years, who were randomly selected from a database of approximately 1 million individuals. A total of 2466 and 1318 participants, who self-reported their occupation as company workers, answered the baseline and follow-up surveys, respectively. Surveys captured fatigue, workday and daily domain-specific sedentary behaviors and physical activity, and total sedentary behaviors and physical activity. We used multivariable linear regression models to estimate associations of changes in sedentary behaviors and physical activity with changes in fatigue. Increases in public transportation sitting during workdays, other leisure sitting time during workdays, and other leisure sitting time were associated with an increase in the motivation aspect of fatigue (b=0.29, 95% CI 0-0.57, P=.048; b=0.40, 95% CI 0.18-0.62, P&lt;.001; and b=0.26, 95% CI 0.07-0.45, P=.007, respectively). Increases in work-related sitting time during workdays, total sitting time during workdays, and total work-related sitting time were significantly associated with an increase in the physical activity aspect of fatigue (b=0.06, 95% CI 0-0.12, P=.03; b=0.05, 95% CI 0.01-0.09, P=.02; and b=0.07, 95% CI 0-0.14, P=.04, respectively). The motivation and physical activity aspects of fatigue increased by 0.06 for each 1-hour increase in total sitting time between baseline and follow-up (b=0.06, 95% CI 0-0.11, P=.045; and b=0.06, 95% CI 0.01-0.10, P=.009, respectively). Our findings demonstrated that sedentary and active behaviors among company workers in Japan were negatively affected during the COVID-19 outbreak. Increases in several domain-specific sedentary behaviors also contributed to unfavorable changes in workers' fatigue. Social distancing and teleworking amid a pandemic may contribute to the sedentary lifestyle of company workers. Public health interventions are needed to mitigate the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or future pandemics on sedentary and physical activity behaviors and fatigue among company workers.","Koohsari, Nakaya, McCormack, Shibata, Ishii, Oka","https://doi.org/10.2196/26293","20210331","COVID-19; Japan; mental health; physical inactivity; prospective design; sitting time","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-01","",12540,""
"Patterns of Youth Inpatient Psychiatric Admissions Before and After the Onset of the COVID-19 Pandemic","To slow the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the virus causing 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), many state authorities enforced extreme social distancing measures, such as closing schools, implementing online instruction, canceling major events, and limiting social contact outside families.

"Stress and Sleep Across the Onset of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Impact of Distance Learning on US College Studentsâ€™ Health Trajectories","Study Objectives. This study examined associations between average and intraindividual trajectories of stress, sleep duration, and sleep quality in college students before and after transitioning to online learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods. Two hundred and one first-year college students answered twice-weekly questionnaires assessing stress exposure, sleep duration, and sleep quality from January until May, 2020 (N= 4,278 unique observations). Results. Multilevel growth modeling revealed that prior to distance learning, student stress was increasing and sleep duration and quality were decreasing. After transitioning online, studentsâ€™ stress immediately and continuously decreased; sleep quality initially increased but decreased over time; and sleep duration increased but then plateaued for the remainder of the semester. Days with higher stress than typical for that student were associated with lower sleep quality, and higher average stress exposure was linked with shorter sleep duration and lower sleep quality. Specific demographics (e.g., females) were identified as at-risk for stress and sleep problems. Conclusions. Although remote learning initially alleviated college studentsâ€™ stress and improved sleep, these effects plateaued, and greater exposure to academic, financial, and interpersonal stressors predicted worse sleep on both daily and average levels. Environmental stressors may particularly dictate sleep quality during times of transition, but changes in learning modalities may mitigate short-term detrimental health outcomes, even during a developmental period with considerable stress vulnerability. Future studies should examine the longer-term implications of these trajectories on mental and physical health.","Michaela S Gusman et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460CA-CA7-239","20210401","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Adolescence; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Early Adulthood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Social health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; college students; sleep; pandemic; stress; sleep quality; covid-19; sleep duration; ecological momentary assessment","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-01","",12547,""
"Personal and caregiver resilience relate to lower internalizing symptoms among Peruvian adolescents during COVID19 lockdown","The COVID-19 pandemic has touched the lives of adolescents around the world. This longitudinal, observational study followed 1,334 adolescents (11 - 17 yo) to investigate whether personal and/or caregiver resilience relates to changes in internalizing symptoms during six stressful weeks of COVID-19 lockdown in PerÃº. In this work, we contextualize socio-ecological resilience in relation to culturally-relevant personal and caregiver resources that youth can use to adapt to stressful situations. We found that adolescents who reported higher levels of personal, caregiver, and overall resilience had lower levels of anxiety and depression at week six. We also find that personal, caregiver and overall resilience moderated the change in anxiety across the five week period of lockdown.","Victoria Guazzelli Williamson et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46141-BFB-ABE","20210401","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Adolescence","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-01","",12548,""
