"The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on well-being of Italian physicians: a report from the Italian Society of Internal Medicine (SIMI) national survey","Over the past few years, COVID-19 pandemic has imposed a high toll worldwide, with a high burden of morbidity and mortality. Healthcare practitioners (HCPs) have been in the frontline since the beginning of the outbreak, and the high level of stress have affected their physical and mental status, as well as their relationships. We aimed at exploring the self-reported changes in comprehensive well-being in a cohort of Italian physicians. An online-based survey was administered to the members of the Italian Society of Internal Medicine (SIMI) between March and June 2021. The survey was based on 32 multiple-choice questions exploring self-reported physical and mental well-being, as well as changes in workloads, work-related feelings and physicians' relationship with patients, colleagues and families. 228 physicians (mean age: 35.7Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°9.8Ã‚Â years) participated in the survey; 120 (52.6%) were residents, 196 (86.0%) worked in COVID-19 units and 65 (28.5%) had COVID-19 during the pandemic. A significant proportion of respondents reported to have experience onset or worsening of physical and mental symptoms, with insomnia/sleep disorders (58.3%) and mood swings (47.8%) being the most common, respectively. The burden of physical and mental consequences was broadly higher among residents compared to specialists, with the former reporting more frequently an increase in the number of worked hours (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.020) and being more frequently infected with COVID-19 (35.0% vs. 21.3, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.032). Moreover, familiar and doctor-patient relationships were also considerably affected. Physicians have been suffering a wide spectrum of physical, mental and relational consequences during COVID-19 pandemic, with youngest doctors being more likely to present several physical and mental health symptoms. Further studies are needed to evaluate long-term consequences of COVID-19 pandemic on the well-being of HCPs, and potential preventive strategies.","Romiti, Bencivenga, Villani, Cicco, Cimellaro, Dalbeni, Talerico, Pietrangelo, Sesti, Zaccone, Armentaro, Arnone, Barone, Bencivenga, Bertolino, Bianco, Binello, Brancati, Buzzetti, Capeci, Cicco, Cordeddu, Curcio, Dalbeni, D'Abbondanza, D'Agnano, D'Ardes, De Feo, Di Marca, Donnarumma, Fei, Filippini, Gambino, Lombardi, Marra, Mattioli, Miceli, Noviello, Olivieri, Padula, Parente, Pes, Piano, Pignataro, Poma, Porceddu, Ricchio, Romiti, Sabena, Salice, Salzano, Sangineto, Savona, SavriÃƒÂ©, Stabile, Susca, Talerico, Teatini, Tombolini, Traversa, Vettore, Vignali, Villani, Vilardi, Zaccone","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11739-022-03108-4","20221001","COVID-19; Healthcare; SARS-CoV-2; Well-being; Work-related stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-03","",38608,""
"Effects of widespread community use of face masks on communication, participation, and quality of life in Australia during the COVID-19 pandemic","The objective was to document the influence of face mask use by other people on communication experiences, participation in activities, and quality of life. Australian adults (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°665) completed an online survey; 90.8% resided in a state with mandatory mask use outside the home and 44.1% self-reported hearing difficulties. Mask use was reported as negatively affecting communication quality in the community (90.2%) and workplace (91.8%), and with household members (59.1%), including an increased requirement for clarification and repetition, increased difficulty communicating, and decreased understanding. Masks influenced feelings when communicating in the community (74.1%) and workplace (76.7%), and with household members (43.6%), including increased fatigue and frustration, and decreased connection to others. Masks influenced the time spent communicating in the community (68.8%) and workplace (67.9%), and with household members (42.3%), including a decrease in the number of individuals communicated with, and the time spent communicating with each individual. Masks influenced participation in activities in the community (50.9%) and workplace (59.7%), and with household members (41.3%), including reduced participation in health-related activities, shopping, and socialising. Influences on quality of life included reduced physical and mental health, including increased loneliness. Female gender and greater self-reported hearing difficulties were significantly associated with increased influence of mask use. The wide-ranging influences of face mask use have implications for physical health and mental health, including social connectedness, and for employers and the economy. As an important measure for combatting disease spread, the negative impacts of mask use must be considered during policy formulation, and appropriate mitigating measures, such as educational campaigns, enacted.","Galvin, Tomlin, Joubert, Story","https://doi.org/10.1186/s41235-022-00436-z","20221001","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-03","",38609,""
"Exploring the over-time, multifaceted impacts of three COVID-19 lockdowns on aspects of capability, wellbeing and mental health across vulnerabilities in Austria","The Austrian government imposed multiple major lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic, but the relevant measures and their perceptions varied over time. The aim of this study was to compare the over-time impacts of the three COVID-19 lockdowns between March 2020 and December 2021 for (capability) wellbeing and mental health in Austria. Adult Austrian residents (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°87) completed an online survey about their experiences during three COVID-19 lockdowns, including capabilities (OxCAP-MH), depression and anxiety (HADS), and general wellbeing (WHO-5). Differences across the baseline and follow-up scores of these instruments were summarised by demographic/socioeconomic characteristics. Longitudinal comparisons of the impacts of the lockdowns were conducted using random effect models on panel data for overall instrument scores and individual capability items. The levels of (capability) wellbeing and mental health decreased for most respondents across the three lockdowns: average 2.4% reduction in OxCAP-MH scores, 18.8% and 9% increases in HADS depression and anxiety subscale scores respectively, and 19.7% reduction in WHO-5 score between the first and third lockdowns. Mental health treatment prior to the pandemic, social support and satisfaction with government measures were the most influential characteristics that determine the association with impacts of the chain of lockdowns. Our study is the first to assess the differential capability limiting aspects of lockdowns over time alongside their impacts on mental health and general wellbeing and calls for special attention for mental health patients, isolation and satisfaction with government measures.","Helter, Ã…Âaszewska, Simon","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-20977-z","20221001","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-03","",38610,""
