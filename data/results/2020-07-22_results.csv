"Minimizing the aerosol-generating procedures in orthodontics in the era of a pandemic: Current evidence on the reduction of hazardous effects for the treatment team and patients","The purpose of this critical review is to list the sources of aerosol production during orthodontic standard procedure, analyze the constituent components of aerosol and their dependency on modes of grinding, the presence of water and type of bur, and suggest a method to minimize the quantity and detrimental characteristics of the particles comprising the solid matter of aerosol  Minimization of water-spray syringe utilization for rinsing is suggested on bonding related procedures, while temporal conditions as represented by seasonal epidemics should be considered for the decision of intervention scheme provided as a preprocedural mouth rinse, in an attempt to reduce the load of aerosolized pathogens  In normal conditions, chlorhexidine 0 2%, preferably under elevated temperature state should be prioritized for reducing bacterial counts  In the presence of oxidation vulnerable viruses within the community, substitute strategies might be represented by the use of povidone iodine 0 2%-1%, or hydrogen peroxide 1%  After debonding, extensive material grinding, as well as aligner related attachment clean-up, should involve the use of carbide tungsten burs under water cooling conditions for cutting efficiency enhancement, duration restriction of the procedure, as well as reduction of aerosolized nanoparticles  In this respect, selection strategies of malocclusions eligible for aligner treatment should be reconsidered and future perspectives may entail careful and more restricted utilization of attachment grips  For more limited clean-up procedures, such as grinding of minimal amounts of adhesive remnants, or individualized bracket debonding in the course of treatment, hand-instruments for remnant removal might well represent an effective strategy  Efforts to minimize the use of rotary instrumentation in orthodontic settings might also lead the way for future solutions  Measures of self-protection for the treatment team should never be neglected  Dressing gowns and facemasks with filter protection layers, appropriate ventilation and fresh air flow within the operating room comprise significant links to the overall picture of practice management  Risk management considerations should be constant, but also updated as new material applications come into play, while being grounded on the best available evidence","Eliades, Theodore; Koletsi, Despina","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajodo.2020.06.002","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: American Journal of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics;2020.; Publication details: American Journal of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-22","",3243,""

However, there is often a lack of awareness and understanding of the environmental health workforce capabilities. In the United States, this is a foundational function of health departments and is the second largest public health workforce. The primary role is to protect the public from exposures to environmental hazards, disasters and disease outbreaks. More specifically, this includes addressing risks relating to sanitation, drinking water, food safety, vector control and mass gatherings. This profession is also recognized in the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2019. Despite this, the entire profession is often not considered an essential service. Rapid integration into COVID-19 activities can easily occur as most are government employees and experienced working in complex and stressful situations. This role, for example, could include working with leaders, businesses, workplaces and churches to safely reopen, and inspections to inform, educate, and empower employers, employees and the public on safe actions.

To explore suicide risk, sleep, psychological status and influencing factors of coronavirus disease 2019 patients so as to provide corresponding countermeasures  Methods Subject were collected from January 2, 2020 to March 10, 2020 Infection group: 376 (95 males and 281 females) came from COVID-19 inpatients  Control group: 501 (110 men, 391 women) from non-COVID-19 population based on WeChat, public platform, circle of friends, etc  All of them were evaluated online and offline, self-evaluation and psychiatrist evaluation  The Nurses' Global Assessment of Suicide Risk scale (NGASR), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Self-rating depression scale (SDS) were applied  T test was conducted for age, the total score of suicide risk, PSQI, SAS, SDS and the factor score of PSQI of the two groups  Chi-square test was performed to sex, history of physical illness, provenance , abnormal incidence and severe incidence of suicide risk, sleep problem, anxiety, and depression of the two groups  Correlation analysis was carried out for age, the total score of suicide risk, SAS, SDS, PSQI and the factor score of PSQI in the infected group  Independent variables (gender, age, physical disease history, the total score of SDS, SAS and PSQI and the factor score of PSQI) and the dependent variable (The total score of suicide risk) of the infection group were assessed for multiple linear regression analysis (stepwise method)  SPSS 22 0 was used to complete data statistics  Results The incidence of moderate and above suicide risk, poor sleep quality, anxiety and depression were respectively 27 39%, 63 03%, 31 91%, 54 26% in the infected group and 7 98%, 33 53%, 9 18% and 21 36% in the control group, which was significantly different from the control group (p&lt;0 01)  The rates of high and high suicide risk, poor sleep quality, severe and severe anxiety, and severe and severe depression were respectively 9 57%, 12 23%, 4 79% and 7 98% in the infected group and 3 79%, 1 80%, 0 80% and 1 80% in the control group, which was significantly different from the control group (p&lt;0 01) The total score of suicide risk, PSQI, SAS, SDS and factor points of PSQI in the infected group were all higher than those in the control group, which was significantly different from the control group (p&lt;0 01) The total score of suicide risk, SAS, SDS, PSQI and factor points of PSQI in the infected group were positively correlated  The total score of suicide risk was also positively correlated with age  Age, anxiety, depression and poor sleep are major risk factors for suicide, among which poor sleep is the most important  Conclusions Patients with COVID-19 had severe sleep problems and psychological problems and a high risk of suicide;

"Hospital suicide due to non-treatment by healthcare staff fearing COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh?","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to individuals fearing COVID-19 infection alongside conditions such anxiety, depression, trauma, and stress. For a small minority, such mental health factors can contribute to suicide. Here we report a novel reason for suicide and seemingly COVID-19-related - negligence in getting treatment by Bangladeshi healthcare providers. It was alleged that a woman committed suicide at a hospital because she was not treated and because doctors and nurses suspected she was infected with COVID-19 and did not want to get infected themselves. To help allay the fears among HCPs and the patients they are treating with COVID-19, a number of initiatives are suggested.","Mamun, Mohammed A; Bodrud-Doza, Md; Griffiths, Mark D","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102295","","Country: NL; HOLANDA; NETHERLANDS; PAISES BAJOS; THE NETHERLANDS; HOLLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Asian J Psychiatr;54: 102295, 2020 Jul 11.; Publication details: Asian J Psychiatr;54: 102295, 2020 Jul 11.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-22","",3297,""
"Clinical characteristics and treatment of critically ill patients with COVID-19 in Hebei","In December, 2019, a novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China. We aimed to clarify the epidemiology, laboratory examinations, imaging findings, and treatment of critically ill patients with COVID-19 in Hebei province, China. In this retrospective study, the demographic, laboratory and imaging, and treatment data of patients with severe COVID-19 treated in 13 designated hospitals in Hebei were collected and analyzed. A total of 319 severe COVID-19 patients were treated at the 13 designated hospitals between 22 January, 2020 and 25 March, 2020. Eventually, 51 critically ill (31 severe cases and 20 critically severe cases) patients were included in the analysis. The patients had an average age of 58.9Ã‚Â±13.7 years, and 27 (52.9%) were men. Twenty-one (41.2%) were familial cluster, and 33 (64.7%) had chronic illnesses. The patients in critically severe group had longer duration from symptom to confirmation, more severe infections, more severe lung injury, and a lower percentage of lymphocytes. All 51 patients received antiviral drugs, 47 (92.2%) received antibacterial agents, 49 (96.1%) received traditional Chinese drugs, and 46 (90.2%) received methylprednisolone. The critically severe patients received more fluid and more diuretic treatment; 14 (70.0%) required invasive mechanical ventilation, and 13 (65.0%) developed extrapulmonary complications. COVID-19 patients who had underlying diseases and longer confirmation times were more likely to progress to critically severe COVID-19. These patients also presented with a higher risk of respiratory depression, circulatory collapse, extrapulmonary complications, and infection.","Chen, Zhang, Zhu, Liu, Yan, Cai, Zhang, Zhi, Hu","https://doi.org/10.21037/apm-20-1273","20200721","2019 novel coronavirus; 2019-nCoV; SARS-CoV-2; critically ill; novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-22","",3298,""
"Associations between COVID-19 related media consumption and symptoms of anxiety, depression and COVID-19 related fear in the general population in Germany","In context of the current COVID-19 pandemic the consumption of pandemic-related media coverage may be an important factor that is associated with anxiety and psychological distress. Aim of the study was to examine those associations in the general population in Germany. 6233 participants took part in an online-survey (March 27th-April 6th, 2020), which included demographic information and media exploitation in terms of duration, frequency and types of media. Symptoms of depression, unspecific anxiety and COVID-19 related anxiety were ascertained with standardized questionnaires. Frequency, duration and diversity of media exposure were positively associated with more symptoms of depression and unspecific and COVID-19 specific anxiety. We obtained the critical threshold of seven times per day and 2.5Ã‚Â h of media exposure to mark the difference between mild and moderate symptoms of (un)specific anxiety and depression. Particularly the usage of social media was associated with more pronounced psychological strain. Participants with pre-existing fears seem to be particularly vulnerable for mental distress related to more immoderate media consumption. Our findings provide some evidence for problematical associations of COVID-19 related media exposure with psychological strain and could serve as an orientation for recommendations-especially with regard to the thresholds of critical media usage.","Bendau, Petzold, Pyrkosch, Mascarell Maricic, Betzler, Rogoll, GroÃƒÅ¸e, StrÃƒÂ¶hle, Plag","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00406-020-01171-6","20200721","Corona; Media coverage; Mental health; Pandemic; Psychological distress; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-22","",3299,""

"Public perceptions and experiences of social distancing and social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic: a UK-based focus group study","This study explored UK public perceptions and experiences of social distancing and social isolation related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This qualitative study comprised five focus groups, carried out online during the early stages of the UK's stay at home order ('lockdown'), and analysed using a thematic approach. Focus groups took place via online videoconferencing. Participants (n=27) were all UK residents aged 18 years and older, representing a range of gender, ethnic, age and occupational backgrounds. Qualitative analysis revealed four main themes: (1) loss-participants' loss of (in-person) social interaction, loss of income and loss of structure and routine led to psychological and emotional 'losses' such as loss of motivation, loss of meaning and loss of self-worth; (2) criticisms of government communication-participants reported a lack of trust in government and a lack of clarity in the guidelines around social distancing and isolation; (3) adherence-participants reported high self-adherence to social distancing guidelines but reported seeing or hearing of non-adherence in others; (4) uncertainty around social reintegration and the future-some participants felt they would have lingering concerns over social contact while others were eager to return to high levels of social activity.Most participants, and particularly those in low-paid or precarious employment, reported feeling that the social distancing and isolation associated with COVID-19 policy has had negative impacts on their mental health and well-being during the early stages of the UK's 'lockdown'. A rapid response is necessary in terms of public health programming to mitigate the mental health impacts of COVID-19 social distancing and isolation. Social distancing and isolation 'exit strategies' must account for the fact that, although some individuals will voluntarily or habitually continue to socially distance, others will seek high levels of social engagement as soon as possible.","Williams, Armitage, Tampe, Dienes","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-039334","20200721","mental health; public health; qualitative research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-22","",3301,""
"Physical and mental health impacts of COVID-19 on healthcare workers: a scoping review","Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has spread to 198 countries, with approximately 2.4 million confirmed cases and 150,000 deaths globally as of April 18. Frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) face a substantially higher risk of infection and death due to excessive COVID-19 exposure. This review aimed at summarizing the evidence of the physical and mental health impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on health-care workers (HCWs). We used the Arksey O'Malley framework to conduct a scoping review. A systematic literature search was conducted using two databases: PubMed and Google Scholar. We found 154 studies, and out of which 10 met our criteria. We collected information on the date of publication, first author's country, the title of the article, study design, study population, intervention and outcome, and key findings, and divided all research articles into two domains: physical and mental health impact. We reviewed a total of 154 articles from PubMed (126) and Google Scholar (28), of which 58 were found to be duplicate articles and were excluded. Of the remaining 96 articles, 82 were excluded after screening for eligibility, and 4 articles did not have available full texts. Ten full-text articles were reviewed and included in this study. Our findings identified the following risk factors for COVID-19-related health impact: working in a high-risk department, diagnosed family member, inadequate hand hygiene, suboptimal hand hygiene before and after contact with patients, improper PPE use, close contact with patients (Ã¢â€°Â¥ 12 times/day), long daily contact hours (Ã¢â€°Â¥ 15 h), and unprotected exposure. The most common symptoms identified amongst HCWs were fever (85%), cough (70%), and weakness (70%). Prolonged PPE usage led to cutaneous manifestations and skin damage (97%), with the nasal bridge (83%) most commonly affected site. HCWs experienced high levels of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress. Female HCWs and nurses were disproportionately affected. The frontline healthcare workers are at risk of physical and mental consequences directly as the result of providing care to patients with COVID-19. Even though there are few intervention studies, early data suggest implementation strategies to reduce the chances of infections, shorter shift lengths, and mechanisms for mental health support could reduce the morbidity and mortality amongst HCWs.","Shaukat, Ali, Razzak","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12245-020-00299-5","20200721","COVID-19; Health impacts; Healthcare workers; Occupational health; Risk factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-22","",3302,""
"The psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on medical staff in Guangdong, China: a cross-sectional study","During previous pandemic outbreaks, medical staff have reported high levels of psychological distress. The aim of the current study was to report a snapshot of the psychological impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and its correlated factors on medical staff in Guangdong, China. On the 2nd and 3rd February 2020, soon after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we surveyed medical staff at four hospitals in Guangdong, China, to collect demographic characteristics, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14), and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scores. Complete responses were received from 1045 medical staff. Respondents were divided into high- and low-risk groups according to their working environment of contacting with potential or confirmed COVID-19 cases. The proportion of staff with anxiety (55.4% v. 43.0%, p &lt; 0.001) or depression (43.6% v. 36.8%, p = 0.028) was significantly higher in the high-risk group than the low-risk group. The percentage of staff with severe anxiety was similar in the two groups. Doctors were more susceptible to moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms. The high-risk group had higher levels of clinical insomnia (13.5% v. 8.5%, p = 0.011) and were more likely to be in the upper quartile for stress symptoms (24.7% v. 19.3%, p = 0.037) than the low-risk group. Additionally, work experience negatively correlated with insomnia symptoms. It is important for hospitals and authorities to protect both the physical and psychological health of medical staff during times of pandemic, even those with a low exposure risk.","Wang, Huang, Huang, Zhang, Guo, Liu, Ma, Geng","https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291720002561","20200721","Anxiety; COVID-19; coronavirus disease 2019; medical staff; psychological status","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-22","",3303,""
"Psychological Impact of COVID-19 lockdown_PREPRINT","This study addressed the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and examined factors exacerbating or mitigating the negative effects of lockdown. Results from a large multi-country online survey (N=8,229) showed average elevated levels of anxiety and depression (especially in the USA, UK, and Brazil), associated with feelings of low control and social isolation. Although social isolation increased with the duration of quarantine, it was mitigated by frequent communication with close others. Other mitigating factors include adaptive but not maladaptive coping, and the perception and trust that oneâ€™s government is dealing with the outbreak. Taking individual actions to avoid contracting the virus were associated with higher anxiety, except when done professionally by essential workers. We suggest that the psychological detrimental effects of lockdown can be alleviated by maintaining frequent social contact, adaptive coping, and governmental actions which show capability, benevolence, and integrity in managing a public health crisis.","Valerie Van Mulukom et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46020-2F0-C8B","20200722","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; covid-19; survey; psychology; control; coping; mental well-being; anxiety; social; mental health; depression; sense of control; government; coronavirus","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-22","",3304,""

"Validation of the French Version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale and its Associations with Depression, Anxiety and Differential Emotions","Abstract The COVID-19 crisis represents a global health concern, including mental health. Regarding the necessity to assess anxiety related to COVID-19, a scale was developed (Ahorsu et al., 2020). The goal of the present study was to validate of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) in French (official language in 29 countries), and investigate its relationship with indicators of affective disturbances. The study was performed on 316 participants. The FCV-19S underwent a double back translation procedure. Its psychometric properties were evaluated. The French FCV-19S demonstrated a stable unidimensional structure with robust psychometric properties (strong internal consistency, good convergent and divergent validity, and good test- retest validity). With its robust psychometric properties in assessing the unidimensional construct of the fear of COVID-19, this scale will help to provide a better understanding of the relationship between emotions and psychological or psychiatric disorders during the pandemics in French-speaking countries.","Arnaud Carre et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46141-444-F07","20200721","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Assessment; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; mental health; fear; french validation; fear of covid-19 scale; scale development; covid-19","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-22","",3306,""
