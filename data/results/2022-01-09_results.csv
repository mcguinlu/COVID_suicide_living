"Positive impacts of e-aid cognitive behavioural therapy on the sleep quality and mood of nurses on site during the COVID-19 pandemic","To investigate the positive impact of e-aid cognitive behavioural therapy on the sleep quality, anxiety, and depression of nurses on site during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nurses on site at the Tianjin Medical University General HospitalÃ‚Â Airport Site experiencing insomnia, anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 prevention and control period, from February 2020 to April 2021, were selected and divided into either an e-aid cognitive behavioural therapy (eCBT-I) group or a control group using a randomized grouping method. The eCBT-I group was given standard eCBT-I for 6 weeks; the control group did not get any intervention. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) were used to evaluate the sleep quality of the subjects. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) were used to assess the subjects' anxiety and depression. Changes in sleep quality, anxiety and depression before and after treatment were comparedÃ‚Â between the two groups. Of 118 nurses randomized, the PSQI and ISI scores within the eCBT-I group (n=60) were significantly lower after treatment (5.9 Ã‚Â± 3.9, 6.7 Ã‚Â± 4.5) than before treatment (10.4 Ã‚Â± 3.5, 12.4 Ã‚Â± 4.7) (p &lt;0.05). Compared to the scores of the control group (n=58) (9.1 Ã‚Â± 3.9, 10.6 Ã‚Â± 4.1), the PSQI and ISI scores in the eCBT-I group (5.9 Ã‚Â± 3.9, 6.7 Ã‚Â± 4.5) were lower after treatment (p &lt;0.05). The GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores in the eCBT-I group were all lower after treatment (3.7Ã‚Â±3.4, 4.2Ã‚Â±4.1) than before treatment (6.7Ã‚Â±4.9, 7.7Ã‚Â±5.1) (p &lt;0.05). Compared with subjects in the control group (7.1Ã‚Â±5.6, 7.3Ã‚Â±5.1), subjects in the eCBT-I group (3.7Ã‚Â±3.4, 4.2Ã‚Â±4.1) had lower scores on the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scales after treatment (p &lt;0.05). eCBT-I improved the sleep quality of frontline nurses during the COVID-19 prevention and control period and relieved anxiety and depression.","Zhou, Kong, Wan, Zhang, Liu, Qu, Wang, Xue","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11325-021-02547-1","20220108","Anxiety and depression; COVID-19 pandemic; E-aid cognitive behavioural therapy; Nurses on site; Sleep quality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-09","",25055,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy worry in the United States","Several recent studies confirm that the COVID-19 pandemic has increased symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression in pregnant persons around world. In this study, we aimed to uncover the impact of COVID-19 on worry during pregnancy. This study used a cross-sectional descriptive research design. A link to a survey was emailed to users of the Ovia Pregnancy app. Participants (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 253) completed the survey, which included the Cambridge Worry in Pregnancy Scale, and answered several free text questions. The free-text questions were included to capture worries not listed on the scale and to allow participants the opportunity to more clearly describe COVID-19-related worries. Descriptive statistics were reported, and content analysis performed to determine themes. Overall, respondents reported they were quite or very worried about having their partner with them at birth (31.7%, nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 80), giving birth (28.2%; nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 71), and something being wrong with the baby (27.3%; nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 69). Results on worries also differed by participants' race, parity, and trimester. When comparing White to other racial groups, other racial groups had statistically significantly higher median scores for questions on worries about employment (PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .001), going to the hospital (PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .002), and internal examinations (PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .03). Content analysis revealed isolation, loss of support, anxiety/stress, and grief as major themes. The worry, isolation, loss of support, anxiety, and grief reported by pregnant persons during the COVID-19 pandemic may impact maternal pre- and postnatal mental health and are not borne equally. Birthing persons of color appear disproportionately impacted. Prenatally, maternity care providers should assess for worry and provide individualized education and resources to pregnant patients, centering individuals and communities made most vulnerable by structural inequality.","Burgess, Breman, Roane, Dada, Bradley, Burcher","https://doi.org/10.1111/birt.12608","20220108","COVID-19; anxiety; isolation; pregnancy; stress; worry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-09","",25056,""
"Adaptation of infant mental health services to preterm infants and their families receiving neonatal intensive care unit services during the COVID-19 pandemic","Multiple changes and stressors at the family, hospital, and societal levels have resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic that impact the early social environment of infants in Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) settings. This manuscript reviews these pandemic-related adversities, including hospital-wide visitor restrictions, mask requirements that interfere with caregiver facial expressions, parental anxiety about virus transmission, and reduced support services. We will further describe adaptations to mental health service delivery and approaches to care in the NICU to mitigate increased risk associated with pandemic-related adversities. Adaptations include integration of technology, staff education and support, and delivery of activity kits to encourage parent-infant bonding. Data was collected as part of routine program evaluation of infant mental health services from one 50-bed NICU setting and describes family concerns, barriers to visitation, and utilization of mental health services during the pandemic. Concerns related to COVID-19 rarely emerged as the primary presenting issue by the families referred for infant mental health services from April through December of 2020. However, a number of families indicated that infection concerns and visitation restrictions posed significant challenges to their parenting and/or coping. There were significant discrepancies noted between the visitation patterns of families with public and private insurance. Several adaptations were developed in response to the multiple challenges and threats to infant mental health present during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kelleher, Dempsey, Takamatsu, Paul, Kent, Dempsey","https://doi.org/10.1002/imhj.21961","20220108","COVID-19; NICU; mental health; preterm infant","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-09","",25057,""
"Prevalence of food addiction and its association with anxiety, depression, and adherence to social distancing measures in Brazilian university students during the COVID-19 pandemic: a nationwide study","The study's objective was to determine the prevalence of food addiction (FA) in Brazilian university students and to verify whether there is an association with anxiety, depression, and adherence to the social distancing measures adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a nationwide cross-sectional study carried out through the application of online questionnaires. Self-reported data on age, sex, economic class, race/skin color, anthropometric data, depression diagnosis, anxiety, modified Yale Food Addiction Scale 2.0 (mYFAS 2.0), and adherence to social distancing measures were collected. 5368 participants were included, with a mean age was 24.1Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°6.3Ã‚Â years, the majority were female (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3990; 74.3%), and the mean BMI in our sample was 24.5Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.3Ã‚Â kg/m<sup>2</sup>. The prevalence of FA was 19.1% (95%CI: 18.0; 20.0%). An association was observed between FA with depression (PR: 1.60; 95%CI: 1.43; 1.78; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01), and anxiety (3.13; 95%CI: 2.74; 3.58; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01), but not with adherence to social distancing measures (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.70). In conclusion, there was a higher prevalence of FA in Brazilian university students. Besides, university students with anxiety, depression, overweight, or obesity and females are more prone to FA.Level of evidence Level V, Opinions of authorities, based on descriptive studies, narrative reviews, clinical experience, or reports of expert committees.","da Silva JÃƒÂºnior, de Lima Macena, de Oliveira, Praxedes, de Oliveira MaranhÃƒÂ£o Pureza, de Menezes Toledo FlorÃƒÂªncio, Gearhardt, Bueno","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40519-021-01344-9","20220108","Food addiction; Generalized anxiety disorder; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-09","",25058,""
"Comparison of fatigue, cognitive dysfunction and psychological disorders in post-COVID patients and patients after sepsis: is there a specific constellation?","Sequelae of COVID-19 can be severe and longlasting. We compared frequencies of fatigue, depression and cognitive dysfunction in survivors of SARS-CoV-2-infection and sepsis. We performed a prospective cohort study of 355 symptomatic post-COVID patients who visited our out-patient clinic for post-COVID-19 care. We compared them with 272 symptomatic patients from the Mid-German Sepsis Cohort, which investigates the long-term courses of sepsis survivors. Possible predictors for frequent clinical findings (fatigue, signs of depression, cognitive dysfunction) in post-COVID were investigated with multivariable logistic regression. Median age of the post-COVID patients was 51Ã‚Â years (range 17-86), 60.0% were female, and 31.8% required hospitalization during acute COVID-19. In the post-COVID patients (median follow-up time: 163Ã‚Â days) and the post-sepsis patients (180Ã‚Â days), fatigue was found in 93.2% and 67.8%, signs of depression were found in 81.3% and 10.9%, and cognitive dysfunction was found in 23.5% and 21.3%, respectively. In post-COVID, we did not observe an association between fatigue or depression and the severity of acute COVID-19. In contrast, cognitive dysfunction was associated with hospitalization (out-patient versus in-patient) and more frequent in post-COVID patients treated on an ICU compared to the MSC patients. In post-COVID patients, fatigue and signs of depression are more common than in sepsis survivors, independent from the acute SARS-CoV-2-infection. In contrast, cognitive dysfunction is associated with hospitalization. Despite the differences in frequencies, owing to the similarity of post-COVID and post-sepsis sequelae, this knowledge may help in implementing follow-up approaches after SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Stallmach, Kesselmeier, Bauer, Gramlich, Finke, Fischer, Fleischmann-Struzek, Heutelbeck, Katzer, Mutschke, Pletz, Quickert, Reinhart, Stallmach, Walter, Scherag, Reuken","https://doi.org/10.1007/s15010-021-01733-3","20220108","COVID-19; Long-COVID; Post-COVID; SARS-CoV2; Sepsis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-09","",25059,""
"The Effect of COVID-19 Outbreak on Older Adults' Hopelessness, Loneliness and Spiritual Well-Being in Turkey","The aim of this study was to determine the hopelessness, loneliness and spiritual well-being of older adults and the relationship between these three concepts during the COVID-19 pandemic. This research used a cross-sectional, descriptive approach. Data were collected between October 13 and November 13, 2020, with 476 individuals over 65Ã‚Â years living in three different cities in Turkey. Data were collected using a demographic information form, Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS), Loneliness Scale (UCLA-LS) and Spiritual Well-being Scale (FACIT-Sp). During the COVID-19 outbreak, it was found that there was a significant negative relationship between hopelessness, loneliness and spiritual well-being of older adults. In this study, it was found that during the COVID-19 pandemic, the level of hopelessness and loneliness among older adults was below the average score, and their spiritual well-being levels were moderate. Based on the findings of the present study, it is recommended that practices which increase hope, strengthen social ties and spiritual support, should be implemented for older individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic period or any other times during which social distancing is mandatory.","DurmuÃ…Å¸, Ãƒâ€“ztÃƒÂ¼rk","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10943-021-01494-1","20220108","COVID-19; Hopelessness; Loneliness; Older adults; Spirituality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-09","",25060,""
"Prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms and impact on self-management among adults with chronic conditions in Chicago, Illinois, USA, during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional survey","To examine the prevalence of mental health symptoms during the first surge of COVID-19 in the USA, and their associations with COVID-19-related emotional distress, health self-management and healthcare utilisation. Cross-sectional analysis of wave 3 (1-22 May 2020) survey data from the ongoing Chicago COVID-19 Comorbidities (C3) study. Seven academic and community health centres in Chicago, Illinois. 565 adults aged 23-88 with one or more chronic conditions completing at least one prior C3 study wave. Clinically relevant anxiety and depressive symptoms as measured using Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System short forms. Self-reported emotional and health-related responses to COVID-19 were measured through a combination of single-item questions and validated measures. Rates of anxiety and depressive symptoms were 14% (81/563) and 15% (84/563), respectively. Anxiety and depressive symptoms were then each separately associated with greater worry about contracting COVID-19 (relative risk (RR) 2.32, 95% CI 1.52 to 3.53; RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.54), greater stress (RR 4.93, 95% CI 3.20 to 7.59; RR 3.01, 95% CI 1.96 to 4.61) and loneliness (RR 3.82, 95% CI 2.21 to 6.60; RR 5.37, 95% CI 3.21 to 8.98), greater avoidance of the doctor (RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.49; RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.36) and difficulty managing health (least square means (LS Means) 6.09, 95% CI 5.25 to 6.92 vs 4.23, 95% CI 3.70 to 4.75; LS Means 5.85, 95% CI 5.04 to 6.65 vs 4.22, 95% CI 3.70 to 4.75) and medications (LS Means 3.71, 95% CI 2.98 to 4.43 vs 2.47, 95% CI 2.02 to 2.92) due to the pandemic.

"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospital-treated self-harm in Sydney (Australia)","This study investigated trends in hospital-treated self-harm and hospital presenting suicidal ideation in the period before and after COVID-19 public health responses by key socio-demographic groups among those presenting to hospitals in the Western Sydney (Australia) population catchment. Emergency department presentations for the period January 2016 to June 2021 were used to specify a series of interrupted time-series models to compare the observed and expected event rates of (1) hospital-treated self-harm and (2) hospital presenting suicidal ideation in the period following the onset of COVID-19 public health measures in March 2020. Rate differences between observed and expected rates in the post-implementation period were also estimated in models stratified by sex, age group, country of birth and socio-economic status. There was no significant increase in hospital-treated self-harm in the period post-implementation of public health orders (March 2020) compared to the previous period, although there were lower than expected rates of emergency department presentations among non-Australian-born males, males aged 0-14 years and 25-44Ã¢â‚¬â€°years, and females aged 45-64Ã¢â‚¬â€°years. In contrast, there was a significant increase in hospital presenting suicidal ideation, particularly among women (rate difference per 100,000Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.91, 95% confidence intervalÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°[1.35, 6.48]) and those aged 15-24Ã¢â‚¬â€°years (both males and females, rate differences ranging from 8.91 to 19.04), and among those residing in lower socio-economic status areas (both males and females, rate differences ranging from 0.90 to 2.33). There was no increase in hospital-treated self-harm rates in the 15Ã¢â‚¬â€°months post-implementation of COVID-19 public health orders in Western Sydney; however, there was a significant increase in hospital presenting suicidal ideation. The limited change in suicidal behaviour may reflect the success of social and economic supports during this period, the benefits of which may have been different for young people, and those of lower socio-economic status.","Sperandei, Page, Bandara, Reis, Saheb, Gaur, Munasinghe, Worne, Fozzard, Brakoulias","https://doi.org/10.1177/00048674211068393","20220108","COVID-19; Suicidal ideation; intentional self-harm; migrant status; socio-economic status","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-09","",25062,""
