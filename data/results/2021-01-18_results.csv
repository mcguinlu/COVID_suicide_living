"Implementing Essential Coaching for Every Mother during COVID-19: A Pilot Pre-Post Intervention Study","ObjectivesThe primary objective was to evaluate the preliminary impact of Essential Coaching for Every Mother on self-efficacy, social support, postpartum anxiety and postpartum depression. The second objective was to explore the acceptability of the Essential Coaching for Every Mother program provided during the COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodsA prospective pre-post study was conducted with first time mothers in Nova Scotia, Canada between July 15th and September 19th, 2020. Participants completed a self-report survey at enrolment (after birth) and six-weeks postpartum. Variety of standardized measures were used and qualitative feedback on the program was also collected. Paired t-tests were carried out to determine changes from baseline to follow-up on psychosocial outcomes and qualitative feedback was analysed through thematic analysis.

ResultsA total of 88 women enrolled. Self-efficacy increased between baseline (B) and follow-up (F) (B:33.33; F:37.11, p=0.000) while anxiety (STAI) declined (B:38.49; F:34.79; p=0.004). No other significant changes were found. In terms of acceptability, 89% of participants felt that the number of messages were just right, 84.5% felt the messages contained all the information they needed relative to caring for a newborn and 98.8% indicated they would recommend this program to other new mothers.

ConclusionEssential Coaching for Every Mother may play a role increasing maternal self-efficacy and decreasing anxiety, although future work with a control group is important to delineate the true effects of the program. Overall, mothers were satisfied with the Essential Coaching for Every Mother program and would recommend it for other mothers, during COVID-19 and beyond.","Justine Dol; Megan Aston; Amy Grant; Douglas McMillan; Gail Tomblin Murphy; Marsha Campbell-Yeo","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.21249598","20210115","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-18","",9558,""
"Physicians' Reactions to COVID-19: The Results of an International Internet Survey","ObjectivesPhysicians across the world have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. This study was designed and conducted to assess the emotional, cognitive, and behavioural reactions of physicians to the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Materials and methodsAn online survey questionnaire using the google forms platform was constructed by the authors. The items in the questionnaire were based on clinical experience, relevant literature review and discussion with peers. A list of issues that were deemed as essential components of the experience of the pandemic relevant to physicians was arrived at. Thereafter these issues were operationalized into question form and hosted on the google forms platform. The link to this questionnaire was circulated by the authors among their peer groups in the month of April 2020.

ResultsWe received 295 responses and 3 were unusable. Most of the responses were from India, the United States of America, Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. About 60% of the respondents identified themselves as frontline and had a decade of clinical experience. Most respondents reported being anxious due to the pandemic and also observed the same in their peers and families. A majority also observed changes in behaviour in self and others and advanced a variety of reasons and concerns. A sense of duty was the most commonly employed coping mechanism.

ConclusionPhysicians are not immune from information and misinformation, or cues in the environment. Behavioural choices are not always predicted by knowledge but by a combination of knowledge, emotional state, personality and environment. Healthcare settings need to be ready for emergencies and should focus on reducing uncertainty in physicians. These factors may also be gainfully used in the mental health promotion of physicians in COVID-19 care roles.","Parul Aneja; Inderjit Singh; Bhupinder Singh; Pardeep Singh Kundi; Inderbir Singh; Sanjana Kathiravan; Shubh Mohan Singh","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.13.21249460","20210115","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-18","",9559,""
"Changes in the Health of Adolescent Athletes: A Comparison of Health Measures Collected Before and During the CoVID-19 Pandemic","ContextIn the spring of 2020, schools closed to in-person teaching and sports were cancelled to control the transmission of CoVID-19. The changes that took place to the physical and mental health among young athletes during this time remain unknown, however.

ObjectiveIdentify changes in the health (mental health, physical activity and quality of life) of athletes that occurred during the CoVID-19 pandemic.

DesignCross sectional study.

SettingSample recruited via social media.

Patients or Other Participants3243 Wisconsin adolescent athletes (age=16.2{+/-}1.2 yrs., female=58% female) completed an online survey in May 2020 (DuringCoVID-19). Health measures for this cohort were compared with previously reported data for Wisconsin adolescent athletes (n=5231, age=15.7{+/-}1.2, 47% female) collected in 2016-2018 (PreCoVID-19).

Main Outcome Measure(s)Demographic information included: sex, grade and sports played. Health assessments included the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Item (PHQ-9) to identify depression symptoms, the Pediatric Functional Activity Brief Scale (PFABS) for physical activity, and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 (PedsQL) for health related quality of life (HRQoL). Univariable comparisons of these variables between groups were made via t-tests or chi-square tests. Means and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each group were estimated by survey weighted ANOVA models.

RESULTSCompared to PreCoVID-19, a larger proportion of the During-CoVID-19 participants reported rates of moderate to severe levels of depression (9.7% vs 32.9%, p<0.001). During-CoVID-19 participants reported 50% lower (worse) PFABS scores (mean:12.2 [95%CI: 11.9, 12.5] vs 24.7 [24.5, 24.9] p<0.001) and lower (worse) PedsQL total scores compared to the PreCoVID-19 participants (78.4 [78.0, 78.8] vs. 90.9 [90.5, 91.3] p<0.001).

CONCLUSIONSDuring the CoVID-19 pandemic, adolescent athletes reported increased symptoms of depression, decreased physical activity and decreased quality of life compared to adolescent athletes in previous years.

Key pointsO_LIAdolescent athletes during CoVID-19 were three times more likely to report moderate to severe symptoms of depression compared to data collected prior to CoVID-19.
C_LIO_LIAdolescent athletes during CoVID-19 reported significantly lower physical activity and quality of life scores compared to high school athletes prior to the CoVID-19 pandemic
C_LIO_LIPost CoVID-19 policies should be implemented to improve the health of adolescent athletes in the US.

"SARS-Cov-2 prevalence, transmission, health-related outcomes and control strategies in homeless shelters: systematic review and meta-analysis","BackgroundPeople experiencing homelessness (PEH) may be at particular risk for COVID19. We synthesised the evidence on SARS-Cov-2 infection, transmission, outcomes of disease, effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI), and the effectiveness of targeted strategies for infection prevention and control (IPC).

MethodsSystematic review of articles, reports and grey-literature indexed in electronic databases (EMBASE, WHO-Covid19, Web of Science), pre-print repositories, institutional websites, and handsearching. Empirical papers of any study design addressing Covid-19 in PEH or homeless shelters staff in English were included. (PROSPERO 2020 CRD42020187033)

FindingsOf 194 publications, 13 studies were included (two modelling, ten observational and one qualitative study). All were conducted in high-income countries. Random-effect meta-analysis of prevalence estimates yields a baseline SARS-Cov-2 prevalence of 2{middle dot}14% (95% Confidence-Interval, 95%CI=1{middle dot}02-3{middle dot}27) in PEH and 1{middle dot}72 % (95%CI=0{middle dot}31-3{middle dot}12) in staff. In outbreaks, the pooled prevalence increases to 29{middle dot}49% (95%CI=16{middle dot}44-29{middle dot}55) in PEH and 15{middle dot}18% (95%CI=8{middle dot}95-21{middle dot}42) in staff. Main IPC strategies were universal and rapid testing, expansion of non-congregate housing support, and individual measures in shelters (bed spacing, limited staff rotation).

InterpretationUp to 30% PEH and 17% staff are infected during outbreaks of SARS-Cov-2 in homeless shelters. Most studies were conducted in the USA. No studies were found on health-related outcomes or health effects of NPI. An overview and evaluation of IPC strategies for PEH, including a better understanding of disease transmission, and reliable data on PEH within Covid-19 notification systems is needed. Qualitative studies may serve to voice PEH experiences and guide future evaluations and IPC strategies.

FundingNo source of funding.

Panel 1: Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSPeople experiencing homelessness (PEH) are at increased risk of infectious, chronic, and mental health adverse conditions. Due to the risk of transmission in shared accommodations, PEH may be particularly vulnerable to SARS-Cov-2 infection and worse clinical outcomes. Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) taken to mitigate the SARS-Cov-2 outbreak may have further aggravated health and social conditions. However, there is no evidence synthesis on the SARS-Cov-2 epidemiology among PEH, the correspondent clinical and other health-related outcomes as well as health effects of NPIs on these groups.

Added value of this study

We reviewed and synthesized existent evidence on the risk of infection and transmission, risk of severe course of disease, effect of NPIs on health outcomes and the effectiveness of implemented measures to avert risks and negative outcomes among PEH. Results of the identified studies suggest that both PEH and shelter staff are at high risk of SARS-Cov-2 infection, especially in case of a local outbreak. Due to the low prevalence of symptoms at the time of a positive SARS-Cov-2 test among PEH, symptom screening alone may not be efficient to control outbreaks. Instead, universal and rapid testing conjugated with expansion of non-congregate housing support, and individual measures in shelters, are discussed as sensible strategies.

Implications of all the available evidence

A comprehensive overview of NPIs and shelter strategies targeting PEH and evaluation of their effectiveness and unintended health consequences is needed. Qualitative research considering living realities of PEH can facilitate understanding of their specific needs during the pandemic.","Amir Mohsen Mohsenpour; Kayvan Bozorgmehr; Sven Rohleder; Jan Stratil; Diogo Costa","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.14.21249851","20210115","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-18","",9561,""
"Prevalence and correlates of depression during the COVID-19 pandemic and the major role of stigmatization in low- and middle-income countries: A multinational cross-sectional study","Currently, there is little data on the mental health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This study aims to examine the pooled and separate prevalence and determinants of depression during the pandemic in samples from four LMICs. Participants (N= 1267, 40.9% women) were recruited from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Haiti, Rwanda, and Togo. They completed an online cross-sectional survey on sociodemographics, exposure and stigmatization related to COVID-19, the Hopkins Symptom Checklist depression subscale, and the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-2. The pooled prevalence for depression symptoms was 24.3% (95% CI: 22.08-26.79%), with significant differences across countries. Younger age, gender (women), and high levels of exposure and stigmatization related to COVIID-19, and resilience were associated with depression in the pooled data. There were significant variations at the country level. Stigmatization (but not exposure to COVID-19 and resilience) was a strong predictor among the four countries. The prevalence of depression symptoms in the LMICs are similar to those reported in China and in most high-income countries during the pandemic. The findings emphasize the need for implementing non-fear-based education programs during epidemics to reduce stigmatization.","CÃƒÂ©nat, Noorishad, Kokou-Kpolou, Dalexis, Hajizadeh, Guerrier, ClormÃƒÂ©us, Bukaka, Birangui, Adansikou, Ndengeyingoma, Sezibera, Derivois, Rousseau","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113714","20210116","COVID-19; DR Congo, Haiti, Rwanda and Togo; Depression; Resilience; Stigmatization","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-18","",9562,""
"Increased emotional eating during COVID-19 associated with lockdown, psychological and social distress","Due to the spread of COVID 2019, the Italian government imposed a lockdown on the national territory. Initially, citizens were required to stay at home and not to mix with others outside of their household (Phase 1); eventually, some of these restrictions were lifted (Phase 2). To investigate the impact of lockdown on emotional and binge eating, an online survey was conducted to compare measures of self-reported physical (BMI), psychological (Alexithymia), affective (anxiety, stress, and depression) and social (income, workload) state during Phase 1 and Phase 2. Data from 365 Italian residents showed that increased emotional eating was predicted by higher depression, anxiety, quality of personal relationships, and quality of life, while the increase of bingeing was predicted by higher stress. Moreover, we showed that higher alexithymia scores were associated by increased emotional eating and higher BMI scores were associated with both increased emotional eating and binge eating. Finally, we found that from Phase 1 to Phase 2 binge and emotional eating decreased. These data provide evidence of the negative effects of isolation and lockdown on emotional wellbeing, and, relatedly, on eating behaviour.","Cecchetto, Aiello, Gentili, Ionta, Osimo","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2021.105122","20210116","BMI; COVID-19 pandemic; binge eating; emotional eating; lockdown; negative emotions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-18","",9563,""

"Spine surgeon perceptions of the challenges and benefits of telemedicine: an international study","While telemedicine usage has increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there remains little consensus about how spine surgeons perceive virtual care. The purpose of this study was to explore international perspectives of spine providers on the challenges and benefits of telemedicine. Responses from 485 members of AO Spine were analyzed, covering provider perceptions of the challenges and benefits of telemedicine. All questions were optional, and blank responses were excluded from analysis. The leading challenges reported by surgeons were decreased ability to perform physical examinations (38.6%), possible increased medicolegal exposure (19.3%), and lack of reimbursement parity compared to traditional visits (15.5%). Fewer than 9.0% of respondents experienced technological issues. On average, respondents agreed that telemedicine increases access to care for rural/long-distance patients, provides societal cost savings, and increases patient convenience. Responses were mixed about whether telemedicine leads to greater patient satisfaction. North Americans experienced the most challenges, but also thought telemedicine carried the most benefits, whereas Africans reported the fewest challenges and benefits. Age did not affect responses. Spine surgeons are supportive of the benefits of telemedicine, and only a small minority experienced technical issues. The decreased ability to perform the physical examination was the top challenge and remains a major obstacle to virtual care for spine surgeons around the world, although interestingly, 61.4% of providers did not acknowledge this to be a major challenge. Significant groundwork in optimizing remote physical examination maneuvers and achieving legal and reimbursement clarity is necessary for widespread implementation.","Riew, Lovecchio, Samartzis, Bernstein, Underwood, Louie, Germscheid, An, Cheung, Chutkan, Mallow, Neva, Phillips, Sciubba, El-Sharkawi, Valacco, McCarthy, Iyer, Makhni","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00586-020-06707-x","20210116","Benefits; Challenges; Global; Spine surgery; Telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-18","",9566,""
"The cerebral network of COVID-19-related encephalopathy: a longitudinal voxel-based 18F-FDG-PET study","Little is known about the neuronal substrates of neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with COVID-19 and their evolution during the course of the disease. We aimed at describing the longitudinal brain metabolic pattern in COVID-19-related encephalopathy using 18F-FDG-PET/CT. Seven patients with variable clinical presentations of COVID-19-related encephalopathy were explored thrice with brain 18F-FDG-PET/CT, once in the acute phase, 1 month later and 6 months after COVID-19 onset. PET images were analysed with voxel-wise and regions-of-interest approaches in comparison with 32 healthy controls. Patients' neurological manifestations during acute encephalopathy were heterogeneous. However, all of them presented with predominant cognitive and behavioural frontal disorders. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in the CSF was negative for all patients. MRI revealed no specific abnormalities for most of the subjects. All patients had a consistent pattern of hypometabolism in a widespread cerebral network including the frontal cortex, anterior cingulate, insula and caudate nucleus. Six months after COVID-19 onset, the majority of patients clinically had improved but cognitive and emotional disorders of varying severity remained with attention/executive disabilities and anxio-depressive symptoms, and lasting prefrontal, insular and subcortical 18F-FDG-PET/CT abnormalities. The implication of this widespread network could be the neural substrate of clinical features observed in patients with COVID-19, such as frontal lobe syndrome, emotional disturbances and deregulation of respiratory failure perception. This study suggests that this network remains mildly to severely impaired 6 months after disease onset.","Kas, Soret, Pyatigoskaya, Habert, Hesters, Le Guennec, Paccoud, Bombois, Delorme","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00259-020-05178-y","20210116","18F-FDG-PET; COVID-19; Glucose metabolism; Prefrontal impairment; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-18","",9567,""
"Increase in suicide following an initial decline during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan","There is increasing concern that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic could harm psychological health and exacerbate suicide risk. Here, based on month-level records of suicides covering the entire Japanese population in 1,848 administrative units, we assessed whether suicide mortality changed during the pandemic. Using difference-in-difference estimation, we found that monthly suicide rates declined by 14% during the first 5 months of the pandemic (February to June 2020). This could be due to a number of complex reasons, including the government's generous subsidies, reduced working hours and school closure. By contrast, monthly suicide rates increased by 16% during the second wave (July to October 2020), with a larger increase among females (37%) and children and adolescents (49%). Although adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic may remain in the long term, its modifiers (such as government subsidies) may not be sustained. Thus, effective suicide prevention-particularly among vulnerable populations-should be an important public health consideration.","Tanaka, Okamoto","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-020-01042-z","20210116","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-18","",9568,""
"Socioeconomic status and cardiovascular health in the COVID-19 pandemic","The goals of this review are to evaluate the impact of socioeconomic (SE) status on the general health and cardiovascular health of individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic and also discuss the measures to address disparity. SE status is a strong predictor of premature morbidity and mortality within general health. A lower SE status also has implications of increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality and poorer CVD risk factor profiles. CVD comorbidity is associated with a higher case severity and mortality rate from COVID-19, with both CVD and COVID-19 sharing important risk factors. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected people of a lower SE status and of ethnic minority group, who in the most deprived regions are suffering double the mortality rate of the least deprived. The acute stress, economic recession and quarantine restrictions in the wake of COVID-19 are also predicted to cause a decline in mental health. This could pose substantial increase to CVD incidence, particularly with acute pathologies such as stroke, acute coronary syndrome and cardiogenic shock among lower SE status individuals and vulnerable elderly populations. Efforts to tackle SE status and CVD may aid in reducing avoidable deaths. The implementation of 'upstream' interventions and policies demonstrates promise in achieving the greatest population impact, aiming to protect and empower individuals. Specific measures may involve risk factor targeting restrictions on the availability and advertisement of tobacco, alcohol and high-fat and salt content food, and targeting SE disparity with healthy and secure workplaces.","Naylor-Wardle, Rowland, Kunadian","https://doi.org/10.1136/heartjnl-2020-318425","20210116","acute coronary syndrome; atherosclerosis; quality of health care; risk factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-18","",9569,""
"Mental health planning at a very early stage of the COVID-19 crisis: a systematic review of online international strategies and recommendations","Mental health care systems have been dramatically affected by COVID-19. Containment measures have been imposed, with negative consequences on population mental health. Therefore, an increase in both symptomatology and mental disorder incidence is expected. This research aims to identify, describe and assess the empirical background on online strategies and recommendations developed by international organizations and governments to cope with the psychological impact of COVID-19 at a very early stage of the pandemic. The PRISMA guidelines were adapted to review online documents. A new questionnaire was developed to identify the existence of common patterns in the selected documents. Questions were classified into three domains: COVID-19 information, mental health strategies and mental health recommendations. A two-step cluster analysis was carried out to highlight underlying behaviours in the data (patterns). The results are shown as spider graphs (pattern profiles) and conceptual maps (multidimensional links between questions). Twenty-six documents were included in the review. The questionnaire analysed document complexity and identified their common key mental health characteristics (i.e., does the respondent have the tools for dealing with stress, depression and anxiety?). Cluster analysis highlighted patterns from the questionnaire domains. Strong relationships between questions were identified, such as psychological tips for maintaining good mental health and coping with COVID-19 (question nÃ‚Â° 4), describing some psychological skills to help people cope with anxiety and worry about COVID-19 (question nÃ‚Â° 6) and promoting social connection at home (question nÃ‚Â° 8). When fast results are needed to develop health strategies and policies, rapid reviews associated with statistical and graphical methods are essential. The results obtained from the proposed analytical procedure can be relevant to a) classify documents according to their complexity in structuring the information provided on how to cope with the psychological impact of COVID-19, b) develop new documents according to specific objectives matching population needs, c) improve document design to face unforeseen events, and d) adapt new documents to local situations. In this framework, the relevance of adapting e-mental health procedures to community mental health care model principles was highlighted, although some problems related to the digital gap must be considered.","Almeda, GarcÃƒÂ­a-Alonso, Salvador-Carulla","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-020-03015-y","20210116","COVID-19; Mental health; Recommendations; Strategies; Systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-18","",9570,""
"Burnout and Depression in Portuguese Healthcare Workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic-The Mediating Role of Psychological Resilience","During the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare workers (HCW) have been exposed to multiple psychosocial stressors. Resilience might protect employees from the negative consequences of chronic stress. The aim of this study was to explore the mediating role of resilience in the relationship between depression and burnout (personal, work-related, and client-related). A cross-sectional study was performed using an online questionnaire distributed via social networks. A survey was conducted comprising standardized measures of resilience (Resilience Scale-25 items), depression (subscale of Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 items), and burnout (Copenhagen Burnout Inventory Scale-19 items). A total of 2008 subjects completed the survey, and a hierarchical regression model was estimated for each burnout dimension. The results revealed that depression had not only a directed effect on personal, work- and client-related burnout, but also an indirect small effect on it through resilience. Psychological resilience played a partial mediating role between depression and all burnout dimensions. This partial mediation suggests that there may be other possible variables (e.g., social connection, self-compassion, gratitude, sense of purpose) that further explain the associations.","SerrÃƒÂ£o, Duarte, Castro, Teixeira","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18020636","20210116","COVID-19; burnout; depression; healthcare workers; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-18","",9571,""
"Emotional eating during COVID-19 in the United Kingdom: exploring the roles of alexithymia and emotion dysregulation","Emotional eating, generally defined as (over)-eating in response to negative emotions, has been associated with poor physical and psychological outcomes. During a time of heightened negative affect, it is important to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdown measures on eating behaviours, and further elucidate the ways in which emotional eating is related to emotion dysregulation and impaired abilities to identify emotions (i.e. alexithymia). The aims of this study were to explore perceived changes in eating behaviours in relation to self-reported negative affect during the pandemic and to examine direct and indirect effects of alexithymia on emotional eating. An online questionnaire measured these constructs in the general population of the United Kingdom (n = 136). Findings demonstrated that those who reported changes to their eating behaviours during the pandemic also reported greater levels of depression during the same time frame. Mediation analyses revealed that difficulties identifying and describing feelings both predicted emotional eating indirectly via emotion dysregulation. Findings contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms underpinning the relationship between alexithymia and emotional eating and describe changes to eating behaviours during COVID-19.

The proportion of &lt;1-year-old presentations increased by 5.56% (P = 0.001), while 11-15Ã¢â‚¬â€°years decreased by 7.91% (P = 0.0001). Respiratory-related paediatric presentations decreased by 30% and proportional decreased by 4.92% (P = 0.001). This study has identified a significant reduction in paediatric presentations to a tertiary emergency department in New Zealand during the national Alert Level 4 Lockdown for COVID-19. The proportional increase in the &lt;1-year-old group may suggest a greater need for community-based child health services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mental health support services may also need to adapt and expand to provide adequate psychological support for children during this crisis. Recognising the needs of these vulnerable groups will be critical during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in addition to informing response plans for similar events in the future.","Bothara, Raina, Carne, Walls, McCombie, Ardagh, Joyce","https://doi.org/10.1111/jpc.15347","20210115","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; emergency; paediatrics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-18","",9573,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on Physical Activity of 10,000 Steps Members and Engagement with the Program in Australia","Background: Physical activity is an important health behavior due to its association with many physical and mental health conditions. During distressing events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a concern that physical activity levels may be negatively impacted. However, recent studies have shown inconsistent results. Additionally, there is a lack of studies in Australia on this topic. Objective: To investigate changes in physical activity reported through the 10,000 Steps program and changes in engagement with the program during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Data between 01/01/2018 and 30/06/2020 from registered members of the 10,000 Steps program, which included 3,548,825 days with steps data, were used. The number of daily steps was logged manually by the members or synced automatically from the activity trackers connected to the program. Measures on the program usage were the number of new registered members per day, the number of newly registered organisations per day, the number of steps logged per day, and the number of step entries per day. Key dates used for comparison were: first case with symptoms in Wuhan; first case in Australia reported; a 14-day ban for non-citizens arriving to Australia from China implemented; lockdown starts in Australia; and Australian Government starts relaxing restrictions. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to test for significant differences in steps between subgroups, engagement measures in 2019 vs. 2020, and before and after an event. Results: A decrease in steps was observed after the first case in Australia (1.5%, p&lt;0.05), and the lockdown (3.4%, p&lt;0.001). At the time of relaxing restrictions started, the steps were already recovered from the lockdown. Additionally, the trends were consistent across genders and age groups. New South Wales, Australian Capital Territory and Victoria had the greatest reductions with decreases of 7.0% (p&lt;0.001), 6.2% (p&lt;0.05), and 4.7% (p&lt;0.001), respectively. During the lockdown, the use of the program increased steeply. On the peak day, there were &gt;9,000 step entries/day with nearly 100 million steps/day logged; and &gt;450 new users and &gt;15 new organizations registering per day although the numbers decreased quickly when restrictions were relaxed. On average per day, there were about 55 new registered users (p&lt;0.001) and two new organisations (p&lt;0.001), 25.6 million steps (p&lt;0.001), and 2672 log entries (p&lt;0.001) more in 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. Conclusion: The pandemic has had negative effects on steps among Australians across age groups and gender. However, the effect was relatively small with steps recovering quickly after the lockdown. There was a large increase in the program usage during the pandemic that might help minimize the health impact of the lockdown and confirms the important role of physical activity programs during times of distress and lockdowns.","To, Duncan, Itallie, Vandelanotte","https://doi.org/10.2196/23946","20210115","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-18","",9574,""
"Differences in mental health and health-related quality of life between the Israeli and Italian population during a COVID-19 quarantine","Severe restrictions related to COVID-19 were implemented almost simultaneously in Italy and Israel in early March 2020, although the epidemic situation in both countries was significantly different. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine how and to what extent the severe restrictions affected the mental health and health-related quality of life of non-infected people, in a comparison between Israel and Italy. A cross-sectional study was conducted during the first week of May 2020 among 510 Israeli and 505 Italian participants. Anxiety and depression levels were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4), and the short form-8 health survey (SF-8) questionnaire measured health-related quality of life. Linear hierarchic regression forced steps analysis was performed to measure the unique contribution of each variable to predicting health-related quality of life. After adjusting for socioeconomic variables, the results showed a significantly higher anxiety level and lower health-related quality of life in the Italian participants. The anxiety and depression variables predicted lower health-related quality of life. Physical activity was found to be a protective factor. The results suggest that early monitoring of anxiety and depression in situations such as quarantine may detect the risk for decline in health-related quality of life. Establishment of professional interventions is needed in order to prevent the negative health consequences of the pandemic-related policy.","Amit Aharon, Dubovi, Ruban","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11136-020-02746-5","20210117","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Health-related quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-18","",9575,""
"Mental wellbeing of healthcare workers working in quarantine centers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Qatar","Healthcare workers managing Coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) patients are at increased risk of poor mental wellbeing. The available literature on the psychological impact in the Arabian Gulf region is limited, and a more in-depth analysis of factors affecting frontline healthcare workers' mental wellbeing is warranted. The aim of this study was to evaluate and explore healthcare workers' wellbeing working in quarantine centers in Qatar. This study was a cross-sectional, web-based survey conducted on healthcare workers managing patients in designated quarantine centers. Healthcare workers associated with 51 COVID-19 quarantine centers were eligible to participate in this survey from April 19 to May 3, 2020. The primary outcome of interest was mental wellbeing as measured by the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (WEMWBS). A total of 127 of 169 contacted staff members completed the survey, with a participation rate of 75%. Approximately 17.4% of participants had well-being scores of less than 45, indicating suboptimal wellbeing and a high risk of psychological distress and depression. The multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that nurses are associated with increased risk (more than the fivefold higher risk of having WEMWBS score &lt;Ã‚Â 45) of adverse mental wellbeing (adjusted OR 5.65; 95% CI 0.57, 56.4; <i>p</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.140). The psychological impact of working in quarantine centers on healthcare workers was less than what has been reported globally. Nurses are the most vulnerable group.

"When the Clinical Environment Is Closed to Students: The Harsh Reality of COVID-19 and Implications for Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine","When the World Health Organization (WHO) declaredÃ‚Â coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)Ã‚Â a global health emergency, Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine (COMs) debated the role of medical students during this developing pandemic. Initially, the discussion included whether medical students were essential personnel contributing to meaningful patient care. Many questions arose regarding how COVID-19 would affect medical education and if the changesÃ‚Â would be temporary or continue for a significant period of time. Due to the lack of availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) and a decreased focus onÃ‚Â clinical education within many healthcare settings, in March the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine (AACOM) declared that medical students were not essential personnel and recommended that COMs take a 'pause' and remove students from the clinical environment. This 'pause' would allow COMs time to assess where medical education could continue, to define the critical pieces of clinical education that required a clinical environment and to address how medical students could contribute during the pandemic. The AACOM Clinical Educators group began to meet on a weekly basis during this time so that Clinical Deans from Osteopathic medical schools across the country could collaborate, share ideas, discuss current challenges, and co-create a system to deliver medical education realizing the limitations of in-person clinical training.","Heiles, Sheridan, Hendriksz, Giusti, Cymet","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.12044","20210116","covid 19; curriculum assessment; curriculum planning; in-person rotations; medical education med ed learning classroom integrated; ward rotations","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-18","",9577,""
"Psychological burden of the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated factors among frontline doctors of Bangladesh: a cross-sectional study","<b>Background:</b> Frontline doctors are the most vulnerable and high-risk population to get the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Hence, we aimed to evaluate the anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance and fear of COVID-19 among frontline doctors of Bangladesh during the pandemic, and the associated factors for these psychological symptoms. <b>Methods:</b> In total, 370 frontline doctors who were involved in the treatment of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients during the pandemic took part in an online cross-sectional study. Recruitment was completed using convenience sampling and the data were collected after the start of community transmission of COVID-19 in the country. Anxiety and depression, sleep disturbance, and fear of COVID-19 were assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-4, two-item version of the Sleep Condition Indicator, and the Fear of Coronavirus-19 scale, respectively. Socio-demographic information, health service-related information, co-morbidity, and smoking history were collected for evaluating risk factors. The proportion of psychological symptoms were presented using descriptive statistics and the associated factors were identified using multinomial logistic regression analysis. <b>Results:</b> Of the doctors, 36.5% had anxiety, 38.4% had depression, 18.6% had insomnia, and 31.9% had fear of COVID-19. In multinomial logistic regression, inadequate resources in the workplace were found as the single most significant predictor for all psychological outcomes: anxiety and/or depression (severe, OR 3.0, p=0.01; moderate, OR 5.3, p=0.000; mild, OR 2.3, p=0.003), sleep disturbance (moderate, OR 1.9, p=0.02), and fear of COVID-19 (severe, OR 1.9, p=0.03; moderate, OR 1.8, p=0.03). <b>Conclusions:Ã‚Â </b>The study demonstrated a high burden of psychological symptoms among frontline doctors of Bangladesh during the COVID-19 pandemic situation.

"The Psychological Impact of COVID-19 Outbreak on Nurses Working in the Northwest of Amhara Regional State Referral Hospitals, Northwest Ethiopia","The psychosocial consequences of the coronavirus pandemic are serious for health professionals including nurses because of a higher level of exposure. Nurses often face huge psychological pressure as a result of workload, long hours, and working in a high-risk environment. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of anxiety, depression, and stress among nurses working in northwest Amhara referral hospitals. Institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from 25th September to 20th October 2020. A total of 302 nurses were selected using a simple random sampling technique. A structured pretested self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. The data were entered into EpiData version 3 and analyzed using SPSS version 21. A binary logistic regression model was used to compute bivariable and multivariable analyses. The prevalence of anxiety, depression, and stress among nurses was 69.6%, 55.3%, and 20.5%, respectively. Unavailability of a guideline, fear of infecting family, and having chronic diseases increase the risk of developing anxiety. Nurses who did not have a guideline, received negative feedback from families, had a history of mental disorders, and chronic diseases have a higher odds of depression. Working in the night shift, lack of training, fear of infecting family, negative feedback from families, presence of confirmed/suspected cases in the family, and having chronic diseases increase the risk of developing stress. More than two-thirds, more than half, and nearly one-fifth of the nurses had anxiety, depression, and stress, respectively. It is better to create awareness for the community, avail a guideline, train nurses, and give special attention to nurses with chronic disease and a history of mental disorders to minimize the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on nurses and protect their mental health.

"The Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic in Children With Cancer: A Report From Saudi Arabia","In January 2020, the WHO declared the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern. Due to the rapid spread of 2019-nCoV, all countries started preventive and precautionary measures to prevent COVID-19 infection spread. These measures limited the population mobility and services provided, which subsequently Impact of on children with cancer and cancer care delivery in the many health centers in Saudi Arabia. We did a cross-sectional study to assess the impact of this outbreak on children with cancer concerning all aspects of life including medical services provided, the specific precautions to prevent spread in cancer patients, mental, psychological effects, and its effect on the quality of life. We collected 204 responses during a survey that assessed the impact on the treatment of cancer children at a tertiary institution during the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of patients were receiving ongoing chemotherapy for leukemia/lymphoma. The majority of these patients (60.5%) reported a delay in treatment received due to hospital cancellation of appointments due to the pandemic. Although the majority of patients in our cohort complained of delayed treatment, fortunately, none of the delays led to fatalities. In the context of global lockdowns and physical distancing to help flatten the COVID-19 curve, telemedicine has proved fundamental to keeping patients and their healthcare providers connected and safe. Children also faced multiple other difficulties such as psychosocial issues during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Steps towards implementing evidence-based screening in family medicine in Ukraine: SWOT-analysis of an approach of multidimensional empowerment","The purpose of this study is to forward the implementation of an operational evidence-based state screening program of common diseases in Ukraine, where currently no state-based and evidence-based screening (EBS) exists. EBS should be performed by Family Doctors in a primary care setting and concern prevalent diseases in adults, such as: obesity (BMI), hypertension (BP measurement), diabetes (glycaemia), dyslipidemia (cholesterol/lipids), colon cancer (FOBT/colonoscopy), breast cancer (mammography), STIs (chlamydia, syphilis), HIV, HBV, HCV (i.e. serology or other rapid tests), HPV (swabs), cervical cancer (test Pap). depression (i.e., PHQ-9), and smoking (i.e., Fagerstrom). Four needs-based research actions were led among citizens and healthcare professionals, based on multidimensional empowerment. Internal Strengths and Weaknesses of the ongoing implementation process were identified through these studies, whereas external Opportunities and Threats were determined by the present socio-cultural and political context. This SWOT analysis is likely to guide future state-based initiatives to accomplish EBS implementation in Ukraine. Internal Strengths are the bottom-up multidimensional empowerment approach, teaching of EBS and the development of an internet-based platform &quot;Screening adviser&quot; to assist shared decision making for person-centred EBS programs. Internal Weaknesses identified for the Family Doctors are a heterogeneous screening and the risk of decreasing motivation to screen. External Opportunities include the ongoing PHC reform, the existent WONCA and WHO support, and the existence of EBS programs in Europe. External Threats are the lack of national guidelines, not fully introduced gate keeping system, the vulnerable socio-economic situation, the war situation in the East of Ukraine and the Covid-19 pandemic. We started EBS implementation through research actions, based on a multidimensional empowerment of citizens, HCP and in EBS pathways involved stakeholder teams, to foster a sustainable operational human resource to get involved in that new EBS pathway to implement.

To assess the prevalence and pattern of mental health issues and substance use in the migrant population and highlight the association with the reverse migration of migrant workers. The field staff visited the shelter homes for migrant population in four cities of Northern India (Chandigarh (UT), Bhatinda (Punjab), Panchkula (Haryana) and Jaipur (Rajasthan). After maintaining the social distance and wearing masks by the staff and migrants, written informed consent was taken for participation in the study. The socio-demographic details of reverse migrants were noted down and Hindi version of Primary Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for mental health problems and screening tool for pattern of substance abuse was administered. Geographically matched undisplaced were also administered these tools. A total of 275 reverse migrants and 276 undisplaced were included in the study. The prevalence of ever use for all the substances among reverse migrants was 44.4% (122/275) and among undisplaced, it was 45.3%.

"Life during COVID-19 lockdown in Italy: the influence of cognitive state on psychosocial, behavioral and lifestyle profiles of older adults","Few studies have examined lockdown effects on the way of living and well-being of older adults stratified by cognitive state. Since cognitive deficits are common in this population, we investigated how cognition influenced their understanding of the pandemic, socio-behavioral responses and lifestyle adaptations during lockdown, and how these factors affected their mood or memory. Telephone-based survey involving 204 older adults Ã¢â€°Â¥65Ã¢â‚¬â€°y/o (median: 82) with previous assessments of cognitive state: 164 normal-old (NOLD), 24 mild-neurocognitive disorder (mild-NCD), 18 mild-moderate dementia. A structured questionnaire was developed to assess psychological and socio-behavioral variables. Logistic regression was used to ascertain their effects on mood and memory. With increasing cognitive deficits, understanding of the pandemic and the ability to follow lockdown policies, adapt to lifestyle changes, and maintain remote interactions decreased. Participants with dementia were more depressed; NOLDs remained physically and mentally active but were more bored and anxious. Sleeping and health problems independently increased the likelihood of depression (OR: 2.29; CI: 1.06-4.93; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.034 and OR: 2.45; CI: 1.16-5.16; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.018, respectively); Regular exercise was protective (OR: 0.30; CI: 0.12-0.72; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.007).

"Depression and Anxiety Symptoms Amongst Kenyan Adolescents: Psychometric Properties, Prevalence, Psychosocial and Sociodemographic Factors","Background: We assessed the psychometric properties of standard Western-derived instruments, the prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms and their associations with sociodemographic and psychosocial variables in a large sample of Kenyan adolescents. Methods: We administered self-report measures of depression (PHQ-8) and anxiety (GAD-7) symptoms, social support, gratitude, happiness, optimism and perceived control to 2,192 Kenyan youths (57.57% female) aged 12-19. Results: Both the PHQ-8 (a = 0.78) and GAD-7 (a = 0.82) showed adequate internal consistency. EFA with a sub-sample (N = 1096) yielded a 1-factor structure for both the PHQ-8 and GAD-7, a subsequent CFA conducted on the basis of the 1-factor model on another sub-sample (N = 1096) yielded good goodness of fit for the PHQ-8 (<U+F063>2=76.73; p<0.001; RMSEA=0.05; CFI=0.96; TLI=0.95) and GAD-7 (<U+F063>2=88.19; p<0.001; RMSEA=0.07; CFI=0.97; TLI=0.95). Some 28.06% of participants met the clinical cut-off for depressive symptoms and 30.38% for anxiety symptoms. Social support, gratitude, happiness, optimism, and perceived control were negatively associated with symptoms. Older and female adolescents reported higher symptoms, while adolescents with three or more siblings reported lower symptoms. Limitations: Cross-sectional data no not allow us to investigate the onset, maintenance, and course of depressive and anxiety symptoms and our large sample was not randomly sampled.

"Resilience, mood, and mental health outcomes during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Bulgaria","Background: The fundamental challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic may have lasting negative effects on the quality of mental health worldwide. Resilience is considered an important protective factor in reducing the risk of psychopathology in the face of various adverse events, such as the ongoing health crisis. The aims of the current study were to: (1) evaluate the predictive utility of resilience in accounting for positive and negative moods, substance use, depression and anxiety; and (2) compare negative and positive moods experienced before the pandemic to emotions reported during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Bulgaria, when the country still had low prevalence of infections and fatalities. Methods: 179 Bulgarian participants completed the international online Minnesota Global Survey on Stress and Resilience in the Face of the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), which included measures of resilience, depression and anxiety, substance use, positive and negative moods experienced both before and during the COVID-19 outbreak. Results: Resilience predicted higher levels of positive affect and lower anxiety, depression, and negative mood during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in Bulgaria. A significant increase was found in negative mood and a corresponding decrease in positive mood in the time since COVID-19 began spreading compared to before the pandemic. Conclusions: Results suggest that the initial wave of the COVID-19 crisis impacted individualsâ€™ well-being, even in countries with relatively low prevalence of COVID-19 and associated fatalities. In this challenging global setting, resilience may serve as a buffer against negative emotional states and psychological distress.","Elena Psederska et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46066-B3C-999","20210116","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; anxiety; substance use; covid-19; depression; resilience; positive and negative mood","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-01-18","",9589,""
