"Changes in Physical Activity, Sleep, Mental Health, and Social Media Use During COVID-19 Lockdown Among Adolescent Girls: A Mixed-Methods Study","To suppress the transmission of coronavirus, many governments, including that of the island of Ireland, implemented a societal lockdown, which included school closures, limits on social gatherings, and time outdoors. This study aimed to evaluate changes in physical activity (PA), mental health, sleep, and social media use among adolescent girls during lockdown. 281 female pupils (12-14Ã‚Â y) taking part in the ongoing Walking In Schools study on the island of Ireland self-reported PA, mental health, sleep, and social media use before (September-October 2019) and during lockdown (May-June 2020), via questionnaires. These were supplemented with open-ended structured interviews conducted with 16 girls during lockdown. During the period of lockdown and school closures, pupils tried new forms of PA and undertook PA with family, but there was no significant change in self-reported PA. There was a decline in health-related quality of life and motivation for exercise; however, self-efficacy for walking and happiness with appearance increased. There was no change in sleep quality or social media usage. Despite the many challenges that schools face as they reopen, there is a need to continue to prioritize PA and motivation for exercise to support health and well-being in adolescent girls.","O'Kane, Lahart, Gallagher, Carlin, Faulkner, Jago, Murphy","https://doi.org/10.1123/jpah.2020-0649","20210512","coronavirus; exercise; females; restrictions; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-13","",13667,""

"Transformation of primary care during the COVID-19 pandemic: experiences of healthcare professionals in eight European countries","Primary care has a crucial role in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic as the first point of patient care and gatekeeper to secondary care. Qualitative studies exploring the experiences of healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic have mainly focused on secondary care. To understand the experiences of European PCPs working during the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. An exploratory qualitative study, using semi-structured interviews in primary care in England, Belgium, the Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, Poland, Greece and Sweden, between April and July 2020. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed and analysed using a combination of inductive and deductive thematic analysis techniques. Eighty interviews were conducted with PCPs. PCPs had to make their own decisions on how to rapidly transform services in relation to COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 care. Despite being overwhelmed with guidance, they often lacked access to practical training. Consequently, PCPs turned to their colleagues for moral support and information to try to quickly adjust to new ways of working, including remote care, and deal with uncertainty. PCPs rapidly transformed primary care delivery despite a number of challenges. Representation of primary care at policy level and engagement with local primary care champions will facilitate easy and coordinated access to practical information on how to adapt services, ongoing training and access to appropriate mental health support services for PCPs. Preservation of autonomy and responsiveness of primary care are critical to preserve the ability for rapid transformation in any future crisis of care delivery.","Wanat, Hoste, Gobat, Anastasaki, Boehmer, Chlabicz, Colliers, Farrell, Karkana, Kinsman, Lionis, Marcinowicz, Reinhardt, Skoglund, Sundvall, Vellinga, Verheij, Goossens, Butler, van der Velden, Anthierens, Tonkin-Crine","https://doi.org/10.3399/BJGP.2020.1112","20210512","COVID-19; primary health care; qualitative; semi-structured interviews","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-13","",13669,""

"Risk perceptions, fear, depression, anxiety, stress and coping among Saudi nursing students during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has seriously impacted various aspects of the society on a global scale. Schools and universities provide rich resources for adolescents and young adults to develop significant coping mechanisms. This study assessed the perceptions of risk, fear, mental health status, and coping strategies among Saudi student nurses amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Using an online survey, the mental health of the students was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale short form version, whereas the coping was assessed by the Brief-Coping Orientation of Problem Experienced scale. The students had modest risk perception and fear of contracting COVID-19. &quot;Religion&quot; was reported as the most frequently used coping strategy. Approximately 43.3%, 37.2%, and 30.9% of the respondents manifested some degree of depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively. Poor COVID-19 knowledge, perceived seriousness of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia, perceived risk of COVID-19 infection, and the use of some coping strategies were predictors of fear. Knowing someone infected with COVID-19, fear, and several coping strategies predicted students' mental health. This study provides data that can be used to create educational and health policies that focus on the mental health of university students, specifically nursing students.","Alsolais, Alquwez, Alotaibi, Alqarni, Almalki, Alsolami, Almazan, Cruz","https://doi.org/10.1080/09638237.2021.1922636","20210512","Anxiety; COVID-19; coping; depression; fear; risk perceptions; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-13","",13673,""
"Access to Mental Healthcare in the 21st Century: An Evolutionary Concept Analysis","One of the most important aspects of receiving medical care is access to that care. For people with mental illness who have greater healthcare needs and are at risk for poor health outcomes, reduced access to care constitutes a crisis. While the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic continues to affect the United States, specifying what it means to have access to mental healthcare is more critical than ever. The aim of this concept analysis is to review definitions and descriptions of access to mental healthcare in the literature and to synthesize the relevance of these findings to inform future research, theory development, policy, and practice. The concept of access to mental healthcare was analyzed using Rodgers's evolutionary concept analysis method. CINAHL, PsycINFO, and MEDLINE were queried for peer-reviewed articles about access to mental healthcare published from January 2010 to April 2020 (<i>n</i> = 72). Data were reviewed for concept antecedents, attributes, consequences, surrogate, and related terms. Five models of access to mental healthcare were identified, with several antecedents and consequences: utilization, economic loss/gain, incarceration, and patient/provider satisfaction. Cross-sectional and predictive studies highlighted three interrelated attributes: clinical management, healthcare delivery, and connectedness. The concept of access to mental healthcare is often used stagnantly across disciplines to create health policies, yet the concept is transformative. Future research requires up-to-date operational definitions of access to mental healthcare to target interdisciplinary approaches.","Smith-East, Conner, Neff","https://doi.org/10.1177/10783903211011672","20210512","chronic mental illness; community mental health services; mental health systems; service delivery research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-13","",13674,""

We investigated the challenges and innovations reported by staff working in services for people with intellectual disability and/or autism in National Health Service (NHS) and non-NHS sectors, and in in-patient and community settings. Data were drawn from 648 staff who participated in a UK-wide online survey. Issues around infection risk and mitigation were more important to those working in the NHS and in-patient settings. Community staff were more likely to express concern about the practicalities of a rapid shift to remote working and engaging patients remotely. Qualitative data revealed support for maintaining remote staff working and remote service provision post-pandemic.

"Lactoferrin for Mental Health: Neuro-Redox Regulation and Neuroprotective Effects across the Blood-Brain Barrier with Special Reference to Neuro-COVID-19","Overall mental health depends in part on the blood-brain barrier, which regulates nutrient transfer in-and-out of the brain and its central nervous system. Lactoferrin, an innate metal-transport protein, synthesized in the substantia nigra, particularly in dopaminergic neurons and activated microglia is vital for brain physiology. Lactoferrin rapidly crosses the blood-brain barrier <i>via</i> receptor-mediated transcytosis and accumulates in the brain capillary endothelial cells. Lactoferrin receptors are additionally present on glioma cells, brain micro-vessels, and neurons. As a regulator of neuro-redox, microglial lactoferrin is critical for protection/repair of neurons and healthy brain function. Iron imbalance and oxidative stress are common among patients with neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, dementia, depression, and multiple sclerosis. As an endogenous iron-chelator, lactoferrin prevents iron accumulation and dopamine depletion in Parkinson's disease patients. Oral lactoferrin supplementation could modulate the p-Akt/PTEN pathway, reduce AÃŽÂ² deposition, and ameliorate cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease. Novel lactoferrin-based nano-therapeutics have emerged as effective drug-delivery systems for clinical management of neurodegenerative disorders. Recent emergence of the <i>Coronavirus disease-2019</i> (COVID-19) pandemic, initially considered a respiratory illness, demonstrated a broader virulence spectrum with the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and inflict a plethora of neuropathological manifestations in the brain - the <i>Neuro</i>-COVID-19. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections are widely reported in Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and multiple sclerosis patients with aggravated clinical outcomes. Lactoferrin, credited with several neuroprotective benefits in the brain could serve as a potential adjuvant in the clinical management of <i>Neuro</i>-COVID-19.","Naidu, Wallace, Davies, Naidu","https://doi.org/10.1080/19390211.2021.1922567","20210512","AlzheimerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease; COVID-19; Lactoferrin; Neuro-COVID-19; ParkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Disease; Redox; SARS-CoV-2; blood-brain barrier; brain tumor; mental health; neurological symptoms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-13","",13678,""

"Descriptive Analysis of a Telephone Based Community Monitoring Service for COVID-19","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has required health services to rapidly respond to the needs of people diagnosed with the virus. Over 80% of people diagnosed with COVID-19 experience a mild illness and there is a need for community management to support these people in their home. In this paper we present, a telephone based COVID-19 community monitoring service developed in an Australian public health network, and we describe the rapid implementation of the service and the demographic and clinical characteristics of those enrolled. A retrospective mixed methods evaluation of the COVID-19 community monitoring service using the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) framework. Eight hundred and fifty COVID-19 positive patients were enrolled, 54% female, 45% male, mean age 34Ã‚Â years SD 17. Four hundred and nine (48%) patients were born outside Australia. Among the 850 patients, 305 (36%) were classified as having a high risk of serious illness from COVID-19. The most prevalent risk factors were cardiovascular disease (37%), lung disease (30%) and age over 60Ã‚Â years (26%). The most common reported ongoing symptoms were fatigue (55%), breathing issues (26%) and mental health issues such as low mood (19%). There were no deaths in patients that participated in the service. The process of risk stratification undertaken with telephone triage was effective in determining risk of prolonged illness from COVID-19.

"Well-being, Interventions and Support during Epidemics (WISE): Protocol for a qualitative longitudinal study of older adults' experiences during COVID-19","<b>Background:</b> The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has the potential to trigger multiple stress domains and lead to long-term repercussions in an individual's quality of life, health and well-being. Stressors from the pandemic are likely to be experienced in many ways by older adults with heterogeneous life experiences and supports available. In this context, it is necessary to tease out the underlying mechanisms leading to positive and negative well-being and mental health across interdependent individual, social and environmental factors. The aim of the present study is to explore community-dwelling older adults' experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a particular focus on mental health and psychosocial well-being. <b>Methods:</b> An exploratory longitudinal qualitative study will be conducted with data collected through written submissions, sitting interviews and walk along interviews with older adults living in Irish community settings. Data collection will take place 3 to 10 weeks apart to enable the exploration of individuals' responses to the evolving social, economic and environmental circumstances derived from the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland.Ã‚ An iterative thematic analysis will be carried out to identify data themes, linkages, and explanations within a socio-ecological framework. <b>Ethics and dissemination: Ã‚Â </b>Ethical approval has been granted by the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Research Ethics Committee (REC202011028).

"Eating Behavior Changes of People with Obesity During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The precautions taken during the pandemic period may cause stress-related eating behavior disorders. It was aimed to test this hypothesis, and the study was carried out to examine pandemic measures the effect of on the nutritional, depression and stress conditions of people with obesity. The individuals who participated in the study were people with obesity who received follow-up dietary therapy in a private hospital. Three separate scales were applied to the individuals, which measured the desire to overeating request, depression status and stress-fighting status. This study was conducted on 368 individuals. Women had lower values of BMI (28.57Ã‚Â±3.89 kg/cm<sup>2</sup>) than men (30.64Ã‚Â±2.87 kg/cm<sup>2</sup>). When the scores of the excessive eating request scale mean scores before and during the pandemic were examined, it was seen that the scores of the individuals increased during the pandemic. In the multivariate regression model, it was seen that the increase of stress and BMI increased the FCQ score (p&lt;0.001). Multiple regression models were created by taking into account the criteria that caused the score increase. Each variable can predict the FCQ score separately. The predictor significance order of variants on FCQ score ÃŽÂ² values is as follows: the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>=0.774), before pandemic FCQ (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>=0.601), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>=-0.268), before pandemic BMI<sup>a</sup> (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>=-0.223), during pandemic BMI<sup>b</sup> (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>=0.073), and age (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>=-0.013).

"Predictive factors of insomnia during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh: a GIS-based nationwide distribution","In a densely populated country like Bangladesh, mental health-related burden and associated adverse outcomes are quite prevalent. However, exploration of sleep-related issues in general, and more specifically of insomnia during the COVID-19 pandemic has been scarce and restricted to a single location. The present study investigated the prevalence of insomnia and its predictive factors in the general population, and included Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis to identify regional heterogeneities of insomnia in Bangladesh. This cross-sectional study was conducted during the early period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Information related to socio-demographics, knowledge of COVID-19, behaviors related to COVID-19, fear of COVID-19, and insomnia were included in a questionnaire, and coupled with GIS-based spatial analysis to identify regional susceptibility to insomnia. Approximately 30.4%, 13.1% and 2.8% of participants reported sub-threshold, moderate, and severe forms of insomnia, respectively. Independent predictive risk factors of insomnia symptoms included female gender, college education, urban residence, presence of comorbidities, using social media, taking naps during daytime, and fear of COVID-19. District-wide variations in the spatial distribution of fear of COVID-19 and insomnia were significantly associated. Insomnia is frequently present during a pandemic, and exhibits regional variability along with multifactorial determinants. These analytic approaches should enable improved detection and targeting of at-risk sectors of the population, and enable implementation of appropriate measures to ensure improved sleep quality.","Al Mamun, Gozal, Hosen, Misti, Mamun","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2021.04.025","20210512","Bangladesh; COVID-19 psychological impact; Fear of COVID-19; GIS-Based nationwide study; Insomnia; Sleep problems","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-13","",13686,""
"Overview of sleep management during COVID-19","The sleep of millions has suffered during the global COVID-19 pandemic. Prevalence rates of 20-45% are reported globally for insomnia symptoms during the pandemic. Affected populations include the public and health care workers. A sleep deprived society faces the increased burden of COVID-related economic disruption, psychosocial problems, substance abuse, and suicide. Disordered sleep is not expected to disappear with control of infection, making interventions acutely necessary. The question becomes how to manage the sleep dysfunction during and after the pandemic. Depression and anxiety are prominent complaints during pandemic restrictions. Insomnia symptoms and fatigue continue even as mood improves in those who are in recovery from COVID-19 infection. Management of disturbed sleep and mental health is particularly needed in frontline health care workers. This overview describes 53 publications, as of February 2021, on disturbed sleep during the pandemic, treatment studies on COVID-related sleep disturbance, and need to rely on current treatment guidelines for common sleep disorders. The available research during the first year of COVID-19 has generally described symptoms of poor sleep rather than addressing treatment strategies. It covers digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-i) for the public and frontline workers, recognizing the need of greater acceptance and efficacy of controlled trials of CBT for affected groups. Recommendations based on a tiered public health model are discussed.","Becker","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2021.04.024","20210512","COVID-19; Insomnia; Public health model of sleep management; Sleep disorders; Sleep vital sign; Treatment guidelines","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-13","",13687,""
"Is It &quot;Aging&quot; or Immunosenescence? The COVID-19 Biopsychosocial Risk Factors Aggravating Immunosenescence as Another Risk Factor of the Morbus A Developmental-clinical Social Work Perspective","COVID-19 has proliferated ageism. The impetus of this article is to show that immunosenescence is a risk factor to COVID-19 and not aging per se. Based on the idea that some older people are also healthier than younger ones, the emphasis of this article is on immunosenescence and not aging as a risk factor of COVID-19 complications. The paper utilizes a biopsychosocial approach to expound on the link between immunosenescence and COVID-19 risk factors. The article explores biological factors such as malnutrition, comorbidities, substance abuse, and sex. It also expands on psychosocial factors such as mental health disorders, homelessness, unemployment, lack of physical exercises, stigma, and discrimination. The article calls for gerontological social work to assume a developmental-clinical social work perspective to prevent the early onset and progression of immunosenescence. It calls for gerontological social work to prevent factors that promote unhealthy aging. The article promotes a preventative stance to practice and not just curative approaches. Treatment involves primary prevention which emphasizes on avoiding the onset of unhealthy aging. It is this approach that gerontological social work should aim also to address in building resilience in the face of pandemics.","Chigangaidze, Chinyenze","https://doi.org/10.1080/01634372.2021.1923604","20210512","COVID-19; Developmental-Clinical Social Work; aging; biopsychosocial approach; gerontological social work; immunosenescence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-13","",13688,""
