"Pandemic with COVID-19 and Families with Children with Chronic Respiratory Diseases","COVID-19 pandemic has provoked a huge change in daily functioning in millions of people worldwide. The epidemiological measures in prevention of possible infection have increased the possible risks on the mental and physical health. We have conducted a survey in order to investigate the needs and challenges of families with children with chronic respiratory diseases. In this order, we have created a questionnaire with general information about the family, general information about the child with chronic respiratory disease, overall physical and mental health before and during the pandemic, needs and mental health condition of the parents/caregivers. This survey showed that this group of families of children with respiratory disorders have suffered financially in significant way and has changed the way they perform professional and educational patterns due to the pandemic. Most of the children were stable in their physical health, but their mental health has deteriorated. This is probably due to the regular contact with the medical staff, but not with the mental health professionals. This group of children has a significant reduction in their physical activity and increase the hours in front of TV screens. The further effect on the physical and mental health is to be investigated.","Zorcec, Jakovska, Micevska, Boskovska, Cholakovska","https://doi.org/10.2478/prilozi-2020-0038","20201004","COVID-19 pandemic; children; chronic respiratory disease","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-05","",5474,""
"Concerns of women regarding pregnancy and childbirth during the COVID-19 pandemic","Better understand knowledge, attitudes and practices of pregnant women and mothers of infants around coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A 58-item electronic survey was distributed to pregnant and postpartum women (infants &lt;12 months) who were &gt;15 years, English-speaking and enrolled in prenatal programs. Data is summarized using central tendency, frequencies and nonparametric statistics. Of 114 (51 % response rate) participants, 82.5 % reported negative changes in mental status measures (e.g. stress, anxious thoughts, changes in sleep patterns). All reported risk-reduction behavior changes (e.g. handwashing/use of sanitizer, social distancing). Significant changes were reported in employment and financial status due to the pandemic. Increases in alcohol consumption among postpartum women were also reported. Few reported changes in prenatal, infant or postpartum healthcare access. This study provides initial insight into the knowledge, attitudes and practices of pregnant and postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study is limited as participants represent a single Midwest community and social desirability response bias may have impacted responses. However, results may inform future interventions to support pregnant women and mothers of infants during pandemics. Providers should consider the impact of such events on mental status, access to resources and changes in behaviors.","Ahlers-Schmidt, Hervey, Neil, Kuhlmann, Kuhlmann","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pec.2020.09.031","20201004","Behavior changes; COVID-19; Healthcare access; Maternal and infant health; Mental health; Pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-05","",5475,""
