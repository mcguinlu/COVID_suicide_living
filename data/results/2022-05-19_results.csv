"Mental health outcomes following COVID-19 infection: Evidence from 11 UK longitudinal population studies","BackgroundEvidence on associations between COVID-19 illness and mental health is mixed. We examined longitudinal associations between COVID-19 and mental health while considering: 1) pre-pandemic mental health, 2) time since infection; 3) subgroup differences; and 4) confirmation of infection via self-reported test, and serology data.

MethodsUsing data from 11 UK longitudinal studies, involving 54,442 participants, with 2 to 8 repeated measures of mental health and COVID-19 between April 2020 and April 2021, we standardised continuous mental health scales within each study across time. We investigated associations between COVID-19 (self-report, test-confirmed, serology-confirmed) and mental health using multilevel generalised estimating equations. We examined whether associations varied by age, sex, ethnicity, education and pre-pandemic mental health. Effect-sizes were pooled in random-effects meta-analyses.

OutcomesPooled estimates of the standardized difference in outcome between those with and without self-reported COVID-19 suggested associations with subsequent psychological distress (0.10 [95%CI: 0.06; 0.13], I2=42.8%), depression (0.08 [0.05; 0.10], I2=20.8%), anxiety (0.08 [0.05; 0.10], I2=0%), and lower life satisfaction (-0.06 [-0.08; -0.04], I2=29.2%). Associations did not vary by time since infection until 3+ months and were present in all age groups, with some evidence of stronger effects in those aged 50+. Self-reported COVID-19, whether suspected or test-confirmed and irrespective of serology status, was associated with poorer mental health.

InterpretationSelf-reporting COVID-19 was longitudinally associated with deterioration in mental health and life satisfaction. Our findings have important implications for mental health service provision, given the substantial prevalence of COVID-19 in the UK and worldwide.

"Effects of social support on depression risk during the COVID-19 pandemic: What support types and for whom?","BackgroundRates of depression have increased worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic. One known protective factor for depression is social support, but more work is needed to quantify the extent to which social support could reduce depression risk during a global crisis, and specifically to identify which types of support are most helpful, and who might benefit most.

MethodsData were obtained from participants in the All of Us Research Program who responded to the COVID-19 Participant Experience (COPE) survey administered monthly from May 2020 to July 2020 (N=69,066, 66% female). Social support was assessed using 10 items measuring emotional/informational support (e.g., someone to confide in or talk to about yourself or your problems), positive social interaction support (e.g., someone to do things with to help you get your mind off things), and tangible support (e.g., someone to help with daily chores if sick). Elevated depression symptoms were defined based on having a moderate-to-severe ([&ge;]10) score on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Mixed-effects logistic regression models were used to test associations across time between overall social support and its subtypes with depression, adjusting for age, sex, race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic factors. We then assessed interactions between social support and potential effect modifiers: age, sex, pre-pandemic mood disorder, and pandemic-related stressors (e.g., financial insecurity).

ResultsApproximately 16% of the sample experienced elevated depressive symptoms. Overall social support was associated with significantly reduced odds of depression (adjusted odds ratio, aOR [95% CI]=0.44 [0.42-0.45]). Among subtypes, emotional/informational support (aOR=0.42 [0.41-0.43]) and positive social interactions (aOR=0.43 [0.41-0.44]) showed the largest protective associations with depression, followed by tangible support (aOR=0.63 [0.61-0.65]). Sex, age, and pandemic-related financial stressors were statistically significant modifiers of the association between social support and depression.

ConclusionsIndividuals reporting higher levels of social support were at reduced risk of depression during the early COVID-19 pandemic. The perceived availability of emotional support and positive social interactions, more so than tangible support, was key. Individuals more vulnerable to depression (e.g., women, younger individuals, and those experiencing financial stressors) may particularly benefit from enhanced social support, supporting a precision prevention approach.","Karmel W Choi; Younga H Lee; Zhaowen Liu; Daniel Fatori; Joshua R Bauermeister; Rebecca A Luh; Cheryl R Clark; AndrÃ© R Brunoni; Sarah Bauermeister; Jordan W Smoller","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.05.15.22274976","20220516","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31451,""
"Sexual attitudes of Turkish population during the COVID-19 outbreak","Introduction During the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, the psychological and mental conditions of the society worsen. The aim of this study is to examine the changes in their sex lives due to the Turkish COVID-19 outbreak. Method This online survey was conducted between April and June 2020 with 468 patients admitted to the hospital. After the approval was given, an online questionnaire was sent from the hospital database and from the social media accounts of health institutions (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, etc.) and e-mail addresses. The first part of the four-part questionnaire included demographic data, the second and third parts of attitudes before and after COVID-19, and the last part to assess sexual functions, sleep, anxiety and depression. Results The study was completed with a total of 390 participants. The response rate of the study is 83.33%. Sexual desires of healthcare workers (3.78 Â± 1.03 vs. 3.07 Â± 1.11;p &lt;0.001), weekly sexual intercourse / masturbation number (2.58 Â± 1.01 vs. 1.18 Â± 1.01;p &lt;0.001), duration of foreplay (19.27 Â± 11.28 vs.10.12 Â± 11.04;p &lt;0.001), duration of sexual intercourse (24.65 Â± 15.67 vs. 14.25 Â± 15, 63;p &lt;0.001) decreased compared to before the COVID-19 outbreak. In addition, participants preferred less foreplay (p &lt;0.001), less oral sex (p &lt;0.001) and anal sex (p: 0.007), and more non-face-to-face positions during COVID-19 (p &lt;0.001) . When the factors affecting sexual dysfunction were examined as univariate and multivariate, it was shown that sexual dysfunction was significantly more common in male gender (OR: 2.048) and alcohol users (OR: 3.836). The shortcoming of the study is that the pre-COVID-19 sexual and mental states of the participants were not assessed with the validated questionnaire. Conclusion During the COVID-19 pandemic, the public's sexual desire decreased, the number of sexual intercourse decreased, the duration of foreplay was reduced, and the preference to be face-to-face in sexual intercourse positions decreased.

"Moderating effects of emotion regulation difficulties and resilience on studentsâ€™ mental health and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic","This study examined whether emotion regulation difficulties and resilience in college students moderated changes in mental health over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants (N = 321) completed surveys assessing mental health, in addition to levels of emotion dysregulation, and resilience during the pandemic, then utilized an anchoring prompt to recall mental health experiences before the pandemic. Correlations revealed participants with higher levels of emotion dysregulation also reported lower levels of resilience. Analyses using the SPSS Macro MEMORE (Montoya, 2019) revealed participants with higher levels of emotion regulation difficulties had greater increases in depression and insomnia, and greater decreases in well-being over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, while participants with lower levels of resilience had greater increases in depression, anxiety, and insomnia over the course of the pandemic.

"Pandemic and its impact on the rural youth: teaching resilience through literature","Writers have responded to contemporary epidemics and diseases in their own unique ways depending on which disease or illness is represented. They have found expression in varied forms of literature. It has been a medium of projecting sympathetic, empathetic, and realistic points of views. On scrutiny, one can find references of the social responses to pandemics available in literature, like interaction among human beings and interface between people and state, and what strategies were followed/adopted to maintain health systems. Further, illness does not necessarily mean only the physical. It can be psychological as well, which the writers often identify and represent in their works. It would, therefore, be fruitful to consider psychoanalytic theory in the context of the effects and consequences of a pandemic. A poem or prose not only mirrors the world around or imparts wisdom or acts as a matter-of-fact project possibility, but is also a reliable source that soothes the mind, body, and soul. It has a therapeutic impact, especially when preserving life is the primary objective and concern. Research has also shown that bibliotherapy is a treatment for various ailments, like depression and mood upliftment, preventing dementia, and cognitive ageing. Considering all these, the paper seeks to identify, while developing an understanding of pandemics, how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the youth, particularly girls aged 17-21 in select rural areas of Haryana, its social, economic, and psychological consequences, and draw certain signposts that can work as a steering to an inclusive and resilient society.","Priyanka, Singh, Shalini, Attri","https://www.google.com/search?q=Pandemic+and+its+impact+on+the+rural+youth:+teaching+resilience+through+literature","","Database: GIM; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Rural and Industrial Development; 9(1):8-14, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31454,""

"Access to Justice in an Age of Uncertainty","In countries like Australia, where the infection and death rates have been low compared to other parts of the world, lockdowns and social restrictions associated with limiting the spread of the virus have resulted in sharp increases in domestic and family violence, alcohol and substance abuse, mental health and physical health problems, job losses and business closures that are linked to unemployment, resulting in higher rates of poverty and homelessness (Carrington et al. 2021;Morley et al. 2021). In doing so, each of the author contributors have considered the following key questions: * Which individuals, social groups, communities or populations are particularly marginalised by the current context and why? * What are the ongoing, emerging and new barriers these groups face in accessing justice in the age of global uncertainty? * What social and political changes might be helpful in addressing the urgent social problems plaguing our world? * What key changes are required (to practice, policy or other mechanisms) that augment access to justice in the current context? While drawn from wide-ranging and diverse topics - the rise of recruitment fraud;the barriers academic staff face in supporting international students in the current neoliberal higher education sector that has been butchered since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic;and the challenges human services practitioners face in neoliberal organisations that have transitioned online work during COVID-19-related lockdowns at a time when this work became much more demanding and complex - not surprisingly, most submissions have focused on accessing basic human rights, such as economic security and affordable housing. In highlighting this important issue, they explain how offenders use employment advertisements to recruit would-be applicants to send personal information that compromises their fnancial security or to pay fees that then expose them to a range of violations, including identity theft and fraud.","Morley, Christine, Carrington, Kerry","https://www.google.com/search?q=Access+to+Justice+in+an+Age+of+Uncertainty","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Social Alternatives; 40(4):3-6, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31456,""
"Predictive factors of clinical assays on hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 mortality during the first year of the pandemic: A meta-synthesis","AJOL : Background: The COVID-19 pandemic led to a violent debate about the efficacy of a repurposed drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and a new broad-spectrum antiviral (remdesivir) and about randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies. To understand conflicting results in the literature, we performed a metasynthesis to determine whether intrinsic qualitative criteria within studies may predict apparent efficacy or ineffectiveness of HCQ and remdesivir. Methodology: Predictive criteria were identified through critical review of studies assessing HCQ and remdesivir for COVID-19 mortality from March to November 2020. Multiple correspondence analysis, comparative metaanalysis, and predictive value were used to explore and identify criteria associated with study outcomes. Results: Among the 61 included studies, potential conflict of interest, detailed therapeutic protocol, toxic treatment (overdose or use in contraindicated patients), known centers and doctors, and private data computing company were the most predictive criteria of the direction of effect of the studies. All 18 observational studies evaluating HCQ and reporting detailed therapeutic protocol without conflict of interest were Pro. Potential conflict of interest was a perfect predictor for remdesivir efficacy. RCTs were associated with HCQ inefficacy and potential conflict of interest. The most predictive criteria were validated and allowed perfect classification of 10 additional studies.Conclusion: In therapeutic trials on COVID-19, the major biases predicting the conclusions are not methodology nor data analysis, but conflict of interest and absence of medical expertise. The thorough search for declared or undeclared and direct or indirect conflict of interest, and medical expertise should be included in the quality criteria for the evaluation of future therapeutic studies in COVID-19 and beyond.

"Early adoption of social emotional learning: Perspectives from elementary principals","Due to the increasing mental health needs of children, schools have been tasked with supporting academic and social emotional needs of students. One component of mental health and wellness that is growing in popularity in the school environment is social emotional learning, or SEL. This qualitative multiple case study explored factors influential to the principal's SEL adoption and implementation experience during the first year of implementation in kindergarten and first grade. Further, this study explored how SEL instruction was adapted to meet the virtual learning experiences of students and staff due to COVID-19. A conceptual framework, based upon Rogers' (2003) Diffusion of Innovation Theory, guided the study. Six principals, identified as early adopters, from five regions in a Virginia school district, participated in the study. In addition to a review of school level data and SEL curriculum resources, semi-structured interviews were completed with principals. Principals in this study described factors such as vision and professional learning (knowledge) and perceived benefits, input from stakeholders, and alignment of initiatives (persuasion) as influential to their early adoption of the SEL initiative. Dedicated time, curriculum, coaching support, and virtual adaptation contributed to the principals' SEL implementation experiences. As implementation occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, principals highlighted the morning meeting structure, virtual adaptation of the curriculum, and an increased focus on adult SEL. Implications of this study speak to developing best practices for SEL in a virtual environment, dedicated time for implementation, providing SEL support to staff and students, and engaging families in supporting SEL at home. Future research should explore the implementation experiences of students, teachers, and families, include grades beyond kindergarten and first grade, and compare implementation outcomes in physical and virtual environments.

"The experiential therapist: Phenomenology, trauma-informed care, and mental health","This book addresses the two issues that were noticed by the author in establishing and running mental health clinics. First, the thinking found in medical practice, and the psychiatrists who advocate for it have dominated the field of mental health. Second, the rest of the psychologists, mental health counselors, clinical social workers, trauma therapists, and so on, have to figure out how one's training fits into this medically oriented practice. The author aims to fit a holistic, alternative way of thinking into a more medical model form of practice before students graduate. Even though thinking from a medical perspective has moved forward the field of mental health and has gained respectable success, it seems shortsighted to hold on to a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach. There is an alternative way of thinking, and it keeps growing as patients in mental health become better-informed and continue to find meaning in their personal experiences. Experiential thought is about setting the stage for future experiences, not a systematic diagnosis and treatment of a present disorder. It warns against life experiences becoming pathologies. It advocates that working through stress and trauma will create hope, resilience, and self-esteem. This book makes comparisons between thinking that focuses on finding meaning in people's life experiences and thinking where relieving symptoms is the ultimate goal. With this in mind, one repeated theme in each chapter will be the description of the medical model system itself, which contains fact-finding, diagnosis, treatment through drugs, therapeutic techniques, treatment planning, and medical model therapy. Experiential thinking may be particularly relevant with the emblematic experience of COVID-19. Where beyond the physical crisis lies the mental one for all who are caught in such an experience.

"Willingness to pay for COVID-19 environmental health risk reductions in consumption: evidence from US professional sports","The COVID-19 pandemic caused substantial economic changes. The airborne transmission of the coronavirus increased the environmental health risks associated with many activities that entailed little risk in the pre-pandemic period, including workplace risks and risks faced by consumers. While a large literature estimates local tradeoffs between money and reduced risk of negative health outcomes in many settings, little empirical evidence addresses consumer willingness to pay for reduction in environmental health risks associated with coronavirus transmission. We estimate professional sports fans' willingness to pay (WTP) for reduced likelihood of coronavirus infection through mask and social distancing policies at games using a stated preference approach. Regression results based on a latent class logit model using survey data collected from 1,391 fans of professional sports teams in five large U.S. metropolitan areas indicate increased attendance likelihood if the venue requires masks and limits attendance to below capacity. Latent class logit models indicate significant heterogeneity in WTP across risk scenarios and sports. We characterize the types of professional sports fan as casual fans who prefer a mask requirement but are indifferent to stadium and arena capacity, rabid fans who are anti-maskers and indifferent to capacity and fans who only have a positive WTP when there is a mask requirement and low stadium/arena capacity (i.e., opportunities for the greatest amount of social distancing).","Humphreys, B.; Wagner, G.

"Turkish Version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale: Validity and reliability study for children and adolescents","Objective: The number of publications reporting anxiety and fear about the ongoing outbreak of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) continues to grow;however, the psychometric tools available to assess a Turkish population are insufficient to measure the relevant mental health outcomes. The purpose of this study was to examine the psychometric properties of the Turkish version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) and to analyze the validity and reliability in children and adolescents. Method: The study sample consisted of 381 children aged 10-18 years. Cronbach's alpha internal consistency analysis was used to evaluate the scale's reliability, and the criterion validity was assessed with the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale- Child (RCADS-C) subscale scores. The construct validity of the scale was examined using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Results: The Cronbach's alpha internal consistency coefficient calculated to determine the scale's reliability was alpha=0.88. The corrected total item test correlation values of the items varied between 0.63 and 0.68. Exploratory factor analysis determined that the factor load of the scale items was 0.73-0.77 and that there was only one factor with an eigenvalue &gt;1.

"Treatment and comorbidities of patients with erectile dysfunction before and during COVID-19 in the United States: A real-world data analysis","Introduction Erectile dysfunction (ED) is usually a symptom of another medical condition. People with poor overall health are more likely to develop severe form of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and may have unwanted symptoms such as ED. COVID-19-related stress, anxiety, and depression can also impact sexual health and possibly lead to ED. There are various treatment options for patients with ED. However, real-world evidence of the impact of COVID-19 on the treatment and comorbidities of patients with ED is limited. Objectives To estimate the impact of COVID-19 on the treatment and comorbidities of patients with ED in the United States. Methods This retrospective real-world data (RWD) analysis used the IQVIA PharMetricsÂ® Plus claims database, which is a patient-Centric, closed claims database of fully adjudicated pharmacy, hospital and medical claims anonymized at the patient level, that captures the complete patient journey for all services billed to and covered by the patient's health plan. We compared the ED treatment and comorbidities in adult males aged 18+ years with ED in the same 3-month periods before (01March - 31May, 2019) and during (01March â€“ 31May, 2020) the COVID-19 pandemic. ED treatment included any ED-related claims, prescriptions of any and individual phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor (PDE5i) medications (avanafil, sildenafil, tadalafil and vardenafil). Results See the table below for number of patients having ED-related claims, having any and individual PDE5i prescriptions, number of patients with COVID-19 diagnosis, and percentage of patients with each of the top 10 comorbidities, in the 3-month periods before and during COVID-19. Conclusions RWD showed that ED-related claims significantly decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, reflecting the pandemic's impact on ED patientsâ€™ health. However, the use of PDE5i medications remained stable during the pandemic. Key comorbidities including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, benign prostatic hyperplasia with lower urinary tract symptoms, testicular hypofunction, and malignant neoplasm of the prostate, during the pandemic, compared with pre-pandemic period, highlighted the impact of the pandemic on ED patientsâ€™ health and need for managing their other comorbid chronic diseases.

"The Crisis of Aesthetics, Aesthetics of Crisis","The coronavirus pandemic and the crisis it has brought about has resulted in inaction on the part of the individual. Not only the current crisis, but also the crises of the last century caused a passivity that was also noticeable in the artist, as the content of the artistic creation is not directly related to the current crisis, but rather is used as an escape route. In times of crisis the creative process does not process the material that is available under the given circumstances, instead art represents a means of accepting life as it is. The definition of art as a form of comforting illusion became a central theme in Nietzscheâ€™s work towards the end of the 19th century as a result of crises. This essay deals with the question of whether the relevance of art for society will remain as long as it continues to function as a passive place of escape and cheer. In order to be able to examine this, the present study deals with Nietzscheâ€™s The birth of tragedy because the work includes Nietzscheâ€™s systematic reflections on aesthetics on which modern art is based. As a result, it was found that the current crisis could give rise to a crisis in  art that has been dominating the cultural milieu at the same time as pleading for inaction. In a new phase in which new concepts are being sought all over the world, it can hardly be expected that aesthetic principles will be preserved as they have prevailed for more than a hundred years.Alternate : Die Coronavirus-Pandemie und die dadurch herbeigefÃ¼hrte Krise hat ein Nicht-Handeln des Individuums mit sich gebracht. Nicht nur die jetzige Krise, sondern auch die Krisen des vorigen Jahrhunderts verursachten eine PassivitÃ¤t, die sich auch beim KÃ¼nstler bemerkbar machte. So wurde Kunst eher als ein Fluchtweg benutzt und der schÃ¶pferische Prozess verarbeitete nicht das Material, das ihm durch die gegebenen UmstÃ¤nde zur VerfÃ¼gung stand. Wenn auch unbewusst, reprÃ¤sentiert die Kunst in Krisenphasen ein Mittel, das Leben so hinzunehmen, wie es ist und jegliche Leiden zu akzeptieren. Die Definition von Kunst als eine trÃ¶stliche Illusion wurde gegen Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts infolge von Krisen zum zentralen Thema in Nietzsches Werk. Der vorliegende Aufsatz beschÃ¤ftigt sich mit der Frage danach, ob die Relevanz der Kunst fÃ¼r die Gesellschaft bestehen bleiben wird, solange sie sich damit begnÃ¼gt, als ein passiver Ort der Flucht und der Aufheiterung zu fungieren. Um der Frage zugrunde gehen zu kÃ¶nnen, befasst sich die vorliegende Untersuchung mit Nietzsches Werk Die Geburt der TragÃ¶die, da das Werk die systematisierten Betrachtungen Nietzsches zur Ã„sthetik beinhaltet, auf denen die moderne Kunst basiert. Infolgedessen wurde festgestellt, dass die aktuelle Krise zugleich eine Krise dieser seit Anfang der Moderne vorherrschenden abstrakten und das Nicht-Handeln beschÃ¶nigenden Kunstprinzipien hervorrufen kÃ¶nnte. In einer Phase, in der auf der ganzen Welt nach neuen Konzepten gesucht wird, ist es kaum zu erwarten, dass Ã¤sthetische Prinzipien so erhalten bleiben, wie sie nun seit mehr als hundert Jahren vorherrschen.","Bayir, Pinar AkkoÃ‡","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Crisis+of+Aesthetics,+Aesthetics+of+Crisis","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Alman Dili ve Edebiyati Dergisi; 2021(45):97-121, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31469,""
"Level of knowledge and awareness of university students about the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19);an assessment from Edirne Province","During the pandemic, stress is caused by the imbalance between the individual's perception and external environmental demands. Studies have shown that psychological stress is closely related to anxiety, depression, and physical conditions such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Students at universities face many stressors, including the volatile environment, lifestyle changes, academic burdens and interpersonal relationships, all of which can lead to significant psychological dysfunction. In particular, they are vulnerable to the stress that most university students in developing countries have to cope with, for themselves and their families, to fight the Covid-19 infection. The sample of this descriptive cross-sectional study consisted of 141 undergraduate health science students from Trakya University in the north west region of Turkey. The study was conducted April 2021 to July 2021. The sociodemographic characteristics of the university students were evaluated. Health sciences students, from the perspective of the Turkish cultural context;we identified the stress levels that have been elevated due to Covid-19. In addition, from the high perceived stress levels due to Covid-19, which is associated with anxiety and depression;We have seen that school success is negatively affected in university students.

"A Retrospective Case Study Report of the Projectification and Quick Wins during the COVID-19 Pandemic in the Governmental Healthcare Sector: Lessons Learned from Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia","Background The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the most challenging disasters healthcare institutions are facing, requiring healthcare systems to balance meeting general healthcare needs with those caused by the pandemic. Healthcare systems were not designed to deal with this crisis: an unpredictable, large-scale challenge that has required urgent resource mobilization, affecting whole populations. However, there has also been no time to debate systems' abilities to deal with the crisis, not least because the pandemic opposes the general direction of these systems. The urgent need for new fast-track, quick-win projects was necessary because we were time-constrained. We also needed an effective approach - which globally known project management tools could be efficiently applied? The widely accepted Project Management Institute (PMI) model and the popular Six Sigma Define, Measure, Analyze, Implement, Control (DMAIC) approach were two reasonable methodologies to select, so we aimed to modify these tools to achieve quick results. An initial needs assessment of the pandemic's challenges required careful consideration of our high-impact healthcare facilities' ability to meet those challenges. Our assessment concluded that ability was limited, and as Lean Six Sigma DMAIC principles are more effectively applicable to quality improvement initiatives, the combined application of DMAIC and PMI principles, which enable robust and stable project initiation, governance, enterprise engagement, and measurable quality deliverables, enabled us to focus on structured project management and quality outcomes. Methods This modified approach was applied to the 10 main Ministry of Health (MOH) hospitals and 2 specialized care centers in the Al-Ahsa region, to design and initiate 40 mini-projects that could yield quick wins. This study was designed to measure the value of applying these tools and learn lessons retrospectively. Results The successful ability to eliminate identified healthcare challenges within 5 weeks of launching the mini-projects, meeting an average of 74% of planned baseline targets.","Alsaqer, Adnan Ahmed, Abduljawad, Asaad Abdulrahman, Mustafa, Hatim Sid Ahmed Mohammed, Mohammad, Maha Salam","https://www.google.com/search?q=A+Retrospective+Case+Study+Report+of+the+Projectification+and+Quick+Wins+during+the+COVID-19+Pandemic+in+the+Governmental+Healthcare+Sector:+Lessons+Learned+from+Al-Ahsa,+Saudi+Arabia","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Saudi Journal of Health Systems Research;: 1-6, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31471,""
"Dreams and nightmares during the pandemic TrÃ¤ume und AlbtrÃ¤ume wÃ¤hrend der Pandemie","The pandemic caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had aÂ huge impact on public mental health. This was also reflected in dreams. Not only did people start to remember more dreams, but dream content changed as themes like sickness, confinement, andâ€”in the English-speaking worldâ€”even bugs began to dominate. This also led to an increase in nightmare frequency. There are various factors that contributed to this change in the dream landscape. Some people have started to sleep more and hereby spend more time in REM sleep, which is known to increase dream recall and further lead to bizarre and vivid dreams. On the other hand, stress and poor mental health had an impact on sleep, and sleep quality thus dropped in many individuals. Poor sleep quality can also lead to an increase in dream recall. Dreams are known to regulate mood, so the rise in dreams and the change in dream content could also reflect aÂ reaction to the overall rise in stress and decline in mental health. Recent studies have shown that as the pandemic progresses, further changes in mental health, dream recall, and dream content arise, but data are still scarce. Further research could help understand the impact the pandemic still has on mental health and dreams, and how this impact is changing over the course of the pandemic.","Ableidinger, Severin, Nierwetberg, Franziska, Holzinger, Brigitte","https://www.google.com/search?q=Dreams+and+nightmares+during+the+pandemic+TrÃ¤ume+und+AlbtrÃ¤ume+wÃ¤hrend+der+Pandemie","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Somnologie;: 1-5, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31472,""

Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate anxiety, depression, and their causes among nurses with COVID-19 infection in different wards of a hospital. Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out between February 1st to October 30th, 2020, among all nurses with COVID-19 infection in different wards of Imam Khomeini Hospital (university hospital), Tehran, Iran. The nurses were contacted by phone, and data were collected using a self-administered, valid, structured questionnaire consisting of sociodemographic characteristics and clinical symptoms. Psychological complications, including anxiety and depression levels, were assessed and their association with other sociodemographic variables was also evaluated. Results: A total of 158 nurses were entered into the study, out of which 112 (70.2%) cases were females. Among all participants, 72.8% and 42.4% of the subjects reported anxiety and depression, respectively. The frequency of moderate to severe anxiety was significantly greater in women than in men (P&lt;0.001). The infected nurses who worked in low-risk departments experienced a greater proportion of moderate to severe depression (P=0.004). In addition, the most prevalent reason for anxiety and depression was found to be the fear of infecting family members. Conclusion: Nurses bear a significant psychological burden during the COVID-19 pandemic, markedly when they get infected and experience clinical symptoms. Therefore, the government and other staff should provide some facilities and supportive administrative work for reducing anxiety and depression and improving nurses' psychological health.","Behnoush, A.

"PREGNANCY IN TIMES OF PANDEMIC: A LOOK AT MENTAL HEALTH BEFORE AND DURING THE PANDEMIC","Introduction: Pregnancy is a stage of physiological, psychological, personal, and social changes for women. The role of the emotional and psychological aspect covers the entire period because as fetal development progresses, the mother-baby relationship is strengthened, making the mother vulnerable. Objectives: Collect, describe and analyze relevant information on mental health in pregnant women, both at different stages of pregnancy and before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A literature search was carried out through PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scielo using terminology compiled from MeSH and DeCs. Results: Pregnancy due to hormonal changes causes the presence of anxiety and feelings of depression that worsen as the stages of fetal development progress. These psychological disorders have greatly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic due to various reasons such as the relationship with a partner, uncertainty, fear, anguish, and growing phobia of contagion. Conclusion: Pregnant women are a vulnerable population whose mental health has always been affected and more than ever due to the pandemic, so they need better care in the health sector, such as providing reliable information on preventive measures to alleviate the burden of stressors, as they bear the burden of their health distress and that of the fetus.","Cisneros Hilario, C.

"Investigation of Anxiety and Depression in the Parents of Children Receiving Special Education for Speech and Language Therapy during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Objective To investigate the effects of possible disruptions in education and follow-up on anxiety and depression in parents of children receiving special education support for speech and language therapy. Materials and Methods A total of 111 parents whose children required special education due to speech and/or language impairments took part in the study. After obtaining the history of children receiving speech and language therapy that was interrupted due to the pandemic and the demographic information of the parents who filled out the questionnaire, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory was used to determine the parents' anxiety level and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale was used to determine their depression level. Results Due to COVID-19, 63.1 percent of the participants were unable to access special education for more than two months. While 62.2 percent of parents who completed the questionnaires did not feel hopeless or pessimistic about their children's future, 16.2 percent did. The parents who filled out the forms had high trait anxiety and medium-high state anxiety, according to their State Trait Anxiety scores. There was a positive statistically significant relationship between state anxiety and trait anxiety. Conclusion The anxiety levels of the parents were already high due to the situation of their children, and the interruption of education may have added to their anxiety.","Atalik, G.; Tirank, S.

"Child and Adolescent Forensic Psychiatry Experiences During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Objective: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) changed the status-quo in psychiatric interview with the advent of telemental health practices, save for a select group of patients;forensic psychiatric interviews among them. The present study aimed to identify the predictors of completing forensic psychiatric evaluations mandated by the judicial authorities in the hospital setting during the COVID-19 outbreak. Method: Twenty-six patients who had completed an initial forensic psychiatric assessment and were required to complete a child and adolescent forensic psychiatry board interview during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic were recruited. Their records were retrospectively examined, sociodemographic data, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Screen For Child Anxiety Related Disorders (SCARED), and Wecshler Intelligence Scale for Children-revised scores were recorded and analyzed. Results: Statistical analysis revealed an association between conduct disorder and concomitant substance use with missed appointments, and maternal employment and completed interviews. BDI and SCARED total scores showed no difference between the patients who missed or completed their mandatory forensic psychiatry board assessment. BDI individual items of loss of pleasure (item 4), suicidality (item 9), and loss of interest (item 12) were associated with missed appointments. Conclusion: The results of this study support the established relationship between conduct problems and depressive symptoms, and this demographic group may be among the most affected by the limitation of access to mental health services during the COVID-19 pandemic, as they are already less likely to seek help overall.","Pilan, B.

"Neurocysticercosis, Epilepsy, COVID-19 and a Novel Hypothesis: Cases Series and Systematic Review","Background: There have been many patients with neurological manifestations reported in medical literature following a COVID-19 infection. We conducted a literature review to identify patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) who presented with Neurocysticercosis (NCC) and associated seizure disorders/ epilepsy. Currently, there is a new variant of the COVID-19 virus strain invading South Africa and no indication when this pandemic will end and what kind of tardive sequelae may occur going forward. Case: We searched the medical literature looking for all publications regarding NCC, Status Epilepticus (SE), Epileptic Seizures (ES), and Epilepsy (Ep), in patients infected by COVID-19. Based on the therapeutic response of our series, we propose a novel approach for patients presenting NCC, epilepsy and associated with COVID-19. We have hypothesized on the pathogenesis of ES and SE from the NCC/Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS), SARS-CoV-2/CRS, including the role played by gut microbiota from the enteric nervous system (gut hormones, gut metabolites, inflammatory factors, neuroactive substances, and microbiota-derived products) to the medulla oblongata/hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis via microbiota gut brain axis in ES, Ep and associated depression, plus the mechanism of hyperferritinemia on the overall process.

"Can families help veterans get more from PTSD treatment? A randomized clinical trial examining Prolonged Exposure with and without family involvement","Background: Posttraumatic stress disorder occurs in as many as one in five combat veterans and is associated with a host of negative, long-term consequences to the individual, their families, and society at large. Trauma-focused treatments, such as Prolonged Exposure, result in clinically significant symptom relief for many. Adherence to these treatments (i.e., session attendance and homework compliance) is vital to ensuring recovery but can be challenging for patients. Engaging families in veteransâ€™ treatment could prove to be an effective strategy for promoting treatment adherence while also addressing long-standing calls for better family inclusion in treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder. This paper describes the methods of a pragmatic randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate if family inclusion in Prolonged Exposure can improve treatment adherence. Methods: One hundred fifty-six veterans, with clinically significant symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, will be randomized to receive either standard Prolonged Exposure or Prolonged Exposure enhanced through family inclusion (Family-Supported Prolonged Exposure) across three different VA facilities. Our primary outcomes are session attendance and homework compliance. Secondary outcomes include posttraumatic stress disorder symptom severity, depression, quality of life, and relationship functioning. The study includes a concurrent process evaluation to identify potential implementation facilitators and barriers to family involvement in Prolonged Exposure within VA. Discussion: While the importance of family involvement in posttraumatic stress disorder treatment is non-controversial, there is no evidence base supporting best practices on how to integrate families into PE or any other individually focused trauma-focused treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder. This study is an important step in addressing this gap, contributing to the literature for both retention and family involvement in trauma-focused treatments.

"The effects of COVID-19 on poisonings in the paediatric emergency department","Objectives The purpose of this study is to describe the impact of the pandemic on poisoning in children under 18 years presenting to a tertiary care paediatric emergency department (ED) in Canada. Methods We utilized the Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program (CHIRPP) surveillance data to identify children presenting to the Hospital for Sick Children for poisonings during two time periods: pre-pandemic (March 11 to December 31, 2018 and 2019) and pandemic (March 11 to December 31, 2020). Primary outcomes investigated the change in proportion for total poisonings, unintentional poisonings, recreational drug use, and intentional self-harm exposures over total ED visits. Secondarily, we examined the change in proportion of poisonings between age, sex, substance type, and admission requirement pre-pandemic versus during pandemic. Results The proportions significantly increased for total poisonings (122.5%), unintentional poisonings (127.8%), recreational drug use (160%), and intentional self-harm poisonings (104.2%) over total ED visits. The proportions over all poisoning cases also significantly increased for cannabis (44.3%), vaping (134.6%), other recreational drugs (54.5%), multi-substance use (29.3%), and admissions due to poisonings (44.3%) during the pandemic. Conclusion Despite an overall decrease in ED visits, there was a significant increase in poisoning presentations to our ED during the pandemic compared with pre-pandemic years. Our results will provide better insight into care delivery and public health interventions for paediatric poisonings.","Zhang, E. W.

"Crossing the digital divide: a veteran affairs program to distribute video-enabled devices to patients in a supportive housing program","Objective Evaluate an initiative to distribute video-enabled tablets and cell phones to individuals enrolled in Veterans Health Affairs supportive housing program during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods In September 2020, individuals in the Veteran Health Affairs (VA) Housing and Urban Development-VA Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) program were offered either a video-enabled tablet or cellphone to support their communication and health care engagement needs. We examined sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of device recipients, and compared engagement in in-person, telephone, and video-based visits (categorized as primary care, specialty care, rehabilitation, HUD-VASH, mental health care, and other) for 6 months prior to (March 1, 2020-August 31, 2020) and following (September 1, 2020-July 30, 2021) device receipt. Results In total, 5127 Veterans received either a tablet (n = 4454) or a cellphone (n = 673). Compared to the 6 months prior to device receipt, in the 6 months following receipt, in-person and video engagement increased by an average of 1.4 visits (8%) and 3.4 visits (125%), respectively, while telephone engagement decreased (-5.2 visits;-27%). Both tablet and cellphone recipients had increased in-person visits (+1.3 visits [8%] and +2.1 visits [13%], respectively);while tablet users had a substantially larger increase in video-based engagement (+3.2 visits [+110%] vs. +0.9 [+64%]). Similar trends were noted across all assessed types of care. Discussion Providing video-enabled devices to Veterans in a supportive housing program may facilitate engagement in health care. Conclusions and Relevance VA's device distribution program offers a model for expanding access to health-related technology and telemedicine to individuals in supportive housing programs. Lay Summary In September of 2020, the Veteran's Health Affairs (VA) initiated a program to distribute video-enabled tablets and cellphones to Veterans who were enrolled in the Housing and Urban Development-VA Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) program. The goal of this program was to maintain communication and health care engagement during the pandemic. After receiving either a tablet or cellphone, we compared in-person, telephone, and video-based engagement among the 4454 tablet recipients and the 673 cellphone recipients. We found in the 6 months following receipt, that overall in-person and video engagement increased by an average of 1.4 visits (8%) and 3.4 visits (125%), while telephone engagement decreased (-5.2 visits;-27%). Both tablet and cellphone recipients had increased in-person visits (+1.3 visits [8%] and +2.1 visits [13%], respectively);while tablet users had a substantially larger increase in video-based engagement (+3.2 visits [+110%] vs. +0.9 [+64%]).

"First-Year College Students' Adjustment During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Protective Roles of Hope and Gratitude","Worsened by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, first-year college students face unique academic and social stressors during the transitional period from high school to college. The present study examined the role of psychological resources (i.e., hope, gratitude, and COVID-19 protective self-efficacy) in mitigating the negative psychological impact of the pandemic. Four hundred seventy-six first-year college students (M-age = 17.97, SD = .59;70.8% female) from a large private university in New York completed two online surveys during the first and seventh week of the Fall 2020 academic semester, respectively. We found that gratitude, hope, and COVID-19 protective self-efficacy were associated with improved psychological well-being over time. Our findings suggest that hope mitigated the detrimental consequences of those with low levels of COVID-19 protective self-efficacy. Specifically, first-year college students with low levels of COVID-19 protective self-efficacy and low levels of hope experienced greater loneliness over time. In contrast, we found that gratitude enhanced the benefits of having high levels of COVID-19 protective self-efficacy. Among those with high levels of gratitude, COVID-19 protective self-efficacy was associated with lower depressive symptoms over time, but this relationship was not significant among those with low levels of gratitude. Hope mitigated the detrimental consequences of those with low levels of COVID-19 protective self-efficacy, while gratitude enhanced the ameliorative effects of those with high levels of COVID-19 protective self-efficacy. One limitation of the present study is the generalizability of the sample to first-year college students from other educational settings and geographic regions. Implications for college students and university administrators are discussed.","Ang, J. Y.

"COVID-19 Racial Discrimination on Mental Health and Life Satisfaction Among Asian Americans: Examining a Moderated Mediation Model","What is the public significance of this article? This study suggests that greater use of coping may be helpful for reducing the harmful effect of racial discrimination on mental health of AAPIs. Additionally, it highlights that a strong sense of ethnic identity may reduce the impact of depression on life satisfaction but worsen the impact of anxiety on life satisfaction. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has contributed to higher rates of racial discrimination and xenophobia toward Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs). The present study examined a moderated mediation model with a national sample of AAPI individuals (N = 725) to determine how experiences of COVID-19 related racial discrimination impacted scores of depression, anxiety, and life satisfaction. Results indicated that experiences of COVID-19 related racial discrimination significantly and negatively impacted life satisfaction among AAPI participants via increased levels of depression and anxiety. Findings also indicated that coping strategies attenuated the link between discrimination and anxiety and discrimination and depression. High levels of ethnic identity exploration exacerbated the association between anxiety and life satisfaction but attenuated the relationship between depression and life satisfaction. Implications for mental health clinicians, educators, and researchers are provided.","Oh, S.; Litam, S. D.

"Ethnic-Racial Discrimination Towards Asian Americans Amidst COVID-19, the So-Called ""China"" Virus and Associations With Mental Health","What is the public significance of this article? Consistent with reports a rise in anti-Asian hate crimes driven by COVID-19, East and Southeast Asian Americans in our study report more discrimination during the pandemic compared to before the pandemic, and these experiences contribute to anxiety and depression. These findings may help raise awareness of Asian American experiences during the pandemic and inform antiracism education in the broader U.S. society. Because Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) first emerged in China, anti-Asian rhetoric has led to significant hate crimes toward Asian Americans. Focusing primarily on East and Southeast Asian Americans in the majority-White Midwest, the present study addressed two research questions: (a) Are the frequency or type of incidents of ethnic-racial discrimination (ERD) among East and Southeast Asian Americans different during COVID-19 than those experienced prior to COVID-19? and (b) To what extent is ethnic identity a protective factor in the face of ERD? A sample of 380 (44% women, M-age = 39.39 and SD = 3.24) East and Southeast Asian American adults recruited through Facebook groups of the Ohioan Asian American community responded to an online survey about ethnic identity, direct and indirect ERD-both currently and retrospectively about experiences before the pandemic-and rated their current depression and anxiety symptoms. Repeated measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) indicate higher reports of both direct and indirect ERD during the pandemic compared to the time prior to the pandemic. Both direct and indirect ERD during the pandemic were associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression. Further, results indicated that ethnic identity moderated some of these associations, though in an unexpected direction: At higher levels of ethnic identity, the effect of ERD on anxiety was stronger than at lower levels of ethnic identity. The findings are discussed in the context of anti-Asian rhetoric during the pandemic, with important implications for the mental health of Asian Americans.","Huynh, V. W.; Raval, V.

"Subjective dignity and self-reported health: Results from the United States before and during the Covid-19 pandemic","Aims To describe disparities in depressive symptoms and self-rated health with a novel, individual-level measure of subjective dignity administered before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods National survey data were collected across the United States by the Gallup Organization in Spring (2017) (nÂ =Â 1459) and again in Spring (2021) (nÂ =Â 1244). Subjective dignity is measured by self-reported perceptions of dignity in oneâ€™s own life. Numerous demographic subgroups constructed across age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, income, urbanicity, labor force status, and political background are used to test for robustness of dignity-health associations within and across years. Results All demographic subgroups studied reported numeric decreases in dignity from 2017 to 2021, with many of these decreases being both large and significant. With few group-year exceptions, subjective dignity relates to lower levels of depression and higher self-rated health, with dignity-depression associations significantly increasing from 2017 to 2021. Conclusions Dignity, as a pluralistic moral concept, is purported to anchor legal, human rights, and cultural discourses on justice, equity, and social inclusion. This study provides timely, original evidence that subjective appraisals of dignity should be considered as a public health indicator, especially across periods of societal unrest or adversity. Given groupwise robustness of dignity-health associations as documented here, subgroup determinants and lay definitions of dignity may merit closer attention.","Andersson, Matthew A.; Hitlin, Steven","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmmh.2022.100113","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: SSM - Mental Health;: 100113, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31497,""
"Status of yoga and mental health among Brazilian practitioners during COVID-19: An internet-based cross-sectional survey","This study aimed to describe yoga practice and verify its association with depression, anxiety, and stress during the COVID-19 pandemic among Brazilian practitioners. A cross-sectional anonymous online survey was conducted in all regions of Brazil using a snowball sampling strategy among yoga practitioners. A total of 860 participants (87% female, aged: 19â€“82 years) completed the survey. Sociodemographic data, lifestyle factors, yoga practice during the pandemic, and the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) scores were collected between July 9 and July 15, 2021. Overall, 9.5%, 9.3%, and 5.6% of participants exhibited some traits (mild to severe) of depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively. Hatha yoga (48%) was the most commonly practiced yoga style. In the adjusted analysis, a higher yoga experience (&gt;5 years) was associated with better anxiety (odds ratio;bootstrap 95% confidence interval: 2.42;1.32, 4.49) and stress status (1.80;1.06, 3.00) than beginners (&lt;1 year). Practitioners who reported higher time and days of yoga practice during the study period were more likely to show normal levels of depression (odds ratio: 2.56â€“6.49;pÂ &lt;Â 0.05), anxiety (odds ratio: 3.68â€“8.84;pÂ &lt;Â 0.05), and stress (odds ratio: 2.15â€“5.21;pÂ &lt;Â 0.05). Moreover, the maintenance of practice frequency during the pandemic was associated with higher odds of normal levels of depression (2.27;1.39â€“3.79), anxiety (1.97;1.25â€“3.10), and stress (1.97;1.32â€“2.96). In conclusion, our findings indicated that a higher level of yoga practice was associated with better mental health levels during the COVID-19 pandemic.","dos Santos, Giovanna M.; Verlengia, Rozangela, Ribeiro, Anna G.

"Treatment retention, return to use, and recovery support following COVID-19 relaxation of methadone take-home dosing in two rural opioid treatment programs: A mixed methods analysis","Objectives In March 2020, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration permitted Opioid Treatment Programs (OTPs) to relax restrictions on take-home methadone and promoted telehealth to minimize potential exposures to COVID-19. We assessed the effects of COVID-19-related changes on take-home methadone dosing in two OTPs serving five rural Oregon counties. Methods We used a mixed-methods convergent design. The OTPs extracted urine drug test (UDT) results, take-home methadone regimens, and treatment retention from the electronic health record (EHR) for patients (nÂ =Â 377). A mixed-effects negative binomial regression model assessed patient-level differences in take-home doses before and after the COVID-19 policy changes and the associations with treatment discontinuation, and UDT positivity. Semi-structured qualitative interviews (nÂ =Â 32) explored patient reactions to increased take-home dosing and reduced clinic visits to provide context for quantitative findings. Results The number of take-home doses increased in the post-COVID-19 period for patients engaged in treatment for more than 180Â days (median: 8 vs 13 take-home doses per month, pÂ =Â 0.011). Take-homes did not increase for patients with fewer days of treatment. Each percentage point increase in take-home dosing above what would be expected without COVID-19 policy changes was negatively associated with the percent of UDT positive for opioids (BÂ =Â -0.12, CI [-0.21, -0.04], pÂ =Â 0.005) and the probability of treatment discontinuation (aORÂ =Â 0.97, CI [0.95, 0.99], pÂ =Â 0.003). Qualitative analysis revealed three themes explaining how increased take-home dosing supported recovery: 1) value of feeling trusted with increased responsibility;2) reduced travel time permitted increased employment and recreation;and 3) reduced exposure to individuals less stable in recovery and potential triggers. Conclusions Take-home methadone dose relaxations were associated with increased methadone take-home doses, improved retention, and decreased UDT opioid positive results among clinically stable patients. Qualitative findings suggest that fewer take-home restrictions are feasible and desirable and do not pose safety or public health harms.","Hoffman, Kim A.; Foot, Canyon, Levander, Ximena A.; Cook, Ryan, Terashima, Javier Ponce, McIlveen, John W.; Korthuis, P.

"Positive Outcomes in a Virtual Partial Hospitalization Program","Background Partial hospitalization programs (PHP) are intensive outpatient mental health programs. During the COVID-19 pandemic, our PHP was converted from an in-person service to a completely virtual telehealth service. We compared the outcomes of care between these two versions of our PHP. Methods In the live version of the program, care was provided to patients aged 18 to 65 years in person, five days a week, with five groups per day and additional services, such as family work. In the telehealth version, we attempted to provide the same services by HIPAA secure video conferencing and telephone, after educating staff and patients. We compared the attendance at clinic, the hospitalization rate, and patient satisfaction with care between the two program versions in the 12 months prior to and after the transition to virtual care. Results There were 4,821 patient visits in the in-person program, and 4,371 in the telehealth program. Compared to the in-person program, the telehealth program was associated with a higher attendance (84.5% vs. 89.5%, pÂ =Â 0.0168), a lower hospitalization rate (16.5 vs. 8.9%, pÂ =Â 0.02), without a difference in the patient satisfaction rate, and with 74.3% of patients reporting improvement in their condition. Conclusions A PHP completely delivered via telehealth was feasible to implement, and some outcomes with such a program were superior to those of a live PHP. Because this was a non-experimental study, factors other than the method of service provision may have been responsible for the observed results.","Vlavianos, Theodore, McCarthy, Marguerite","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcjq.2022.04.007","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: The Joint Commission Journal on Quality and Patient Safety;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31500,""
"Aversion liquid-filled drug releasing capsule (3D-RECAL): A novel technology for the development of immediate release abuse deterrent formulations using a fused deposition modelling (FDM) 3D printer","COVID19 has caused a significant socioeconomic burden worldwide. Opioid crisis was further intensified with the increasing number of opioid overdose/misuse related deaths in last two years. Abusers have adopted newer/efficient methods for manipulating and abusing commercial opioid formulations. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been strategizing tirelessly to prevent misuse/abuse of prescription opioids. One of the strategies is to develop an abuse deterrent formulation (ADF). The current study aims to develop a novel 3D printed drug-releasing capsule shell filled with an aversion liquid (3D-RECAL). Primarily, metformin hydrochloride (MT, model drug) loaded printable filaments of polyvinyl alcohol was prepared using hot melt extrusion. Following extrusion, a 3D printed capsule shell was designed and fabricated using a single nozzle fuse deposition modelling 3D printer. An aversion liquid to be filled in 3D-RECAL capsules was prepared by combining sudan black and sodium polyacrylamide starch in oil base. Mechanical analysis of extruded filaments suggested that the filaments with 20%w/w MT had a higher mechanical strength compared to other drug loadings. Instantaneous gelling and large black non-snortable particles were formed during solvent extraction and physical manipulation studies, respectively. Due to the drug being embedded in the capsule shell, MT release was immediately started with &gt;85% of MT release within 45 mins in 0.1N HCl. Due to the everlasting need for the newer efficient ADF technologies, 3D-RECAL can be a step in the right direction towards saving lives, providing safe and effective measures to deterring abusers.","Palekar, Siddhant, Kumar Nukala, Pavan, Patel, Ketan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2022.121804","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Pharmaceutics;: 121804, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31501,""
"Factors Associated with the Mental Health Status of Isolated COVID-19 Patients in Korea","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has a substantial impact on the physical and mental health status of patients with COVID-19. This studyâ€™s objective was to evaluate the factors associated with mental health in patients isolated with COVID-19. Methods It is a retrospective, cross-sectional study. One hundred and two patients discharged from COVID-19 hospitalization in Korea were analyzed. The primary outcome was the correlation between psychological problems such as anxiety, depression, and fear of stigma and physical symptoms such as respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, headache, and fever. Mental and physical symptoms were ascertained using closed and multiple-choice questions. The secondary outcome was the correlation between mental issues, demographic factors, and disease severity. Hypoxia and the need for oxygen therapy, a need for remdesivir antiviral treatment, and indications of pneumonia progression on chest x-ray were confirmed through a review of medical records and used to measure disease severity. Results Patients with COVID-19 indicated feelings of depression (48.1%), anxiety (49.1%), and fear of stigma (60.45%), and some continued to experience physical symptoms even after discharge. Logistic regression revealed that gastrointestinal symptoms positively correlated with depression (p&lt;.05) and headache positively correlated with fear of stigma (p&lt;.05), while the other factors were not statistically significant (p&gt;.05). Conclusions This study showed that psychological symptoms persisted even after discharge. Gastrointestinal symptoms and headache were influential factors in predicting depression and fear of stigma. Based on this, dedicated COVID-19 hospitals should provide mental health support and preventive management.","Jung, Jae-Hyu, Bae, Eun Young, Ko, Jin Young","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idh.2022.04.003","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Infection, Disease & Health;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31502,""
"Efficacy of add-on Ayurveda and Yoga intervention in health care workers of tertiary care hospital during COVID-19: Randomized controlled trial","Background The present study aimed to evaluate the safety and prophylactic efficacy of add-on Comprehensive Ayurveda and Mindfulness-based Yoga (CAY) regimen to standard care among Healthcare workers (HCWs) against COVID-19. Materials and methods This prospective single-blind (outcome assessor-blinded) RCT was conducted in tertiary care hospital in Delhi during November 2020â€“January 2021. HCWs of both sexes were randomized to add-on CAY intervention or control group. The primary outcomes were the incidence of confirmed COVID-19 positive cases and influenza-like illness events (ILI). Secondary outcomes were anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9), and quality of Life (SF-36) at the end of 12 weeks. Results Three hundred fifty-six participants (181 in intervention and 175 in the control group) were randomized. With the modified intention to treat approach, we analyzed 309 participants. The mean age for the intervention and control groups was 39.3Â Â±Â 10.1 and 36.6Â Â±Â 10 years, respectively. Incidence of COVID-19 events was higher in control group compared to CAY group (16 of 164 [9.8%] vs. 11 of 145 [7.6%];P = 0.50). The incidence of ILI events was also higher in the control group as compared to the CAY group (14 of 164 [8.5%] vs 9 of 145 [6.2%]). The health change domain of the SF-36 questionnaire showed statistically significant improvement in the CAY group as compared to the control group (PÂ &lt;Â 0.01).

"Psychological responses of medical staff during COVID-19 and the adjustment effect of brief mindfulness meditation","Background COVID-19 has posed an unprecedented threat to public health and remains a critical challenge for medical staff, especially those who have been fighting against the virus in Wuhan, China. Limited data have been reported regarding the psychological status of these medical staff members. Therefore, we conducted this study to explore the mental health status of medical staff and the efficacy of brief mindfulness meditation (BMM) in improving their mental health. Methods A survey was conducted between April 18 and May 3, 2020. Upon completing the pre-test, participants in the treatment group received a 15-min BMM intervention every day at 8 p.m. Post-test questionnaires were completed after 16 days of therapy. The questionnaire comprised demographic data and psychological measurement scales. The levels of pre and post-test depression, anxiety, stress, and insomnia were assessed using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, Perceived Stress Scale, and Athens Insomnia Scale, respectively. Results A total of 134 completed questionnaires were received. Of the medical staff, 6.7%, 1.5%, and 26.7% reported symptoms of depression, anxiety, and insomnia, respectively. Public officials from military hospitals reported experiencing greater pressure than private officials (tÂ =Â 2.39, pÂ =Â 0.018, dÂ =Â 0.50). Additionally, BMM treatment appeared to effectively alleviate insomnia (tÂ =Â 2.27, pÂ =Â 0.027, dÂ =Â 0.28).

"Suicidal behavior in new patients presenting to the Telepsychiatry services in a Tertiary Care Center: An exploratory Study","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has led to expansion of telepsychiatry services and formulation of telemedicine guidelines. However, the telemedicine guidelines are not very clear about psychiatric emergencies, such as suicidal behaviour, resulting in psychiatrists facing dilemma about handling such situations. Aim To evaluate the prevalence of suicidal behaviour in new patients presenting to the Telepsychiatry services in a Tertiary Care centre. Methods 1065 new adult patients (aged &gt;18 years) registered with telepsychiatry services were assessed for suicidal behaviour, in the form of death wishes, suicidal ideations, plans, attempts (lifetime/recent) and non-suicidal self-injurious behaviour (NSSI) (lifetime/recent). Results In terms of suicidal behaviour, in the last few weeks prior to assessment 14.4% of the patients had death wishes, 2.4% had thoughts of killing themselves, 0.9% had attempted suicide in the lifetime and 0.6% in the last few weeks, 1.1% had active suicidal ideations at the time of assessment, 0.6% had active suicidal plan, 1.3% had history of NSSI in the lifetime and 0.5% had NSSI behaviour in the last few weeks. Based on the current suicidal behaviour, 1.3% of the patients were asked to report to the emergency immediately, 0.5% were given an appointment within 72hours for follow-up, and 14.4% were explained high risk management. Conclusions Overall prevalence of suicidal behavior is relatively low in new patients seeking psychiatric help through telepsychiatry services.","Grover, Sandeep, Rai, Bhavika, Chakravarty, Rahul, Sahoo, Swapnajeet, Mehra, Aseem, Chakrabarti, Subho, Basu, Debasish","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2022.103152","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Asian Journal of Psychiatry;: 103152, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31505,""

"ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE PRESENCE OF STRESS, DEPRESSION AND/OR SUICIDAL IDEATION AND ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE IN PERUVIAN MEDICAL STUDENTS AMID THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC","Introduction: Mental health is a priority public health problem, with medical students being a group susceptible of suffering from mental disorders. Objective: To determine the association between, on the one hand, the presence of depression, stress and/or suicidal ideation and, on the other, the academic performance of medical students from a Peruvian university in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and methods: Cross-sectional, analytical and prospective study carried out in 241 students from 1st to 6th year of medicine. Data collection was carried out between March and May 2021. The presence and levels of stress, depression and risk of suicidal ideation were determined using the Perceived Stress Scale-14 (EEP-14), the Zung Scale for Depression (EZ-D) and the Beck Suicidal Ideation Scale (ISB), respectively;on the other hand, academic performance was evaluated with the Reyes Murillo learning assessment scale. A bivariate analysis was performed using the chi square test (significance level of p&lt;0.05) to establish the association between the study variables. Results: Most of the students had an average academic performance (70.12%). The prevalence of depression, stress, and suicidal ideation was 33.61%, 94.19%, and 88.79%, respectively. Academic performance was significantly associated with the presence of depression (p=0.018), but not with the presence of stress (p=0.669), or risk of suicidal ideation (p=0.438). Conclusions: Only depression was significantly associated with academic performance, although its prevalence was much lower than stress or suicidal ideation, so it is necessary for the university to implement strategies aimed at improving the mental health of this population;this will not only improve its quality of life, but also its academic performance.","Baquerizo-Quispe, N.

"Association between home working and mental health by key worker status during the Covid-19 pandemic Evidence from four British longitudinal studies","Little is known about the relationship between homeworking and mental health during the Covid-19 pandemic and how it might differ by keyworker status. To understand this relationship, we use longitudinal data collected over three time points during the pandemic from three British cohort studies born in 1958 (National Child Development Study), 1970 (British Cohort Study) and 1989-90 (Next Step) as well as from a population-based study stratified by four age groups (Understanding Society). We estimate the association between life satisfaction, anxiety, depression, and psychological distress and homeworking by key worker status using mixed effects models with maximum likelihood estimation to account for repeated measurements across the pandemic, allowing intercepts to vary across individuals after controlling for a set of covariates including pre-pandemic home working propensities and loneliness. Results show that key workers working from home showed the greatest decline in mental health outcomes relative to other groups. Pre-pandemic homeworking did not significantly change the nature of such a relationship and loneliness slightly attenuated some of the effects. Finally, mental health outcomes varied across age-groups and time points. The discussion emphasises the need to pay attention to key workers when assessing the relationship between mental health and homeworking.","Wielgoszewska, Booth, Green, Hamilton, Wels","https://doi.org/10.2486/indhealth.2022-0081","20220518","Employment; Essential worker; Home working; Key worker; Mental health; Wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31509,""

Cross-sectional study consisting in a telephone interview 3 months after hospital discharge. This study was conducted during the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic by the Local Health Authority of Reggio Emilia (Italy). Adult individuals discharged from hospital between April and June 2020 after COVID-19. hospitalisation for reasons other than COVID-19, inability to participate in the study, concomitant acute or chronic conditions causing disability. We assessed: dyspnoea (Medical Research Council), fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale), mood disturbances (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), limitations in activity (Barthel Index) and participation restrictions (Reintegration to Normal Living Index). We also collected data on sociodemographic characteristics, health status prior to COVID-19, COVID-related clinical manifestations and hospital care pathway up to discharge, rehabilitation interventions, accidental falls and emergency room access. 149 participants (men, 62%; average age 62 (Ã‚Â±11) years) were enrolled, 35 of which (23%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) while hospitalised. Three months after hospital discharge, nearly half of the participants still suffered from dyspnoea (44%) or fatigue (39%). Almost all individuals (91.2%) recovered a good level of independence in activity of daily living, but 76% still suffered participation restrictions. Female sex was significantly associated with worse outcomes for all symptoms. Individuals who had moderate or severe COVID-19 may perceive persistent symptoms which may result in reduced social participation.

"Relationship between perceived stress and depression in Chinese front-line medical staff during COVID-19: A conditional process model","Sustained stress during COVID-19 may be associated with depression in front-line medical staff, which would expose them to severe threats. This study aimed to examine whether the relationship between perceived stress and depression is mediated by insomnia, and whether this mediation is moderated by resilience. For front-line medical staff, this study used online questionnaire to evaluate their perceived stress, depression, insomnia and resilience. A conditional process model was performed to examine the relationship between perceived stress and depression, as well as the mediating effect of insomnia and the moderating effect of resilience. A total of 606 front-line medical staff completed the survey. Higher level of perceived stress was significantly positively related to severe insomnia and depression. In addition, insomnia was positively related to depression, while resilience could moderate the effect of perceived stress on depression by direct and indirect paths. The causality among perceived stress, depression, insomnia and resilience is difficult to be verified. Perceived stress is positively related to depression, and insomnia can mediate the effect of perceived stress on depression. In addition, the effect of perceived stress on depression, whether direct or indirect, is moderated by resilience, which is a protective factor for mental health.","Li, Liang, Yuan, Li, Wang, Huang, Zeng, Yang, Zhou, Li, Su, Zhou","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.05.064","20220518","COVID-19; Depression; Front-line medical staff; Insomnia; Perceived stress; Resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31511,""

"Continuation of teletherapy post COVID-19: Survey data from licensed mental health professionals","The use of teletherapy has exponentially increased in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Studies on teletherapy have documented substantial benefits of accessibility and convenience even before the start of the pandemic. While recent studies show that this modality of therapy delivery is here to stay, few, have studied who will most benefit from this trend. In this short paper, we report predictors of continued teletherapy usage in a sample of licensed mental health professionals in the United States during a time period when pandemic-related restrictions began diminishing. As such it is one of the first studies to examine factors related to continued benefits of teletherapy post-pandemic. Participation from licensed mental health professionals was sought on listservs of national organizations of multiple mental health organizations. Data were collected via an anonymous link to a survey on Qualtrics between January 2021 to April 2021. Participants responded to questions on therapist demographics, practice setting, experiences of shifting to teletherapy, perspectives on continued use of teletherapy, and their client characteristics. Findings related to client characteristics that predicted continued teletherapy usage are presented here. A total of 186 consented to participate in the survey, with a final sample of 114 with complete data. A majority of participants identified as female (92/114, 80.7%), White (94/114, 82.5 %), having a master's degree (75/114, 65.5%) from a nationally accredited program (106/114, 93%). Data were analyzed using heteroskedastic regression modeling with client related factors as predictors. Two models were run with and without distance travelled by clients as a control variable. Model estimates from both models showed that continued use of teletherapy post-pandemic were predicted by the following factors: higher percentage of clients from rural areas, younger and elderly clients, clients with Medicare, and clients with marginalized gender and religious/spiritual identities. Significantly, having a higher percentage of clients from lower socioeconomic status, those with Medicaid coverage, and a higher percentage of couple and families as clients predicted decreased use of teletherapy post-pandemic. Findings from the study suggest that while some groups of clients are more likely to continue to receive benefits of teletherapy, vulnerable groups such as those in lower socioeconomic conditions, Medicaid beneficiaries, and those who seek couple and family therapy may be less likely to be served by it. These differences point to a need to address factors driving telehealth care disparities such as access to technology, housing, and childcare issues, as well as need for continued training licensed professionals.","Gangamma, Walia, Luke, Lucena","https://doi.org/10.2196/32419","20220518","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31513,""
"Relationship between the Bolsa FamÃƒÂ­lia national cash transfer programme and suicide incidence in Brazil: A quasi-experimental study","Socioeconomic factors have been consistently associated with suicide, and economic recessions are linked to rising suicide rates. However, evidence on the impact of socioeconomic interventions to reduce suicide rates is limited. This study investigates the association of the world's largest conditional cash transfer programme with suicide rates in a cohort of half of the Brazilian population. We used data from the 100 Million Brazilian Cohort, covering a 12-year period (2004 to 2015). It comprises socioeconomic and demographic information on 114,008,317 individuals, linked to the ""Bolsa FamÃƒÂ­lia"" programme (BFP) payroll database, and nationwide death registration data. BFP was implemented by the Brazilian government in 2004. We estimated the association of BFP using inverse probability of treatment weighting, estimating the weights for BFP beneficiaries (weight = 1) and nonbeneficiaries by the inverse probability of receiving treatment (weight = E(ps)/(1-E(ps))). We used an average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) estimator and fitted Poisson models to estimate the incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for suicide associated with BFP experience. At the cohort baseline, BFP beneficiaries were younger (median age 27.4 versus 35.4), had higher unemployment rates (56% versus 32%), a lower level of education, resided in rural areas, and experienced worse household conditions. There were 36,742 suicide cases among the 76,532,158 individuals aged 10 years, or older, followed for 489,500,000 person-years at risk. Suicide rates among beneficiaries and nonbeneficiaries were 5.4 (95% CI = 5.32, 5.47, p &lt; 0.001) and 10.7 (95% CI = 10.51, 10.87, p &lt; 0.001) per 100,000 individuals, respectively. BFP beneficiaries had a lower suicide rate than nonbeneficiaries (IRR = 0.44, 95% CI = 0.42, 0.45, p &lt; 0.001). This association was stronger among women (IRR = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.33, 0.38, p &lt; 0.001), and individuals aged between 25 and 59 (IRR = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.40, 0.43, p &lt; 0.001). Study limitations include a lack of control for previous mental disorders and access to means of suicide, and the possible under-registration of suicide cases due to stigma. We observed that BFP was associated with lower suicide rates, with similar results in all sensitivity analyses. These findings should help to inform policymakers and health authorities to better design suicide prevention strategies. Targeting social determinants using cash transfer programmes could be important in limiting suicide, which is predicted to rise with the economic recession, consequent to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.","Machado, Williamson, Pescarini, Alves, Castro-de-Araujo, Ichihara, Rodrigues, Araya, Patel, Barreto","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004000","20220518","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31514,""
"Remote and Hybrid Schooling During COVID-19: Associations with Child Behavior and Sleep","The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of child behavior, academic and sleep concerns, and parent stress and depression symptoms during COVID-19; to test associations of parent-child well-being with child school format; and to examine effect moderation by child race/ethnicity and material hardship. A total of 305 English-speaking parents of elementary school-age children completed online surveys regarding demographics, child school format, behavior, learning-related experiences, sleep, and parent stress and depression symptoms. Multivariable linear and logistic regression analyses examined associations of school format with child and parent outcomes. Children were aged 5.00 to 10.99 years, with 27.8% underrepresented minority race/ethnicity. Per parental report, 27.7% attended school in-person, 12.8% hybrid, and 59.5% remote. In multivariable models, compared with children receiving in-person instruction, children receiving remote instruction exhibited more hyperactivity (ÃŽÂ² 0.94 [95% confidence interval, 0.18-1.70]), peer problems (ÃŽÂ² 0.71 [0.17-1.25]), and total behavioral difficulties (ÃŽÂ² 2.82 [1.11-4.53]); were less likely to show academic motivation (odds ratio [OR] 0.47 [0.26-0.85]) and social engagement (OR 0.13 [0.06-0.25]); were more likely to show schoolwork defiance (OR 2.91 [1.56-5.40]); and had a later sleep midpoint (ÃŽÂ² 0.37 [0.18-0.56]) and higher odds of cosleeping (OR 1.89 [1.06-3.37]). Associations of remote learning with behavior difficulties were stronger for children without material hardships. Children receiving remote and hybrid instruction were reported to have more difficulties compared with children receiving in-person instruction. Children with material hardships showed more behavior challenges overall but less associated with school format. Therefore, planning for a return to in-person learning should also include consideration of family supports.","Levitt, Munzer, Torres, Schaller, McCaffery, Radesky","https://doi.org/10.1097/DBP.0000000000001085","20220518","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31515,""
"Cognitive remediation therapy for post-acute persistent cognitive deficits in COVID-19 survivors: A proof-of-concept study","<b>ABSTRACT</b>Cognitive impairments figure prominently in COVID-19 survivors. Cognitive remediation therapy (CRT) improves functional outcomes reducing long-term cognitive deficits in several neurological and psychiatric conditions. Our case-control study investigates the efficacy of a CRT programme administered to COVID-19 survivors in the post-acute phase of the illness. Seventy-three COVID-19 survivors presenting cognitive impairments at one-month follow-up were enrolled. Among them, 15 patients were treated with a two-month CRT programme, and 30 non-treated patients were matched conditional to their baseline cognitive functioning. Cognitive functions were assessed before and after treatment. Depression and quality of life were also evaluated. Mixed model ANOVA revealed a significant effect over time of the CRT programme on global cognitive functioning (<i>F</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.56, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.039), while no significant effect was observed in the untreated group.

"Exposure to COVID-19 news and its relation to stress, depression, and anxiety in the context of difficulty in accessing social support","Past literature showed an increase in the tendency to seek out news media information when social connections are strained. In general, news exposure has been linked to a mix of both positive and negative outcomes, such as heightened protective behaviors, feelings of reassurance, lower uncertainty, and an increase in stress and anxiety. However, its impact on individuals living in communities under lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic has yet to be explored. This study contributes to the existing literature by exploring the effects of COVID-19-related news exposure on mental health outcomes (such as depression and anxiety) for people living in areas that are under community lockdown. Using purposive sampling, 435 Filipinos under community quarantine were surveyed. The structural model of the relations between exposure to COVID-19-related news, difficulty accessing social support, stress, depression, and anxiety was tested via ML estimation with Robust specification using EQS 6.3 software. Social support access was hypothesized to have a moderating role in the impact of COVID-19 news exposure on stress. The results showed an adequately fit model. Results show that higher exposure to news related to COVID-19 led to lower levels of stress, especially for those who were having more difficulty accessing social support. In turn, lesser stress was shown to lead to lesser symptoms of anxiety and depression. This research illustrates the modest, positive impact news exposure has on mental health outcomes, particularly for individuals who may have difficulty accessing social support due to lockdown measures. In situations where social connectedness and access to social support becomes strained, accessing news can be one way to reduce distress among individuals in lockdown and quarantine.","Villasanta, Acosta, Tabo-Corpuz, Manaois","https://doi.org/10.1080/09638237.2022.2069706","20220518","COVID-19; mental health; news exposure; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31517,""

"Adolescent Trauma During the COVID Pandemic: Just Like Adults, Children, or Someone Else?","COVID-19 stay-at-home (SAH) orders were impactful on adolescence, when social interactions affect development. This has the potential to change adolescent trauma. A post-hoc multicenter retrospective analysis of adolescent (13-17Ã‚Â years-old) trauma patients (ATPs) at 11 trauma centers was performed. Patients were divided into 3 groups based on injury date: historical control (CONTROL:3/19/2019-6/30/2019, before SAH (PRE:1/1/2020-3/18/2020), and after SAH (POST:3/19/2020-6/30/2020). The POST group was compared to both PRE and CONTROL groups in separate analyses<b>.</b> 726 ATPs were identified across the 3 time periods. POST had a similar penetrating trauma rate compared to both PRE (15.8% vs 13.8%, <i>P</i> = .56) and CONTROL (15.8% vs 14.5%, <i>P</i> = .69). POST also had a similar rate of suicide attempts compared to both PRE (1.2% vs 1.5%, <i>P</i> = .83) and CONTROL (1.2% vs 2.1%, <i>P</i> = .43).

"Effects of social isolation and restrictions on older people during the COVID-19 pandemic","Older people's health is vulnerable to the effects of long-term changes to everyday life and their recovery from ill health can be delayed by the deconditioning effects of isolation. Social isolation can increase the likelihood of loneliness in older people, which has negative implications for their mental and physical health. To explore the effects of social isolation and social distancing on older people in the Republic of Ireland during and following the government-enforced lockdown in the first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This study involved a convenience sample of four participants from the Republic of Ireland. Semi-structured interviews were conducted and audio-recorded with each participant over six sessions, two weeks apart, between 6 April 2020 and 7 July 2020. Transcripts were analysed using content analysis of longitudinal data to identify themes. Three themes were identified: the effect on health and mental well-being; commitment to restrictions; and concern about the non-adherence of others. Participants committed fully to 'cocooning' and other government restrictions, sometimes to the detriment of their health. Healthcare professionals need to be mindful of potential post-pandemic deconditioning in older people resulting from adherence to government restrictions and lingering anxieties about returning to normality after prolonged isolation.","Dunford, Brooke","https://doi.org/10.7748/nop.2022.e1400","20220518","COVID-19; clinical; coronavirus; health promotion; mental health; older people; psychosocial; public health; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31521,""

"Communication challenges in social isolation, subjective cognitive decline, and mental health status in older adults: A scoping review (2019-2021)","Through an evolutionary concept analysis, social isolation (SI) was defined as lack of social belonging and engagement with others, minimal number of social contacts, and insufficient quality relationships. This definition represents broader understanding of most contributing factors to SI and supports the concepts of reduced communication and socialization experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic served to heighten this problem, including communication challenges, and brought negative outcomes of SI to light. The overall research question examined the impact of communication challenges and SI on OAs with Alzheimer's disease, related dementias, and subjective cognitive changes (2020-2021). This scoping literature review was developed to compare the psychosocial and mental health of older adults between prepandemic and pandemic lockdown of 2020-2021. This review followed the procedures for scoping review reporting as stated by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). In collaboration with an expert scientific information specialist assigned to the college of nursing, the literature was queried through MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process, In-Data-Review &amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations and Daily 1946 to September 02, 2021; APA PsycInfo 1806 to August Week 5 2021; and Embase Classic+Embase 1947 to 2021 September 02. Search terms included social isolation; nursing home; home for the aged; long-term care; old age homes or convalescent home or nursing home; long-term care, or long-term care; aged or elders or seniors, dementia, Alzheimer's or dementia; osteoporosis; and fragility fracture. Quantitative data informed outcomes through increased depression and anxiety, higher rates of depression during the pandemic than prepandemic, and increased symptomology in neuropsychiatric profiles. Further, COVID19-related restrictions, including impaired communication streams, seemed to be the origin of stress-related cognitive changes and symptomology. Communication challenges in residents with dementia may lead to feelings of social isolation. Qualitative evidence supports that dementia has a social, psychological, material, and socio-demographic impact. Further, the lockdown disrupted the existing flow of communication between all stakeholders and residents, resulting in heightened perceptions of SI and a profound sense of loss. The results include a diverse and complex characterization of negative outcomes. Further, strong evidence indicates that communication and human contact can ameliorate negative outcomes.","Koszalinski, Olmos","https://doi.org/10.1111/ppc.13115","20220518","COVID-19; dyshomeostasis; loneliness; long-term care; nursing homes; older adults; pandemic; social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31523,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on visual outcomes of diabetic macular edema patients at a tertiary care veterans affairs center","There are limited studies on factors that impacted retina clinic patient outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to evaluate visual and anatomic outcomes in patients with diabetic macular edema (DME) requiring anti-VEGF injections at the veterans' affairs tertiary care eye clinic in Houston, TX. Patient volume from April 2020 was compared to that of April 2019 to determine attendance changes. To evaluate outcomes, we reviewed patients with DME who had scheduled appointments during April 2020. We tracked changes in central foveal thickness (CFT) and Snellen visual acuity (VA) measurements. Patient outcomes were classified as poor (defined as worsening VA or CFT at follow-up) or good (no worsening of either at follow-up). Regression analysis identified characteristics associated with poor outcomes. To prevent the spread of COVID-19, patients were called to reschedule clinic appointments. Attendance frequency decreased from 523 patients in April 2019 to 246 patients in April 2020. 134 patients met inclusion criteria (mean age of 64.7Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°8.8Ã‚Â years). 19/134 of patients were seen on schedule, 89/134 had delayed appointments (average follow-up interval of 115.2Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°50.0Ã‚Â days), and 26/134 were lost to follow-up.

"Impact of COVID-19 social distancing on medical research from the perspective of postgraduate students: a cross-sectional online survey","To investigate the impact of COVID-19 social distancing on medical research from the perspective of postgraduate students. A cross-sectional study using an online survey was conducted from October 31 to November 1, 2021. A questionnaire was used to assess the impact of COVID-19 social distancing on medical research among postgraduate students. The questionnaire included basic information, medical research information, and information about social distancing measures. Participants also completed the self-made Research Work Affected Scale of Postgraduates (RWAS-P; qualitative evaluation: very mildly 0-10; mildly 11-20; moderately 21-30; severely 31-40; very severely 41-50). Logistic regression was used to identify factors related to the impact of COVID-19 social distancing. A total of 468 participants were analyzed; 95.2% of the participants adhered to social distancing measures. The median total RWAS-P score was 22. The median RWAS-P scores for earlier research data, current research projects, future research plans, paper publication, and graduation schedule were 2, 6, 6, 6, and 4, respectively (score range 0-10).

"Contribution of Deep-Learning Techniques Toward Fighting COVID-19: A Bibliometric Analysis of Scholarly Production During 2020","COVID-19 has dramatically affected various aspects of human society with worldwide repercussions. Firstly, a serious public health issue has been generated, resulting in millions of deaths. Also, the global economy, social coexistence, psychological status, mental health, and the human-environment relationship/dynamics have been seriously affected. Indeed, abrupt changes in our daily lives have been enforced, starting with a mandatory quarantine and the application of biosafety measures. Due to the magnitude of these effects, research efforts from different fields were rapidly concentrated around the current pandemic to mitigate its impact. Among these fields, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning (DL) have supported many research papers to help combat COVID-19. The present work addresses a bibliometric analysis of this scholarly production during 2020. Specifically, we analyse quantitative and qualitative indicators that give us insights into the factors that have allowed papers to reach a significant impact on traditional metrics and alternative ones registered in social networks, digital mainstream media, and public policy documents. In this regard, we study the correlations between these different metrics and attributes. Finally, we analyze how the last DL advances have been exploited in the context of the COVID-19 situation.","Chicaiza, Villota, Vinueza-Naranjo, Rumipamba-Zambrano","https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3159025","20220518","Bibliometric analysis; COVID-19; deep learning; scholarly production","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31526,""
"Subjective social status, COVID-19 health worries, and mental health symptoms in perinatal women","Pregnant women and those who have recently given birth are considered an at-risk population during the COVID-19 pandemic with regards to the impact of both general stress and pandemic-related stressors. The extent to which subjective social status (SSS), one's perception of relative standing compared to others in a social hierarchy, might mitigate the effects of COVID-19-related health worries on mental health has not yet been reported, despite SSS often outperforming socioeconomic status as a predictor of various health outcomes including depression. This cross-sectional survey study tested the moderating effect of SSS on association between COVID-19- related health worries and mental health symptoms (depressive and generalized anxiety) among a sample of 1,637 perinatal women from the United States who took part in the Perinatal Experiences and COVID-19 Effects (PEACE) Study between May 2020 and June 2021. We found that high subjective social status was protective against depressive symptoms when self-reported COVID-19-related worry was low. When COVID-19-related worry was high, subjective social status was no longer influential. Higher levels of COVID-19-related health worries were associated with more anxiety symptoms, and higher subjective social status did not moderate anxiety symptomatology at either level of COVID-19-related worry. Although higher SSS has historically been protective against mental health decline, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic it may not be sufficiently protective against anxiety, or against depression for those who experience high levels of worry regarding the effects of COVID-19 on health.","Liu, Koire, Erdei, Mittal","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2022.101116","20220518","Anxiety; Depression; Health anxiety; Maternal health; Postpartum; Pregnancy; Socioeconomic status; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31527,""
"The Environmental Story During the COVID-19 Lockdown: How Human Activities Affect PM25 Concentration in China?","At the end of 2019, the very first COVID-19 coronavirus infection was reported and then it spread across the world just like wildfires. From late January to March 2020, most cities and villages in China were locked down, and consequently, human activities decreased dramatically. This letter presents an ""offline learning and online inference"" approach to explore the variation of PM2.5 pollution during this period. In the experiments, a deep regression model was trained to establish the complex relationship between remote sensing data and <i>in situ</i> PM2.5 observations, and then the spatially continuous monthly PM2.5 distribution map was simulated using the Google Earth Engine platform. The results reveal that the COVID-19 lockdown truly decreased the PM2.5 pollution with certain hysteresis and the fine particle pollution begins to increase when advancing resumption of work and production gradually.","Tan, Li, Gao, Jiang","https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2020.3040435","20220518","Absorbing Aerosol Index (AAI); Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD); COVID-19; Google Earth Engine (GEE); PM25; deep learning; remote sensing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31528,""
"Association of the time spent on social media news with depression and suicidal ideation among a sample of Lebanese adults during the COVID-19 pandemic and the Lebanese economic crisis","The main objectives were to associate between social media news consumption during these unstable times and depression, as well as suicidal ideation among a sample of Lebanese adults, in addition to associate between fear of Covid-19, depression and suicidal ideation. Secondary objectives aimed to check the mediating effect of depression in the association between time spent on social media to get the news and the presence of suicidal ideation. This is a cross-sectional study executed between April and May 2021. It involved 402 Lebanese citizens aged 18Ã‚Â years and above, selected randomly from all Lebanese districts. Having cancer (BetaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.20) or lung disease (BetaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.27), more fear of COVID-19 (BetaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.16), a higher time spent on social media for news (BetaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.13) and a higher household crowding index (BetaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.29) were significantly associated with more depression, whereas having a pet in the house (BetaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.13) and working in the medical field (BetaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.17) were significantly associated with less depression. Higher depression (aORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.19) was significantly associated with higher odds of having suicidal ideation, whereas more fear of COVID-19 (aORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.84) and older age (aORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.96) were significantly associated with less odds of having suicidal ideation. Depression did not mediate the association between time spent on social media to get the news and suicidal ideation. This study showed that more time spent on social media reading the news is associated with higher depression but not suicidal ideation. Fear of Covid-19 is associated with more depression, but less suicidal ideation. Further studies are needed to identify the causality between social media news consumption, depression and suicidal ideation. Moreover, awareness campaigns should be organized to teach people how to consume social media news in a responsible way, without letting it affect their emotions directly, which may cause psychological disorders.","El Frenn, Hallit, Obeid, Soufia","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-022-03148-1","20220518","Depression; Fear of COVID-19; Lebanon; Social media news; Suicidal ideation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31529,""
"Negative emotional symptoms during COVID19 confinement: The relationship with reading habits","Coronavirus disease (COVID19) is an ongoing pandemic, which forced governments across the globe to implement confinement measures to limit the spread of the disease. These measures have impacted the daily life and psychological status of people. However, no studies have examined the relationship between changes in psychological status with reading habits during the COVID19 pandemic. The study aims at examining the relationship between changes in reading habits and negative emotional states. The psychological status was measured using the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scales (DASS). In addition, the participants reported changes in four types of reading experiences during COVID19 confinement. These reading types are specialized, general knowledge, story/novels, and religious material. An internet-based survey was used to collect the data among adults. A total of 1711 individuals participated in the study. About 60.0%, 55.1%, 60.5% and 61.0% reported participating in scientific, religious, general, and novel reading, respectively. Additionally, the ANOVA revealed differences (<i>p</i>Ã‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.05) in DASS scores according to the changes in scientific, religious, newspaper, and novel/story reading. Subgroup post hoc comparisons showed that DASS scores were associated with a no-change or increase in all types of reading habits indicating a main effect of emotional state on all types of reading. Current results might suggest that the participants who experienced greater negative emotions, tended to either not change or increase their reading habits. Additionally, individuals with lower negative emotion scores reported a decrease in reading during the COVID19 pandemic.","Alomari, Alzoubi, Khabour, Hendawi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imu.2022.100962","20220518","COVID19; Confinement; Negative emotional; Reading habits","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31530,""
"Priority Nursing Populations for Mental Health Support Before and During COVID-19: A Survey Study of Individual and Workplace Characteristics","Nursing is a high-risk profession and nurses' exposure to workplace risk factors such as heavy workloads and inadequate staffing is well documented. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated nurses' exposure to workplace risk factors, further deteriorating their mental health. Therefore, it is both timely and important to determine nursing groups in greatest need of mental health interventions and supports. The purpose of this study is to provide a granular examination of the differences in nurse mental health across nurse demographic and workplace characteristics before and after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. This secondary analysis used survey data from two cross-sectional studies with samples (Time 1 study, 5,512 nurses; Time 2, 4,523) recruited from the nursing membership (Ã¢Ë†Â¼48,000) of the British Columbia nurses' union. Data was analyzed at each timepoint using descriptive statistics and ordinal logistic regression. Several demographic and workplace characteristics were found to predict significant differences in the number of positive screenings on measures of poor mental health. Most importantly, in both survey times younger age was a strong predictor of worse mental health, as was full-time employment. Nurse workplace health authority was also a significant predictor of worse mental health. Structural and psychological strategies must be in place, proactively and preventively, to buffer nurses against workplace challenges that are likely to increase during the COVID-19 crisis.","Havaei, MacPhee, Ma, Mao","https://doi.org/10.1177/08445621221098833","20220518","Nursing; demographic characteristics; health authority; logistic models; mental health; workplace characteristics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31531,""
"A cross-sectional investigation of psychosocial stress factors in German families with children aged 0-3Ã‚Â years during the COVID-19 pandemic: initial results of the CoronabaBY study","Psychosocial stress during the COVID-19 pandemic is increasing particularly in parents. Although being specifically vulnerable to negative environmental exposures, research on psychosocial stress factors in infants' and toddlers' families during the pandemic is so far sparse. The CoronabaBY study investigates the perceived pandemic burden, parenting stress and parent and child mental health problems in families with children aged 0-3Ã‚Â years in Bavaria, Southern Germany. Further, the relationships between these psychosocial stressors are examined and sociodemographic characteristics that may be predictive of these factors will be explored. Participants were cross-sectionally surveyed via smartphone app. Standardized questionnaires on perceived pandemic burden, parenting stress, parental symptoms of depression and anxiety, infants' crying, sleeping and feeding problems or toddlers' emotional and behavioral problems were applied. NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°991 parents (M<sub>age</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°33.7Ã‚Â years, SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.5; 93.7% mothers, 91.5% born in Germany) with infants (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°554; M<sub>age</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.9Ã‚Â months, SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.0) or toddlers (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°435; M<sub>age</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°25.9Ã‚Â months, SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°6.5) participated in the first half-year of 2021. Sixty-five percent of the parents perceived a high pandemic burden, 37.7% experienced parenting stress and 24.1% showed affective symptoms (anxiety: 30.1%, depression: 18.5%). Feeding problems, crying/ sleeping problems and multiple regulatory problems were found in 34.8%, 26.2% and 13.5% of the infants, respectively. Amongst toddlers, 8.5% showed noticeable behavior and emotional problems. Children`s mental health problems correlated moderately with parenting stress and parental affective symptoms and weakly with perceived pandemic burden. A lower financial status, higher parental education and increasing child age were significant but weak predictors for higher parenting stress, affective symptoms and higher psychological problems in children. A majority of the surveyed families with infants and toddlers experience the pandemic as stressful. The main challenges are parental affective symptoms and limited resources for childcare due to parenting stress. Overall, infants and toddlers show similar levels of mental health problems when being compared to pre-pandemic studies, but staggered detrimental effects on children`s mental health might occur if the stressful conditions persist. This is already indicated by correlations between parental and child psychosocial stress factors.","Buechel, Nehring, Seifert, Eber, Behrends, Mall, Friedmann","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13034-022-00464-z","20220517","Anxiety; Behavior problems; COVID-19; Depression; Early life adversity; Infancy and early childhood; Parent psychosocial functioning; Parenting; Psychosocial functioning; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31532,""
"Food worry and mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic","There is limited and inconsistent literature examining the relationship between food worry and mental health in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study examined the association between food worry and mental health among community dwelling Canadian adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Adults age 16Ã‚Â years and older completed an anonymous online questionnaire between April 1, 2020 and November 30 2020. Measures of pre-pandemic and current food worry, depression (PHQ-2), anxiety (GAD-2), and sociodemographic variables were included. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine the association between food worry and symptoms of depression and anxiety. In total, 1605 participants were included in analyses. Worry about affording food was reported by 320 (14.78%) participants. In models adjusting for sociodemographic covariates, compared with people without food worry, participants who had food worry were 2.07 times more likely to report anxiety symptoms (aOR 2.07, 95% CI: 1.43 - 2.98, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) and were 1.9 times more likely to report depressive symptoms (aOR 1.89, 95% CI: 1.39-2.57, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.0001). Lower income, lower education, and pre-existing mental health conditions were significant predictors of symptoms of depression. Female gender, younger age, lower education, lower income, and pre-existing mental health condition were significant predictors of anxiety symptoms. Our study highlights the relationship between food worry and poor mental health. Policy supports such as improved income supports, clinical implications such as screening for food worry in primary care, referral to emergency food programs and support with meal planning may help mitigate mental health symptoms during the current pandemic, during future societal recovery from this pandemic and during future pandemics.","Han, Purkey, Davison, Watson, Nolan, Mitchell, Traviss, Kehoe, Bayoumi","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-13410-7","20220517","COVID-19 pandemic; Food insecurity; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31533,""
"Social media use and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in young adults: a meta-analysis of 14 cross-sectional studies","Public isolated due to the early quarantine regarding coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) increasingly used more social media platforms. Contradictory claims regarding the effect of social media use on mental health needs to be resolved. The purpose of the study was to summarise the association between the time spent on social media platform during the COVID-19 quarantine and mental health outcomes (i.e., anxiety and depression). Studies were screened from the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases. Regarding eligibility criteria, studies conducted after the declaration of the pandemic, studies that measured mental health symptoms with validated tools, and studies that presented quantitative results were eligible. The studies after retrieval evaluated the association between time spent on social media platform and mental health outcomes (i.e. anxiety and depression). The pooled estimates of retrieved studies were summarised in odds ratios (ORs). Data analyses included a random-effect model and an assessment of inter-study heterogeneity. Quality assessment was conducted by two independent researchers using the Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Nonrandomized Studies (RoBANS). This meta-analysis review was registered in PROSPERO ( https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/ , registration No CRD42021260223, 15 June 2021). Fourteen studies were included. The increase in the time spent using social media platforms were associated with anxiety symptoms in overall studies (pooled ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.55, 95% CI: 1.30-1.85), and the heterogeneity between studies was mild (I<sup>2</sup>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°26.77%). Similarly, the increase in social media use time was also associated with depressive symptoms (pooled ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.43, 95% CI: 1.30-1.85), and the heterogeneity between studies was moderate (I<sup>2</sup>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°67.16%). For sensitivity analysis, the results of analysis including only the ""High quality"" studies after quality assessment were similar to those of the overall study with low heterogeneity (anxiety: pooled ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.45, 95% CI: 1.21-1.96, I<sup>2</sup>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.00%; depression: pooled ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.42, 95% CI: 0.69-2.90, I<sup>2</sup>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.00%).

"Age-related cognitive effects of the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions and associated mental health changes in Germans","Restrictive means to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic have not only imposed broad challenges on mental health but might also affect cognitive health. Here we asked how restriction-related changes influence cognitive performance and how age, perceived loneliness, depressiveness and affectedness by restrictions contribute to these effects. 51 Germans completed three assessments of an online based study during the first lockdown in Germany (April 2020), a month later, and during the beginning of the second lockdown (November 2020). Participants completed nine online cognitive tasks of the MyBrainTraining and online questionnaires about their perceived strain and impact on lifestyle factors by the situation (affectedness), perceived loneliness, depressiveness as well as subjective cognitive performance. The results suggested a possible negative impact of depressiveness and affectedness on objective cognitive performance within the course of the lockdown. The younger the participants, the more pronounced these effects were. Loneliness and depressiveness moreover contributed to a worse evaluation of subjective cognition. In addition, especially younger individuals reported increased distress. As important educational and social input has partly been scarce during this pandemic and mental health problemsÃ‚Â have increased, future research should also assess cognitive long-term consequences.","Menze, Mueller, Mueller, Schmicker","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-11283-9","20220517","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31535,""
"Mental disorders following COVID-19 and other epidemics: a systematic review and meta-analysis","COVID-19 has imposed a very substantial direct threat to the physical health of those infected, although the corollary impact on mental health may be even more burdensome. Here we focus on assessing the mental health impact of COVID-19 and of other epidemics in the community. We searched five electronic databases until December 9, 2020, for all peer-reviewed original studies reporting any prevalence or correlates of mental disorders in the general population following novel epidemics in English, Chinese or Portuguese. We synthesised prevalence estimates from probability samples during COVID-19 and past epidemics. The meta-analytical effect size was the prevalence of relevant outcomes, estimated via random-effects model. I<sup>2</sup> statistics, Doi plots and the LFK index were used to examine heterogeneity and publication bias. This study is pre-registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020179105. We identified 255 eligible studies from 50 countries on: COVID-19 (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°247 studies), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS; nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°5), Ebola virus disease (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2), and 1918 influenza (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1). During COVID-19, we estimated the point prevalence for probable anxiety (20.7%, 95% CI 12.9-29.7), probable depression (18.1%, 13.0-23.9), and psychological distress (13.0%, 0-34.1). Correlates for poorer mental health include female sex, lower income, pre-existing medical conditions, perceived risk of infection, exhibiting COVID-19-like symptoms, social media use, financial stress, and loneliness. Public trust in authorities, availability of accurate information, adoption of preventive measures and social support were associated with less morbidity. The mental health consequences of COVID-19 and other epidemics could be comparable to major disasters and armed conflicts. The considerable heterogeneity in our analysis indicates that more random samples are needed. Health-care professionals should be vigilant of the psychological toll of epidemics, including among those who have not been infected.","Leung, Ho, Bharwani, Cogo-Moreira, Wang, Chow, Fan, Galea, Leung, Ni","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-022-01946-6","20220517","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31536,""
"Psychological impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical students in the United States of America","This study aimed to assess the early psychological impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on United States medical students when compared to graduate students in fields unrelated to healthcare using the perceived stress scale (PSS-10) and the perceived COVID-19-related risk scale (PCRS). This was a cross-sectional study between May and June 2020. We created an anonymous, online questionnaire that was administered to medical students nationwide and local graduate students. We used Student's t-test, Chi-square test, and regression models. We received 425 completed responses. Contrary to similar stress levels in graduate students, medical students on average experienced significantly more stress after coursework suspension than before (20.6Ã‚Â vs 14.7). Female gender and a mental illness diagnosis were associated with statistically significantly elevated PSS-10 scores before and after suspension in medical students. Medical students reported a low PCRS score. Most medical students were confident in their department's infection control measures and willing to report to work. Female gender and a mental illness diagnosis remain two important risk factors for medical students' stress levels during the pandemic. This study highlights the need to foster students' public health competency and safely involve students as non-frontline workers in public health emergency responses for their mental wellbeing.","Zhang, Geddes, Kanga, Himelhoch","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2022.114595","20220519","COVID-19; Medical students; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31537,""
"Trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy with Puerto Rican youth in a post-disaster context: Tailoring, implementation, and program evaluation outcomes","Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) has not yet been systematically evaluated in the Caribbean context, particularly with Hispanic youth exposed to multiple disasters. The objective of this project was twofold: 1) to train mental health providers in Puerto Rico in TF-CBT as part of a clinical implementation project within the largest managed behavioral health organization (MBHO) on the island, and 2) to conduct a program evaluation to determine the feasibility of implementation and the effectiveness of the treatment. Fifteen psychologists were trained in TF-CBT. These psychologists then provided TF-CBT to 56 children and adolescents, ages 5-18, in community-based mental health clinics and one primary care clinic with a co-located psychologist in Puerto Rico. The mean number of traumatic events reported by youth referred for TF-CBT was 4.11. Thirty-six out of 56 children enrolled in the project (64.3%) successfully completed all components of TF-CBT. Results demonstrated large effect sizes for reduction in youth-reported posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) (Cohen's dÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.32), depressive symptoms (Cohen's dÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.32), and anxiety symptoms (Cohen's dÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.18). These results suggest that it was feasible to train providers in TF-CBT, that providers were able to deliver TF-CBT in community-based settings both in person and via telehealth (due to the COVID-19 pandemic), and that TF-CBT was an effective treatment option to address trauma-related concerns for youth in Puerto Rico in a post-disaster context. This project is an important first step in the dissemination and implementation of evidence-based trauma-focused treatment for Hispanic youth and disaster-affected youth in the Caribbean.","Orengo-Aguayo, Dueweke, Nicasio, de Arellano, Rivera, Cohen, Mannarino, Stewart","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2022.105671","20220519","Climate change; Disaster; Evidence-based treatment; Global mental health; Hispanic; Latinx; PTSD; Puerto Rico; TF-CBT; Trauma; Youth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31538,""

"The mental health of children and young people living in big cities in a revolving postpandemic world","The world's population is increasingly urban, with most children and young people growing up and living in cities. Evidence suggests that urbanicity is linked to an increased risk for the development of mental health disorders. Rather than an accumulation of risk factors, urbanization is a complex process that profoundly structures living conditions. In this sense, it is timely to discuss what are the social and structural determinants of mental health of children and young people in such settings. Three domains of determinants of mental health were selected for discussion: economics and living conditions, crime and violence, and urban layouts. For each, we debated realities faced by urban children and young people, providing an overview of recent evidence on implications for mental disorders and well being. We also discuss the potential impacts of the covid-19 pandemic on each domain, as well as recommendations for future action.

"Positive personal resources and psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic: resilience, optimism, hope, courage, trait mindfulness, and self-efficacy in breast cancer patients and survivors","This study aims to understand the association between positive personal resources (i.e., optimism, hope, courage, trait mindfulness, and self-efficacy), resilience, and psychological distress (i.e., anxiety, depression, stress) in women with breast cancer and breast cancer survivors during the COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesized that personal positive resources can directly influence resilience, which in turn prevented psychological distress. The research sample consisted of 409 Italian women (49% patients, 51% survivors) who were administered a questionnaire to assess positive resources, resiliency, and distress. structural equation model (SEM) analysis was carried out to confirm the hypothetical-theoretical model. Personal positive resources had a direct positive effect on resilience, which prevented from distress. These results were observed across cancer patients and survivors, and regardless the level of direct exposure to COVID-19. In both patients and survivors, the relationships between positive personal resources, resilience, and psychological distress is strong enough to be not influenced by the level of exposure to COVID-19 and despite COVID-19 pandemic caused the disruption of active treatment plans and delays in routine check-ups. Implications of this study suggest the urgency to screen positive resources and to identify women with lower resilience and a potentially higher susceptibility to develop psychological distress. For these women, our findings suggest the implementation of psychological interventions that build resilience.","Chiesi, Vizza, Valente, Bruno, Lau, Campagna, Lo Iacono, Bruno","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-022-07123-1","20220517","Anxiety; Breast cancer; COVID-19; Courage; Hope; Optimism; Psychological distress; Resilience; Self-efficacy; Trait mindfulness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31542,""
"The potential of remdesivir to affect function, metabolism and proliferation of cardiac and kidney cells in vitro","Remdesivir is a prodrug of a nucleoside analog and the first antiviral therapeutic approved for coronavirus disease. Recent cardiac safety concerns and reports on remdesivir-related acute kidney injury call for a better characterization of remdesivir toxicity and understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Here, we performed an in vitro toxicity assessment of remdesivir around clinically relevant concentrations (C<sub>max</sub> 9Ã‚Â Ã‚ÂµM) using H9c2 rat cardiomyoblasts, neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes (NMCM), rat NRK-52E and human RPTEC/TERT1 cells as cell models for the assessment of cardiotoxicity or nephrotoxicity, respectively. Due to the known potential of nucleoside analogs for the induction of mitochondrial toxicity, we assessed mitochondrial function in response to remdesivir treatment, early proteomic changes in NMCM and RPTEC/TERT1 cells and the contractile function of NMCM. Short-term treatments (24Ã‚Â h) of H9c2 and NRK-52E cells with remdesivir adversely affected cell viability by inhibition of proliferation as determined by significantly decreased <sup>3</sup>H-thymidine uptake. Mitochondrial toxicity of remdesivir (1.6-3.1Ã‚Â Ã‚ÂµM) in cardiac cells was evident by a significant decrease in oxygen consumption, a collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential and an increase in lactate secretion after a 24-48-h treatment. This was supported by early proteomic changes of respiratory chain proteins and intermediate filaments that are typically involved in mitochondrial reorganization. Functionally, an impedance-based analysis showed that remdesivir (6.25Ã‚Â Ã‚ÂµM) affected the beat rate and contractility of NMCM. In conclusion, we identified adverse effects of remdesivir in cardiac and kidney cells at clinically relevant concentrations, suggesting a careful evaluation of therapeutic use in patients at risk for cardiovascular or kidney disease.","Merches, Breunig, Fender, Brand, BÃƒÂ¤tz, Idel, Kollipara, Reinders, Sickmann, Mally, Lorenz","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00204-022-03306-1","20220517","COVID-19; Cardiotoxicity; Mitochondrial toxicity; Nephrotoxicity; Nucleoside analog; Remdesivir","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31543,""
"Acceptability of a Fentanyl Vaccine to Prevent Opioid Overdose and Need for Personalized Decision-Making","The opioid epidemic worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. Synthetic opioids (primarily fentanyl) comprise the most common drugs involved in overdose (OD) death. A vaccine that blocks fentanyl from reaching the brain to prevent OD is under development and insight is needed into its acceptability. Using a semi-structured interview guide, persons with opioid use disorder (OUD), family, professionals, and the public, were interviewed about attitudes and concerns regarding a fentanyl vaccine. Reactions to fictional clinical vignettes of persons at risk of OUD because of pain and/or substance use histories were collected, analyzed, and quantified for favorability. Interviews were transcribed, coded, and analyzed thematically. Among NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°64 participants, (70.3% female, average age 32.4 years), attitudes were favorable toward a fentanyl vaccine, with preference for lifelong durability (76% of nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°55 asked). Perceived benefits centered on the potential for a life-saving intervention, suffering averted, healthcare dollars saved, and the utility of a passive harm reduction strategy. Concerns centered on uncertainty regarding vaccine safety, questions about efficacy, worry about implications for future pain management, stigma, and need for supportive counseling and guidance to personalize decision-making. Reactions to vignettes revealed complex attitudes towards fentanyl vaccination when considering recipient age, health history, and future risks for addiction and pain. Positive responses to a fentanyl vaccine were found along with appreciation for the complexity of a vaccine strategy to prevent OD in the setting of pain and uncertain durability. Further research is needed to elucidate operational, ethical, and communications strategies to advance the model.","Weitzman, Kossowsky, Blakemore, Cox, Dowling, Levy, Needles, Levy","https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciac344","20220517","Acceptability; Fentanyl vaccine; Harm reduction; Opioid overdose; Opioid use disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31544,""
"Characterizing Unusual Spatial Clusters of Male Mental Health Emergencies Occurring During the First National COVID-19 ""Lockdown"" in the East Midlands Region, UK: A Geospatial Analysis of Ambulance 999 Data","The widespread psychological effects of contagion mitigation measures associated with the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are well known. Phases of ""lockdown"" have increased levels of anxiety and depression globally. Most research uses methods such as self-reporting that highlight the greater impact of the pandemic on the mental health of females. Emergency medical data from ambulance services may be a better reflection of male mental health. We use ambulance data to identify unusual clusters of high rates of male mental health emergencies occurring in the East Midlands of the United Kingdom during the first national ""lockdown"" and to explore factors that may explain clusters. Analysis of more than 5,000 cases of male mental health emergencies revealed 19 unusual spatial clusters. Binary logistic regression analysis (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> = 787.22, <i>df</i> = 20, <i>p</i> Ã¢â€°Â¤ .001) identified 16 factors that explained clusters, including proximity to ""healthy"" features of the physical landscape, urban and rural dynamics, and socioeconomic condition. Our findings suggest that the factors underlying vulnerability of males to severe mental health conditions during ""lockdown"" vary within and between rural and urban spaces, and that the wider ""hinterland"" surrounding clusters influences the social and physical access of males to services that facilitate mental health support. Limitations on social engagement to mitigate effects of the pandemic are likely to continue. Our approach could inform delivery of emergency services and the development of community-level services to support vulnerable males during periods of social isolation.","Moore, Hill, Tanser, Siriwardena, Gussy, Cutts, Spaight","https://doi.org/10.1177/15579883221097539","20220518","COVID-19; ambulance data; male mental health; rural health; spatial analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31545,""

Findings for waves 1 (March 2020) to 6 (November 2020) are reported (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1943). Covid-related worry and rumination levels were highest at the beginning of the first lockdown, then declined but increased when the UK returned to lockdown. Worry levels were higher than rumination levels throughout. High levels of COVID-related worry and rumination were associated with a five- and ten-fold increase in clinically meaningful rates of depression and anxiety (respectively) together with lower well-being and higher loneliness. The effects of COVID-related worry on depression and anxiety levels were most marked and clinically meaningful in individuals living with a pre-existing mental health condition.

"Pediatric Mental Health Presentations and Boarding: First Year of the COVID-19 Pandemic","Psychiatric boarding occurs when patients remain in emergency departments (ED) or are admitted to inpatient medical/surgical units to await placement at psychiatric treatment programs. Boarding was already increasing in the United States (US) over the past decade, and the COVID-19 pandemic has only further profoundly affected the mental health of youth. The current study aims to describe psychiatric diagnoses and boarding among pediatric patients presenting to the hospital after the pandemic onset. We performed a retrospective chart review from March 2019 to February 2021 of all youth Ã¢â€°Â¤ 18 years with ED or inpatient medical/surgical admissions related to mental health complaints at a large US Northeast pediatric hospital and compared psychiatric diagnoses and boarding during the 12-months before and after the pandemic onset. Inferential statistics included chi-square and t-tests. Interrupted time series analyses evaluated trends during the study period. Proportion of hospital presentations of pediatric patients with suicidal ideation/suicide attempts (p&lt;0.001), depression (p&lt;0.001), anxiety (p=0.006), eating disorders (p&lt;0.001), substance use disorders (p=0.006), and obsessive compulsive and related disorders (p&lt;0.001), all increased during the first pandemic year, compared with the prior year. Average length of psychiatric boarding more than doubled [2.1 vs 4.6 days, p&lt;0.001] and 50.4% of patients experienced extended boarding periods Ã¢â€°Â¥ 2 days during the first pandemic year.

We present a 28-year-old female case of post-COVID major depression with psychotic features and Cotard's syndrome with no previous psychiatric history. Her complaints were initially described by the sadness of mood with early morning worsening, diminished interest in almost all activities, anhedonia, increased anxiety, ideas of worthlessness, hopelessness, guilt, decreased sleep, and appetite. Then, she developed severe depression with psychotic features such as delusions of persecution, poverty, and nihilism. Nihilistic delusions included a description of everything coming to an end. She thought that her organs were no more working. Later she negated her existence and started believing that she was dead. The patient recovered after a combination of sertraline and olanzapine treatment.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of body mass index of T1D patients on the psychological symptoms and eating habits, as well as the prognostic factors of the psychological symptoms during the lockdown period. Diabetes mellitus patients were invited to complete this survey from the outpatient Diabetes clinic of the General Hospital of Chania and the ""AHEPA"" General University Hospital of Thessaloniki in Greece. Psychological symptoms were assessed using the DASS-42 questionnaire and eating habits were assessed using the EAT-26 questionnaire. Overall, 112 T1D patients were analyzed (response rate: 28.8%).

"Neuropsychiatry's Role in the Postacute Sequelae of COVID-19: Report From the American Neuropsychiatric Association Committee on Research","The postacute sequelae of COVID-19 infection (PASC), also known as post-COVID condition or ""long COVID,"" refers to symptoms that persist after the initial acute phase of the infection. PASC symptoms may occur in patients who had mild acute disease. On the basis of current data, commonly reported neurological and psychiatric symptoms in PASC include sleep problems, fatigue, cognitive impairment, headache, sensorimotor symptoms, dizziness, anxiety, irritability, and depression. Knowledge from neuropsychiatric sequelae of other viral infections, such as other coronaviruses, provides us with information about the heterogeneity and similarities of neuropsychiatric clinical presentations that may follow viral illnesses over a long period. Several, possibly overlapping, pathophysiological mechanisms have been proposed to explain neuropsychiatric PASC: direct effects of the virus and immunological, vascular, functional, iatrogenic, and other etiologies. The authors present practice considerations for clinicians confronted with the challenge of evaluating and treating patients who have neuropsychiatric PASC. A comprehensive neuropsychiatric approach reviews historical factors, provides an objective assessment of symptoms, carefully considers all potential etiologies, and offers a therapeutic approach aimed at restoring premorbid functioning. Given the currently limited therapeutic options for neuropsychiatric PASC, unless an alternative etiology is identified, treatment should be symptom based and guided by evidence as it emerges.","Baslet, Aybek, Ducharme, Modirrousta, Nicholson","https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.neuropsych.21080209","20220517","COVID-19; Infectious Disease; Long COVID; Neuropsychiatric Assessment; PASC (Post-acute Sequelae of COVID-19)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31550,""

"Force application of laparoscopic surgeons under the impact of heavy personal protective equipment","Surgeons are required to wear heavy personal protective equipment while delivering cares to patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. We examined the impact of wearing double gloves on surgeons' performance in laparoscopic surgery. Eleven surgeons-in-training were recruited to perform laparoscopic cutting tasks in simulation while wearing none, one pair, and two pairs of surgical gloves. Forces applied to laparoscopic instruments were measured. Wearing gloves prolonged task times (one pair of gloves: 301.6Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 61.7 s; two pairs of gloves: 295.8Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 65.3 s) compared with no gloves (241.7Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 46.9 s; <i>pÃ‚Â =</i>Ã‚Â 0.043).

"A Virtual, Simulated Code White for Undergraduate Nursing Students","Nurses and nursing students are increasingly vulnerable to workplace violence, both verbal and physical, as health care settings and clients cope with unprecedented challenges including the COVID-19 pandemic. Concurrently, clinical learning opportunities for nursing students have been curtailed by public health restrictions and limited capacity. While virtual simulations have been promoted as an alternative to clinical hours, their effectiveness as an educational intervention on workplace violence has yet to be assessed. The authors sought to evaluate a virtual, simulated code white-a set of organized responses to a client, visitor, or staff member exhibiting the potential for violence-involving 4th year undergraduate nursing students, randomly sorted into an intervention group and a control group. Pre and post test measures of knowledge and attitudes about mental health, workplace violence and virtual simulation were collected, as well as qualitative data from focus groups. While the sample size (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°24) was insufficient to detect meaningful differences between the intervention and control groups, descriptive statistics and focus group data revealed significant gaps in participants' knowledge around managing workplace violence. Participants rated the virtual simulation highly for its realism and the opportunity to experience working in a virtual environment, while they felt the preamble and debrief were too short. The findings illustrate a virtual code white simulation has clear educational benefits, and that multiple iterations, both virtual and in person, would most likely increase the benefits of the intervention.","Stephen, King, Taylor, Jackson, Hilario","https://doi.org/10.1177/08445621221101290","20220517","COVID-19; Code white; mental health; undergraduate nursing education; virtual simulation; workplace violence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31553,""
"Implementing Full Practice Authority for Advanced Practice Registered Nurses: A Case for Mitigating Critical Mental Health Services","The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted some perverse health disparities that we know have long existed in the United States. Disparities related to access, affordability, and cultural appropriateness of care cannot be overemphasized. More importantly, disparities related to provider shortages continue to contribute to adverse patient outcomes, particularly in rural areas and other socioeconomically deprived communities. Despite the push from the National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN) to ensure adoption and implementation of full practice authority (FPA) of advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs), currently only 28 states in the United States have achieved this goal. In addition, there are some states such as Florida that recently passed legislation supporting FPA for primary care APRNs, yet still have practice restrictions for specialty APRNs, such as mental health. The evidence is clear that patients managed by APRNs have better or comparable outcomes to those managed by physicians; thus, more advocacy is needed to ensure that all states and territories achieve this very important milestone for the profession as it has the potential to foster a collaborative interdisciplinary approach to patient care, which at the same time produces positive patient outcomes, employee satisfaction, and a work environment in which all members of the care team feel valued and autonomous.","Tice, Brown, Boyle, Martin, Castillo, Mumba","https://doi.org/10.1177/10783903221096341","20220517","full practice authority; health care access; mental health care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31554,""
"Study protocol to test the efficacy of self-administration of dexmedetomidine sedative therapy on anxiety, delirium, and ventilator days in critically ill mechanically ventilated patients: an open-label randomized clinical trial","Administration of sedative and opioid medications to patients receiving mechanical ventilatory support in the intensive care unit is a common clinical practice. A two-site randomized open-label clinical trial will test the efficacy of self-management of sedative therapy with dexmedetomidine compared to usual care on anxiety, delirium, and duration of ventilatory support after randomization. Secondary objectives are to compare self-management of sedative therapy to usual care on level of alertness, total aggregate sedative and opioid medication exposure, and ventilator-free days up to day 28 after study enrolment. Exploratory objectives of the study are to compare self-management of sedative therapy to usual care on 3- and 6-month post-discharge physical and functional status, psychological well-being (depression, symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder), health-related quality of life, and recollections of ICU care. ICU patients (n = 190) who are alert enough to follow commands to self-manage sedative therapy are randomly assigned to self-management of sedative therapy or usual care. Patients remain in the ICU sedative medication study phase for up to 7 days as long as mechanically ventilated. The care of critically ill mechanically ventilated patients can change significantly over the course of a 5-year clinical trial. Changes in sedation and pain interventions, oxygenation approaches, and standards related to extubation have substantially impacted consistency in the number of eligible patients over time. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in mandated extended pauses in trial enrolment as well as alterations in recruitment methods out of concern for study personnel safety and availability of protective equipment. Patient triaging among healthcare institutions due to COVID-19 cases also has resulted in inconsistent access to the eligible study population. This has made it even more imperative for the study team to be flexible and innovative to identify and enrol all eligible participants. Patient-controlled sedation is a novel approach to the management of patient symptoms that may be able to alleviate mechanical ventilation-induced distress without serious side effects. Findings from this study will provide insight into the efficacy of this approach on short- and long-term outcomes in a subset of mechanically ventilated patients. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02819141.

"Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance in Children with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) Associated with COVID-19: Institutional Protocol-Based Medium-Term Follow-up Study","Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) secondary to COVID-19 infection in previously healthy children often results in subtle but persistent echocardiographic abnormalities despite complete clinical recovery. This study was done to investigate medium-term cardiovascular outcomes of patients with MIS-C using cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR). This is a single-center retrospective study of patients aged less than 21Ã‚Â years, diagnosed with MIS-C who received an outpatient CMR, around 6Ã‚Â months after discharge. CMR was done in patients with significant troponin leak or depressed LVEF. CMR performed on a GE Signa HDxt 1.5 Tesla magnet with a myocarditis protocol. Diagnosis of myocarditis was determined by the original Lake Louise Criteria. There were 21 patients with a median age of 11Ã‚Â years, (IQR 8-13Ã‚Â years), who underwent CMR at median follow-up duration of 6Ã‚Â months (IQR 5-7Ã‚Â months). At the peak of illness during admission, there were 95.2% patients with abnormal Troponin I and BNP. By echocardiogram, 76.2% had left ventricular systolic dysfunction and 9.5% had coronary ectasia, which all resolved by 6Ã‚Â months. By CMR, there were five patients (23.8%) with abnormal left atrial volume, one patient (4.8%) with an abnormal indexed left ventricular end-diastolic volume, and three patients (15%) with abnormal LVEF. There was no evidence of myocardial edema in T2-weighted image sequence. There were three patients with persistent late gadolinium enhancement (14.3%). Follow-up CMR is a useful tool in diagnosing subtle myocardial abnormalities and guide necessity for future follow-up.","Chakraborty, Philip, Santoso, Naik, Merlocco, Johnson","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00246-022-02927-8","20220516","COVID-19; Cardiovascular magnetic resonance; MIS-C; Myocarditis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31556,""
"Examining the impact of sharing COVID-19 misinformation online on mental health","Misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic proliferated widely on social media platforms during the course of the health crisis. Experts have speculated that consuming misinformation online can potentially worsen the mental health of individuals, by causing heightened anxiety, stress, and even suicidal ideation. The present study aims to quantify the causal relationship between sharing misinformation, a strong indicator of consuming misinformation, and experiencing exacerbated anxiety. We conduct a large-scale observational study spanning over 80 million Twitter posts made by 76,985 Twitter users during an 18.5 month period. The results from this study demonstrate that users who shared COVID-19 misinformation experienced approximately two times additional increase in anxiety when compared to similar users who did not share misinformation. Socio-demographic analysis reveals that women, racial minorities, and individuals with lower levels of education in the United States experienced a disproportionately higher increase in anxiety when compared to the other users. These findings shed light on the mental health costs of consuming online misinformation. The work bears practical implications for social media platforms in curbing the adverse psychological impacts of misinformation, while also upholding the ethos of an online public sphere.","Verma, Bhardwaj, Aledavood, De Choudhury, Kumar","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-11488-y","20220518","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31557,""
"COVID-19 Vaccines and Potential Implications for COVID-19-Specific Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Presentations","Public health crises, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, have wide reaching implications on mental health, and have resulted in unique OCD presentations specific to respective crises. The distribution of highly efficacious and effective vaccines for COVID-19 present a crossroads for the COVID-19-specific OCD presentation, including the potential for COVID-19 presentation perpetuation or remission in the face of vaccinations. Individual differences may play a unique role in who does and does not see a reduction of OCD symptoms specific to this virus as a function of vaccination status. Here, we discuss prior health crises that have resulted in unique OCD presentations, review relevant assessment and intervention guidelines, discuss potential implications that vaccines may have on this COVID-19-specifc presentation, and provide case presentations and future recommendations for treatment providers and researchers.","Wiese, Wojcik, Omar","https://doi.org/10.1891/JCP-2021-0019","20220518","COVID-19; COVID-19 vaccination; COVID-19-specific OCD; SARS-CoV-2 and obsessive-compulsive disorder; obsessive-compulsive disorder; obsessive-compulsive disorder concern with germs","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31558,""
"Clinician Perspectives on the Impact of COVID-19 on the Treatment of Adults and Youth with Anxiety","We describe the perceptions of mental health clinicians practicing in the United States about the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the presentation and treatment course of active clients with anxiety. Clinician participants reported on client symptomology at the beginning of treatment, just before (prior to March 2020), and at a mid-pandemic timepoint (December 2020/January 2021). An initial sample of 70 clinicians responded to a survey assessing their clients' overall anxiety severity, anxiety sensitivity, pathological uncertainty, family accommodation, and avoidance levels. Of these, 54 clinician responses were included in study analyses, providing detailed clinical information on 81 clients. Findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with increases in anxiety severity in the majority of clients; overall, clinicians reported that 53% of clients had symptoms worsen due to COVID-19 and that only 16% experienced improvement of symptoms during treatment. Those who had lower levels of avoidance pre-pandemic and those who increased their frequency of treatment were more likely to experience increases in anxiety severity by the mid-pandemic timepoint. Further research is needed to understand the extended effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on anxiety symptomology and treatment.","Dickinson, Clinger, Leong, Amos Nwankwo, Olsen, Cepeda, Geralnik, Wu, Guzick, Schneider, Storch","https://doi.org/10.1891/JCP-2021-0035","20220516","COVID-19; anxiety; cognitive-behavioral therapy; generalized anxiety disorder; pandemic; treatment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31559,""
"Association of mental health with clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients with moderate COVID-19","To assess the association of depression and anxiety with clinical outcomes and laboratory markers among hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A prospective cohort study in Wuhan, China was conducted in 205 adult hospitalized patients with a diagnosis of moderate coronavirus disease from admission through discharge or death. Anxiety and depression were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The primary outcome was the incidence of severe or critical COVID-19, and the secondary outcomes were increased length of hospital stay and altered laboratory markers during follow up. Among the 205 hospitalized patients (mean age 58Ã¢â‚¬Â¯years; 51.7% male), 25 (12.2%) developed severe or critical COVID-19. According to the HADS scores, 51 (24.9%) and 92 (44.9%) of participants presented with clinically significant anxiety and depression, respectively. Using multi-variable adjusted Cox regression analysis, the adjusted hazard ratio of developing severe or critical COVID-19 associated with anxiety and depression was 1.55 (95% CI: 0.63, 3.80) and 4.28 (95% CI: 1.20, 15.30), respectively. The risk of developing severe or critical COVID-19 with both anxiety and depression was more than four times higher than in patients without anxiety or depression (HR, 4.05; 95% CI: 1.02, 16.00). In addition, both the trends of depression and anxiety were positively associated with a prolonged duration of hospitalization, and immune response was significantly decreased in patients with depression than those without. In patients having coronavirus disease, depression was associated with worse clinical outcomes. These findings highlight the importance of prevention and management of mental health problems in confronting the COVID-19 pandemic.","Li, Zhang, Cai, Lu, Bao, Rong","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.05.047","20220516","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Epidemiology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31560,""
"Information technology-based versus face-to-face cognitive-behavioural therapy for anxiety and depression: A systematic review and meta-analysis","We aimed to systematically review the efficacy of information technology-based cognitive behavioural therapy (ICBT) versus face-to-face cognitive behavioural therapy (FCBT) for management of anxiety and depression in adult patients. Systematic literature search for clinical trials comparing ICBT to FCBT in adults diagnosed with anxiety or depression was conducted. Quantitative analyses were performed to examine the efficacy of ICBT versus FCBT. Primacy outcome was change in symptom severity. A total of 11 publications (10 studies and 896 participants) were included. The pooled effect size of ICBT versus FCBT did not find significant difference for post-treatment anxiety or depressive symptoms severity (Hedges' gÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯-0.07; 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯-0.20 to 0.06), and ICBT was non-inferior to FCBT (at Cohen's dÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.3). Maintenance of treatment efficacy also showed no significant difference between ICBT and FCBT at 6Ã¢â‚¬Â¯months (gÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯-0.14, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯-0.42 to 0.14) and 12Ã¢â‚¬Â¯months (gÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯-0.05, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯-0.41 to 0.32) post-treatment. Adherence rate was lower in ICBT than FCBT but did not achieve statistically significance (61% vs 88%; RRÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.86, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.74 to1.00). Results were not affected by study quality. The examination of study heterogeneity was limited by the small number of studies. We found non-inferior performance of ICBT versus FCBT in reducing symptoms in patients diagnosed of anxiety or depressive disorders. With the social-distancing measures amid COVID-19 pandemic, service providers should give serious consideration with great caution in the decision-making process of offering ICBT to patients.","Chow, Jiang, You","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.05.048","20220516","Anxiety; Cognitive behavioural therapy; Depression; Face-to-face; Information technology; Internet","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31561,""
"Affective experiences during COVID-19 pandemic lockdown and posttraumatic growth: A 1-year longitudinal study in France","The COVID-19 crisis has resulted in major restrictions on daily life that are undeniably detrimental to individual wellbeing. Nevertheless, there may be positive psychological changes over the longer term, particularly in the form of posttraumatic growth (PTG). A total of 1075 individuals representative of the French population took part in an online survey during the first lockdown (T1: March to May 2020) and 1Ã¢â‚¬Â¯year later (T2). Their affective experiences at T1 were analyzed, together with the development of PTG at T2. Three affective profiles were identified at T1: one associated with feelings of loneliness and depressive symptoms (Loneliness cluster), one with positive feelings (Happiness cluster), and one with rather negative feelings of anger and fear, but also a feeling of happiness (Negative-moderate cluster). PTG was generally low at T2, with the Negative-moderate cluster achieving the highest score. This study was based on an online survey, and an exploratory cluster analysis was conducted. Complementary studies should be conducted to determine the predictive value of our findings. Within the space of 1Ã¢â‚¬Â¯year following the first lockdown due to COVID-19, people living in France, especially those who had experienced a mixture of feelings during lockdown, appeared to develop some form of PTG. Nevertheless, PTG was rather weak overall.","Goutaudier, Martinelli, ChevalÃƒÂ¨re, Dezecache, Belletier, Huguet, Droit-Volet, Gil","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.05.056","20220516","Affective experiences of lockdown; COVID-19; Posttraumatic growth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31562,""
"Social Engagement and Distress among Home Care Recipients during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Ontario, Canada: A Retrospective Cohort Study","To examine factors associated with distressing social decline and withdrawal during the COVID-19 pandemic for home care recipients. Retrospective cohort. Home care recipients age 18Ã‚Â years or older in Ontario, Canada without severe cognitive impairment with an assessment and follow-up between September 1, 2018 and August 31,Ã‚Â 2020. Data were collected using the interRAI home care. Outcomes of interest were distressing decline in social participation and social withdrawal. Independent variables were entered into multivariable longitudinal generalized estimating equations. Interaction terms with the pandemic were tested. Those significant at P &lt; .01 were retained in final models and reported as odds ratios (ORs), 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We compared 26,492 and 19,126 home care recipients before and during the pandemic, respectively. The pandemic was associated with greater odds of experiencing distressing social decline (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.22Ã¢â‚¬â€™1.34) and withdrawal (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.04Ã¢â‚¬â€™1.15). Living alone (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.05Ã¢â‚¬â€™1.22), frailty (OR 3.21, 95% CI 2.76Ã¢â‚¬â€™3.73), health instability (OR 2.22, 95% CI 2.02Ã¢â‚¬â€™2.44), and depression (OR 2.14, 95% CI 2.01Ã¢â‚¬â€™2.29) increased the odds of distressing social decline.

"The Effect of Creative Arts Therapy on Psychological Distress in Healthcare Professionals","Work-related psychological distress is common among healthcare professionals. We determined whether four creative arts therapy (CAT) programs were acceptable, feasible, and improved psychological distress and job turnover intention in healthcare professionals with burnout symptoms. Healthcare professionals were enrolled during the COVID-19 pandemic from September 2020 until July 2021. Participants attended in-person weekly 90-minute group session for 12 consecutive weeks. Intervention and control subjects completed surveys before the beginning and after the end of their cohort. The study outcomes were session attendance (feasibility), program satisfaction (acceptability), and change in symptoms of anxiety, depression, burnout, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and job turnover intention. We randomized 165 participants into four CAT interventions and one common control group across three sequential cohorts. Thirty-five randomized participants dropped out before the start of the cohort, and 16 were replaced from a waiting list. Therefore, the cohort consisted of 146 participants. On average, participants were 35 years old, white (85%), and female (92%). Overall, 52% were nurses, 10% were doctors, and 16% were behavioral health specialists. Participants attended a median of 9.5 [8-11] sessions. Program satisfaction was high with a median Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8) score of 31 [17-32] out of a possible score of 32. Participants randomized to the intervention had improvements in anxiety (p&lt;0.0001) and depression scores (p=0.0007), total PTSD score (p=0.0002), burnout scores (p= 0.001, 0.003, 0.008), and turnover intention (p=0.001).

"Remote Healthcare Program in Mexico in the Context of the COVID-19 Pandemic","Given the challenge of limiting the transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 while simultaneously continuing to provide medical care for other chronic and degenerative diseases and monitor therapy, a remote medical advice and guidance program was created to help individuals receive health services at their homes. A descriptive, cross-sectional, and observational study was performed from April 13, 2020 to April 19, 2021 among Petroleos Mexicanos (PEMEX) health services beneficiaries. Mobile text messages were used to assign patients throughout Mexico to a doctor, who coordinated a video call with the nursing service for advice and remote care. In total, 17,472 calls were registered, with an average duration of 10.28 minutes. Almost half (49.4%) of the people who requested attention through the remote program were workers, 31.5% were workers' relatives, and 19.1% were retired workers. The average age of the program users was 50.66 Ã‚Â± 18.02 years. A total of 144 doctors from 28 different specialties participated. In this program, 7,163 calls were made because of respiratory symptoms, 1,514 for therapeutic monitoring (prescriptions), and 8,183 because of other diseases, including mental health.

"Lifestyle behaviours and mental health and wellbeing of tertiary students during COVID-19 lockdown in Australia: A cross-sectional study","Australia experienced significant COVID-19 lockdown restrictions throughout 2020 that had an impact on mental health and disrupted health-promoting lifestyle behaviours. Lockdowns may have exacerbated existing mental health concerns among tertiary students, who experience higher levels of mental health concerns compared to the wider community. This study aimed to investigate the association between modifiable lifestyle factors and wellbeing of students at a Melbourne-based tertiary education institution during COVID-19 lockdown. This quantitative, cross-sectional study was conducted across campuses in Melbourne and Sydney. Data was collected via online questionnaire during the 7th week of a second-wave lockdown. Descriptive statistics were calculated for demographic variables (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 239). Linear regression models were estimated to determine multivariate associations between lifestyle variables and psychological distress. Participants were on average 30.98Ã‚Â years old (SDÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 9.78), predominantly female, domestic students, undergraduate, not the first member of their family to attend university and living out of family home. Mindfulness, diet quality, sleep quality and moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) were all inversely correlated with psychological distress. Unadjusted and adjusted models show that mindfulness, sleep quality, and MVPA were all independently inversely related to psychological distress. Greater mindfulness, sleep quality and engagement in MVPA were associated with lower psychological distress during COVID-19 lockdowns. As this study is cross-sectional and we cannot rule out reverse causality. This study highlights the potential for lifestyle focused mental-health promotion delivered through tertiary education institutions to support students in times of crisis as well as more generally.","Dash, Bourke, Parker, Dadswell, Pascoe","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comppsych.2022.152324","20220518","COVID-19 pandemic, students; Mental health; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31566,""
"Effects of Healthcare Organization Actions and Policies Related to COVID-19 on Perceived Organizational Support Among US Internists: A National Study","Perceived organizational support (POS) may promote healthcare worker mental health, but organizational factors that foster POS during the COVID-19 pandemic are unknown. The goals of this study were to identify actions and policies regarding COVID-19 that healthcare organizations can implement to promote POS and to evaluate the impact of POS on physicians' mental health, burnout, and intention to leave patient care. We conducted a cross-sectional national survey with an online panel of internal medicine physicians from the American College of Physicians in September and October of 2020. POS was measured with a 4-item scale, based on items from Eisenberger's Perceived Organizational Support Scale that were adapted for the pandemic. Mental health outcomes and burnout were measured with short screening scales. The response rate was 37.8% (N = 810). Three healthcare organization actions and policies were independently associated with higher levels of POS in a multiple linear regression model that included all actions and policies as well as potential confounding factors: opportunities to discuss ethical issues related to COVID-19 (ÃŽÂ² (regression coefficient) = 0.74, p = .001), adequate access to personal protective equipment (ÃŽÂ² = 1.00, p = .005), and leadership that listens to healthcare worker concerns regarding COVID-19 (ÃŽÂ² = 3.58, p &lt; .001). Sanctioning workers who speak out on COVID-19 safety issues or refuse pandemic deployment was associated with lower POS (ÃŽÂ² = -2.06, p &lt; .001). In multivariable logistic regression models, high POS was associated with approximately half the odds of screening positive for generalized anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, burnout, and intention to leave patient care within 5 years. Our results suggest that healthcare organizations may be able to increase POS among physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic by guaranteeing adequate personal protective equipment, making sure that leaders listen to concerns about COVID-19, and offering opportunities to discuss ethical concerns related to caring for patients with COVID-19. Other policies and actions such as rapid COVID-19 tests may be implemented for the safety of staff and patients, but the policies and actions associated with POS in multivariable models in this study are likely to have the largest positive impact on POS. Warning or sanctioning workers who refuse pandemic deployment or speak up about worker and patient safety is associated with lower POS and should be avoided. We also found that high degrees of POS are associated with lower rates of adverse outcomes. So, by implementing the tangible support policies positively associated with POS and avoiding punitive ones, healthcare organizations may be able to reduce adverse mental health outcomes and attrition among their physicians.","Sonis, Pathman, Read, Gaynes, Canter, Curran, Jones, Miller","https://doi.org/10.1097/JHM-D-21-00208","20220518","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31567,""
"Pregnancy and the Risk of In-Hospital Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Mortality","To evaluate whether pregnancy is an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality among patients of reproductive age hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) viral pneumonia. We conducted a retrospective cohort study (April 2020-May 2021) of 23,574 female inpatients aged 15-45 years with an International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis code for COVID-19 discharged from 749 U.S. hospitals in the Premier Healthcare Database. We used a viral pneumonia diagnosis to select for patients with symptomatic COVID-19. The associations between pregnancy and in-hospital mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mechanical ventilation were analyzed using propensity score-matched conditional logistic regression. Models were matched for age, marital status, race and ethnicity, Elixhauser comorbidity score, payer, hospital number of beds, season of discharge, hospital region, obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic pulmonary disease, deficiency anemias, depression, hypothyroidism, and liver disease. In-hospital mortality occurred in 1.1% of pregnant patients and 3.5% of nonpregnant patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and viral pneumonia (propensity score-matched odds ratio [OR] 0.39, 95% CI 0.25-0.63). The frequency of ICU admission for pregnant and nonpregnant patients was 22.0% and 17.7%, respectively (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.15-1.55). Mechanical ventilation was used in 8.7% of both pregnant and nonpregnant patients (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.86-1.29). Among patients who were admitted to an ICU, mortality was lower for pregnant compared with nonpregnant patients (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.20-0.57), though mechanical ventilation rates were similar (35.7% vs 38.3%, OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.70-1.16). Among patients with mechanical ventilation, pregnant patients had a reduced risk of in-hospital mortality compared with nonpregnant patients (0.26, 95% CI 0.15-0.46). Despite a higher frequency of ICU admission, in-hospital mortality was lower among pregnant patients compared with nonpregnant patients with COVID-19 viral pneumonia, and these findings persisted after propensity score matching.","Pineles, Goodman, Pineles, O'Hara, Nadimpalli, Magder, Baghdadi, Parchem, Harris","https://doi.org/10.1097/AOG.0000000000004744","20220518","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31568,""
"A national study of moral distress among US internal medicine physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic","There have been no studies to date of moral distress during the COVID-19 pandemic in national samples of U.S. health workers. The purpose of this study was to determine, in a national sample of internal medicine physicians (internists) in the U.S.: 1) the intensity of moral distress; 2) the predictors of moral distress; 3) the outcomes of moral distress. We conducted a national survey with an online panel of internists, representative of the membership of the American College of Physicians, the largest specialty organization of physicians in the United States, between September 21 and October 8, 2020. Moral distress was measured with the Moral Distress Thermometer, a one-item scale with a range of 0 (""none"") to 10 (""worst possible""). Outcomes were measured with short screening scales. The response rate was 37.8% (N = 810). Moral distress intensity was low (mean score = 2.4, 95% CI, 2.2-2.6); however, 13.3% (95% CI, 12.1% - 14.5%) had a moral distress score greater than or equal to 6 (""distressing""). In multiple linear regression models, perceived risk of death if infected with COVID-19 was the strongest predictor of higher moral distress (ÃŽÂ² (standardized regression coefficient) = 0.26, p &lt; .001), and higher perceived organizational support (respondent belief that their health organization valued them) was most strongly associated with lower moral distress (ÃŽÂ² = -0.22, p &lt; .001). Controlling for other factors, high levels of moral distress, but not low levels, were strongly associated (adjusted odds ratios 3.0 to 11.5) with screening positive for anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, burnout, and intention to leave patient care. The intensity of moral distress among U.S. internists was low overall. However, the 13% with high levels of moral distress had very high odds of adverse mental health outcomes. Organizational support may lower moral distress and thereby prevent adverse mental health outcomes.","Sonis, Pathman, Read, Gaynes","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0268375","20220518","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31569,""
"The associations of long-COVID symptoms, clinical characteristics and affective psychological constructs in a non-hospitalized cohort","The effects of COVID-19, especially long-COVID, on the psychological health is incompletely understood. We aimed to evaluate the mid-term associations of the long-COVID symptoms and affective factors in a cohort of non-hospitalized patients. A total of 166 patients were enrolled in this study, including 119 sedentary/non-athlete and 47 athlete subjects at the Post-COVID Outpatient Clinic of Semmelweis University. Clinical data regarding acute and long-term symptoms were obtained and detailed laboratory testing was carried out. Demographic data and psychological tests were collected. We found a positive association between the level of depressive symptoms and anxiety and long-COVID symptom count, while life satisfaction and social support correlated negatively with the long-COVID symptom count. Higher haemoglobin levels and lower LDL-cholesterol were also shown to be moderating factors. A regression model showed that symptoms during acute infection, depression, age, and life satisfaction are predictors of the long-COVID symptom count. The presence of pre-existing affective or anxiety problems was also associated with higher reported long-COVID symptom count. Furthermore, we found significant association between pre-existing mental health problems and the investigated psychological constructs. It appears that long COVID-19 is associated with acute symptoms and mental factors. Depression and anxiety have been shown to have a negative effect on symptom perception, and also contribute to a higher number of symptoms in a non-hospitalized sample. Our study suggests bi-directional interconnection between clinical and psychological factors.","Ocsovszky, Otohal, BerÃƒÂ©nyi, JuhÃƒÂ¡sz, Skoda, Bokor, Dohy, SzabÃƒÂ³, Nagy, Becker, Merkely, VÃƒÂ¡gÃƒÂ³","https://doi.org/10.1556/2060.2022.00030","20220516","COVID-19; PTSD; affective symptoms; blood test; perceived social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31570,""
"Let's color: An online coloring game improves subjective well-being and reduces anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic","Coronavirus Disease 2019 has spread worldwide and generated tremendous stress on human beings. Unfortunately, it is often hard for distressed individuals to access mental health services under conditions of restricted movement or even lockdown. In this research, we developed an online coloring game and tested its effectiveness as an accessible and engaging instrument for maintaining subjective well-being (SWB) as well as for reducing anxiety during the pandemic. The study first aims to develop an online digital intervention package on a commercial released coloring game. The second aim is to test the effectiveness of difference interventions package for players to maintain SWB and reduce anxiety during the pandemic. An evidence-based coloring intervention package was developed and uploaded to an online coloring game covering almost 1.5 million players worldwide in January 2021. Global players participated to color either four rounds of images characterized by awe, pink, nature, and blue or four rounds of irrelevant images. Participants' subjective well-being (SWB), anxiety, and perceived effectiveness of the game in reducing anxiety (subjective effectiveness, SE) were assessed one week before the intervention (T1), after completing pictures in each round (T2-T5), and after the intervention (T6). Independent t-tests were used to examine the general intervention effect and the intervention effect of each round. One-way ANOVA was used to examine whether these outcome variables were influenced by the number of rounds completed. In total, 1390 global players responded and completed at least one assessment. Overall, the general intervention group showed a statistical significantly greater increase in SWB than the general control group (N=164, t=3.59, Cohen's d 0.58[95% CI 0.36 to -1.24], P&lt;0.001). Compared to the control group, the best effectiveness of intervention group showed in the Awe round, in which the increasing of SWB is significant (N=171, t=2.51, Cohen's d 0.39[95% CI 0.10 to -0.82], P=0.013), and players who colored all four pictures had nearly significant improvement in SWB (N=171, F(4,170)=2.34, Ã…â€¹2=0.053, P=0.058) and a significant decrease in anxiety(N=171, F(4,170)=3Ã‚Â·39, Ã…â€¹2=0Ã‚Â·075, P=0.011). These data suggest that the effectiveness of online psychological interventions, such as coloring game, for mental health in the special period. It shows the feasibility of applying existing commercial games embedded scientific psychological interventions that can fill the gap of mental crises and services for a wider group of people during the pandemic. The result would inspire the innovations of against the psychological problems caused by public emergencies, and encourages more games, especially most popular ones, to take more positive action for the common crisis of mankind.","Xi, Gao, Lyu, She, Wang, Zhang, Yu, Ji, Wei, Dai, Qian","https://doi.org/10.2196/37026","20220516","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31571,""
"Self-poisonings before and during the initial year of the COVID-19 pandemic in northern Poland","The objectives of this study included evaluating and reporting on the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and preventive measures in the form of a lockdown on self-poisoning tendencies in northern Poland. The authors retrospectively analyzed medical records of all patients (N = 2990) admitted to the Pomeranian Center of Toxicology in 2018-2020. Of those, further analysis included 2140 patients who had been admitted because of a suicide attempt by self-poisoning. The authors also selected a group of 40 patients on the basis of a self-reported direct relationship of the suicide attempt with the COVID-19 pandemic or the imposed lockdown. The rates of suicide attempts in toxicological patients over the years ranged 68.18-75.3%. The patients were predominantly female, with age between MÃ‚Â±SD 33.2Ã‚Â±16.9 and 36.0Ã‚Â±16.4. Each year, over 60% of patients were admitted during their first attempt and were treated psychiatrically prior to their attempt, with differences observed in the COVID-19-related group. The alcohol intoxication during the suicide attempt was confirmed in 37.40-43.53% of the patients, with a higher rate of 52.50% observed in the COVID-19-related group. The main self-reported reason for the suicide was a romantic relationship conflict or breakup, and a conflict and/or violence in the family. The most frequent agents were over-the-counter painkillers, antidepressants, antipsychotics and benzodiazepines or Z-drugs. During the initial year of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a fall of suicide attempts by self-poisonings in northern Poland, significant only in the case of women. The self-reported reasons were similar in all years, with mainly minor changes. There was also an increase in attempts made using benzodiazepines or Z-drugs seen in 2020 and in the COVID-19-related group. The authors believe that there is a need for multi-center, large-scale prospective studies that would provide better insight into the pandemic-related suicidal trends.","Sein Anand, Sein Anand","https://doi.org/10.13075/ijomeh.1896.01838","20220516","COVID-19; pandemic; psychiatry; self-poisoning; suicide attempts; toxicology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31572,""

"Rhode Island's Response for COVID-Positive Individuals Experiencing Homelessness and Housing Insecurity: A Qualitative Process Evaluation","From March-June 2020, Rhode Island utilized a 209-room hotel as a quarantine/isolation (Q/I) facility for COVID-positive individuals experiencing homelessness or housing insecurity. This qualitative study used semi-structured interviews to explore experiences of key stakeholders in designing and implementing the intervention. Four major themes emerged from the data analysis: 1) the isolative nature of Q/I housing tended to negatively affect residents' mental health, 2) the addition of medical oversight was a key positive development for the intervention, 3) the security presence involved in the response tended to exacerbate residents' mental health challenges, and 4) COVID-19 and this Q/I response highlighted homelessness itself as a public health crisis that must be addressed.

"Care burden, loneliness, and social isolation in caregivers of people with physical and brain health conditions in English-speaking regions: Before and during the COVID-19 pandemic","Public health restrictions due to the COVID-19 (SARS CoV-2) pandemic have disproportionately affected informal caregivers of people living with long term health conditions. We aimed to explore levels of care burden, loneliness, and social isolation among caregivers of people with enduring physical and brain health conditions in English-speaking regions worldwide, by investigating outcomes before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional anonymous online survey data from 2287 English-speaking caregivers of people with long term health conditions from four English-speaking regions (UK, Ireland, USA, New Zealand) included measures of care burden, loneliness, and social isolation, reported before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Analyses were descriptive, followed by an ordinal regression model for predictors of burden. Compared to pre-pandemic levels, all caregivers experienced a significant increase in burden, loneliness, and isolation. Caregivers of people with both brain health and physical conditions were the most burdened and had the highest levels of loneliness and isolation compared to caregivers of people with either a brain health or physical condition only. The increase in care burden among caregivers of people with brain health challenges was associated with caregiver's gender, moderate and severe emotional loneliness, magnitude and frequency of isolation during the pandemic, and care circumstances (cohabitation with the care recipient, restrictions on the ability to provide care). Health and social care interventions should target caregivers' care circumstances and psychological outcomes, particularly in women, accounting for the significant additional burden of care, loneliness, and isolation resulting from pandemic-related restrictions.","Grycuk, Chen, Almirall-Sanchez, Higgins, Galvin, Kane, Kinchin, Lawlor, Rogan, Russell, O'Sullivan, Leroi","https://doi.org/10.1002/gps.5734","20220517","COVID-19; Caregiver burden; brain health; brain health conditions; caregivers; dementia; loneliness; mental health; mental illness; social isolation; Brain; COVID-19; Caregiver Burden; Caregivers; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Loneliness; Pandemics; Social Isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31575,""
"Trauma-informed mental health practice during COVID-19: Reflections from a Community of Practice initiative","This article discusses insights arising from a Community of Practice (CoP) initiative within a mental health short stay inpatient unit adjacent to a major Emergency Department to explore how COVID-19 has influenced engagement and support of people in mental distress. The present initiative was designed as a collaboration between the University of South Australia and SA Health. Community of Practice (CoP) is combined with a narrative review of current evidence to explain specific nursing care responses within an operating environment of pandemic-induced fear and uncertainty. Meetings discussed the challenges associated with delivering mental health care for people experiencing mental health distress in the COVID-19 context. Applying trauma-informed principles to mental health care delivery was identified to be of relevance in the context of an ongoing pandemic. Humanizing nursing care and increasing people's sense of predictability and safety contributed to therapeutic engagement and support during COVID-19. Factors discussed to mitigate the effects of safety measures include, for example, nuanced verbal and non-verbal engagement of health workers with people in mental distress when wearing personal protective equipment (PPE). We highlight the need to 'humanise' nursing and openly communicating that both practitioners and people in distress are navigating special circumstances. The CoP participants additionally acknowledged that the experience of moral distress among frontline health workers needs to be addressed in future policy responses to COVID-19. Person-centred and trauma-informed responses at the point of care might help to mitigate the pandemic short- and long-term effects for both service users and frontline health workers.","Macedo, Reilly, Pettit, Negoita, Ruth, Cox, Staugas, Procter","https://doi.org/10.1111/inm.13013","20220516","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; mental health nursing; mental health recovery; psychosocial nursing; trauma-informed practice","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31576,""
"Hydroxychloroquine safety in Covid-19 vs non-Covid-19 patients: analysis of differences and potential interactions","The use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in the first COVID-19 epidemic wave raised concerns about its safety. All the adverse reactions (ADR) suspected to be induced by HCQ and submitted to the Spanish Pharmacovigilance Database were studied. A disproportionality analysis was performed to determine adverse effects reported with non-Covid and Covid patients. To explore potential drug-drug interactions, Omega (ÃŽÂ©) statistics was calculated. More severe cases were reported when used in COVID-19. Main differences in frequency were observed in hepatobiliary, skin, gastrointestinal, eye, nervous system and heart ADRs. During the COVID-19 pandemic, high disproportionality in reports was found for Torsade de Pointes/QT prolongation with a ROR (-ROR) of 132.8 (76.7); severe hepatotoxicity, 18.7 (14.7); dyslipidaemias, 12.1 (6.1); shock, 9.5 (6.9) and ischaemic colitis, 8.9 (2.6). Myopathies, haemolytic disorders and suicidal behaviour increased their disproportionality during the pandemic. Disproportionality was observed for neoplasms, haematopoietic cytopaenias and interstitial lung disease in the pre-COVID-19 period. Potential interactions were showed between HCQ and azithromycin, ceftriaxone, lopinavir and tocilizumab. The way in which HCQ has been used during the Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in a change in the profile of spontaneous reporting HCQ-related ADR in Spain. Of particular concern during the pandemic were arrhythmias, hepatotoxicity, severe skin reactions and suicide risk, but not ocular disorders. Some of the new ADRs identified will require more detailed analyses.","Sainz-Gil, Merino Kolly, Velasco-GonzÃƒÂ¡lez, Verde Rello, Fernandez-Araque, Sanz Fadrique, MartÃƒÂ­n Arias","https://doi.org/10.1080/14740338.2022.2078303","20220516","COVID-19; adverse drug reactions; hydroxychloroquine; pharmacovigilance; safety profile","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31577,""
"DRD4 polymorphism associated with greater positive affect in response to negative and neutral social stimuli","Despite the robustness of DRD4 polymorphism associations with brain-based behavioral characteristics in candidate gene research, investigations have minimally explored associations between these polymorphisms and emotional responses. In particular, the prevalent single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) -521C/T (rs1800955) in the promoter region of DRD4 remains unexplored relative to emotions. Here, two independent samples were evaluated using different emotion elicitation tasks involving social stimuli: Study 1 (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 120) evoked positive and negative emotional responses to validated film clips; Study 2 (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 122) utilized Cyberball to simulate social rejection and acceptance. Across studies, C/C individuals self-reported higher mean positive affect scores using Likert scales versus T carrier individuals, selectively when presented with neutral or negative (but not positive) social stimuli. The consistent findings across these two studies supports a functional consequence of this DRD4 SNP on emotion processing during changing social contexts. Continued investigation will help clarify if a C/C genotype enhances positive emotions under negative circumstances, or if the presence of the T allele reduces positive emotions, and how rs1800955 behavioral associations might generalize across different demographics. Future studies could also reveal if this SNP interacts with other changing environmental conditions to affect emotional responses, such as social limitations during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Gilman, Ford, Jasnow, Coifman","https://doi.org/10.1111/ahg.12471","20220516","affect; dopamine; emotions; mental health; ostracism; polymorphism; receptors; single nucleotide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31578,""
"More than a year of pandemic: Longitudinal assessment of anxiety and depressive symptoms in the Argentine general population during the COVID-19 outbreak","The COVID-19 pandemic has radically changed daily life and the way we interact with others. It has also brought negative psychological consequences: several studies have reported increased levels of distress symptomatology at the onset of the pandemic. However, few longitudinal studies have been carried out, and even fewer in low- and middle-income countries. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze longitudinally the anxiety and depressive symptomatology of the Argentine general population during the first thirteen months of the pandemic. The total sample included 988 adults (ages 18 -77) from different regions of Argentina. Open-access surveys were distributed via social media at five time points (March, April, May, August 2020 and April 2021). Depression and anxiety symptoms were assessed through the Beck Depression Inventory-II and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Mixed repeated-measures ANOVA were applied, with time as a within-subjects factor, and socioeconomic status, gender, and age group as between-subjects factors. Results showed a progressive increases in anxiety (F (27.78, 3417.60) = 62.88, p &lt; .01, ÃŽÂ·p2 = .060) and depression (F <sub>(3.42, 3373.75)</sub> = 84.78, p &lt; .01, ÃŽÂ·p<sup>2</sup> = .079) symptoms in the general population throughout the pandemic (except for a slight decrease in anxiety in Wave 2). All of the between-subjects factors showed significant effects on both types of symptoms: female gender, younger age and lower income were associated with greater depression and anxiety in all waves. A time-age interaction effect was found (F <sub>(10.26, 3364.05)</sub> = 2.99, p &lt; .01, ÃŽÂ·p<sup>2</sup> = .009): after the third wave, depressive symptoms tended to decrease or stabilize in the young adult group, whereas there was a positive linear increase in the older groups. This study provided evidence that anxiety and depression symptoms tend to increase during crisis contexts, and that this effect is even more pronounced for certain vulnerable population groups.

"Stress level of dentists during COVID-19 pandemic in hot spots of Tamil Nadu: A cross-sectional study","The novel 2019 COVID-19 spreads by respiratory and aerosols, and this elevates the risk of dentistry during this pandemic. Widespread disease, in a short time, creates stress and has a psychological impact. The aim of this study was planned to assess the stress level of the dentists living or practicing or studying in hot spots which could help to understand mental status among the general dentists during COVID-19 lockdown. This cross-sectional study was conducted during the period of August 10 to August 25, 2020, on an Internet platform after getting consent from the dentists and practitioners using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Chi-square association was used. Parametric tests such as independent <i>t</i>-tests and one-way ANOVA were also used. In all instances, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. This study had a total response from 1044 dental students and dentists residing in hot spot zones in Tamil Nadu.

"Comparative assessment of factors affecting anxiety levels among adults attending online meditation sessions during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study","The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic induced the governments around the world to impose harsher preventive measures like stay at home order, lock down etc., to contain the spread of infection. This measure increased the stress of the general population through isolation of masses, loss of employment, and loss of recreation. There is a dearth of quality data showing anxiety levels among the population and association of novel nonpharmaceutical measures such as online meditation with it. The study is a cross-sectional comparative study based on an online survey. The study population included 74 adult participants, out of which 30, included in the study group were attending structured online meditation sessions and 44 of the participants as a comparison group after matching age, gender, location of residence, and socioeconomic status.

The COVID-19 pandemic has posed significant problems in a variety of fields. The current pandemic created many changes that are seen as challenges worldwide. However, it created opportunities and benefits for many, extend a helping hand towards the people in need, in the society, community, and the nation. This paper focuses on challenges, opportunities, and benefits during the (COVID-19) pandemic in India. Online search engines like PubMed and Google Scholar were used to conduct the research. The review article's dates were not restricted in any way. A total of 48 articles were chosen. The data was tabulated based on the kind of study and the outcomes. There are just a few papers available that demonstrate the necessity for more study. COVID-19 caused unforeseen changes in the health care industry, unequal distribution of health care, and consequences on mental health, according to the review studies. Teleconsultation, Internet use, and E-learning have all become more accessible. A period of transitory economic collapse and an increase in the number of migrants left many despondent. Improvement in family bonding, use of a face mask, and hygiene measures to adapt to the current scenario. There was also an impact on water sources, waste management systems, and environmental resource conservation. Difficult conditions can provide both problems and opportunities and advantages to the people during a pandemic outbreak.","Khlem, Kannappan, Choudhury","https://doi.org/10.4103/jehp.jehp_1397_21","20220516","Acute respiratory syndrome; challenges; coronavirus; coronavirus disease-19; coronavirus infections; opportunities; pandemics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31584,""
"Factors Associated With Prolonged Psychological Distress Among Nurses and Physicians Engaged in COVID-19 Patient Care in Singapore and Japan","This study explores the factors contributing to the prolonged psychological distress of frontline nurses and physicians caring for COVID-19 patients in hospitals in Singapore and Japan. A cross-sectional survey between September and December 2020 yielded 1,644 responses (23.8%), from 62 nurses and 64 physicians in Singapore and 1,280 nurses and 238 physicians in Japan. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that significant risk factors for prolonged psychological distress included being a frontline nurse [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 2.40, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.24-4.66], having an underlying medical condition (aOR = 1.74, 95% CI: 1.22-2.46), experiencing prejudice because they undertook COVID-19 patient care (aOR = 3.05, 95% CI: 2.23-4.18), having trouble dealing with panicked or uncooperative patients (aOR = 2.36, 95% CI: 1.71-3.25), and experiencing an outbreak of COVID-19 in the hospital (aOR = 2.05, 95% CI: 1.38-3.04). Factors inversely associated with psychological distress included age (OR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.97-1.00), number of beds in the hospital (aOR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.57-0.94), clinical practice of carefully putting on and taking off personal protective equipment in daily COVID-19 patient care (aOR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.37-0.73), and knowledge on COVID-19 (aOR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.72-0.94). These results could help us identify vulnerable healthcare providers who need urgent mental care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Measures that may reduce psychological strain include adequate supply of medical resources, education on precautionary measures, and communication strategies to combat discrimination against frontline healthcare providers.","Morioka, Tan, Kikuchi, Asai, Suzuki, Ashida, Kutsuna, Saito, Hayakawa, Tan, Kodama, Ohmagari","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.781796","20220516","coronavirus disease 2019; cross-sectional survey; healthcare providers; mental health; pandemic; psychological distress; quarantine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31585,""
"A Positive Legacy of Trauma? The Role of Perceived Social Support on Mental Health Among Earthquake Survivors During the COVID-19 Outbreak","People with prior experience of severe trauma may be particularly vulnerable in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, little is known about mental health problems among prior trauma survivors during the pandemic outbreak. A total of 362 Wenchuan earthquake survivors were assessed using Patient Health Questionnaire, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, as well as Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, as part of an online survey between February 3 and 10, 2020. Our results showed that 6.6 and 4.7% of the participants experienced depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 outbreak, respectively. Perceived social support was negatively associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms. Earthquake exposure has no direct effect on current depressive and anxiety symptoms, but it would moderate the direct relationship between perceived social support and psychological symptoms. Our findings suggested that trauma exposure may lead to salutogenic outcomes. The protective effect of perceived social support on psychological symptoms was greater in people with a higher level of trauma exposure than in a lower one.","Wang, Zhai, Chen, Chen, Hua, Wang, Fan, Liu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.845929","20220516","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; perceived social support; trauma exposure","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31586,""
"Changes and Challenges in Inpatient Mental Health Care During the First Two High Incidence Phases of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Germany - Results From the COVID ÃŽÂ¨ Psychiatry Survey","Psychiatric inpatient treatment, an important pillar of mental health care, is often of longer duration in Germany than in other countries. The COVID-19 pandemic called for infection prevention and control measures and thereby led to shifts in demand and inpatient capacities. The Germany-wide <i>COVID</i> ÃŽÂ¨ <i>Psychiatry Survey</i> surveyed department heads of German psychiatric inpatient institutions. It assessed changes in utilization during the first two high incidence phases of the pandemic (spring 2020 and winter 2020/21) and also consequences for care, telemedicine experiences, hygiene measures, treatment of patients with mental illness and co-occuring SARS-CoV-2, and coercive measures in such patients. A total of <i>n</i> = 71 psychiatric departments (of 346 contacted) participated in the survey. The results showed a median decrease of inpatient treatment to 80% of 2019 levels and of day hospital treatment to 50% (first phase) and 70% (second phase). Reductions were mainly due to decreases in elective admissions, and emergency admissions remained unchanged or increased in 87% of departments. Utilization was reduced for affective, anxiety, personality, and addiction disorders but appeared roughly unaffected for psychotic disorders. A lack of integration of patients into their living environment, disease exacerbations, loss of contact, and suicide attempts were reported as problems resulting from reduced capacities and insufficient outpatient treatment alternatives. Almost all departments (96%) treated patients with severe mental illness and co-occurring SARS-CoV-2 infection. The majority established special wards and separate areas for (potentially) infectious patients. Telephone and video consultations were found to provide benefits in affective and anxiety disorders. Involuntary admissions of persons without mental illness because of infection protection law violations were reported by 6% of the hospitals. The survey showed high adaptability of psychiatric departments, which managed large capacity shifts and introduced new services for infectious patients, which include telemedicine services. However, the pandemic exacerbated some of the shortcomings of the German mental health system: Avoidable complications resulted from the lack of cooperation and integrated care sequences between in- and outpatient sectors and limited options for psychiatric hospitals to provide outpatient services. Preventive approaches to handle comparable pandemic situations in the future should focus on addressing these shortcomings.","Wiegand, BrÃƒÂ¶cker, Fehr, Lohmann, Maicher, RÃƒÂ¶thke, Rueb, Wessels, de Greck, Pfennig, Unterecker, TÃƒÂ¼scher, Walter, Falkai, Lieb, HÃƒÂ¶lzel, Adorjan","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.855040","20220516","COVID-19; inpatient care; mental health care; pandemic; psychiatry; telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31587,""
"Sleep Difficulties Among COVID-19 Frontline Healthcare Workers","To identify COVID-19 work-related stressors and experiences associated with sleep difficulties in HCW, and to assess the role of depression and traumatic stress in this association. A cross-sectional study of HCW using self-report questionnaires, during the first peak of the pandemic in Israel (April 2020), conducted in a large tertiary medical center in Israel. Study population included 189 physicians and nurses working in designated COVID-19 wards and a comparison group of 643 HCW. Mean age of the total sample was 41.7 Ã‚Â± 11.1, 67% were female, 42.1% physicians, with overall mean number of years of professional experience 14.2 Ã‚Â± 20. The exposure was working in COVID-19 wards and related specific stressors and negative experiences. Primary outcome measurement was the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Secondary outcomes included the Primary Care-Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Screen (PC-PTSD-5); the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) for depression; the anxiety module of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS); Pandemic-Related Stress Factors (PRSF) and witnessing patient suffering and death. Compared with non-COVID-19 HCW, COVID-19 HCW were more likely to be male (41.3% vs. 30.7%) and younger (36.91 Ã‚Â± 8.81 vs. 43.14 Ã‚Â± 11.35 years). COVID-19 HCW reported higher prevalence of sleep difficulties: 63% vs. 50.7% in the non-COVID group (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.15-2.29, <i>p</i> = 0.006), mostly difficulty maintaining sleep: 26.5% vs. 18.5% (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.11-2.44, <i>p</i> = 0.012). Negative COVID-19 work-related experiences, specifically witnessing patient physical suffering and death, partially explained the association. Although past psychological problems and current depression and PTSD were associated with difficulty maintaining sleep, the main association remained robust also after controlling for those conditions in the full model. COVID-19 frontline HCW were more likely to report sleep difficulties, mainly difficulty maintaining sleep, as compared with non-COVID-19 HCW working at the same hospital. Negative patient-care related experiences likely mediated the increased probability for those difficulties. Future research is needed to elucidate the long-term trajectories of sleep difficulties among HCW during large scale outbreaks, and to identify risk factors for their persistence.","Cleper, Hertz-Palmor, Mosheva, Hasson-Ohayon, Kaplan, Kreiss, Afek, Pessach, Gothelf, Gross","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.838825","20220516","COVID-19; COVID-19 outbreak; health care staff; health care workers (HCW); sleep; sleep difficulties; sleep disorders; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31588,""
"Perceived Stress Positively Relates to Insomnia Symptoms: The Moderation of Resilience in Chinese Pregnant Women During COVID-19","The government's COVID-19 pandemic response lockdown strategy had a negative psychological and physical impact on individuals, which necessitated special care to pregnant women's mental health. There has been no large-scale research on the underlying relationship between perceived stress and insomnia symptoms in pregnant Chinese women up to this point. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we wanted to see if there was an association between perceived stress and insomnia symptoms, as well as the moderating impact of resilience for Chinese pregnant women. This cross-sectional study examined 2115 pregnant women from central and western China using multi-stage sampling methodologies. A systematic questionnaire was used to collect information on sleep quality, perceived stress, and resilience using the Insomnia Severity Index, Perceptual Stress Scale, and Connor and Davidson Resilience Scale. To assess the moderating influence of resilience, hierarchical regressions were used. During the COVID-19 pandemic, 18.53% of respondents (<i>N</i> = 2115) reported experiencing sleeplessness. In pregnant women, perceived stress was positively linked with insomnia symptoms (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, resilience significantly attenuated the influence of perceived stress on insomnia symptoms in Chinese expectant mother (ÃŽÂ²<sub>interaction</sub> = -0.0126, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Pregnant women with strong resilience were less influenced by perceived stress than those with poor resilience. The findings of this study might give empirical proof that health care professionals should identify the relevance of reducing perceived stress in pregnant women with poor resilience and provide better treatment and support when necessary.","Zou, Tao, Zhou, Zhang, Zhang, Li, Yang, Wang, Huang, Wang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.856627","20220516","moderation effect; perceived stress; pregnant women; resilience; sleep quality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31589,""
"Mental Health and Wellbeing in Lithuanian Medical Students and Resident Doctors During COVID-19 Pandemic","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a negative effect on mental health and subjective psychological wellbeing. One of the most affected population is medical students, reporting higher levels of depression, anxiety, sleep difficulties, and overall poorer wellbeing. However, the relationship between depression, anxiety, and sleep difficulties, and subjective psychological wellbeing has not been extensively researched in medical students in the context of COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between depression, anxiety, and sleep quality, and subjective psychological wellbeing. In total, 524 medical students and resident doctors (78.6% female, mean age 24 Ã‚Â± 3 years old) participated in an online survey between December 2020 and February 2021. Participants completed the WHO-Five Wellbeing Index Questionnaire, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment-7.

"Machine Learning-Based Prediction Models for Depression Symptoms Among Chinese Healthcare Workers During the Early COVID-19 Outbreak in 2020: A Cross-Sectional Study","The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19)-related depression symptoms of healthcare workers have received worldwide recognition. Although many studies identified risk exposures associated with depression symptoms among healthcare workers, few have focused on a predictive model using machine learning methods. As a society, governments, and organizations are concerned about the need for immediate interventions and alert systems for healthcare workers who are mentally at-risk. This study aims to develop and validate machine learning-based models for predicting depression symptoms using survey data collected during the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Surveys were conducted of 2,574 healthcare workers in hospitals designated to care for COVID-19 patients between 20 January and 11 February 2020. The patient health questionnaire (PHQ)-9 was used to measure the depression symptoms and quantify the severity, a score of Ã¢â€°Â¥5 on the PHQ-9 represented depression symptoms positive, respectively. Four machine learning approaches were trained (75% of data) and tested (25% of data). Cross-validation with 100 repetitions was applied to the training dataset for hyperparameter tuning. Finally, all models were compared to evaluate their predictive performances and screening utility: decision tree, logistics regression with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), random forest, and gradient-boosting tree. Important risk predictors identified and ranked by the machine learning models were highly consistent: self-perceived health status factors always occupied the top five most important predictors, followed by worried about infection, working on the frontline, a very high level of uncertainty, having received any form of psychological support material and having COVID-19-like symptoms. The area under the curve [95% CI] of machine learning models were as follows: LASSO model, 0.824 [0.792-0.856]; random forest, 0.828 [0.797-0.859]; gradient-boosting tree, 0.829 [0.798-0.861]; and decision tree, 0.785 [0.752-0.819]. The calibration plot indicated that the LASSO model, random forest, and gradient-boosting tree fit the data well. Decision curve analysis showed that all models obtained net benefits for predicting depression symptoms. This study shows that machine learning prediction models are suitable for making predictions about mentally at-risk healthcare workers predictions in a public health emergency setting. The application of multidimensional machine learning models could support hospitals' and healthcare workers' decision-making on possible psychological interventions and proper mental health management.","Zhou, Luo, Yang, Liu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.876995","20220516","COVID-19; depression; health personnel; machine learning; predictive value of tests","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31591,""
"Incorporating Digital Interventions into Mental Health Clinical Practice: a Pilot Survey of How Use Patterns, Barriers, and Opportunities Shifted for Clinicians in the COVID-19 Pandemic","Although many digital mental health interventions are available, clinicians do not routinely use them in clinical practice. In this pilot survey, we review the factors that supported the rapid transition to televisits during the COVID-19 pandemic, and we explore the barriers that continue to prevent clinicians from using other digital mental health interventions, such as mindfulness applications, mood trackers, and digital therapy programs. We conducted a pilot survey of mental health clinicians in different practice environments in the USA. Survey respondents (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°51) were primarily psychiatrists working in academic medical centers. Results indicated that systemic factors, including workplace facilitation and insurance reimbursement, were primary reasons motivating clinicians to use televisits to provide remote patient care. The shift to televisits during the pandemic was not accompanied by increased use of other digital mental health interventions in patient care. Nine clinicians reported that they have never used digital interventions with patients. Among the 42 clinicians who did report some experience using digital interventions, the majority reported no change in the use of digital applications since transitioning to televisits. Our preliminary findings lend insight into the perspective of mental health clinicians regarding the factors that supported their transition to televisits, including institutional support and insurance reimbursement, and indicate that this shift to virtual patient care has not been accompanied by increased use of other digital mental health interventions. We contend that the same systemic factors that supported the shift toward virtual visits in the COVID-19 pandemic may be applied to support the incorporation of other digital interventions in mental healthcare.

"T-Cell Subsets and Interleukin-10 Levels Are Predictors of Severity and Mortality in COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","Many COVID-19 patients reveal a marked decrease in their lymphocyte counts, a condition that translates clinically into immunodepression and is common among these patients. Outcomes for infected patients vary depending on their lymphocytopenia status, especially their T-cell counts. Patients are more likely to recover when lymphocytopenia is resolved. When lymphocytopenia persists, severe complications can develop and often lead to death. Similarly, IL-10 concentration is elevated in severe COVID-19 cases and may be associated with the depression observed in T-cell counts. Accordingly, this systematic review and meta-analysis aims to analyze T-cell subsets and IL-10 levels among COVID-19 patients. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of the immunodepression observed in COVID-19, and its consequences, may enable early identification of disease severity and reduction of overall morbidity and mortality. A systematic search was conducted covering PubMed MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and EBSCO databases for journal articles published from December 1, 2019 to March 14, 2021. In addition, we reviewed bibliographies of relevant reviews and the medRxiv preprint server for eligible studies. Our search covered published studies reporting laboratory parameters for T-cell subsets (CD4/CD8) and IL-10 among confirmed COVID-19 patients. Six authors carried out the process of data screening, extraction, and quality assessment independently. The DerSimonian-Laird random-effect model was performed for this meta-analysis, and the standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for each parameter. A total of 52 studies from 11 countries across 3 continents were included in this study. Compared with mild and survivor COVID-19 cases, severe and non-survivor cases had lower counts of CD4/CD8 T-cells and higher levels of IL-10. Our findings reveal that the level of CD4/CD8 T-cells and IL-10 are reliable predictors of severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients.

Grounded theory approach is used to collect, analyse, and code the data elicited from 37 semi-structured interviews. Qualitative analysis of the data found that the lockdown during coronavirus outbreak led to boredom, financial loss, and intimate terrorism which resulted in an elevated risk of anxiety and stress. It was also revealed that risk of anxiety and stress further increased during the lockdown due to the moderating role of the media and doom scrolling. Significance of the study rests in developing a grounded theory framework for stress and anxiety in the Indian context that can help the government and the associated bodies as well as the healthcare departments to devise strategies and policies to reduce the risk of nation-wide lockdown on the mental health of the people.

"COVID-Specific Coercive Control among Emerging Adults Attending College: A Brief Note","The COVID-19 pandemic represents a ""perfect storm"" with regards to risk for intimate partner violence (IPV). Abusive partners may engage in novel forms of coercive control, such as pressuring their partner to engage in activities associated with COVID-19 infection risk (e.g., attend a large gathering). However, no empirical research has focused on COVID-specific coercive control. The current study sought to evaluate the prevalence of COVID-specific coercive control in a large sample of U.S. college students, as well as its association with other forms of IPV and depression and anxiety. A total of 2,289 undergraduate students attending eight U.S. universities who were currently in a sexual/dating/romantic relationship completed an online survey in Fall 2020 about COVID-specific coercive control, other forms of IPV (psychological, physical, sexual, coercive control) and depression and anxiety symptoms. Overall, 15.5% (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°355) of students reported experiencing COVID-specific coercive control. Individuals who experienced COVID-specific coercive control were more likely to have experienced all other forms of IPV than those who did not experience COVID-specific coercive control. Further, individuals who experienced COVID-specific coercive control had significantly greater anxiety than individuals who did not experience any form of IPV. Individuals who experienced both COVID-specific coercive control and other forms of IPV had the highest levels of depression and anxiety. COVID-specific coercive control may serve to increase depression and anxiety, particularly if it co-occurs with other forms of IPV. Future work should evaluate the prevalence and long-term impact of coercive control during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Littleton, Edwards, Sall, Lim, Mauer","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10896-022-00403-8","20220516","Anxiety Coercive control; COVID-19; College students; Depression; Intimate partner violence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31596,""

We assessed individuals' mental health, i.e., suicidal ideation (via Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation, BSS), depression (via Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9), anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, HADS), experience of psychological and physical violence, including changes in suicidal ideation and anxiety compared to before the pandemic, and relationship characteristics (i.e., relationship status, satisfaction, and commitment as well as family structure) with online questionnaires in a population-based cross-sectional study with 3,012 respondents in Austria during the COVID-19 pandemic. There were small to medium-sized group differences with regards to relationship status and satisfaction (ÃŽÂ· <sub><i>p</i></sub> <sup>2</sup>: 0.011-0.056). Most mental health outcomes were less favorable in singles than in individuals in happy relationships, but scores for anxiety (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), psychological (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and physical violence (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and the probability of experiencing an increase in anxiety compared to before the pandemic (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) were lower in singles as compared to those with low relationship satisfaction. Furthermore, scores for suicidal ideation (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.001) and psychological (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.01) and physical violence (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.01) were highest in individuals in relationships with low commitment and with a child living in the same household, but effect sizes were small (ÃŽÂ· <sub><i>p</i></sub> <sup>2</sup>: 0.004-0.015). During the COVID-19 pandemic, as compared to singles, mental health appeared worse in individuals with low relationship satisfaction and those in a relationship with low commitment and with a child in the household. Living in a happy relationship was associated with somewhat better mental health.","Till, Niederkrotenthaler","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.857329","20220516","COVID-19; family structure; mental health; relationship commitment; relationship satisfaction; romantic relationship","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31597,""
"Short Term Effects of Inner Engineering Completion Online Program on Stress and Well-Being Measures","The Covid-19 pandemic has been a major disruptor of routine life, resulting in increased stress and predisposing people to negative outcomes, such as insomnia, anxiety and hopelessness. Mind-body interventions have improved concentration, emotional balance, and positive emotions, with an enhanced sense of productivity, and self-confidence. We therefore hypothesized that exposure to an online mind-body intervention, ""Inner Engineering Completion Online (IECO),"" would reduce stress and promote well-being. This prospective cohort study enrolled participants registered for the IECO courses, which for the first time were delivered remotely, online. Participants learned a 21-min meditation practice called Shambhavi Mahamudra Kriya during the course, which incorporates controlled breathing and mediation techniques. Each enrolled participant was asked to complete self-reported electronic surveys at three key time points: at the time of consent, immediately after completing IECO, and 6 weeks after IECO completion. Effects of IECO practice were assessed using four well-validated neuropsychological scales: Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Positive Emotion/Relationship/Engagement Scale (PERMA) Profiler, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS). A Signed Rank test was used to analyze the survey data and <i>P</i>-values of &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Of the 375 participants interested in participation, 164 participants were eligible. Sixty-eight participants completed surveys at all time points and were identified as compliant participants. The baseline median score for PSS in compliant participants (<i>n</i> = 95) was 13.5 (IQR 9, 18); immediate post-IECO median PSS score was 12 (IQR 8, 16) demonstrating a 1.5 unit decrease in PSS scores (<i>p</i>-value = 0.0023). Similarly, comparing PSS scores in compliant participants (<i>n</i> = 68) for immediate Post IECO [11.5 (IQR 8, 15.5)] to PSS scores at six weeks [8 (IQR 4.5, 12.5)] showed a statistically significant 3.5-unit decrease, indicating a reduction in stress upon routine practice of the intervention (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). Incorporating the remotely delivered mind-body intervention <i>Shambhavi Mahamudra Kriya</i> into daily life via the IECO program over as few as 6 weeks produced a significant stress reduction, improvement in sleep quality and mindfulness.

"Psychosocial Effects of COVID-19 in the Ecuadorian and Spanish Populations: A Cross-Cultural Study","The world's population is currently overcoming one of the worst pandemics, and the psychological and social effects of this are becoming more apparent. We will present an analysis of the psychosocial effects of COVID-19: first, a cross-sectional study in an Ecuadorian sample (<i>n</i> = 301) and second, a comparative study between two samples from the Ecuadorian and Spanish populations (<i>n</i> = 83 each one). Participants completed an online survey to (1) describe how they felt (depression, anxiety, and stress) before and after confinement; (2) analyze which emotional and behavioral variables predict depressive symptoms, anxiety, and stress perceived after the confinement; (3) carry out a comparative study in a sample of Ecuadorian and Spanish surveys. Results indicate, first, that Ecuadorians experience significantly more depressive symptoms, anxiety, and stress after confinement. Second, variables which predict depressive symptoms and anxiety are greater public prosocial tendency, less stress as a challenge, and greater stress as a threat, as well as an empathetic tendency that implies greater emotional regulation. Experienced stress after confinement was predicted by a greater public prosocial tendency, as well as an empathetic tendency. Finally, scores for depression, anxiety, and stress are higher after confinement in both countries. However, results reveal the similarity of the psychosocial effects that are being experienced, regardless of the country, and the differences in the variables that can help explain these effects. This can contribute to the constitution of intervention plans which aim to soften and alleviate the effects produced by a situation such as that experienced with COVID-19.","Chocho-Orellana, Samper-GarcÃƒÂ­a, Malonda-Vidal, Llorca-Mestre, Zarco-Alpuente, Mestre-EscrivÃƒÂ¡","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.803290","20220516","COVID-19; Ecuadorian; Spanish; cross-cultural; psychosocial effects","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31599,""
"Online Emotional Support Accompany Group Intervention and Emotional Change of the Public During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Multi-Period Data Analysis From China","COVID-19 has made it difficult to adopt traditional face-to-face psychological intervention under this situation because of the blocked down and social distancing, which brings big psychological crisis to the public among the global. To explore the emotional change of the public in China at the outburst of the pandemic at different phases, to establish an online working platform and create a new model of an online intervention to hold public emotions under pandemic, and test its effectiveness, so to give advisement for government emergency management system. We established an online organization to work for this program ad innovated a model of online group counseling with online emotional support accompany group (OESAG) right after the outburst of a pandemic. We analyzed 53 OESAGs from February 10 to April 9, including 555 application forms, 253 feedback from members, and 139 feedback from group leaders by using NVivo and SPSS to explore the evolution and characteristics of public emotion during COVID-19 and the effectiveness of OESAG. Our results showed that the emotional changes of members ranged from shock to depression to positive. The public's emotions swiftly changed from stress, anxiety, and isolation, to the hope of returning to work or finding a job during the pandemic with the help of OESAG. OESAG has effectively regulated the negative emotions of members by conducting psychological crisis intervention to provide members a space to communicate with each other, especially the female and frontline staff. Policy makers can set up an online systematic psychological crisis intervention system as soon as possible to make up for the lack of psychological assistance in the emergency management system.","Lu, Wang, Zhang, Ma, Huo, Bu, Tang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.840686","20220516","COVID-19; emotional distress; online emotional support accompany group; psychological crisis intervention; social distancing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31600,""
"Lockdown Social Isolation and Lockdown Stress During the COVID-19 Pandemic in China: The Impact of Mindfulness","This study is aimed to examine the impact of mindfulness in the relationship between social isolation, job and financial insecurity, and stress during the lockdown period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Drawing on Conservation of Resources theory, Psychological Contract theory, Mindfulness theory, and Awareness notion, we propose that lockdown job insecurity partially mediates the link from lockdown social isolation to lockdown financial insecurity, and that the relationship between lockdown social isolation and lockdown stress is mediated as follows: first, simple partial mediation through both lockdown job and financial insecurity and second, sequential mediation through lockdown job and financial insecurity, respectively. Moreover, we assume that mindfulness moderates the relationship between lockdown financial insecurity and lockdown stress. The results from our SEM analyses, using a sample of 1,356 respondents in China, support all the research hypotheses. Based on this empirical work, this study concludes that mindfulness, which is considered by many people to play a role in reducing stress during the COVID-19 lockdown period, is de facto endangering their mental health (that is, they experience more stress) instead. Theoretical and practical implications, as well as limitations and proposals for future research are discussed.","Li, Zhou, Van der Heijden, Li, Tao, Guo","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.778402","20220516","COVID-19; lockdown financial insecurity; lockdown job insecurity; lockdown social isolation; lockdown stress; mindfulness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31601,""
"Teacher Motivation and Burnout of English-as-a-Foreign-Language Teachers: Do Demotivators Really Demotivate Them?","This study examined the relationships between teacher motivation (TM) and perceived burnout of English-as-a-foreign-language (EFL) teachers in Chile. A particular focus was given to demotivators and their impact on TM and burnout. The impact of COVID-19 was considered. Given that EFL teachers tend to be second language (L2) learners of English themselves, the study also investigated how TM and L2 motivation interact with each other. The participants were 154 school-level teachers with a range of backgrounds (teaching experience, geographic areas, and school sectors). In the questionnaire, four scales were included: (a) autonomous motivation for teaching; (b) demotivators; (c) perceived burnout; and (d) L2 motivation. Fifteen teachers were interviewed in order to triangulate the survey results. Structural equation modeling showed that TM negatively predicted perceived burnout, suggesting that it can counter teachers' emotional exhaustion and their perceived lack of personal accomplishment. Demotivators predicted TM positively, albeit weakly. L2 motivation was found to be only weakly related to TM. Qualitative findings indicated that teaching experience mediated the role that demotivators played in relation to TM. Experienced teachers, especially those who held intrinsic motivation to teach, channeled the impact of demotivators, including those relating to the pandemic, to a positive motivational force to teach. The study implies the importance of considering teachers as agents and devising an educational system in which their mental health is prioritized.","Sato, FernÃƒÂ¡ndez Castillo, Oyanedel","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.891452","20220516","COVID-19; burnout; demotivators; mixed methods research; non-native-speaking teachers; second language motivation; self-determination theory; teacher motivation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31602,""
"COVID-19 behavioral questionnaire (CoBQ): Comparing the pandemic's impact on health behavior in three US states","The COVID-19 pandemic impacted daily routines for a majority of the population, with implications for their health behaviors. Racial and ethnic minorities have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. The novel COVID-19 Behavioral Questionnaire (CoBQ) was developed in Fall 2020 to provide a means to measure the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the United States population. The study utilized behavioral domains to determine which demographic groups reported that they were made the most vulnerable during Fall-Winter 2020-2021 of the pandemic. The study aimed to further validate and test the CoBQ in varied US regions and compare the scores obtained from three states, California, Ohio, and Illinois. A prospective, multi-site survey-based study was designed to further validate and test the 17-item CoBQ in varied populations. Respondents included patients on routine visits at each pharmacy or clinical site who agreed to complete the survey online via Qualtrics. Data analyses included descriptive statistics, psychometric testing, and comparison of groups using Analysis of Variance. Completed surveys (<i>n</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 507) between October 2021 and March 2021 were analyzed. Respondents were mostly female, white, and had some college education. The CoBQ showed improved reliability compared with previous testing and strong construct validity through factor analysis. Overall scores were similar between three states. The most impacted groups included those who reported within the 18-49 age group, a yearly household income &lt;$50Ã¢â‚¬â€°000, or education up to high school. The CoBQ is the first validated tool to measure the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on health behaviors. Results could serve as a baseline to address the most vulnerable patient groups and support identified behavioral needs during a similar pandemic situation.","Mercadante, Chu, Chen, Wong, Khare, Law","https://doi.org/10.1002/jac5.1625","20220516","COVIDÃ¢â‚¬Â19; CoBQ; health behavior; mental health; pandemic; public awareness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31603,""
"Virtual Photovoice With Older Adults: Methodological Reflections during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Photovoice is a participatory action research method in which participants take and narrate photographs to share their experiences and perspectives. This method is gaining in popularity among health researchers. Few studies, however, have described virtual photovoice data collection despite the growing interest among qualitative health researchers for online data collection. As such, the aim of this article is to discuss the implementation of a virtual photovoice study and presents some of the challenges of this design and potential solutions. The study examined issues of social isolation and mental health among older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Canadian province of QuÃƒÂ©bec. Twenty-six older adults took photographs depicting their experience of the pandemic that were then shared in virtual discussion groups. In this article, we discuss three key challenges arising from our study and how we navigated them. First, we offer insights into managing some of the technical difficulties related to using online meeting technologies. Second, we describe the adjustments we made during our study to foster and maintain positive group dynamics. Third, we share our insights into the process of building and maintaining trust between both researchers and participants, and amongst participants. Through a discussion of these challenges, we offer suggestions to guide the work of health promotion researchers wishing to conduct virtual photovoice studies, including with older adults.","Ferlatte, Karmann, GariÃƒÂ©py, Frohlich, Moullec, Lemieux, HÃƒÂ©bert","https://doi.org/10.1177/16094069221095656","20220516","Covid-19; mental health; older adults; online research; online study; photovoice","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31604,""
"Paying the price? Academic work and parenting during COVID-19","The shift to remote working/learning to slow transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has had widespread mental health impacts. We aimed to describe how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the mental health of students and faculty within a health sciences faculty at a central Canadian university. Via an online survey, we queried mental health in the first four months of the COVID-19 pandemic quantitatively (scale: 1 (most negative)-100 (most positive)) and qualitatively. The sample (<i>n</i> = 110) was predominantly women (faculty 39/59; [66.1%]; students 46/50; [92.0%]). Most faculty were married/common law (50/60; [84.8%]) and had children at home (36/60; [60.0%]); the opposite was true for most students.Faculty and students self-reported comparable mental health (40.47Ã‚Â±24.26 and 37.62Ã‚Â±26.13; respectively). Amongst women, those with vs. without children at home, reported significantly worse mental health impacts (31.78Ã‚Â±23.68 vs. 44.29Ã‚Â±27.98; respectively, <i>p</i> = 0.032).Qualitative themes included: ""Sharing resources,"" ""spending money,"" ""few changes,"" for those without children at home; ""working at home can be isolating,"" including the subtheme, ""balancing act"": ""working in isolation,"" ""working more,"" for those with children at home. Amongst women in academia, including both students and faculty, those with children at home have disproportionately worse mental health than those without children at home.

"The effects of COVID-19 on Canadian surgical residents' education and wellness","The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged health care systems. We sought to comprehend the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on surgical residents' education and mental well-being across Canada. An online 51-question survey was distributed to surgical residents across all 17 Canadian post- graduate surgical residency programs. The questionnaire contained questions concerning demographic factors, perceived effects of COVID-19 pandemic on surgical training and residents' mental health (categorically demonstrating whether it improved, stayed the same, or worsened). Health habits were measured as continuous variables and compared before and during the pandemic. Additionally, participants reported the performance of wellness offices' response to their needs during this crisis. A total of 122 out of 650 (19%) residents from all surgical specialities anonymously completed the survey. The majority (68%) reported a worsening in their surgical training. 94% of participants favored online teaching as a complementary method to in-person teaching. As to health habits, 38% reported a rise in their alcohol consumption and time spent seated. Only a minority (25%) felt happier and 41% reported experiencing more anxiety in comparison to surgical training pre-COVID-19. Merely 14% reported benefitting from wellness programs. The COVID-19 pandemic had a negative effect on the perceived quality of surgical training, education, and resident mental health. There is an urgent need to reconsider the implemented measures in medical education and urge us to develop better agendas to face the current or future waves.

"Unhealthy Dieting During the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Opinion Regarding the Harmful Effects on Brain Health","Since 2020, the world has been suffering from a pandemic that has affected thousands of people regardless of socio-economic conditions, forcing the population to adopt different strategies to prevent and control the advance of the disease, one of which is social distancing. Even though social distancing is a safe strategy to reduce the spread of COVID-19, it is also the cause of a rising sedentary behavior. This behavior develops an excess of fat tissue that leads to metabolic and inflammatory disruption related to chronic diseases and mental health disorders, such as anxiety, depression, and sleep issues. Furthermore, the adoption of dietary patterns involving the consumption of ultra-processed foods, higher in fats and sugars, and the reduction of fresh and healthy foods may play a role in the progress of the disease. In this perspective, we will discuss how an unhealthy diet can affect brain function and, consequently, be a risk factor for mental health diseases.","RenterÃƒÂ­a, GarcÃƒÂ­a-SuÃƒÂ¡rez, Moncada-JimÃƒÂ©nez, Machado-Parra, Antunes, Lira, JimÃƒÂ©nez-Maldonado","https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2022.876112","20220516","COVID-19 pandemic; brain; brain function; mental health; nutrition","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31607,""

"Stressors and Information-Seeking by Dialysis and Transplant Patients During COVID-19 Reported on a Telephone Hotline: A Mixed Methods Study","In early 2020, we activated a telephone hotline, the COVID-19 Kidney/Transplant Listening and Resource Center (KTLRC) to learn more about the impact of COVID-19 on the stress and information-seeking behaviors of dialysis and transplant patients. A mixed-methods study including semi-structured qualitative interviews probing about emotional, health and financial challenges experienced and quantitative surveys assessing depression and anxiety levels and information-seeking behaviors. 99 participants [28 dialysis patients, 71 transplant patients] varying by race/ethnicity [Hispanic (25.3%), White (23.2%), Asian (24.2%), and Black (24.2%)] shared their COVID-19 experiences and information seeking behaviors by telephone. Interviews and surveys were conducted from 6/17/2020 to 11/24/2020. Qualitative themes were identified using thematic analysis. Frequencies were calculated to assess levels of depression and anxiety using the Patient Health Questionnaire for Depression and Anxiety (PHQ-4) and types of information-seeking behaviors. Seven themes and 16 subthemes emerged. Themes of commonly reported stressors include postponing medical visits, decreased accessibility of getting medication, difficulty in receiving up-to-date patient focused health information and receiving dialysis supplies, and delays in medical appointments. Other stressors include losses of health insurance and income, and increased vigilance in behaviors to avoid contracting COVID-19. Fifteen participants had moderate to severe anxiety and depression symptoms and reported more frequent and severe panic attacks post-COVID. Participants sought emotional support from family, friends, and faith communities. They also commonly obtained information from news media and reported needing more transplant-specific updates about COVID-19, and frequent communication from their kidney and transplant specialists. This convenience sample of individuals willing to share their experiences through a telephone hotline may not generalize to all dialysis and transplant patients; stressors related to COVID-19 for these patients continue to change. As the impact of the pandemic continues, needs-based interventions tailored for the kidney and transplant community including access to mental health resources, education, and support for care transitions should continue.","Arevalo, Murillo, Ho, Advani, Davis, Lipsey, Kim, Waterman","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xkme.2022.100479","20220516","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31609,""
"Psycho-Cardiological Disease: A Bibliometric Review From 2001 to 2021","The aim of this study was to gain insight into the progress and dynamics of psycho-cardiological disease research and track its hot spots. We have analyzed psycho-cardiological disease-related literature extracted from the Web of Science (WOS) Core Collection from 2001 to 2021 with the help of Cite Space. As a result, we have included 5,032 records. Then, we have analyzed connected networks for the country, author, subject category, keywords, and cited reference. We have summarized the findings in four aspects. First, the annual quantitative distribution of publications is on the rise, although there is a slight drop. Second, in terms of country analysis, the United States, England, Australia, Germany, and Italy are the main research forces in psycho-cardiological diseases. At the same time, several academic entities represented by Andrew Steptoe and Roland von KÃƒÂ¤nel, MD, have been formed based on the early consciousness of physical and mental health in these countries. Besides, China is also more concerned about it due to the rapid population aging process and the largest population. Third, the psycho-cardiological disease is multidisciplinary, including psychology, psychiatry, clinical medicine, such as cardiovascular system and neurology, public environmental and occupational health, and pharmacology. Finally, the results of keyword analysis and co-cited references indicate the hot spots and frontiers in psycho-cardiological disease. The hot spots in psycho-cardiological disease include three aspects. The first aspect includes psychosocial factors, such as depression, lack of social support, and low economic and social status; the second aspect includes priority populations, such as Alzheimer's disease dementia caregivers, elderly, and patients with cancer, and the third aspect includes interventions, such as exercise therapy and diet. In addition, there are three future research frontiers. The first is a psycho-cardiological disease in patients with COVID-19; the second is cardiac rehabilitation, especially exercise therapy and health behavior evaluation; and the final is evidence-based medical evaluation, such as systematic reviews and meta-analyses.","You, Shou, Zhang, Fan, Chai, Xue, Hu, He","https://doi.org/10.3389/fcvm.2022.890329","20220516","bibliometric analysis; cardiovascular diseases; cite space software; mapping knowledge domains; psycho-cardiological disease","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31610,""
"Psychotropic Medication Use Before and During COVID-19: A Population-Wide Study","<b>Background:</b> The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and public health measures that took place have led to concerns regarding mental health and receipt of psychotropic medications. We aimed to study the changes in psychotropic medication dispensation rates before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in the general population. <b>Methods:</b> Administrative health data from the Canadian province of Manitoba was used to describe the quarterly incidence and prevalence of antipsychotics, antidepressants, and anxiolytic/sedative-hypnotics from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2020. Individuals who received at least one prescription within each quarter were considered exposed to the medication. The denominator was the total population within each quarter. Incidence was defined as no receipt of medication in the 3Ã‚Â years prior to the quarter of interest. Autoregression models for time series data plus indicator variables were used to compare each quarter of 2020 after public health measures were implemented in March 2020 in relation to the expected trend. Analyses were stratified by age and sex. <b>Results:</b> There were 1,394,885 individuals in the first quarter of 2020, with a mean (SD) age of 38.9 (23.4) years, 50.3% were female, and 36.1% had a psychiatric diagnosis in the previous 5Ã‚Â years. A significant decrease was observed for incident antidepressant use (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05 for both sexes and all age groups except for those 65Ã‚Â years and older) and anxiolytic use (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05 for both sexes and all age groups except 80Ã‚Â years and older) in the second quarter (April-June) of 2020 compared to the expected trend. Females and those aged 40Ã‚Â years and older had a significantly higher incidence of antidepressant and antipsychotic use in the final quarter of 2020 compared to the expected trend (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). <b>Conclusion:</b> Our findings indicate a decrease in new prescriptions for antidepressants and anxiolytics in the 3Ã‚Â months after COVID-19 in-person restrictions were first implemented. We then observed an increase in the new use of antidepressants and antipsychotics at the end of 2020, in females and people aged 40Ã‚Â years and older, with the highest rates of use in the population 80Ã‚Â years and older.","Leong, Kowalec, Eltonsy, Bolton, Enns, Tan, Yogendran, Chateau, Delaney, Sareen, Falk, Spiwak, Logsetty, Alessi-Severini","https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2022.886652","20220516","COVID-19; drug utilization; pandemic; population-wide study; psychotropic drugs","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31611,""
"Oxidative Stress and Hyper-Inflammation as Major Drivers of Severe COVID-19 and Long COVID: Implications for the Benefit of High-Dose Intravenous Vitamin C","Oxidative stress is a pivotal point in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and presumably also in Long-COVID. Inflammation and oxidative stress are mutually reinforcing each other, thus contributing to the systemic hyperinflammatory state and coagulopathy which are cardinal pathological mechanisms of severe stages. COVID-19 patients, like other critically ill patients e.g. with pneumonia, very often show severe deficiency of the antioxidant vitamin C. So far, it has not been investigated how long this deficiency lasts or whether patients with long COVID symptoms also suffer from deficiencies. A vitamin C deficit has serious pathological consequences because vitamin C is one of the most effective antioxidants, but also co-factor of many enzymatic processes that affect the immune and nervous system, blood circulation and energy metabolism. Because of its anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, endothelial-restoring, and immunomodulatory effects the supportive intravenous (iv) use of supraphysiological doses has been investigated so far in 12 controlled or observational studies with altogether 1578 inpatients with COVID-19. In these studies an improved oxygenation, a decrease in inflammatory markers and a faster recovery were observed. In addition, early treatment with iv high dose vitamin C seems to reduce the risks of severe courses of the disease such as pneumonia and also mortality. Persistent inflammation, thrombosis and a dysregulated immune response (auto-immune phenomena and/or persistent viral load) seem to be major contributors to Long-COVID. Oxidative stress and inflammation are involved in the development and progression of fatigue and neuro-psychiatric symptoms in various diseases by disrupting tissue (e.g. autoantibodies), blood flow (e.g. immune thrombosis) and neurotransmitter metabolism (e.g. excitotoxicity). In oncological diseases, other viral infections and autoimmune diseases, which are often associated with fatigue, cognitive disorders, pain and depression similar to Long-COVID, iv high dose vitamin C was shown to significantly relieve these symptoms. Supportive iv vitamin C in acute COVID-19 might therefore reduce the risk of severe courses and also the development of Long-COVID.","Vollbracht, Kraft","https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2022.899198","20220516","COVID-19; Long Covid; ascorbic acid; autoimmunity; cognitive dysfunction; fatigue; hyperinflammation; oxidative stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31612,""
"The Role of Urban Environment Design on Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Scoping Review","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the ways and times of living and using urban spaces, specifically referring to the dimension of daily life. The restrictive measures introduced during the lockdown periods have necessarily led to a re-evaluation of proximity scale bringing particularly attention to issues relating to public transport and mobility and to the quality and distribution of open public spaces. This scoping review explores the relationship between the urban environment design and health referring to the constraints imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic in the period from 2020 to 2021, with two main objectives: (i) to investigate the recurring urban design topics and issues related to the spatial and social needs stressed by the emergency; (ii) to identify the urban design measures both experienced during the health emergency and proposed in view of a post-COVID urban and territorial planning as they are considered impactful on health promotion. The search strategy was based on a set of keywords searched in two electronic databases which allowed the identification of a total of 1,135 contributions. After defining the eligibility criteria, we proceeded to the screening process concluded with the inclusion of 19 studies. The analysis of the contributions led to the systematization of six main urban topics-and to the corresponding spatial requirements and project proposals-highlighted as relevant and supportive in terms of the promotion of inhabitant's public health: (i) transport, mobility and accessibility; (ii) green and outdoor spaces; (iii) public and pedestrians' spaces; (iv) care services and health network; (v) communications; (vi) public and business services. The resulting framework is useful for guiding healthy city planning toward public policies, tools, regulations, urban measures, and emergency contrast provisions, that contribute to increasing the effectiveness in terms of safety and well-being.","Faedda, Plaisant, Talu, Tola","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.791656","20220517","COVID-19; mental health; physical health; scoping review; urban design; urban environment; vulnerable inhabitants; COVID-19; Communicable Disease Control; Environment Design; Health Promotion; Humans; Pandemics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31613,""
"Suicide Risk and Association With the Different Trauma During the COVID-19 Pandemic Period: A Cross-Sectional Study on Adolescent With Different Learning Stage in Chongqing, China","This study aimed to examine the current suicidal risk and whether the suicidal risk was associated with a wide range of trauma. The self-administered online questionnaire was adopted to collect suicide risk (SR) such as suicidal ideation, self-harm, suicide attempts, and different trauma information of the adolescents by cluster sampling in Chongqing, China. Multivariable linear regression was presented to assess the association between different risks of trauma and SR scores. Approximately 14.7% of adolescents enrolled reported suicide ideation and more than 10% of adolescents have experienced one kind of trauma during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic period. After adjusting for confounding variables, adolescents who suffered family hurt had a higher risk score of SR (beta coefficients (ÃŽÂ²) = 0.289, 95% confidence interval (<i>CI</i>) = 0.115-0.463). A positive association was found among participants from junior and senior school (ÃŽÂ² = 0.415, 95% <i>CI</i> = 0.152, 0.768), and the SR score was positively associated with sexism among participants from the university/college (ÃŽÂ² = 0.238, 95% <i>CI</i> = 0.042, 0.434). The most potentially obvious trauma that contributed to SR in junior and senior school adolescents might be cyberbullying. Family neglect or abuse might be a detrimental factor in SR for adolescents whether those in junior school or those in university school in China. More interventions, like education related to cyberbullying and family abuse, should be prioritized to reduce the risk of suicide.","Yu, Wu, Wang, Liu, Zhao","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.858157","20220518","COVID-19 pandemic; adolescent; family; suicide risk; trauma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31614,""
"Occupational Burnout Symptoms and Its Relationship With Workload and Fear of the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic Among Hospital Nurses","The pandemic has intensified physical and psychological work demands experienced by nurses in a hospital environment. The purpose of this study was to examine personal and work environmental risk factors associated with occupational burnout among hospital nurses. We conducted a cross-sectional from April to November 2020. Data from 831 nurses who worked professionally in four educational hospitals were compiled through survey questionnaires to report the prevalence of burnout, occupational and individual factors. Independent <i>t</i>-test and Mann-Whitney test measured the link between the scopes of occupational burnout and risk factors. About half of the participants indicated moderate symptoms of burnout. The fear of the nurses correlated significantly with emotional exhaustion (<i>r</i> = 0.71, <i>p</i> = 0.001), depersonalization (<i>r</i> = 0.67, <i>p</i> = 0.02), and personal accomplishment (<i>r</i> = 0.63, <i>p</i> = 0.05).

"Factors Influencing Delayed Treatment in Patients With Breast Cancer During COVID-19 Pandemic","The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has endangered human health and life. This pandemic has changed people's lifestyle and affected the regular delivery of standard cancer treatment. In the present study, we aimed to explore the influencing factors of delayed treatment in patients with breast cancer during COVID-19 pandemic. This study was a cross-sectional investigation, and the subjects were patients who were discharged from the department of burn and plastic surgery after February 2020. All participants completed this study's online questionnaire based on the WeChat and Wenjuanxing platforms. Levels of anxiety and depression were measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Patients were divided into a delay group and non-delay group according to the occurrence of delayed treatment. Univariate analysis was performed by using the <i>t</i> test or chi-square test. A logistic regression model was employed to determine factors associated with delayed treatment. The present study included a total of 397 patients with breast cancer, among whom delayed treatment occurred in 76 patients, accounting for 19.1%. Scores on both the anxiety subscale and depression subscale in delay group were significantly higher than those in non-delay group. Compared with non-delay group, we found that patients in delay group usually had a higher level of education (<i>P</i> = 0.020), worse self-feeling (<i>P</i> = 0.030), poor compliance of medical order (<i>P</i> = 0.042), and a higher prevalence of anxiety (<i>P</i> = 0.004) and depression (<i>P</i> = 0.012). Traffic inconvenience was also an important relevant factor for delayed treatment (<i>P</i> = 0.001). The prevalence of recurrence in delay group was higher than that in non-delay group (<i>P</i> = 0.018). By using logistic multivariate regression analysis, the results revealed that level of education and traffic inconvenience were independent factors influencing delayed treatment in patients with breast cancer during COVID-19 pandemic. The prevalence of delayed treatment in patients with breast cancer during COVID-19 pandemic is relatively high. Our findings reveal several influencing factors closely associated with delayed treatment, which is useful information that will be beneficial for patients to receive standardized therapy by taking targeted measures.","He, Wang, Zhao, Xu, Li, Huang, Sun, Li, Ai, Xiao, Xue, He","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.808873","20220517","COVID-19; anxiety; breast cancer; delayed treatment; depression; Breast Neoplasms; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Time-to-Treatment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31617,""
"Change in Alcohol Consumption and Binge Drinking in University Students During the Early COVID-19 Pandemic","Young adults have been overly affected by the containment measures against COVID-19 and, consequently, worsening in mental health and change in health behavior have been reported. Because the life phase of emerging adulthood is crucial for developing health behaviors, this study aims to examine increase in alcohol consumption, single and multiple binge drinking, and associated factors in students during lockdown and post-lockdown periods. A prospective open cohort study design with nine survey time points between April 2020 and June 2021 was conducted. The present study uses pooled data from the first survey T0 (3 April to 14 April) and follow-ups at T1 (30 April to 11 May 2020) and T2 (28 May to 8 June 2020). Students from all faculties of the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW) (<i>N</i> = 12'431) were invited. Of the 1,300 students who participated at baseline and in at least one follow-up, 1,278 (98.3%) completed the questionnaires, final net sample size was 947. Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) models were used to investigate the factors associated with increases in alcohol consumption based on number of occasions/last 30 days; drinks/week, and binge drinking at T0, and respective changes at T1 and T2 (increases, decreases, no change). Overall, 20% of Swiss university students reported an increased alcohol consumption and 26% engaged in binge drinking. Number of drinks at baseline was associated with a higher probability of increased alcohol consumption, as well as engaging in single and multiple binge drinking events. Higher anxiety scores were associated with a higher probability to increase the alcohol consumption and engaging at least once in binge drinking. Additional factors associated with any binge drinking were male gender, younger age and not living with parents. Higher perceived social support was only associated with engaging in heavy binge drinking. A substantial number of students developed a more risky health behavior regarding alcohol consumption. It is important to identify at risk students and design target prevention including factors such as age, gender and social norms. Further, health behavior and determinants of health behaviors of students should be carefully monitored during the further course of the pandemic.","Zysset, Volken, Amendola, von Wyl, Dratva","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.854350","20220517","COVID-19; alcohol; anxiety; binge drinking; emerging adulthood; lockdown; risky health behavior; students; Adult; Alcohol Drinking; Binge Drinking; COVID-19; Cohort Studies; Communicable Disease Control; Female; Humans; Male; Pandemics; Prospective Studies; Students; Universities; Young Adult","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31618,""
"Using routine outcome measures as clinical process tools: Maximising the therapeutic yield in the IAPT programme when working remotely","The objective of the study was to investigate the administration and use of routine outcome monitoring session by session in the context of improving guided-self-help interventions when delivered remotely at Step 2 care in the English Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services. Qualitative research using recordings of telephone-treatment sessions. Participants (11 patients and 11 practitioners) were recruited from four nationally funded IAPT services and one-third sector organisation commissioned to deliver Step 2 IAPT services, in England. Data collection took place prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Transcripts of telephone-treatment sessions were analysed using thematic analysis. Four themes were identified: (1) lack of consistency in the administration of outcome measures (e.g. inconsistent wording); (2) outcome measures administered as a stand-alone inflexible task (e.g. mechanical administration); (3) outcome measures as impersonal numbers (e.g. summarising, categorising and comparing total scores); and (4) missed opportunities to use outcome measures therapeutically (e.g. lack of therapeutic use of item and total scores). The administration of outcome measures needs to ensure validity and reliability. Therapeutic yield from session-by-session outcome measures could be enhanced by focusing on three main areas: (1) adopting a collaborative conversational approach, (2) maximising the use of total and items scores and (3) integrating outcome measures with in-session treatment decisions. Shifting the perception of outcome measures as impersonal numbers to being process clinical tools ensures a personalised delivery of psychological interventions and has the potential to enhance engagement from practitioners and patients what may reduce drop-out rates and improve clinical outcomes.","Faija, Bee, Lovell, Lidbetter, Gellatly, Ardern, Rushton, Brooks, McMillan, Armitage, Woodhouse, Barkham","https://doi.org/10.1111/papt.12400","20220516","IAPT; clinical feedback; collaborative conversational approach; depression; mental health; psychological practitioner; qualitative study; routine outcome measures; step 2; telephone treatment; wellbeing; wellbeing anxiety","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31619,""
"A Longitudinal Study of the Psychological State of Teachers Before and During the COVID-19 Outbreak in Mexico","The COVID-19 outbreak significantly impacted people's lives. Within the education system, the teaching mode drastically changed to adapt to the social distancing restrictions due to the pandemic. Consequently, teachers have been facing challenges associated with remote learning in addition to those of the pandemic. The aim of the present study was to assess the psychological state among teachers at two stages: pre-pandemic (November 2019) and during the pandemic (June-July 2020 and June-July 2021). Information regarding demographic data, depression, anxiety, and stress (DASS-21), and burnout syndrome (MBI-ES) was collected using validated questionnaires. Results showed a significantly higher scores as well as a higher prevalence in the DASS-21 and the MBI-ES scales, on the second measurement taken during the pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic period and the first evaluation during the pandemic. During the second evaluation on pandemic stage, female teachers of Ã¢â€°Â¥45Ã‚Â years of age with a college-level of education, 11Ã‚Â years of teaching experience, and currently teaching at preschools and primary schools were significantly associated with higher anxiety, stress, EE, and burnout scores.

Using a repeated cross-sectional survey design, we conducted 3 online surveys of college students during the COVID-19 pandemic at 22 universities in Guandong, China. The 3 surveys were conducted during the outbreak period (T1: 3 February to 10 February 2020, NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°164,101), remission period (T2: 24 March to 3 April 2020, NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°148,384), and normalized prevention and control period (T3: 1 June to 15 June 2020, NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°159,187). Suicidal ideation was measured by the ninth item of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. A range of suicide-related factors was assessed, including sociodemographic characteristics, depression, anxiety, insomnia, pre-existing mental health problems, and COVID-19-related factors. The prevalence of suicidal ideation was 8.5%, 11.0% and 12.6% at T1, T2, and T3, respectively. Male sex (aOR: 1.35-1.44, PsÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), poor self-perceived mental health (aOR: 2.25-2.81, PsÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), mental diseases (aOR: 1.52-2.09, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), prior psychological counseling (aOR: 1.23-1.37, PsÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01), negative perception of the risk of the COVID-19 epidemic (aOR: 1.14-1.36, PsÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), depressive symptoms (aOR: 2.51-303, PsÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and anxiety symptoms (aOR: 1.62-101.11, PsÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) were associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation. Suicidal ideation appeared to increase during the COVID-19 pandemic remission period among college students in China. Multiple factors, especially mental health problems, are associated with suicidal ideation. Psychosocial interventions should be implemented during and after the COVID-19 pandemic to reduce suicide risk among college students.","Liang, Liu, Peng, Chen, Huang, Wang, Zhao, Fan, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-022-03968-2","20220518","COVID-19 pandemic; College students; Prevalence; Risk factors; Suicidal ideation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31621,""
"Gender difference in working from home and psychologicaldistress - A national survey of US employees during the COVID-19 pandemic","TheCOVID-19 pandemic has precipitated broad and extensive changes in the waypeople live and work. While the general subject of working from home hasrecently drawn increased attention, few studies have assessed genderdifferences in vulnerability to the potential mental health effects of workingfrom home. Using data from 1,585workers who participated in the Health, Ethnicity, and Pandemic (HEAP) study, anational survey conducted in the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic in October2020, associations of working from home with psychological distress wereexamined with weighted logistic regression among 1,585 workers and stratified bygender. It was found that workers who worked from home had higher odds ofpsychological distress (aOR and 95% CI = 2.62 [1.46, 4.70]) compared to workerswho did not work from home, adjusting for demographic factors, socioeconomicstatus, and health behaviors. In gender-stratified analyses, this positiveassociation between working from home and psychological distress was significantin women (aOR and 95% CI = 3.68 [1.68, 8.09]) but not in men. These resultshave implications for female workers' mental health in the transition towardsworking from home in the COVID-19 pandemic era.","Matthews, Chen, Omidakhsh, Zhang, Han, Chen, Shi, Li, Wen, Li, Su, Li","https://doi.org/10.2486/indhealth.2022-0077","20220515","COVID-19; Gender; Mental health; Workers; Working from home","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31622,""
"Changes in marriage, divorce and births during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan","Marriage, divorce and fertility are declining in Japan. There is concern that the COVID-19 pandemic may have accelerated the decrease in marriages and births while increasing the number of divorces. Changes in partnership behaviours and fertility have significant implications for mental health, well-being and population demographics. Japanese vital statistical data were collected for December 2011-May 2021. We used the Farrington algorithm on the daily numbers of marriages, divorces and births (per month) in order to determine whether any given month between January 2017 and May 2021 had a significant excess or deficit. Analyses were conducted at the national and regional levels. During the pandemic, significant deficits in the national number of marriages were noted in January 2020, April 2020, May 2020, July 2020, September 2020 and April 2021. Regional marriage patterns reflected national trends. Divorces were noted to be in deficit during April 2020, May 2020 and May 2021 at the country level. Regional analyses mirrored national divorce trends with the exception of Shikoku, which showed no deficits during the pandemic. Significant deficits in the number of total births were noted in December 2020, January 2021 and February 2021. Regionally, birth deficits were concentrated in Chubu, Kansai and Kanto. After the start of the pandemic, no significant excesses in marriages, divorces or births were noted at the national or regional level. Marriages and divorces declined during the pandemic in Japan, especially during state of emergency declarations. There were decreased births between December 2020 and February 2021, approximately 8-10 months after the first state of emergency, suggesting that couples altered their pregnancy intention in response to the pandemic. Metropolitan regions were more affected by the pandemic than their less metropolitan counterparts.","Ghaznavi, Kawashima, Tanoue, Yoneoka, Makiyama, Sakamoto, Ueda, Eguchi, Nomura","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2021-007866","20220517","COVID-19; Epidemiology; Health policy; Public Health; COVID-19; Divorce; Humans; Japan; Marriage; Pandemics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31623,""
"Resilience and its impact on the mental health of physiotherapists during the COVID-19 pandemic in SÃƒÂ£o Paulo, Brazil","To analyze whether resilience modulates the levels of depression, anxiety, stress and the impact of events in physiotherapists who work with COVID-19 patients with those who do not. A cross-sectional study was conducted from August 2020 up to October 2020. A total of 519 physiotherapists were enrolled and divided according to resilience and whether they worked with COVID-19 patients. Volunteers answered sociodemographic questionnaires, rating their depression, anxiety, and stress on a scale (DASS-21). The impact of event scale revised (IES-R) and 14-item resilience scale (14-RS) were also used. Physiotherapists with low resilience present scores significantly high of depression, anxiety, stress and impact of event compared to the high resilience group (PÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯.001). Additionally, working with COVID-19 patients also resulted in increased levels of depression, anxiety, stress, and impact of event compared with the NO COVID-19 group (PÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯.001). These responses were modulated by age, sex, number of absences from work, whether or not personal protective equipment was received, host leadership, and the practice and maintenance of regular physical activity. The responses to the questionnaires were anonymous and self-administered. We cannot assess whether these people had a previous diagnosis of depression, anxiety and stress. Low resilience and work with COVID-19 patients were associated with high levels of depression, anxiety, and stress and worse psychological impacts of events. Several aspects modulate these responses and can contribute to improving the resilience and mental health of physiotherapists who are responsible for the care of COVID-19 patients.","da Silva Pigati, Righetti, Nisiaymamoto, Saraiva-Romanholo, de Fatima Lopes Calvo TibÃƒÂ©rio","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.05.049","20220515","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Physiotherapists; Resilience; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31624,""
"Prevalence and predictors of mental health outcomes in UK doctors and final year medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic","The mental health of doctors is an ongoing concern, both prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to: i) assess the prevalence of symptoms of depression, anxiety, PTSD, and burnout in UK doctors and final year medical students during the pandemic, and ii) analyse the hypothesised relationships between psychological flexibility, intolerance of uncertainty and resilience with these mental health outcomes. A cross-sectional online study of UK-based doctors and final year medical students was conducted between 27/09/2020 and 31/01/2021. Outcomes were measured using the PHQ9, GAD7, PCL-5, and aMBI. Independent variables included the CompACT-SF, IUS-12, and CD-RISC-10. Descriptive statistics, between-group analyses, and multiple regression were performed. Prevalence of anxiety symptoms was 26.3%, depression 21.9%, PTSD 11.8%, and burnout 10.8%. Psychological flexibility negatively predicted all outcomes, apart from low personal achievement. Intolerance of uncertainty positively predicted anxiety and PTSD scores. Resilience negatively predicted scores on burnout subscales. Cross-sectional design and non-probability sampling method means that assumptions about causality cannot be made and may have implications for bias and generalisability of results. Doctors and medical students in the UK reported high levels of mental health symptoms during the pandemic, between September 2020 and January 2021. All three independent variables explained significant variance in mental health outcomes. Psychological flexibility was the most consistent predictor, over and above sociodemographic variables and other psychological predictors. These findings have implications for interventions to improve retention of our essential medical workforce, and for providing support at future times of national crisis.","Johns, Samuel, Waddington","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.05.024","20220515","Anxiety; Burnout; COVID-19; Depression; Doctor; Medical student; PTSD","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31625,""
"Closed doors: Predictors of stress, anxiety, depression, and PTSD during the onset of COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil","The rise in mental health problems in the population directly or indirectly because of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a major concern. The aim of this study was to investigate and compare independent predictors of symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in Brazilians one month after the implementation of measures of social distancing. This cross-sectional study was performed using a web-based survey. The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) were the outcomes. Data were gathered regarding demographics, social distancing, economic problems, exposure to the news of the pandemic, psychiatric history, sleep disturbances, traumatic situations, and substance use. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test - Consumption (AUDIT-C) was also administered. The predictors of the symptoms were investigated using hierarchical multiple linear regression. Of a sample of 3587 participants, approximately two-thirds considered that their mental health worsened after the beginning of the social restriction measures. The most important predictors of the symptoms investigated were the intensity of the distress related to the news of the pandemic, younger age, current psychiatric diagnosis, trouble sleeping, emotional abuse or violence, and economic problems. These results confirmed the hypothesis that the pandemic impacted the mental health of the population and indicated that the level of distress related to the news was the most important predictor of psychological suffering.","Calegaro, Ramos-Lima, Hoffmann, Zoratto, Kerber, Costa, Picinin, KÃƒÂ¶chler, Rodrigues, Maciel, Braun, Girardi, Cecatto, Weber, Rodrigues, Bertolazi, de Oliveira, Negretto, de Mello","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.05.052","20220515","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Pandemic; Post-traumatic; Stress disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31626,""

"Health-Related Quality of Life Outcomes With Regular Yoga and Heartfulness Meditation Practice: Results From a Multinational, Cross-sectional Study","Although the benefits of yoga are well established across the world, there are limited studies exploring the long-term interrelation between yoga, meditation, and health. Specifically, there is limited research exploring the differences in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among regular meditators and nonmeditators. This study explored the differences in 7 domains of HRQOL (including quality of life, ability to adopt a healthy lifestyle, ability to relax, frequency of nervousness and stress, coping with day-to-day stress, workplace productivity, and staying healthy during the COVID-19 pandemic) among practitioners of yoga and meditation. A cross-sectional, online survey was distributed to all members who participated in a 100-day yoga and meditation program, culminating in the International Day of Yoga event, organized by the Heartfulness Institute in partnership with the Central Council for Research in Yoga and Naturopathy, Ministry of Ayush, SVYASA Yoga University, and Patanjali Yoga Institute, India. The program consisted of daily virtual yoga, meditation, and speaker sessions. The data were analyzed by nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis tests for continuous variables and chi-square test for categorical variables. A total of 3164 participants from 39 countries completed the survey. Mean age was 33.8 (SD 13.6) years. The majority of the participants were female (n=1643, 52%) and students (n=1312, 41.5%). Regular yoga and meditation practice was associated with a positive impact on all 7 domains of HRQOL (Mann-Whitney P&lt;.05 and Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup>P&lt;.05). Notably, experienced Heartfulness (Ã¢â€°Â¥2 years) meditators reported better outcomes in all the domains of HRQOL as compared to those not currently practicing this form of meditation and participants with Ã¢â€°Â¤1 year of Heartfulness meditation experience (P&lt;.05). This is one of the first cross-sectional studies to explore HRQOL outcomes among participants of a 100-day virtual yoga and meditation program. Overall, a yoga and meditation practice was found to be an effective tool for promoting HRQOL. Regular yoga and meditation practice was associated with factors promoting health and well-being, with long-term meditation practice associated with increased benefits.","Thimmapuram, Patel, Madhusudhan, Deshpande, Bouderlique, Nicolai, Rao","https://doi.org/10.2196/37876","20220518","COVID-19; Heartfulness; cross-sectional study; health outcome; health-related quality of life; healthy living; meditation; mental health; online survey; psychological health; quality of life; stress; wellness; yoga","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31628,""

"Acceptability of community-based transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in major depression: mixed methods analysis of individual experiences","Acceptability impacts on patient preference, treatment adherence and outcomes. However, acceptability has typically been assessed by attrition rates, which do not reflect the complexity of the construct or provide the details necessary for meaningful interpretation or potential for refinement. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a novel non-invasive brain stimulation that could be a first line treatment in major depressive disorder (MDD). We examined the acceptability of a community-based tDCS treatment for MDD. Acceptability was assessed by questionnaires and individual interviews at three timepoints: baseline, following course of treatment, and a long term 6-month follow up. Participants were 26 MDD (19 women) in a current depressive episode of moderate to severe severity. Treatment was 6-week course of tDCS, provided in a bifrontal montage with real-time remote supervision at each session. Participants consistently endorsed the tDCS sessions as being â€œvery acceptableâ€ from baseline to the follow up period. There was a significant increase in personal endorsement from â€œwould strongly recommendâ€ at the end of treatment to â€œwould very strongly recommendâ€ at follow up. Individual interviews demonstrated four main themes: effectiveness, side effects, time commitment, and feeling held, support and contained. Real-time supervision of each session may not reflect usual treatment protocols and could have influenced acceptability. Acceptability remained high throughout the course of treatment and at follow up. The theme of feeling contained could be specific to this protocol. Emergence of novel themes demonstrates the benefits of obtaining qualitative views for intervention refinement.","Rachael M.

"Psychological resilience factors and their association with weekly stressor reactivity during the COVID-19 outbreak in Europe","Recently, cross-sectional relationships between psycho-social resilience factors (RFs) and resilience, operationalized as an outcome of low reactivity of mental health to stressor exposure (low â€˜stressor reactivityâ€™) during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, were reported. Extending these findings, we here examine prospective relationships and weekly dynamics between the same RFs and stressor reactivity in a longitudinal sample during the aftermath of the first wave in several European countries. Over five weeks of app-based assessments, participants weekly reported stressor exposure, mental health problems, RFs, and demographic data, in one of six different languages. As (partly) preregistered, hypotheses were tested cross-sectionally at baseline (N=558) and longitudinally (N=200), using mixed effects models and mediation analyses. RFs at baseline, including positive appraisal style, optimism, self-efficacy, perceived good stress recovery, and perceived social support, were negatively associated with stressor reactivity (SR) scores, not only cross-sectionally (baseline SR scores) but also prospectively (average SR scores across subsequent weeks). In both analyses, positive appraisal style mediated the effects of perceived social support on SR. In the analyses of weekly RF-SR dynamics, RFs positive appraisal (of stressors generally and specifically of the Corona crisis) and general self-efficacy were negatively associated with SR in a contemporaneous, but not lagged fashion. We identify psychological RFs which prospectively predict resilience and co-fluctuate with weekly stressor reactivity within individuals. The prospective results endorse that the previously reported RF-SR associations do not exclusively reflect mood-congruency or other temporal bias effects. We further confirm an important role for positive appraisal in resilience.","Sophie BÃ¶gemann et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E015F-92F-D7F","20220518","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; stressor reactivity; mental health; pandemic; positive appraisal; resilience","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-19","",31636,""
