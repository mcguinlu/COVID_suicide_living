"COVID-19 pandemic and mental health in Spain: an analysis of their relationship using Google Trends","This study aims to examine the public interest that exists on internet regarding various mental health topics and its relationship with evolution of COVID-19 pandemic in Spain. Google Trends was used to explore relative search volume (RSV) for the following terms related with mental health (TRMH): &quot;anxiety&quot;, &quot;depression&quot;, &quot;stress&quot;, &quot;insomnia&quot; and &quot;suicide&quot;; between January and December 2020. The cross-correlation function was performed to assess association between new COVID-19 cases and RSV levels for TRMH. Finally, Mann-Whitney test was used to examine differences between RSV values for TRMH before and after of state of alarm declarations on March and October 2020. The &quot;anxiety&quot; term showed the highest RSV indices. A significant correlation was found between new COVID-19 cases and RSV for &quot;anxiety&quot; with a time-lag of +1 week (r=0.49; p&lt;0.05). Was found an increase of SRV for &quot;anxiety&quot; (U=0.00; p=0.01) and a decrease of SRV for &quot;depression&quot; (U=1.00; p=0.04) between 4-week period before and after state of alarm of March 2020. Regarding the state of alarm of October 2020, a higher RSV for &quot;anxiety&quot; (U=0.50; p=0.02) was found in the four weeks after it compared with a similar previous period. Anxiety is the mental health topic of greatest public interest on internet in context of COVID-19 pandemic. Public concern about anxiety rises one week after the increase in COVID-19 cases and is greater after introduction of control measures that entail any type of mobility restriction or activity limitation. There is a greater general need for information on anxiety at specific times in the pandemic evolution.","Becerra-GarcÃƒÂ­a, SÃƒÂ¡nchez-GutiÃƒÂ©rrez, Barbeito, Calvo","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rpsm.2021.05.001","20210518","Ansiedad; Anxiety; COVID-19; Internet use; Mental health; Public health; Salud mental; Salud pÃƒÂºblica; Uso de internet","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13761,""
"Real versus illusory personal growth in response to COVID-19 pandemic stressors","There is considerable evidence of widespread emotional distress associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. A growing number of studies have assessed posttraumatic growth related to the current pandemic; but, none have considered whether reported growth is real or illusory (i.e., characterized by avoidant or defensive coping that results in higher levels of distress). The purpose of this study was to extend this literature by assessing growth specific to the pandemic in people reporting high levels of COVID-related stress and estimating the extent of real and illusory COVID-19-related growth. Participants were 893 adults from Canada and the United States with high levels of COVID-related stress who provided complete responses on measures of posttraumatic growth, disability, and measures of general and COVID-related distress as part of a larger longitudinal survey. Approximately 77 % of participants reported moderate to high growth in at least one respect, the most common being developing greater appreciation for healthcare workers, for the value of one's own life, for friends and family, for each day, as well as changing priorities about what is important in life and greater feelings of self-reliance. Consistent with predictions, cluster analysis identified two clusters characterized by high growth, one comprising 32 % of the sample and reflective of real growth (i.e., reporting little disability and stable symptoms across time) and the other comprising 17 % of the sample and reflective of illusory growth (i.e., reporting high disability and worsening symptoms). These clusters did not differ in terms of socially desirable response tendencies; but, the illusory growth cluster reported greater increases in alcohol use since onset of the pandemic. Consistent with research regarding personal growth in response to prior pandemics and COVID-19, we found evidence to suggest moderate to high levels of COVID-related growth with respect to appreciation for healthcare workers, life, friends and family, and self-reliance. Findings from our cluster analysis support the thesis that many reports of COVID-related personal growth reflect ineffectual pandemic-related coping as opposed to true growth. These findings have important implications for developing strategies to optimize stress resilience and posttraumatic growth during chronically stressful events such as pandemics.","Asmundson, Paluszek, Taylor","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2021.102418","20210518","COVID-19; COVID-19 stress; Coronavirus; Mental health; Pandemic; Posttraumatic growth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13762,""
"Primary Care Provider-Reported Prevalence of Vaccine and Polyethylene-Glycol Allergy in Canada","The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of accurate capture of vaccine, and vaccine component, allergy. There remains a gap in the prevalence literature from the perspective of direct primary care provider (PCP) reporting at a population level. To determine the prevalence of PCP-documented vaccine and polyethylene glycol (PEG) allergy using Electronic Medical Record (EMR) data from the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN). Retrospective cohort study using the CPCSSN repository. Machine learning algorithms were applied to assess for vaccine allergy documentation, and ATC codes used for PEG allergy or allergy to common injectable medications containing PEG (CIMCP). The prevalence of PCP-documented vaccine allergy in Canada was 0.037%, (395/1,055,677) and of PEG allergy was 0.0009% (10/1,055,677). In total, 0.01% of patients had a documented allergy to either PEG or CIMCP (135/1,055,677). None of the patients with PEG allergy had a documented allergy to a CIMCP. Patients with vaccine allergy and PEG allergy were significantly more likely to have other atopic comorbidities including asthma (P&lt;.0001 for both), eczema (P&lt;.0001 and P=.001 respectively), rhinitis (P=.002 and P&lt;.0001 respectively) and food allergy (P&lt;.0001 for both). Significantly higher rates of depression (P=.0005 and P&lt;.0001 respectively) and anxiety (P=.003 and P&lt;.0001) were seen in those with vaccine allergy, or PEG allergy, compared to those without. This is the first study to estimate the prevalence of vaccine and PEG allergy in a national cohort that utilizes PCP documentation, demonstrating a low reported rate of vaccine allergy and PEG allergy.","Abrams, Greenhawt, Shaker, Kosowan, Singer","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anai.2021.05.011","20210518","PEG allergy; vaccine allergy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13763,""
"Working from home and dietary changes during the COVID-19 pandemic: A longitudinal study of health app (CALO mama) users","It is plausible that the coronavirus disease pandemic and related changes in work and life patterns affected dietary patterns, but existing studies have limitations owing to a cross-sectional design. Using longitudinal data, we examined dietary changes in people due to the pandemic and work and life patterns. We conducted an online survey on changes in work and life patterns during the pandemic from April 30, 2020, to May 8, 2020, among users of a health app called CALO mama provided in Japan. We retrieved and linked the dietary data for 5,929 participants from January 1, 2020, to May 13, 2020. Generalized linear mixed models were used to estimate the frequencies of food intake associated with the pandemic and work and life patterns. During the state of emergency, the frequency of intake of vegetables, beans, seaweeds, fish, meats, dairy products, and snacks increased, whereas alcohol intake decreased. Working from home was associated with increased intake of vegetables, fruits, dairy products, and snacks but decreased intake of seaweeds, meats, and alcohol. Time spent on childcare was associated with decreased intake of vegetables and fruits but increased intake of meats. Probable depressive symptoms were negatively associated with the frequency of food intake other than snacks and alcohol. We conclude that diet quality improved during the pandemic in general, but attention must be paid to overconsumption of snacks and negative factors such as increased burden of childcare and depression for healthy eating.","Sato, Kobayashi, Yamaguchi, Sakata, Sasaki, Murayama, Kondo","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2021.105323","20210518","COVID-19; dietary change; fruit and vegetable intake; snacking; work and life pattern; working from home","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13764,""
"Transdiagnostic Psychiatric Symptoms, Burnout, and Functioning in Frontline Health Care Workers Responding to the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Symptomics Analysis","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to an increased risk of psychiatric symptoms among frontline health care workers (FHCWs). In the current study, a novel &quot;symptomics&quot; approach was employed to examine the association between acute transdiagnostic symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and burnout and work and relationship difficulties in FHCWs at an urban tertiary care hospital in New York City. Symptoms of COVID-19-related PTSD (4-item PTSD Checklist-5), MDD (Patient Health Questionnaire-8), GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7), burnout (Single-Item Mini-Z Burnout Assessment), and functional difficulties (Brief Inventory of Psychosocial Functioning) were assessed. Relative importance analyses were conducted to identify PTSD, MDD, and GAD symptoms associated with burnout and functional difficulties. The total number of eligible participants included 6,026 presumed FHCWs, of which 3,360 (55.8%) completed the survey and 2,579 (76.8%) of whom endorsed directly treating patients with COVID-19 and provided sufficient responses to our outcome variables for analysis. Feeling tired/having little energy, being easily annoyed or irritable, and feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge were most strongly associated with burnout; feeling tired/having little energy accounted for the greatest amount of explained variance (&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°15%). Negative expectations of oneself or the world, trouble concentrating, and feeling easily annoyed or irritable were most strongly associated with work difficulties; negative expectations of oneself or the world accounted for the greatest amount of explained variance (&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°9%). Feeling easily annoyed or irritable, negative expectations about oneself or the world, and feeling bad about oneself were most strongly associated with relationship difficulties; feeling easily annoyed or irritable accounted for the greatest amount of explained variance (&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°10%). Results of this study underscore the importance of a transdiagnostic, symptom-based approach when examining associations between acute psychopathology and burnout and functional difficulties in FHCWs. Further work is needed to determine if early interventions aimed at ameliorating specific psychiatric symptoms may help mitigate risk for peri- and posttraumatic burnout and functional difficulties in this population.","Kachadourian, Feder, Murrough, Feingold, Kaye-Kauderer, Charney, Southwick, Peccoralo, Ripp, Pietrzak","https://doi.org/10.4088/JCP.20m13766","20210518","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13765,""
"Mental health and illness of medical students and newly graduated doctors during the pandemic of SARS-Cov-2/COVID-19","SARS-Cov-2 virus pandemic causes serious emotional consequences. It has occurred widespread medical courses suspension, and graduations were anticipated. Field hospitals, set up to treat patients with mild to moderate COVID-19, were the main workplaces of newly graduated doctors. To assess the impact of SARS-Cov-2/COVID-19 pandemic on mental health of medical interns and newly graduated doctors. This is a cross-sectional study performed using a digital platform. Links to forms were sent in two moments: moment 1 (M1), at the beginning of the pandemic, in the first half of April/2020 and moment 2 (M2), after six months of pandemic, in the second half of September/2020. All students from the medical internship and all doctors graduated since 2018 from the three medical schools in Sergipe-NE-Brazil were invited. 335 forms were answered in April and 148 in September. In M1 88.9% considered themselves exposed to excess of information about COVID-19, which was associated with anxiety symptoms (p = 0.04). Long family physical distance was also associated with these symptoms, as increased appetite (p = 0.01), feeling shortness of breath (p = 0.003) and sweating (p = 0.007). Fear of acquire COVID-19 was reported as intense by almost half of participants, and of transmitting by 85.7% in M1. In M2 41.2% reported the death of friends or relatives. Psychiatric illness was described by 38.5% and psychotropic drugs use by 30.1% in M1, especially those who lived alone (p = 0.03) and the single ones (p = 0.01). Alcohol intake was reported by 54.3%, and among doctors graduated in 2020 it increased from 50% in M1 to 85% in M2 (p = 0.04). The pandemic had a negative impact on the mental health of medical students and newly graduated doctors.

"Factors Affecting Portal Usage Among Chronically Ill Patients During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the Netherlands: Cross-sectional Study","The COVID-19 pandemic has seriously impacted the capacity of the regular healthcare system. It is reflected in limited access to non-urgent care for chronically ill patients in the Dutch healthcare system. Nevertheless, many of them still depend on healthcare assistance to manage their illnesses. Patient portals are used to provide continued healthcare (remotely) and offer self-management tools during COVID-19 and potentially after. However, little is known about the factors influencing portal usage and users' satisfaction among chronically ill patients during the Covid-19 pandemic. The objective of this study was to examine predictors of chronically ill patients' usage of patient portals, the willingness to recommend the portal to others, and the likelihood of future usage among portal non-users. An online self-administered questionnaire was distributed among chronically ill patients via social media in May 2020. The questionnaire consisted of four parts: 1) Demographics including age and daily internet hours of usage; 2) Physical health status including COVID19 infection, perceived level of control, and hospital visits; 3) Mental health status including depression and life satisfaction; 4) Portal usage including response waiting time and awareness. Descriptive analyses, correlation, univariate, and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify factors that affect portal usage, users' willingness to recommend, non-users' likelihood of future portal usage. A total of 652 patients responded, of which 461 valid questionnaires were included. Among the 461 patients, 67% (307/461) were identified as patient portal users. Of the non-users, 55% (85/154) reported not being aware of the existence of a patient portal at their hospital. Significant predictors of portal usage include level of control (P=.04), hospital visit time (P=.03), depression scale (P=.03), and status of life satisfaction (P=.02). Among portal users, waiting time to get a response via the portal (P&lt;.001) and maximum acceptable waiting time (P&lt;.001) are the strongest predictors for willingness to recommend the portal; among non-users, the model predicts that those who were not aware of patient portals (P&lt;.001) and were willing to wait moderately long (P&lt;.001) are most likely to use the portal in the future. This study provides insights into factors that influence portal usage and willingness to recommend, based on which healthcare providers can improve the adoption of patient portals and their services. It suggests that healthcare providers should leverage efficient operations management to improve responsiveness and reduce waiting time to enhance user satisfaction and willingness to recommend usage. Healthcare organizations need to increase portal awareness among non-users and train their patients to increase both usage and longer adoption of patient portals. Factors including depression and life satisfaction can influence portal usage; therefore, future studies on determinates of portal usage and non-usage in this specific population are needed.","Kong, Riedewald, Askari","https://doi.org/10.2196/26003","20210518","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13767,""

"[Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the care situation in psychiatric hospitals in Germany]","To assess the structural performance of psychiatric hospitals in Germany during the COVID(coronavirus disease)-19 pandemic, aÃ‚Â nationwide survey was launched in March 2020, in which the corona-related changes in care structures during the first wave of the pandemic were collated. Data on the care situation were collected by means of a survey inÃ‚Â 38 out of 388 contacted psychiatric and psychotherapy hospitals in Germany over the course of 1 month. The changes and adaptations of the care structures, the type of therapy measures applied and care options for people with mental disorders and a COVID-19 infection as well as the legal basis underlying the care for patients unable to consent were documented. On average, the inpatient treatment capacity of psychiatric hospitals in Germany decreased by approximately 40% compared with prepandemic periods. Day clinic and outpatient services were also only available in aÃ‚Â limited form or were even discontinued completely. Specialized wards for patients with COVID-19 infections were available in most of the surveyed clinics (84%). Psychiatric hospitals were already able to respond quickly and adequately to the crisis situation in the first wave of the pandemic, e.g. by setting up COVID wards; however, the reduction in treatment capacity to 60% has significantly worsened the care situation for people with mental illnesses. Therefore, further efforts should urgently be made to adapt mental health care to the requirements of the pandemic in the long term. ZIEL: Um die strukturelle LeistungsfÃƒÂ¤higkeit psychiatrischer Kliniken in Deutschland wÃƒÂ¤hrend der COVID(Ã¢â‚¬Å¾coronavirus diseaseÃ¢â‚¬Å“)-19-Pandemie beurteilen zu kÃƒÂ¶nnen, wurde im MÃƒÂ¤rz 2020 eine Umfrage durchgefÃƒÂ¼hrt, in der die Corona-bedingten VerÃƒÂ¤nderungen der Versorgungstrukturen wÃƒÂ¤hrend der ersten Welle der Pandemie erfasst wurden. Zur Erfassung der Versorgungssituation wurden mittels Umfrage Daten inÃ‚Â 38 von 388 angeschrieben Kliniken fÃƒÂ¼r Psychiatrie und Psychotherapie in Deutschland im Verlauf eines Monats erhoben. Dokumentiert wurden die VerÃƒÂ¤nderungen und Anpassungen der Versorgungsstrukturen, die Art der angewendeten TherapiemaÃƒÅ¸nahmen und VersorgungsmÃƒÂ¶glichkeiten fÃƒÂ¼r Menschen mit psychischen StÃƒÂ¶rungen und einer COVID-19-Infektion sowie die der Versorgung zugrunde liegende Rechtsgrundlage bei nichteinwilligungsfÃƒÂ¤higen Patient*innen. Im Durchschnitt verringerte sich die stationÃƒÂ¤re BehandlungskapazitÃƒÂ¤t psychiatrischer Kliniken in Deutschland etwa um 40Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% im Vergleich zu Zeiten vor der Pandemie.

In den meisten befragten Einrichtungen (84Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%) standen Spezialbereiche fÃƒÂ¼r COVID-19-infizierte Patient*innen zur VerfÃƒÂ¼gung. Psychiatrische Kliniken waren bereits in der ersten Welle der Pandemie in der Lage, schnell und adÃƒÂ¤quat auf die Krisensituation z.Ã‚Â B. durch Einrichtung von COVID-Stationen zu reagieren. Durch die Reduzierung der BehandlungskapazitÃƒÂ¤ten auf 60Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% hat sich jedoch die Versorgungssituation fÃƒÂ¼r Menschen mit psychischen Erkrankungen deutlich verschlechtert.

"Rates and predictors of uptake of mental health support during the COVID-19 pandemic: an analysis of 26,720 adults in the UK in lockdown","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has put a great strain on people's mental health. A growing number of studies have shown worsening mental health measures globally during the pandemic. However, there is a lack of empirical study on how people support their mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to examine a number of formal and informal mental health support. Further, it explored factors that might be associated with the use of different types mental health support. Data from 26,720 adults in the UCL COVID-19 Social Study were analysed between 13th April 2020 and 3rd July 2020. Data were analysed using logistic and Poisson regression models. About 45% of people reported talking to friends or family members to support their mental health, 43% engaging in self-care activities, 20% taking medication, 9% speaking to mental health professionals, 8% talking to a GP or other health professional, and another 8% using helpline or online services. Gender, education, living status, loneliness, pre-existing mental health conditions, general depression and anxiety, coping and personality were found to be associated with the use of mental health support. While the negative impacts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic are inevitable, people can play an active role in managing their mental health.

"[Impact of social distancing for covid-19 on the psychological well-being of youths: a systematic review of the literature]","During the first semester 2020 almost all country implemented rigid measures of social distances, including schools closure, to limit the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Up to now, however, the efficacy of school closure to reduce the spread of the disease in the community still remains unclear and no much is known about the potential negative effects of such measures on physical health and psychological wellbeing of youths, mainly if protracted for long periods. To summarize the data of a systematic review on the impact of the 2020 school closure and social distances measures implemented in response to covid-19 pandemic on youths' physical health and psychological wellbeing. In the present paper we describe the impact on psychological wellbeing. We searched 11 international databases up to 1st September 2020 to retrieve cohort studies, cross sectional surveys, uncontrolled pre-post studies and modelling studies. Methodological quality of included studies has been assessed with validated checklists. Sixty-four studies have been included; 27 assessed the impact on psychological wellbeing. All the studies have been conducted during the first wave of pandemic and assessed the short-term effect of social distances measures implemented for relatively short periods. The majority of the studies were conducted in the UK (37,6%) and China (27%). The 42.3% has been judged of high methodological quality. Two studies reported an increase of suicides, while two studies reported a reduction of the access to Psychiatric Emergency Department, Maltreatment allegations decreased substantially, likely due to a reduction in reports rather than actual incidence. Prevalence of anxiety among adolescents ranged between 19% and 64%, depression between 22.3% and 43.7%. Among children 5-12 years old, prevalence of anxiety varied between 19% and 78%, while depression between 6.3% and 22.6%. Among pre-school children, some studies found worsening of behavioural and emotional problems while others did not. Most of the studies reported relevant worsening of the psychological wellbeing, mainly among adolescents. If school closure and rigid social distances measures will extend for a long time, an even more pronounced negative effect can be expected. Further studies are needed on the long-term effect of prolonged social distances measures, as well as a careful harm-benefit analysis of the impact of such measures.","Minozzi, Saulle, Amato, Davoli","https://doi.org/10.1701/3608.35873","20210518","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13771,""
"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic lockdown on occupational therapy practice and use of telerehabilitation - A cross sectional study","COVID-19 has become a global public health emergency affecting 223 countries and territories, and it drastically changed the life of public and health care delivery systems. Although many guidelines have been proposed to avoid infection from COVID-19 and to promote the use of telerehabilitation, there is still no clear answer for the current scenario and strategies of therapists' practice during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. This study aimed to explore the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on Occupational Therapists' (OTs) practice, the use of telerehabilitation strategies by OTs, and their employment and mental health. Also, this study aimed to explore the OTs perspective on the role of telerehabilitation during this pandemic lockdown. Online cross-sectional survey was conducted between April 2020 and May 2020. 114 OTs completed the survey. The results of this study showed that 52.8% of therapists had stress and anxiety due to COVID-19 lockdown. We found that 60.7% of OTs (n=65) used telerehabilitation, versus 36.1% (n=39) before the lockdown. Telerehabilitation approaches were mostly implemented during this lockdown for children with autistic problems (66.6%), stroke (12.9%), cerebral palsy (6.4%), learning disabilities (9.6%), Parkinson's diseases (1.6%), and other medical conditions (2.8%). 10% of therapists reported that they lost their job, and 76% reported that this lockdown affected their income negatively. Overall, 87.8% of therapists reported that mobile technology was very useful to overcome the stress due to COVID-19 related lockdown, social isolation, and social distancing.

Records of all in-patients between January 2019 and July 2020 (n = 78) were examined for 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) level, ward area, supplementation status, test seasonality, medication and health status. The mean 25(OH)D level for supplemented (800 IU/day) patients was 75 nmol/L (s.d. = 20), compared with 40 nmol/L (s.d. = 19) in the non-supplemented group (P &lt; 0.001). Thirty-eight percent of those who were in-patients during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic developed symptoms, but the small sample size could not establish vitamin D levels as a predictor of outcome. Vitamin D (800 IU/day) supplementation is effective but the adequacy of the nationally recommended dose of 400 IU/day is unclear.

"Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on acute stress disorder and career planning among healthcare students","This study aimed to investigate the effects of COVID-19 on the prevalence of acute stress disorder and subsequent effects on career planning among healthcare students. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 1158 healthcare students across five medical universities in February 2020. Acute stress disorder was assessed using the Stanford Acute Stress Response Questionnaire. Further data regarding COVID-19 knowledge, individual behaviours, occupational choices, and career planning were collected. Based on the results of the Stanford Acute Stress Response Questionnaire, the students were divided into high-risk and low-risk groups for acute stress disorder. The correlation between acute stress disorder and the impact on career planning was analysed. The high-risk group comprised 143 (12.3%) participants, while 1015 (87.7%) participants were in the low-risk group. Two factors increased the risk of acute stress disorder in the students, including 'I think the pandemic is far away from me' (B: 1.27, 95%CI: 1.60-7.87) and 'Physical contact with confirmed or suspected cases' (B: 2.49, 95%CI: 3.42-42.44). Those who obtained pandemic information from official media sources indicated a lower risk of acute stress disorder (B: -0.24, 95%CI: 0.49-1.26). The high-risk group was more likely to quit the medical profession after graduation. The COVID-19 pandemic may cause acute stress disorder among healthcare students and affect their career planning. Universities and relevant departments should provide more information and moral support for these students.","Zhang, Qi, Wang, Wang, Huang, Li, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.1111/inm.12839","20210518","COVID-19; acute stress disorder; career planning; healthcare students; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13774,""
"Converging public health crises: substance use during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic","The international, public health crisis caused by the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in unforeseen medical and psychiatric consequences. We reviewed publications from January 2020 to January 2021, given that earlier documents were not relevant, to review findings on changes in substance use and overdoses during the pandemic. Additionally, this review of the literature also documents advocacy efforts, health service modification and challenges, as well as COVID-related health complications associated with substance use. Recent work focused on identifying changes in the distribution and use of substances as well as the unique challenges to promoting the health of persons who use substances in the current pandemic. Although COVID-19 has triggered unprecedented innovations in the organizational and public policy, the use of certain substances (alcohol, cannabis, cigarettes, fentanyl, heroin, and opiates) is increasing internationally. Unique associations between substance use and pandemic-related adverse health outcomes were identified. In addition, the pandemic precipitated significant barriers and disruptions to care. Given increased overdose rates and infections among people who use drugs, continued surveillance and vigilance are needed to assess changes and reduce use and adverse consequences during the continuing COVID-19 crisis. Changes are urgently needed to reduce adverse health outcomes because of treatment barriers and lack of adequate treatment options. Additionally, integrative approaches are necessary to promote the public health of persons who use substances.","Striley, Hoeflich","https://doi.org/10.1097/YCO.0000000000000722","20210518","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13775,""
"Impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on healthcare workers: systematic comparison between nurses and medical doctors","The COVID-19 outbreak has had major impact on individual's psychological health and overall well being worldwide. Evidence shows that these psychological challenges are especially prominent in healthcare workers (HCW); especially in nurses. Indeed, several studies report that nurses suffer more psychologically because of the consequences of the pandemic compared with medical doctors. To further look into this, we systematically review the recent literature to see whether the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic differs between medical doctors and nurses across studies and which aspects of mental health are especially affected in nurses. Across studies, there is solid evidence that nurses show poorer mental health outcomes compared with medical doctors during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is especially true for symptoms of depression, anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Here, prevalence rates in nurses are often higher than 50%. In contrast, general stress levels and burnout seem to be comparable between nurses and medical doctors. Given that nurses suffer more from depression, anxiety and PTSD symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, special programs addressing their needs are required.","Kunz, Strasser, Hasan","https://doi.org/10.1097/YCO.0000000000000721","20210518","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13776,""
"COVID-19 health and social care access for autistic people: European policy review","The global COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on European health and social care systems, with demands on testing, hospital and intensive care capacity exceeding available resources in many regions. This has led to concerns that some vulnerable groups, including autistic people, may be excluded from services. We reviewed policies from 15 European member states, published in March-July 2020, pertaining to (1) access to COVID-19 tests; (2) provisions for treatment, hospitalisation and intensive care units (ICUs); and (3) changes to standard health and social care. In parallel, we analysed survey data on the lived experiences of 1301 autistic people and caregivers. Autistic people experienced significant barriers when accessing COVID-19 services. First, despite being at elevated risk of severe illness due to co-occurring health conditions, there was a lack of accessibility of COVID-19 testing. Second, many COVID-19 outpatient and inpatient treatment services were reported to be inaccessible, predominantly resulting from individual differences in communication needs. Third, ICU triage protocols in many European countries (directly or indirectly) resulted in discriminatory exclusion from lifesaving treatments. Finally, interruptions to standard health and social care left over 70% of autistic people without everyday support. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated existing healthcare inequalities for autistic people, probably contributing to disproportionate increases in morbidity and mortality, mental health and behavioural difficulties, and reduced quality of life. An urgent need exists for policies and guidelines on accessibility of COVID-19 services to be updated to prevent the widespread exclusion of autistic people from services, which represents a violation of international human rights law.","Oakley, Tillmann, Ruigrok, Baranger, Takow, Charman, Jones, Cusack, Doherty, Violland, WroczyÃ…â€žska, Simonoff, Buitelaar, Gallagher, Murphy","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-045341","20210518","COVID-19; child &amp; adolescent psychiatry; health policy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13777,""
"Effects of social isolation on a long-term care resident with dementia and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic","The older population and medically frail persons are at higher risk of severe infections and death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Long-term care (LTC) facilities are encouraged to take various actions to safeguard residents and reduce the spread of COVID-19 including by restricting visitors, which leads to isolation. The imposed isolation undermines the autonomy of older adults living in LTC facilities, especially those with dementia, and the isolation from loved ones can worsen cognition and depression. The purpose of this case report is to highlight isolation practices implemented to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in an LTC facility, which increased the social isolation and worsened cognition and depression in a resident with dementia and depression. Because many residents of LTC facilities have dementia, this case is an example of the need for interventions to support the mental health of persons living in LTC facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic.","LeVasseur","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gerinurse.2021.04.007","20210518","COVID-19; Dementia; Depression; Isolation; Long-term care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13778,""
"Mindfulness-based online intervention on mental health and quality of life among COVID-19 patients in China: an intervention design","COVID-19 can lead to increased psychological symptoms such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety among patients with COVID-19. Based on the previous mindfulness-based interventions proved to be effective, this protocol reports a design of a randomized controlled trial aiming to explore the efficacy and possible mechanism of a mindful living with challenge (MLWC) intervention developed for COVID-19 survivors in alleviating their psychological problems caused by both the disease and the pandemic. In April 2021, more than 1600 eligible participants from Hubei Province of China will be assigned 1:1 to an online MLWC intervention group or a waitlist control group. All participants will be asked to complete online questionnaires at baseline, post-program, and 3-month follow-up. The differences of mental health status (e.g. PTSD) and physical symptoms including fatigue and sleeplessness between the COVID-19 survivors who receiving the online MLWC intervention and the control group will be assessed. In addition, the possible mediators and moderators of the link between the MLWC intervention and target outcomes will be evaluated by related verified scales, such as the Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire. Data will be analyzed based on an intention-to-treat approach, and SPSS software will be used to perform statistical analysis. The efficacy and potential mechanism of MLWC intervention in improving the quality of life and psychological status of COVID-19 survivors in China are expected to be reported.

"Mental health and its relationship with social support in Iranian students during the COVID-19 pandemic","In addition to physical problems, the COVID-19 crisis continues to impose serious psychological adverse effects on people's mental health, which plays a major role in the efficiency of every community. Students, especially medical sciences students, suffer from more stress as a result of exposure to COVID-induced stressors. It is, therefore, essential to measure mental health and its relationship with social support in medical sciences students during the COVID pandemic. The present study was conducted to determine the mental health status of students and its correlation with social support. This cross-sectional study was conducted using random sampling on 280 students of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences in Iran in 2020. Socio-demographic profile scale, Mental Health Test (GHQ-28), and the scale of Perceived Social Support (PRQ-85) were used to collect data. Participants completed the questionnaires online. Considering the potential confounding variables, a general linear model (GLM) was utilized to determine the relationship between mental health and perceived social support. Mean (Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°standard deviation) of total mental health score 26.5 (12.5) was in the acceptable range of 0-63., and 56% of students suffered from a mental disorder. Mean (Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°standard deviation) of social support score 128.2 (21.0) ranged from 25 to175. According to Pearson's correlation coefficient, there was a significant inverse correlation between social support score and total mental health score and all its subscales [pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001; rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.294 toÃ¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.536]. According to the GLM, mental health score decreased significantly with social support score [pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001;Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.32 toÃ¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.20; CI 95%; BÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.26]. Given the inverse relationship between social support and mental health, it is suggested to increase the level of social support for students at all times, especially during the stressful COVID-19 pandemic to improve their mental health.","Ghafari, Mirghafourvand, Rouhi, Osouli Tabrizi","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40359-021-00589-4","20210518","Covid-19; Mental health; Social support; Student","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13780,""
"Global effect of COVID-19 pandemic on physical activity, sedentary behaviour and sleep among 3- to 5-year-old children: a longitudinal study of 14 countries","The restrictions associated with the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in changes to young children's daily routines and habits. The impact on their participation in movement behaviours (physical activity, sedentary screen time and sleep) is unknown. This international longitudinal study compared young children's movement behaviours before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Parents of children aged 3-5Ã¢â‚¬â€°years, from 14 countries (8 low- and middle-income countries, LMICs) completed surveys to assess changes in movement behaviours and how these changes were associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Surveys were completed in the 12Ã¢â‚¬â€°months up to March 2020 and again between May and June 2020 (at the height of restrictions). Physical activity (PA), sedentary screen time (SST) and sleep were assessed via parent survey. At Time 2, COVID-19 factors including level of restriction, environmental conditions, and parental stress were measured. Compliance with the World Health Organizations (WHO) Global guidelines for PA (180Ã¢â‚¬â€°min/day [Ã¢â€°Â¥60Ã¢â‚¬â€°min moderate- vigorous PA]), SST (Ã¢â€°Â¤1Ã¢â‚¬â€°h/day) and sleep (10-13Ã¢â‚¬â€°h/day) for children under 5Ã¢â‚¬â€°years of age, was determined. Nine hundred- forty-eight parents completed the survey at both time points. Children from LMICs were more likely to meet the PA (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AdjOR]Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.0, 95%Confidence Interval [CI] 1.0,3.8) and SST (AdjORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.2, 95%CI 1.2,3.9) guidelines than their high-income country (HIC) counterparts. Children who could go outside during COVID-19 were more likely to meet all WHO Global guidelines (AdjORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.3, 95%CI 1.1,9.8) than those who were not. Children of parents with higher compared to lower stress were less likely to meet all three guidelines (AdjORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.5, 95%CI 0.3,0.9). PA and SST levels of children from LMICs have been less impacted by COVID-19 than in HICs.

"Worry and mental health in the Covid-19 pandemic: vulnerability factors in the general Norwegian population","There is an urgent need for knowledge about the mental health consequences of the ongoing pandemic. The aim of this study was to identify vulnerability factors for psychological distress and reduced life satisfaction in the general population. Furthermore, we aimed to assess the role of COVID-related worries for psychological distress and life satisfaction. A presumed representative sample for the Norwegian population (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1041, response rateÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°39.9%) responded to a web-survey in May 2020. The participants were asked about potential vulnerability factors including increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 (underlying illness, older age), socioeconomic disadvantage (living alone, unemployment, economic problems), and pre-existing mental health vulnerability (recent exposure to violence, previous mental health challenges). Additional measures included COVID-related worry, psychological distress, and life satisfaction. More than one out of four reported current psychological distress over the threshold for clinically significant symptoms. Socioeconomic disadvantages, including living alone and pre-existing economic challenges, and pre-existing mental health vulnerabilities, including recent exposure to violence and previous mental health problems, were associated with a higher level of psychological distress and a lower level of life satisfaction. A higher level of COVID-related worry was significantly associated with a higher level of psychological distress, and a lower level of life satisfaction, even when adjusting for all the vulnerability factors. This study identified several vulnerability factors for mental health problems in the pandemic. Individuals recently exposed to violence and individuals with pre-existing mental health problems are at particular risk. Worrying about the consequences of the pandemic contributes negatively to current mental health. However, worry cannot explain the excess distress in vulnerable groups. Future research should focus on how COVID-related strains contribute to mental health problems for vulnerable groups.","Blix, Birkeland, Thoresen","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-10927-1","20210518","COVID-19; Mental health; Pandemic; Worry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13782,""

"Review of antiviral peptides for use against zoonotic and selected non-zoonotic viruses","Viruses remain one of the leading causes of animal and human disease. Some animal viral infections spread sporadically to human populations, posing a serious health risk. Particularly the emerging viral zoonotic diseases such as the novel, zoonotic coronavirus represent an actual challenge for the scientific and medical community. Besides human health risks, some animal viral infections, although still not zoonotic, represent important economic loses to the livestock industry. Viral infections pose a genuine concern for which there has been an increasing interest for new antiviral molecules. Among these novel compounds, antiviral peptides have been proposed as promising therapeutic options, not only for the growing body of evidence showing hopeful results but also due to the many adverse effects of chemical-based drugs. Here we review the current progress, key targets and considerations for the development of antiviral peptides (AVPs). The review summarizes the state of the art of the AVPs tested in zoonotic (coronaviruses, Rift Valley fever viruses, Eastern Equine Encephalitis Virus, Dengue and JunÃƒÂ­n virus) and also non-zoonotic farm animal viruses (avian and cattle viruses). Their molecular target, amino acid sequence and mechanism of action are summarized and reviewed. Antiviral peptides are currently on the cutting edge since they have been reported to display anti-coronavirus activity. Particularly, the review will discuss the specific mode of action of AVPs that specifically inhibit the fusion of viral and host-cell membranes for SARS-CoV-2, showing in detail some important features of the fusion inhibiting peptides that target the spike protein of these risky viruses.","Hollmann, Cardoso, Espeche, MaffÃƒÂ­a","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2021.170570","20210517","Animal viruses; Antiviral peptides; Coronavirus; Zoonotic viruses","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13784,""

This cross-sectional study was conducted May 5-25, 2020, among 347 hospital staff (nursing and other hospital staff, with the exception of doctors). Depression, anxiety, and insomnia were measured using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, and the Insomnia Severity Index, respectively. Of respondents, 16.4% reported clinically significant depression, 13.8% reported clinically significant anxiety, and 13.3% reported insomnia. Among the nursing staff, 20.9% reported clinically significant depression, 15.9% reported clinically significant anxiety, and 17.0% reported insomnia. There was significantly higher depression (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.000), anxiety (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.002), and insomnia (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.007) among nursing staff compared with other hospital staff in 2-tailed t tests.

Study results show that more than 1 in 10 hospital staff suffer from mental health conditions, even during the beginning of the pandemic, and there is a need for active psychiatric support for the hospital staff during this pandemic. Depression, anxiety, and insomnia are significantly higher among nurses compared to other hospital staff. The results of this research suggest that comprehensive support measures should be implemented to protect and maintain mental health of hospital staff, especially nurses, while fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.","Uvais, Nalakath, Jose","https://doi.org/10.4088/PCC.20m02843","20210517","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13785,""

Increasing the knowledge, attitude, and practices towards COVID-19 prevention among hospital visitors are very important to prevent transmissions of the pandemic despite the lack of evidence remains a challenge in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the status of knowledge, attitude, and preventive practice towards COVID-19 and associated factors among hospital visitors in South Gondar Zone Hospitals, Northwest Ethiopia. A facility-based cross-sectional study design was employed during August 1 to 30, 2020 from randomly selected 404 adult hospital visitors in South Gondar Zone Hospitals, Northwest Ethiopia. The data was collected using interviewer-administered questionnaire. The outcome of this study was good or poor knowledge, positive or negative attitude and good or poor preventive practice towards COVID-19. Three different binary logistic regression models with 95% CI (Confidence interval) was used for data analysis. For each mode, bivariable analysis (crude odds ratio [COR]) and multivariable analysis (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]) was used during data analysis. From the bivariable analysis, variables with a p-value &lt;0.25 were retained into the multivariable logistic regression analysis. From the multivariable logistic regression analysis, variables with a significance level of p-value &lt;0.05 were taken as factors independently associated with knowledge, attitude and preventive practices towards COVID-19. About 69.3% of the respondents had good knowledge, 62.6% had a positive attitude, and 49.3% had good preventive practice towards the prevention of COVID-19. We found that factors significantly associated with good knowledge about COVID-19 were educational status who can read and write (AOR = 2.78; 95%CI: 1.18-6.56) and college and above (AOR = 6.15; 95%CI: 2.18-17.40), and use of social media (AOR = 2.96; 95%CI: 1.46-6.01). Furthermore, factors significantly associated with a positive attitude towards COVID-19 includes the presence of chronic illnesses (AOR = 5.00; 95%CI; 1.71-14.67), training on COVID-19 (AOR = 3.91; 95%CI: 1.96-7.70), and peer/family as a source of information (AOR = 2.45; 95%CI: 1.06-5.63). Being a student (AOR = 7.70; 95%CI: 1.15-15.86) and participants who had a good knowledge on COVID-19 (AOR = 4.49; 95%CI: 2.41-8.39) were factors significantly associated with good practice towards COVID-19. We found that knowledge, attitude, and preventive practices towards prevention of COVID-19 among adult hospital visitors were low. Therefore, we recommended that different intervention strategies for knowledge, attitude and preventive practices are urgently needed to control the transmission of COVID-19 among adult hospital visitors. Health education of those who could not read and write about COVID-19 knowledge issues and advocating use of social media that transmit messages about COVID-19 are highly encouraged to increase the good knowledge status of adult hospital visitors. Furthermore, providing training about COVID-19 prevention methods and using various sources of information about COVID-19 will help for improving positive attitude towards COVID-19 prevention, whereas for increasing the status of good preventive practices towards COVID-19, improving the good knowledge about COVID-19 of adult hospital visitors are essential.","Belete, Berihun, Keleb, Ademas, Berhanu, Abebe, Gizeyatu, Hassen, Teshome, Lingerew, Feleke, Natnael, Adane","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0250145","20210517","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13789,""
"Disrupted rhythms of life, work and entertainment and their associations with psychological impacts under the stress of the COVID-19 pandemic: A survey in 5854 Chinese people with different sociodemographic backgrounds","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected the life and work of people worldwide. The present study aimed to evaluate the rhythm disruptions of life, work, and entertainment, and their associations with the psychological impacts during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional study was conducted from the 10th to 17th March 2020 in China. A structured e-questionnaire containing general information, the Chinese version of Brief Social Rhythm Scale, and Zung's self-rating scales of depression and anxiety (SDS and SAS) was posted and collected online through a public media (i.e. EQxiu online questionnaire platform). Scores in sleeping, getting up, and socializing (SGS) rhythm and eating, physical practice, and entertainment (EPE) rhythm were compared among and between participants with different sociodemographic backgrounds including gender, age, education, current occupation, annual income, health status, and chronic disease status. Correlations of SDS and SAS with SGS-scale and EPE-scale were also analyzed. Overall, 5854 participants were included. There were significant differences in the scores of SGS-scale and EPE-scale among people with different sociodemographic backgrounds. The scores were significantly higher in the groups with female gender, low education level, lower or higher than average income, poor health status, ages of 26-30 years or older than 61 years, nurses and subjects with divorce or widow status. There were also significant differences in SAS and SDS scores among people with different sociodemographic backgrounds (all P&lt; 0.05). The overall prevalence of depression and anxiety was 24.3% and 12.6%, respectively, with nurses having the highest rates of depression (32.94%) and anxiety (18.98%) among the different occupational groups. SGS-scale was moderately correlated with SDS and SAS, and disruption of SGS rhythm was an independent risk factor for depression and anxiety. Social rhythm disruption was independently associated with depression and anxiety. Interventions should be applied to people vulnerable to the rhythm disruption during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Yang, He, Xu, Li, Wang, Wang, Wang, Wang, Zhao, Lin, Deng, Deng, Kuang, Chen","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0250770","20210517","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13790,""
"A multi-module web-based COVID-19 Anxiety and Stress Resilience Training (COAST): Single cohort feasibility study in first responders","Since the emergence of COVID-19, health care workers and first responders have been at high risk for mental health symptoms due to their exposure to the virus and higher work stress during the pandemic. Although interventions exist to address mental health issues following exposure to disasters, emergencies, and humanitarian crises, considerably less is known about web-based unguided interventions to help mitigate the negative impacts of such events. Additionally, in contexts in which emergencies reduce access to in-person care, remote forms of support are critical, yet there remains limited research on the use of such interventions. Evidence-based, easy to use and scalable interventions are direly needed for this population. To develop and feasibility-test an unguided e-mental health program tailored to first responders and health care personnel based on scientific evidence and empirically based techniques. We developed COVID-19- specific training modules focusing on several domains that previous research has indicated as key to resilience and stress recovery: self-efficacy, mindfulness, sleep, and positive thinking. The program was made available to 702 first responders between May and August 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sociodemographic, work- and COVID-19-related information were collected, and psychometric questionnaires completed. We examined user acceptance and user activity, including module choice and participant feedback. Seven percent of all first responders we reached out to, n= 52, used the program at least once. COAST use was independent of age, sex, or baseline levels of self-efficacy, mindful awareness, sleep quality and positive thinking, all P &gt;. 39. First-responders who had been tested positive and those who had been quarantined were more likely to engage in the program. A click-count analysis per module showed that participants used the self-efficacy and mindfulness modules most often, 382 and 122 clicks over 15 weeks, respectively. Overall, first responders expressed satisfaction with the program. Engagement of first responders in a multi-module web-based COVID-19 Anxiety and Stress Resilience Training program was feasible and the first responder cohort expressed overall satisfaction with the program. Those in more difficult circumstances, i.e., in quarantine and those tested positive, may be more likely to engage in such programs. Further controlled studies could pave the way for efficacy studies and development of additional modules, including just-in time interventions or blended interventions combining individual use of an unguided self-help intervention, such as COAST, with subsequent individual psychotherapy for those who continue to experience stress and psychological symptoms.","Heyen, Weigl, MÃƒÂ¼ller, MÃƒÂ¼ller, Eberle, Manoliu, Vetter, Brown, Berger, Kleim","https://doi.org/10.2196/28055","20210517","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13791,""
"Increases in Naloxone Administrations by Emergency Medical Services Providers During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Retrospective Time-Series Study","The opioid crisis in the United States may be exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Increases in opioid use, Emergency Medical Service (EMS) runs for opioid-related overdoses, and opioid-overdose deaths have been reported. No study has examined changes in multiple naloxone administrations, an indicator of overdose severity, during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study examined changes in the occurrence of naloxone administrations (NAs) and multiple naloxone administrations (MNAs) during EMS runs for opioid-related overdoses during the COVID-19 pandemic in Guilford County, North Carolina (NC). Using a period-over-period approach, we compared the occurrence of opioid-related EMS runs, NAs, and MNAs during the 29-week period before (September 1, 2019 to March 9, 2020) and after NC's COVID-19 state-of-emergency declaration (i.e., the 'COVID-19 period' of 3/10/2020 to 9/30/2020). Furthermore, historical data were used to generate a quasi-control distribution of period-over-period changes to compare the occurrence of each outcome during the COVID-19 period to each 29-week period back to January 1, 2014. All outcomes increased during the COVID-19 period. Compared to the previous 29 weeks, the COVID-19 period experienced increases in the weekly mean number of opioid-related EMS runs (25.6 versus 18.6, p&lt;.001), NAs (22.3 versus 14.1, p&lt;.001), and MNAs (5.0 versus 2.7, p&lt;.001) corresponding to proportional increases of 37.4%, 57.8%, and 84.8%, respectively. Additionally, the increases during the COVID-19 period were greater than 91% of all historical 29-week periods analyzed. The occurrence of EMS runs for opioid-related overdoses as well as NAs and MNAs during EMS runs increased during the COVID-19 pandemic in Guilford County, NC. For a host of reasons that need to be explored, the COVID-19 pandemic appears to exacerbate the opioid crisis.","Khoury, Preiss, Geiger, Anwar, Conway","https://doi.org/10.2196/29298","20210517","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13792,""
"The Role of Hope and Resilience in Protecting Against Suicidal thoughts and Behaviors During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the mental health and wellbeing of populations across the world. This study aimed to examine: (1) which specific aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with the presence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, and (2) the extent to which participants' hopelessness and resilience moderated the relationship between COVID-19 related stress and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. We administered an online survey to 12,989 adult (16+) participants across Wales from the 9th June to the 13th July 2020. Participants completed a series of questionnaires measuring the stressors they had experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, their levels of hopelessness over the past two weeks, their levels of resilience, and whether they had experienced suicidal thoughts or behaviors since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings revealed that: (1) food insecurity, domestic abuse, relationship problems, redundancy, social isolation and financial problems were the COVID-19 related stressors most strongly associated with suicidal thoughts and behaviors, and (2) that both hopelessness and resilience moderated the relationship between COVID-19 stress and suicidal thoughts, such that the relationship between COVID-19 stress and the presence of suicidal thoughts was much stronger for individuals with high hopelessness and low resilience. These results highlight the aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic that are closely related to suicidal thoughts and behaviors and demonstrate the important role that hope for the future and resilience play in protecting individuals against the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.HighlightsStressors caused by the pandemic are linked to increased suicidal thoughts.Hope protects individuals against the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.Resilience also protects people from the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Knowles, Gray, O'Connor, Pink, Simkiss, Snowden","https://doi.org/10.1080/13811118.2021.1923599","20210517","COVID-19; hopelessness; resilience; stress; suicide; survey; wales; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13793,""
"Effects of WeChat-based psychological interventions on the mental health of patients with suspected new coronavirus pneumonia: A pilot study","Suspected patients with new coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) may suffer from unique mental health problems. However, the shortage of medical personnel and the infectiousness of the disease have challenged traditional psychological interventions. This study investigated the effects of a new WeChat-based psychological intervention on the mental health of suspected NCP patients. This study included 48 participants (control groupÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 24 vs. intervention groupÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 24). The control group received conventional NCP nursing, and the intervention group received conventional NCP nursing and the WeChat psychological interventions. Participants completed the Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS), and Acute Stress Disorder Scale (ASDS) on the day of, and the 14th day after, admission. There were no significant differences between the two groups (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05) regarding demographic characteristics, education, work status, anxiety, depression, or acute stress disorder on the day of admission (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05).

"Healthcare Worker's Distress and Perceived Discrimination Related to COVID-19 in Colombia","The purpose of this study was to associate perceived discrimination related to COVID-19 and psychological distress in healthcare workers in the Colombian Caribbean. To do so, the authors designed and applied a cross-sectional study. They contacted a non-probabilistic sample by mail or instant messaging. The participants filled out a questionnaire that included scales for measuring perceived discrimination, anxiety, depression, perceived stress related to COVID-19, and suicide risk. One hundred and fifty healthcare workers between the ages of 18 and 68 participated in the research. Of these, 72% were women, 39.3% nursing assistants, 18.0% nurses, and 42.7% physicians. The perceived discrimination scores showed positive correlations with the scores on depressive symptoms among nursing assistants and physicians (r<sub>s</sub> =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.34) and suicide risk in nursing assistants (r<sub>s</sub> =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.35) and physicians (r<sub>s</sub> =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.31). Among nurses, all measurements were independent of perceived discrimination. Nursing assistants scored higher in perceived discrimination than nurses and physicians. Physicians scored higher for COVID-19 perceived stress than nursing assistants, and nurses showed similar scores to the physicians' scores. In conclusion, perceived discrimination is related to depressive symptoms and suicide risk among nursing assistants and physicians. Nursing assistants report more perceived discrimination than nurses and physicians.","Campo-Arias, JimÃƒÂ©nez-Villamizar, Caballero-DomÃƒÂ­nguez","https://doi.org/10.1111/nhs.12854","20210517","SARS Virus; Social discrimination; health personnel; psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13795,""
"Validation of the Mental Health Checklist (MHCL) during COVID-19 lockdown","The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in unprecedented disruption to everyday life, including widespread social distancing and self-quarantining aimed at reducing the virus spread. The Mental Health Checklist (MHCL) is a measure developed to assess psychological health during extended periods of isolation and confinement, and has shown strong psychometric properties in community samples and during Antarctic missions. This study validated the MHCL in a sample of 359 U.S. and U.K adults during the peak of the COVID-19 lockdown. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) tested model fit, and convergent validity analyses were conducted to compare the MHCL with validated measures of depression, anxiety and stress, as well as insomnia. The MHCL exhibited good model fit for most CFA indices, and showed strong convergent validity with other measures of psychological well-being. Findings suggest that the MHCL is useful for assessing mental health in a variety of environments and conditions.","So, Kim, Cifre, Gonzalez, Bower, Alfano","https://doi.org/10.1002/jcop.22600","20210517","COVID-19; MHCL; factor structure; mental health; questionnaire validation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13796,""
"A survey of Canadian emergency physicians' experiences and perspectives during the COVID-19 pandemic","The objective of this study was to explore Canadian emergency physicians' experiences, concerns, and perspectives during the first wave of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. This cross-sectional survey of physician members of Pediatric Emergency Research Canada and the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians explored: personal safety/responsibility to care; patient interactions; ethical issues in pandemic care; institutional dynamics and communication practices. Data analysis was descriptive: categorical data were summarised with frequency distributions, continuous data [100Ã‚Â mm visual analog scales (VAS)] were analysed using measures of central tendency. Short open-ended items were coded to identify frequencies of responses. From June 29 to July 29, 2020, 187 respondents (13% response rate) completed the survey: 39% were from Ontario and 20% from Quebec, trained in general (50%) or pediatric (37%) emergency medicine. Respondents reported a high moral obligation to care for patients (97/100, IQR: 85-100, on 100Ã‚Â mm VAS). Fear of contracting COVID-19 changed how 82% of respondents reported interacting with patients, while 97% reported PPE negatively impacted patient care. Despite reporting a high proportion of negative emotions (84%), respondents (59%) were not/slightly concerned about their mental health. Top concerns included a potential second wave, Canada's financial situation, worldwide solidarity, and youth mental health. Facilitators to provide emergency care included: teamwork, leadership, clear communications strategies. Canadian emergency physicians felt a strong sense of responsibility to care, while dealing with several ethical dilemmas. Clear communication strategies, measures to ensure safety, and appropriate emergency department setups facilitate pandemic care. Emergency physicians were not concerned about their own mental health, requiring further exploration.

"A review on the COVID-19-related psychological impact on older adults: vulnerable or not?","COVID-19 is a novel event of the twenty-first century. Therefore, contemporary research is required to determine the current pandemic's psychological impact on older populations. Soon after the COVID-19 outbreak, several narrative reviews and guidelines were released to support older adult's psychological wellbeing. However, a lack of data from original studies was reported until May 2020. To identify studies published from May 2020 until January 2021 that quantitatively assessed the mental health impact of COVID-19 on older adults using validated psychometric tools. A comprehensive literature search of original research articles was conducted using specific terms. The screening procedure was conducted stepwise. Among the 18 included studies, cross-sectional online surveys indicated that older adults were less psychologically distressed than younger ones. A longitudinal study revealed that COVID-19 did not have a major impact on loneliness and satisfaction with life. On the contrary, studies comparing pre- with peri-pandemic data revealed that older adults experienced more severe depressive/anxiety/stress symptoms and loneliness during the pandemic. Several studies reported though only subclinical symptoms, as well as low loneliness levels during the pandemic. Research studies suggested that older age may buffer against the COVID-19-related impact on mental health. Despite evidence against generalised perceptions of vulnerability, older adults' ability to adapt to adversity may be uneven, depending on cultural, social, economic and other individual factors. Taken together, the impact, moreover the long-term impact of COVID-19, is expected to vary across countries and older subpopulations, and remains to be evaluated by prospective, longitudinal studies.","Parlapani, Holeva, Nikopoulou, Kaprinis, Nouskas, Diakogiannis","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40520-021-01873-4","20210517","Anxiety symptoms; COVID-19; Depressive symptoms; Loneliness; Older adults; Post-traumatic stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13798,""

Participants reported concerns about their loved one's physical and mental health, the limited access to other caregiving sources, and the limited opportunities to maintain personal well-being. Caregiving tasks completed more than usual included providing emotional support, shopping for groceries and essentials, and contacting healthcare providers.

"COVID-related work changes, burnout, and turnover intentions in mental health providers: A moderated mediation analysis","<b> <i>Objective:</i> </b> The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has drastically impacted the provision of mental health services. Changes required of providers were substantial and could lead to increased burnout and, subsequently, increased turnover intentions. This study examined burnout experienced by mental health services providers in the context of COVID-19 and through the lens of the job demands-resources (JD-R) model. We examined the effects of work changes on burnout and subsequent turnover intentions, and how job and personal resources may have buffered the extent to which work changes due to COVID-19 impacted burnout. <b> <i>Methods:</i> </b> Service providers (<i>n</i> = 93) from six community mental health centers (CMHCs) in one Midwestern state in the United States completed surveys as part of service contracts to implement evidence-based practices. Path analysis tested the unconditional indirect relations between work changes and turnover intentions through burnout. Moderated mediation determined whether the indirect effect of work changes on turnover intentions via burnout varied in strength by job and personal resources. <b> <i>Results:</i> </b> Work changes had a significant indirect effect on turnover intentions through burnout ( ÃŽÂ² ^ = .140, 95% CI = .072, .217). This indirect effect varied as a function of two job resources, organizational trust and perceived organizational support. <b> <i>Conclusions and Implications for Practice:</i> </b> Burnout was relatively low only when work changes were low and job resources levels high. When work changes were high, burnout was similarly high across levels of job resources. To minimize burnout, organizations should limit task, setting, and team-related work changes to the extent possible.

"What's going on following acute covid-19? Clinical characteristics of patients in an out-patient rehabilitation program","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients present long-lasting physical and neuropsychological impairment, which may require rehabilitation. The current cross-sectional study characterizes post COVID-19 sequelae and persistent symptoms in patients in an outpatient rehabilitation program. Thirty patients [16 post-ICU and 14 non-ICU; median ageÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 54(43.8-62) years; 19 men] presenting sequelae and/or persistent symptoms (&gt;3 months after acute COVID-19) were selected of 41 patients referred for neurorehabilitation. Patients underwent physical, neuropsychological and respiratory evaluation and assessment of impact of fatigue and quality of life. The main reasons for referral to rehabilitation were: fatigue (86.6%), dyspnea (66.7%), subjective cognitive impairment (46.7%) and neurological sequelae (33.3%). Post-ICU patient presented sequelae of critical illness myopathy and polyneuropathy, stroke and encephalopathy and lower forced vital capacity compared to non-ICU patients. Cognitive impairment was found in 63.3% of patients, with a similar profile in both sub-groups. Increased physical fatigue, anxiety and depression and low quality of life were prevalent irrespective of acute COVID-19 severity. The variability of post COVID-19 physical and neuropsychological impairment requires a complex screening process both in ICU and non-ICU patients. The high impact of persistent symptoms on daily life activities and quality of life, regardless of acute infection severity, indicate need for rehabilitation.","Albu, Zozaya, Murillo, Garcia-Molina, ChacÃƒÂ³n, Kumru","https://doi.org/10.3233/NRE-210025","20210517","COVID-19; cognitive impairment; neurological impairment; persistent symptoms; sequelae","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13802,""
"Policing pain: A qualitative study of non-criminal justice approaches to managing opioid overdose during the COVID-19 pandemic","Opioid related drug overdose deaths are a leading cause of death and injury in the United States. While research demonstrates that where people live has a major impact on drug use and abuse, most work looks at social dynamics at the county level or under the rubric of the urban/rural divide. Only recently, scholarship has become attuned to the post-industrialized areas located on the fringes of urban cores. Data presented in here are from field research conducted in McKeesport, Pennsylvania, a small river town located east of Pittsburgh. Once a thriving industrial city, it is now deteriorated and has documented high levels of overdose experience. Preliminary results suggest that McKeesport residents, even before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), practice social and physical distancing as a way of life; data indicate how the pandemic potentially exacerbates the risk of accidental opioid overdose among a population defined by both geographic and social isolation.","Trappen, McLean","https://doi.org/10.1080/10852352.2021.1908206","20210518","COVID-19; deindustrialization; harm-reduction; opioids; overdose; policing; social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13803,""
"Likely Exacerbation of Psychological Disorders from Covid-19 Response","Anxiety and fear felt by people around the world regarding the coronavirus pandemic is real and can be overwhelming, resulting in strong emotional reactions in adults and children. With depressive and anxiety disorders already highly prevalent in the general population (300Ã¢â‚¬â€°million worldwide), depression and/or anxiety specifically because of the pandemic response is likely. Moreover, the current state of panic in the face of uncertainty is apt to produce significant amounts of stress.

"Predictors of worker mental health in intellectual disability services during COVID-19","Workers supporting adults with intellectual disabilities experience significant stress in their essential role during COVID-19. The purpose of this study was to describe the experience of these workers and determine predictors of emotional distress. Eight hundred and thirty-eight workers supporting adults with intellectual disabilities completed an online survey about their work during COVID-19 and their mental health in July 2020. One in four workers reported moderate to severe emotional distress. Being older and more experienced, having counselling services available through one's agency, and engaging in regular exercise or hobbies outside work were associated with less distress. Workers who reported increased stress in the workplace, stigma towards their families because of their job, personal fears about spreading COVID-19, and receipt of medications for mental health conditions or therapy reported greater distress. More attention is needed to address the mental health of workers supporting adults with intellectual disabilities as they continue their essential work during the pandemic.","Lunsky, Bobbette, Chacra, Wang, Zhao, Thomson, Hamdani","https://doi.org/10.1111/jar.12892","20210517","COVID-19; intellectual disability; mental health; workers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13806,""
"Gambling by Young Adults in the UK During COVID-19 Lockdown","Gambling is a common activity amongst young adults in the UK, and was a behavior of interest during the early mitigation against COVID-19 (first lockdown). The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) was used to investigate attitudes, moods and behavior during lockdown in England. ALSPAC participants were invited to complete online questionnaires in May 2020, including a set of questions about frequency of gambling and gambling activities which had been asked three years previously. Mental health and wellbeing data and alcohol use were also collected as part of lockdown questionnaires. Gambling questions were completed by 2632 young adults, 71% female, with a mean age of 27.8 years. Overall, gambling frequency reduced during lockdown for both males and females, but more males engaged in regular (weekly) gambling. Gambling activities became more restricted compared to previous reports, but online gambling (e.g. online poker, bingo, casino games) was more frequent. Previous gambling behaviour predicted gambling frequency during lockdown. No associations were apparent between gambling frequency and measures of mental health and well-being. Heavy alcohol use was strongly linked with regular gambling during lockdown. Gamblers were more than twice as likely as non-gamblers to have experienced financial difficulties pre-COVID, but gambling frequency was not related to employment status during lockdown. Online gambling increased during lockdown, whilst offline gambling activities decreased in frequency. A small minority of regular weekly gamblers, who tended to be male and heavy users of alcohol, participated in a wide range of online and offline gambling activities.","Emond, Nairn, Collard, HollÃƒÂ©n","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10899-021-10029-y","20210517","ALSPAC; COVID-19; Gambling; Lockdown","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13807,""
"Predictors of self-reported adherence to COVID-19 guidelines A longitudinal observational study of 51,600 UK adults","In the absence of a vaccine, governments have focused on social distancing, self-isolation, and increased hygiene procedures to reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). Compliance with these measures requires voluntary cooperation from citizens. Yet, compliance is not complete. Existing research on the predictors of compliance is almost exclusively based on cross-sectional data, raising the possibility of reverse causality and confounding. Using data from the UCL COVID-19 Social Study, a large weekly online panel of UK adults from first three months of lockdown in the UK (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 51,600), we tested whether within-person changes in confidence in government, mental wellbeing, social experiences and awareness of COVID-19 were longitudinally related to self-reported compliance levels with guidelines from authorities using random intercept cross-lagged panel models. We found evidence of a small longitudinal association between increased confidence in government to tackle the pandemic and higher self-reported compliance, but little evidence that factors such as mental health and wellbeing, worries about future adversities, and social isolation and loneliness were related to later compliance. We found higher self-reported compliance was longitudinally related to higher depressive symptoms. We found that low compliance was related to lower leisure engagement, providing care, and working outside the home. Our results suggest that to effectively manage the pandemic, governments should ensure that confidence is maintained. Nuffield Foundation, Wellcome Trust and the MARCH Mental Health Network.

"Occupational Stress Assessment of Health Care workers (HCWs) Facing COVID-19 Patients in Kerman Province Hospitals in Iran","The health care workers (HCWs) at the frontline of fighting COVID-19 are at higher risk for mental health problems, including stress, anxiety, depression, and insomnia. This study aimed at assess the status of occupational stress in the three occupational groups of nurses, physicians and hospital cleaning crew facing COVID-19 patients in hospitals of Kerman province in Iran. : This cross-sectional descriptive analytical study was performed on 290 medical staffs including nurses, physicians and cleaning crew facing COVID-19 patients working in different hospitals in Iran in 2020. Demographic information form and occupational Stress Questionnaire (HSE tool indicator) were used to collect data. The health and safety executive (HSE) questionnaire has 35 questions and 7 areas, which was developed in the 1990s by the UK Health and Safety Institute to measure occupational stress. The mean score of total dimensions among HCWs was 2.93. Communications, Manager support, Changes and Demand factors with scores of 2.76, 2.77, 2.83 and 2.87 had the greatest impact on participants' stress levels, respectively. Also, Colleague support factor with a score of 3.38 had the least effect on stress levels. Also, according to the results, 87% of nurses, 79% of cleaning crew and 67% of physicians had a partial to high levels of stress that, on average, 77.5% of the HCWs participating in this study had at least a small amount of stress. The mean stress score among the participants of the present study was between high stress level and moderate stress level. Factors such as communications, manager support, change and demand had the greatest impact on employee stress levels. Therefore, by improving the communication between people working in hospitals, increasing managers' support for staff, and reducing workplace demands such as reducing workload and improving workplace environment, the stress level of staff in hospitals during the outbreak of COVID-19 can be reduced.","Zare, Mohammadi Dameneh, Esmaeili, Kazemi, Naseri, Panahi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e07035","20210518","COVID-19; HSE questionnaire; Health Personnel; Health care workers (HCWs); occupational stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13809,""
"Associations of the COVID-19 pandemic with the economic status and mental health of people affected by the Fukushima disaster using the difference-in-differences method: The Fukushima Health Management Survey","Although the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and relevant preventive measures can affect the economic status and mental health of the public, their effect remains unraveled owing to a limited number of surveys conducted before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We investigated the association of COVID-19 and relevant measures with multivariate outcomes among people affected by the Fukushima disaster in 2011 using the difference-in-differences (DID) method. We then analyzed the associations between sociodemographic factors and outcomes. We assessed psychological distress, problem drinking, insomnia state, unemployment, household economic decline, and interpersonal problems using three questionnaire surveys administered in 2018, 2019, and 2020. Participants were grouped according to three time periods by dates of voluntary stay-at-home requests (February 26) and the declaration of emergency (April 16) in Japan. The years 2020 and 2019 were regarded as the treatment group and control group, respectively, after confirming that no DIDs were found between 2018 and 2019. We performed regression analyses to identify the risk factors for outcomes. The DIDs were significant for household economic decline after the declaration of emergency, whereas problem drinking significantly improved. No significant DIDs were observed for other mental health outcomes including psychological distress and insomnia state. Absence of counselors was positively and significantly associated with all outcomes in 2020. Overall, people affected by the Fukushima disaster experienced more economic damage after the declaration of emergency during the COVID-19 pandemic but their mental health status did not reduce. Identifying people who have no counselors and providing them with support are emergent requirements to prevent a subsequent mental health decline.","Murakami, Kobayashi, Oikawa, Goto, Momoi, Takebayashi, Ohira, Yasumura, Maeda","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2021.100801","20210518","Alcohol-related disorders; COVID-19; Difference-in-differences method; Fukushima nuclear accident; Psychological distress; Sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13810,""
"Perceptions and Experiences of Frontline Urban Indian Organization Healthcare Workers With Infection Prevention and Control During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has created significant challenges for outpatient healthcare providers and patients across the United States (U.S.). Forty-one Urban Indian Organizations (UIOs), who provide a wide spectrum of health services for American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations and other underinsured and uninsured populations in urban areas across the country, are no exception. The National Council of Urban Indian Health (NCUIH), in collaboration with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), set out to understand the needs, challenges, and opportunities for improvement in infection prevention and control (IPC) training and systems from the perspective of UIO frontline healthcare workers. As part of the CDC's <i>Project Firstline</i>, NCUIH was chosen as a partner in a national collaborative. The first task was to conduct listening sessions with frontline UIO staff to learn more about IPC practices in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thirty staff from 16 UIOs, representing full ambulatory, limited ambulatory, outreach and referral, and outpatient and residential treatment programs participated in virtual video focus groups in July of 2020. Thematic and content analysis protocols guided data analysis and coding. Analysis of findings generated four major themes: staff adaptation in the context of resilience; responsibility and duty to protect patients, families, and coworkers; mental and emotional issues for UIO staff; and IPC challenges in the context of COVID-19. Participants' challenges ranged from lack of access to personal protective equipment (PPE) to the absence of standardized training. Significant disparities in social determinants of health experienced by Native American and non-Native populations served by UIOs create additional challenges to the delivery of and access to care during the pandemic. The diverse array of tribal cultural values and contexts of the people and communities served by UIOs reportedly serve as both facilitators and barriers to care, awareness, and uptake of infectious disease public health practices.","Collins, Crowder, Ishcomer-Aazami, Apedjihoun","https://doi.org/10.3389/fsoc.2021.611961","20210518","American Indian and Alaska Native; COVID-19; epidemic; healthcare worker; mental health; minority health; public health; urban Indian health organization","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13811,""

In absence of protective buffers, prolonged exposure to excessive, early adversity can lead to poor health outcomes with significant impact lasting beyond the childhood years. Helping Us Grow Stronger (HUGS/Abrazos) is a community-based program, designed and launched at the time of the COVID-19 surge in the Spring of 2020, that combines emergency relief, patient navigation, and direct behavioral health support to foster family resilience and mitigate the negative impacts of COVID-related toxic stress on pregnant women and families with children under age 6. Through a targeted referral process, community health workers provide resource navigation for social needs, and a social worker provides behavioral health support. The use of innovative tools such as a centralized resource repository, community health workers with specialized knowledge in this age range, and a direct referral system seeks to assist in streamlining communication and ensuring delivery of quality care. We aim to serve over 300 families within the 1st year.

"Mental Health Outcomes Among Civil Servants Aiding in Coronavirus Disease 2019 Control","<b>Objective:</b> To assess the psychiatric status of Chinese civil servants aiding in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) control. <b>Background:</b> During the COVID-19 pandemic, Chinese civil servants have faced high workloads that may contribute to mental disorders. We assessed the prevalence of both depression and anxiety symptoms among civil servants in Jiangsu and surrounding provinces using the Chinese versions of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale. <b>Methods:</b> The PHQ-9 and GAD-7 were used to assess the severity of symptoms of depression and anxiety, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mental health outcomes. <b>Results:</b> In total, 867 Chinese civil servants aiding in COVID-19 control were included in our study. Overall, 37.25 and 38.06% of all respondents reported having symptoms of depression and anxiety, respectively. Respondents who were younger and more educated and those who had fewer years of work experience had higher scores for both depression and anxiety. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that being a woman, being younger, having more education and having fewer years of work experience were associated with a higher risk of symptoms of depression and anxiety. However, whether they had experience combating infectious diseases or worked in frontline, there was no significant difference between respondents with and without experience, as well as between frontline and non-frontline workers, in both symptoms of depression and anxiety. <b>Conclusions:</b> The civil servants aiding in COVID-19 control reported suffering from varying degrees of mental disorders.

"Was a forced lockdown adequate for a country in conflict? A psychological perspective from the Syrian population","Syria has suffered for nine years from a conflict that left over 11.1 million inhabitants in need of humanitarian assistance and over 80% in poverty. A ten-week-long full lockdown was enforced in Syria and successfully minimized the spread of COVID-19. This study aims to estimate the occurrence of mental health disorders after lockdown termination among the citizens of war-torn Syria. Online questionnaires, which included demographic and war-related questions, Dimensions of Anger Reactions 5 (DAR-5) and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) were distributed to different social media groups. This study recruited 1445 participants, of which 515 (35.6%) were males, the mean age was 24.8Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 6.3 years, 38% had problematic anger, 64% had moderate to very severe depression, 42.9% had moderate to severe anxiety and 39.7% had moderate to severe stress. Increased living expenses, not being able to go out and a reduced ability to earn income and provide food were significantly associated with the psychological burden after the lockdown (<i>p</i>Ã‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.05). The association of war variables with mental disorders was weaker than the effect of the deteriorating economy. Other healthcare workers had more severe distress than doctors, who themselves were found to have less distress than the general population (<i>p</i>Ã‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.05). Anger scores were approximately equal, regardless of the type of work. Finally, shisha smoking was associated with worse mental health (<i>p</i>Ã‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.05). The psychological burden of the damaged economy surpassed the direct damage due to COVID-19 and the effect of years of conflict. Urgent interventions are required, as this burden may continue for years, if not for decades. A full lockdown in countries with fragile economies may delay the spread of the virus, but it will severely damage the economy, which will lead to a deterioration of the mental health of their citizens.","Kakaje, Mansour, Ghareeb","https://doi.org/10.5339/qmj.2021.17","20210518","COVID-19; Syria; anger; anxiety; conflict.; depression; developing country; healthcare workers; lockdown; mental health; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13815,""

In the period March 20-30, 2020, we collected data on COVID-19-related knowledge, awareness and adoption of preventive practices, depression and anxiety (Patient Health Questionnaire-4), stress (Impact of Event Scale-6), pessimism, and tobacco and alcohol use. Differences between age groups (18-39Ã‚Â years, 40-59Ã‚Â years andÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°60Ã‚Â years) were tested using Pearson's chi-squared tests or ANOVAs; associations between drinking and smoking and depression, anxiety, and stress were tested using adjusted logistic regression models. Approximately half of the sample (<i>N</i><sub>Total</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°6391) were 50-69Ã‚Â years old and 58% were female. COVID-19 knowledge (meanÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°12.0; SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.2) and protective practice awareness (meanÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°9.1; SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.8) were high. Among respondents, 44% had a score consistent with depression and anxiety (PHQ-4 scoreÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°6), and 52% reported high stress scores (Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã‚Â median of 1.33). COVID-19-related anxiety and depression were associated with increased drinking (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.79; 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.49, 2.15) and smoking (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.17; 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.64, 2.88). High stress scores were also associated with increased drinking (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.80; 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.49, 2.17, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and smoking (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.75; 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.31, 2.33). In spite of high knowledge levels, important gaps were identified. High prevalence of poor mental health outcomes and associated increases in drinking and smoking warrant ongoing risk communications tailoring to effectively disseminate information and expanding psychosocial services, particularly via telehealth, to mitigate the negative mental health impact of COVID-19.

"Mitigating the Impacts of COVID-19 on Global Child Health: a Call to Action","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), continues to affect individuals, communities, and health systems worldwide. Here, we highlight how COVID-19 threatens to jeopardize the tremendous gains made over the last few decades on improving children's health globally. In contrast to adults, children with COVID-19 are less likely to develop severe disease requiring hospitalization or die as a direct result of infection. However, the pandemic will likely have other important health impacts disproportionately affecting vulnerable children globally. Possible effects include worsening of poverty and food insecurity; disruption of already strained routine child health services; damage to already imperiled healthcare workforces; a wave of mental health challenges; interruption of education; and increased risks of violence, abuse, exploitation, and neglect. These challenges notwithstanding, the response to COVID-19 may also provide opportunities, such as for health system strengthening, that could improve child health after the pandemic. The negative impacts of COVID-19 on global child health may be substantial. However, these are not foregone conclusions and much can be done to mitigate the worst outcomes. Child health providers should advocate for an equitable response to COVID-19 that prioritizes the health of vulnerable children and furthers the gains made in global child health.","Garcia-Prats, McAdams, Matshaba, Thahane, Butteris, Conway, Slutsker, St Clair, Haq","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40475-021-00241-6","20210518","Food insecurity; Healthcare workforce; Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs); Malnutrition; Mental health; Routine childhood immunization","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13819,""

This study aimed to assess the health-related quality of life (QoL), and identify its psychological and clinical correlates in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) during pandemic in Egypt. A cross-sectional study, using a convenience sampling technique, was conducted among patients with DM who were recruited from Zagazig University endocrinology outpatient clinics, Sharkia Province, Egypt from June 30 to September 29, 2020. A total of 200 consecutive patients were interviewed using a semistructured demographic and clinical checklist, the fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the short form 36 (SF-36) health survey. Poor physical and mental QoL was reported in 64% and 62% of patients with DM, respectively. Female gender, increased mean arterial pressure (MAP), associated physical comorbidities, and depressive symptoms were associated with lesser odds of physical QoL (OR 0.46, 0.96, 0.29, and 0.88, respectively). Besides, female gender, associated physical comorbidities, fear of COVID-19 virus infection (FCV), and depressive symptoms were associated with lesser odds of mental QoL (OR 0.41, 0.36, 0.91, and 0.84, respectively). The FCV was inversely correlated with all items of SF-36 among patients. QoL, either physical or mental, was adversely affected among patients with DM during pandemic. FCV was negatively correlated with all QOL domains.

"Magnitude and determinants of the psychological impact of COVID-19 among health care workers: A systematic review","The mental health of the health care professionals is more likely to be affected by the coronavirus disease-19 compared to the general population. Accordingly, the current study aimed to summarize the magnitudes and determinants of the psychological impact of coronavirus among health care professionals. The studies from Medline via PubMed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar were searched from 5 September to 19 October 2020. The review was conducted as per PRISMA-2009 (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses). Initially, 6316 articles were searched from three databases (PubMed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar). Finally, 20 articles were filtered to be included in our review. Among different types of psychological impact, stress was reported that lies within the range from 5.2% to 100%, anxiety was reported from 11.1% to 100%, depression was from 10.6% to 58%, and insomnia was from 28.75% to 34%. Several factors were related to the negative psychological state of health care workers due to coronavirus disease-19 like educational level, occupation, gender, age, working environment, work experience, legal status, ethnicity, psychological comorbidity, social support, personal/family exposure, and feeling of health care providers. The most common psychological impacts among health care workers were anxiety and stress. Besides different sociodemographic factors that determine the psychological impacts, front-line health care workers and participants having psychological comorbidity have a high risk of negative psychological state impacts as compared to their counterparts. Therefore, special attention should tend to health care workers directly involved in the prevention and management of coronavirus disease-19 and having a different risk of mental health condition.","Bekele, Hajure","https://doi.org/10.1177/20503121211012512","20210518","COVID-19; determinants; health care workers; magnitude; psychological impacts","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13821,""

However, as this task has not been prioritized in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, a new lethal enemy has emerged that now poses another crisis, namely, the &quot;infodemic&quot;, with consequences that have affected the entire population worldwide. In particular, it has increased the vulnerability of a group that is not often discussed: children, who constitute our study population.This article provides an analysis aimed at demystifying false constructs about the low impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the child population. It gives a chronological description of the different events that were the building blocks of the infodemic, affecting this population in three phases: first, at the onset of the pandemic, when its effects on children were ignored altogether; second, when children were stigmatized as &quot;super-spreaders&quot;; and third, when the crisis resulting from a failure to transmit information to this population group became evident.The world is facing both the pandemic and a pressing need for communicative justice, which includes children as a primary target group. Taking a social determinants approach, this article proposes a new normal that includes using accurate and clear information to empower children to combat the infodemic virus from an early age.

"Navigating the Same Storm but Not in the Same Boat: Mental Health Vulnerability and Coping in Women University Students During the First COVID-19 Lockdown in the UK","Having a mental health diagnosis in both general and student populations has been found to be a risk factor for negative coping and increased psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Drawing on a subset of data from a large contemporaneous research study, this report explores the experiences of 36 women students with and without reported pre-existing mental health diagnoses during the first UK lockdown, in spring 2020. Specifically, the data explored self-reported coping with the restrictions, with the abrupt move to online learning, and the loss of support; as well as students' perceived strengths and difficulties in balancing their student role with family roles such as being a partner and/or a parent. Students with a pre-existing mental health diagnosis reported higher levels of loneliness compared to a matched sample of non-students, and more avoidant coping and negative emotional coping than students without a diagnosis. Qualitative data illustrate how parenting intersects with well-being and stress as both a protective and risk factor for women university students. This research report adds to the evidence base on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the student population, and how pre-existing mental health diagnoses intersect with coping behaviours and vulnerability in women students. Exploration of potential vulnerabilities can provide opportunities for targeted support, and identifying effective coping has the potential to inform effective interventions.","Misca, Thornton","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.648533","20210518","COVID-19; coping; mental health; vulnerability; women students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13824,""
"Psychological Impact of COVID-19 on College Students After School Reopening: A Cross-Sectional Study Based on Machine Learning","COVID-19, the most severe public health problem to occur in the past 10 years, has greatly impacted people's mental health. Colleges in China have reopened, and how to prevent college students from suffering secondary damage due to school reopening remains elusive. This cross-sectional study was aimed to evaluate the psychological impact of COVID-19 after school reopening and explore via machine learning the factors that influence anxiety and depression among students. Among the 478 valid online questionnaires collected between September 14th and September 20th, 74 (15.5%) showed symptoms of anxiety (by the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale), and 155 (32.4%) showed symptoms of depression (by Patient Health Questionnaire-9). Descriptive analysis of basic personal characteristics indicated that students at a higher grade, having relatives or friends who have been infected, fearing being infected, and having a pessimistic attitude to COVID-19 easily experience anxiety or depression. The Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was utilized to counteract the imbalance of retrieved data. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and multivariate logistic regression were performed to explore significant influence factors. The results indicate that exercise frequency, alcohol use, school reopening, having relatives or friends who have been infected, self-quarantine, quarantine of classmates, taking temperature routinely, wearing masks routinely, sleep quality, retaining holiday, availability of package delivery, take-out availability, lockdown restriction, several areas in school closed due to COVID-19, living conditions in the school, taking the final examinations after school reopening, and the degree to which family economic status is influenced by COVID-19 are the primary influence factors for anxiety or depression. To evaluate the effect of our model, we used 5-fold cross-validation, and the average area under the curve (AUC) values of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of anxiety and depression on the test set reached 0.885 and 0.806, respectively. To conclude, we examined the presence of anxiety and depression symptoms among Chinese college students after school reopening and explored many factors influencing students' mental health, providing reasonable school management suggestions.","Ren, Xin, Ge, Zhao, Liu, Ho, Ho","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.641806","20210518","COVID-19; anxiety; college student; depression; machine learning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13825,""
"The Relationship Between Quarantine Length and Negative Affect During the COVID-19 Epidemic Among the General Population in China: The Roles of Negative Cognition and Protective Factors","Quarantine and isolation at extended length, although considered as highly effective countermeasures for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) which started at the end of 2019, can have great impact on individual's mental health, especially emotional state. The present research recruited 5,115 participants from the general public across 32 provinces and autonomous regions in China in an online survey study, about 20 days after the lockdown of the epicenter (Wuhan), to investigate the relationship between the length of the quarantine and negative affect (including depression and anxiety), as well as the mediating roles of negative cognition (including worry and anticipation), and the moderating roles of dispositional optimism, tolerance of uncertainty, social support, and healthy behavior. The results showed that: (1) Worry and anticipation mediated the relationship between quarantine length and depression and anxiety; (2) Dispositional optimism moderated the path coefficients of quarantine length to worry, worry to anxiety, and anticipation to depression; (3) Tolerance of uncertainty moderated the path coefficient of worry to anxiety; (4) Social support moderated the path coefficient of anticipation to anxiety. In conclusion, during quarantine, dispositional optimism, uncertainty tolerance, and social support can buffer the direct or indirect effects of quarantine length on depression and anxiety. These findings could have profound implications on the societal responses to COVID-19 and future pandemics.","Hou, Long, Meng, Cheng, Zhang, Zhou","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.575684","20210518","COVID-19; anticipation; anxiety; depression; protective factor; quarantine; worry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13826,""
"Psychological Predictors of Precautionary Behaviors in Response to COVID-19: A Structural Model","The first lines of defense during an epidemic are behavioral interventions, including stay-at-home measures or precautionary health training, aimed at reducing contact and disease transmission. Examining the psychosocial variables that may lead to greater adoption of such precautionary behaviors is critical. The present study examines predictors of precautionary practices against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in 709 Mexican participants from 24 states. The study was conducted via online questionnaire between the end of March and the beginning of April 2020, when the pandemic response was in its initial stages in Mexico. The instrument included demographic items, as well as scales assessing COVID-19-resembling symptoms, empathy, impulsivity, anhedonic depression, general health practices, alcohol consumption, and COVID-19-associated precautionary behaviors. Most participants reported adopting limited social distancing or other precautionary behaviors against COVID-19. The results of a structural equation model demonstrated that the presence of COVID-19 symptoms was related to impulsivity and general health behaviors. However, no direct association between precautionary behaviors and the presence of COVID-19 symptoms was found. In turn, precautionary behaviors were more prevalent among participants who reported higher empathy and general health behaviors and were inhibited indirectly by impulsivity via alcohol consumption. Furthermore, the model suggests that anhedonic depression symptoms have a negative indirect effect on precautionary behaviors via general health behaviors. Finally, impulsivity showed a negative direct effect on general health behavior. These results highlight the role that general physical health and mental health play on precautionary behavior and the critical importance of addressing issues such as depression, general health behaviors, and impulsivity in promoting safe actions and the protection of self and others.","FrÃƒÂ­as-Armenta, Corral-FrÃƒÂ­as, Corral-Verdugo, Lucas","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.559289","20210518","COVID-19; anhedonia; empathy; health practices; impulsivity; precautionary behaviors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13827,""

The sample consisted of 979 students from eight different schools. The method of data collection was online surveys administered to parents and adolescents. The dependent variables were mental health problems and wellbeing. Several independent variables were assessed (sociodemographic variables, Covid-19 related experiences, related educational experiences, and family functioning). A descriptive analysis and univariable and multivariable regression models were performed to study the association between variables. <b>Results:</b> Positive educational experiences, primarily academic self-concept, reduced the probability of mental health problems and increased wellbeing. Among covid-19 related variables, practicing meditation or praying reduced emotional problems, while having family or health problems increased emotional problems among adolescents.

"Cyberchondria Amidst COVID-19 Pandemic: Challenges and Management Strategies","The corona-virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), first found in Wuhan, China in December 2019, has posed an inexplicable threat to the global community. After its inception, the virus proliferated rapidly, which led to the cause of millions of deaths, and having a detrimental effect on physical health, social lives, economic uncertainty, and mental health of people. The World Health Organization has reported that there are 111 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 2.45 million deaths due to COVID-19 worldwide. Indisputably, the present pandemic has contributed to the extensive psychological and environmental distress together with clinical depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), domestic violence, and unemployment. Due to the ambiguous nature of the pandemic, educational organizations, and outdoor activities are closed, thus burdening the mental health of younger populations. Children as well as youths are more glued to the Internet for their studies, online gaming, shopping, watching movies, and searching health-related information. Despite the advantages of using the Internet, it has some severe consequences too. Some people are repeatedly searching for physical and mental well-being related information without verifying credible sources, which, in turn, causes distress and anxiety. In such situations, individuals may end up contributing to an illness known as cyberchondria. In this paper, we have tried to highlight the problematic use of Internet for health-related searches and have outlined the management of such illness. We suggest two strategies: firstly, to reduce repeated online searches of health information and, secondly, to manage anxiety-augmenting thoughts that are triggered due to the maladaptive thoughts caused by the abstruse information.","Varma, Das, Singh","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.618508","20210518","COVID-19; Covid anxiety; cyberchondria; health; health related internet searches","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13829,""
"Coping Strategies in the Spanish Population: The Role in Consequences of COVID-19 on Mental Health","The worldwide health emergency caused by COVID-19 is a new challenge for humanity which individuals respond to in a diversity of ways. The type of coping people use in such a situation could lead to positive or negative consequences to their health. Our objective was to analyze the use of coping strategies in the general population with attention to sociodemographic variables, and to test the capacity of these strategies for mediating in repercussions on mental health. The 1,160 adults who participated in this study answered the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ-S) and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28). The data were collected in a CAWI (Computer Aided Web Interviewing). The results suggest that the coping strategies they used the most differed depending on sociodemographic characteristics, such as age, sex and education. Furthermore, two mediation models were estimated for positive and negative coping strategies in the relationship between the presence of COVID-19 near them and mental health. The &quot;negative&quot; coping strategies were found to exert an indirect effect as mediators in the impact that COVID-19 positive cases near them had on their health. The consequences to mental health of the impact of coping with adverse situations should not be underestimated and it is important to design programs to educate the population in coping strategies that promote their health.","Molero Jurado, PÃƒÂ©rez-Fuentes, FernÃƒÂ¡ndez-MartÃƒÂ­nez, Martos MartÃƒÂ­nez, GÃƒÂ¡zquez Linares","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.606621","20210518","COVID-19; adult population; coping; health; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13830,""
"Online Indicated Preventive Mental Health Interventions for Youth: A Scoping Review","<b>Objective:</b> Between the ages of 12 and 25 the onset of mental disorders typically occurs, and the burden of mental health problems is greatest for this group.

Academic literature published from 2013 onwards in printed or electronic format was included from Scopus, PsychINFO, and Ovid MEDLINE(R) ALL. <b>Results:</b> The search yielded 11,122 results, with the final selection resulting in inclusion of 30 articles for this review. In total, the articles included 4,950 participants. 26.7% of the selected articles focused on youth between 12 and 25 years. Of the articles 60% did not screen for, nor exclude participants with clinical levels of symptoms. Most studies used a common evidence-based therapy for the disorder-category targeted. More than half of the online interventions included some form of human support. Adherence levels ranged between 27.9 and 98%. The results indicate general effectiveness, usability and acceptability of online indicated preventive interventions. The most commonly used approach was CBT (<i>n</i> = 12 studies). Studies varied in their size, rigor of study, effectiveness and outcome measures. Online interventions with a combination of clinical and peer moderation (<i>n</i> = 3 studies) appear to result in the most stable and highest effect sizes. <b>Conclusion:</b> Online indicated preventive mental health interventions for youth with emerging mental health issues show promise in reducing various mental health complaints, and increasing positive mental health indicators such as well-being and resilience. Additionally, high levels of usability and acceptability were found. However, the included studies show important methodological shortcomings. Also, the research has mainly focused on specific diagnostic categories, meaning there is a lack of transdiagnostic approaches. Finally, clear definitions of- as well as instruments to measure- emerging or subclinical mental health symptoms in youth remain are missing.","van Doorn, Nijhuis, Egeler, Daams, Popma, van Amelsvoort, McEnery, Gleeson, Ãƒâ€“ry, Avis, Ruigt, Jaspers, Alvarez-Jimenez, Nieman","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.580843","20210518","digital; e-health; early detection and intervention; indicated prevention; mental health; scoping review; well-being; youth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13831,""
"The COVID-19-Related Lockdown in Qatar: Associations Among Demographics, Social Distancing, Mood Changes, and Quality of Life","The worldwide spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the absence of medical treatment and vaccination, the delayed onset of symptoms, and the rapid human-to-human transmission have led the vast majority of countries to impose strict social distancing procedures. Whereas it appears that social distancing is an effective strategy for mitigating spread, it may also result in a variety of unintended negative consequences to individuals' psychological well-being and mental health. During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the present study examined associations among some demographic variables (gender, age, marital and working statuses, and having a family member or a friend infected with COVID-19), acceptance of social distancing, mood changes, and quality of life (QoL) in Qatar, a high-income Middle Eastern Arabic-speaking country. Older, married, and working participants were more accepting of social distancing than younger, unmarried, and non-working participants, respectively. Participants indicated that, during this time, they became more distressed, upset, scared, irritable, nervous, and afraid, and less inspired and determined. In a stark contrast, more individuals indicated that they became more interested, alert, and attentive, whereas higher percentages of participants reported feeling less guilty, hostile, and ashamed. Social distancing correlated positively with negative affect, whereas social avoidances correlated positively with positive affect and with physical, psychological, social, and environmental QoL. Finally, positive affect correlated positively, and negative affect correlated negatively, with these four domains of QoL. These results highlight the need for public health and clinical providers to consider peoples' psychological well-being and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Megreya, Latzman, Al-Ahmadi, Al-Dosari","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-021-00536-9","20210518","Acceptance of social distancing; COVID-19; Demographic variables; Mood changes; Quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13832,""
"Relationship Between Risk Perception, Social Support, and Mental Health Among General Chinese Population During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The Coronavirus Diseases (COVID-19) pandemic is a global public health challenge and provides an opportunity to investigate the unclear relationship between risk perception, social support, and mental health. This study aims to examine the association between risk perception and mental health while taking social support as a moderator. An online cross-sectional study recruiting 2993 participants was conducted in China, from 1st to 10th, February 2020. The relationship between risk perception, social support, and mental health was examined using multivariate linear regression analyses. This study indicated that risk perception was associated with a higher level of mental health symptoms. The subscale &quot;Perceived uncontrollability&quot; seemed to present a stronger correlation with depressive symptoms (Beta=0.306) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (Beta=0.318) than the subscale &quot;Perceived Severity&quot; did. Moreover, social support moderated the relationship between perceived uncontrollability and mental health symptoms. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is necessary to design mental health strategies and programs from a risk perception perspective (more mental health strategies should be delivered to build reasonable risk perception), while social support from family and friends may be protective to against depressive symptoms and PTSD symptoms. There is a demand for mental health intervention from a risk perception perspective.","Liu, Huang, Fu, Zhang, Feng, Guo","https://doi.org/10.2147/RMHP.S302521","20210518","PTSD symptoms; SARS-CoV-2; depressive symptoms; risk perception; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13833,""
"Mental Health Adverse Effects of COVID-19 Pandemic on Health Care Workers in North West Ethiopia: A Multicenter Cross-Sectional Study","The coronavirus has affected nearly every aspect of our lives. Most importantly the health-care workers (HCWs) are under insurmountable psychological pressures which lead them to various mental health problems, such as anxiety, stress, and depression. This study aimed to assess mental health adverse effects of COVID-19 pandemic on health-care workers in North West Ethiopia 2020. Institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted. A simple random sampling technique was applied and 419 participants completed the questionnaire. Mental health adverse effects were measured using the depression, anxiety and stress scale (DASS-21). Data were entered into Epi data version 4.4.2 then exported to SPSS version 24 for analysis. Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate binary logistic regressions with odds ratios and 95% confidence interval were employed. The level of significance of association was determined at a p-value &lt; 0.05. Prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress in this study was 58.2%, 64.7%, and 63.7%, respectively Those who had a medical illness, and mental illness, contact with confirmed COVID-19 pts, and poor social support showed a statistically significant association with depression. Female sex, participants who had families with chronic illness, had contact with confirmed COVID-19 case and poor social support had statistically significant association with anxiety, whereas participants who had families with chronic illness had contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases, and those participants who had poor social support were predictors of stress during COVID-19 pandemic. The magnitudes of mental health problems were higher and the concerned body should emphasize the continuous assessment of the mental health of health-care workers during this pandemic.","Asnakew, Amha, Kassew","https://doi.org/10.2147/NDT.S306300","20210518","COVID-19; DASS-21; anxiety; depression; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13834,""
"Therapist Experiences and Attitudes About Implementing Internet-Delivered Parent-Child Interaction Therapy During COVID-19","It has been widely recognized that access to mental health treatment is imperative to address current and long-term stressors for children and parents during COVID-19. Internet-delivered Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (iPCIT, previously referred to as I-PCIT) is a strong model for remote service delivery during social distancing restrictions due to its empirical base. However, this treatment modality was not widely implemented before COVID-19, likely due to barriers to providing telehealth services. This mixed methods study conducted a follow-up survey to gather therapist experiences (<i>N =</i> 223) in delivering iPCIT during COVID-19, including qualitative data on the benefits and challenges to delivering iPCIT. The vast majority of therapists (82%) indicated that they transitioned to deliver PCIT via telehealth in response to COVID-19. PCIT caseloads decreased slightly from the first survey to the COVID-19 follow-up survey, but the racial and ethnic composition of caseloads were not significantly different between the two surveys. Of the 183 therapists who transitioned to deliver PCIT via telehealth, 82% expressed interest in continuing to provide iPCIT following the COVID-19 pandemic. Reported benefits of iPCIT included decreased barriers to access and the ability to practice skills within the naturalistic home environment. Challenges to iPCIT were primarily issues with technology as well as other logistical barriers, which could limit engagement for some families. Findings from this study may be beneficial in improving future implementation of iPCIT during and post-COVID-19.","Barnett, Sigal, Green Rosas, Corcoran, Rastogi, Jent","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpra.2021.03.005","20210517","COVID-19; Parent-Child Interaction Therapy; iPCIT; implementation; telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13835,""
"Integrating Advocacy for Marginalized Children and Families Into Evidence-Based Care During COVID-19: Clinical Vignettes","The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has disproportionately impacted the health and socioeconomic outcomes for low-income populations, people of color, and immigrant children and families in the United States. As inequities in resources (i.e., food, internet, housing), health care, and education increased for marginalized families as a result of COVID-19, child-focused clinicians had to broaden their professional scope and implement new advocacy efforts. The current paper uses clinical vignettes taken from a New York State Office of Mental Health-licensed child and adolescent outpatient clinic in the Bronx, New York. The vignettes highlight the social inequities that impacted marginalized children and families during the pandemic, as well as the clinical team's response through the integration of evidence-base practice and advocacy.

"Exploring anxiety levels in healthcare workers during COVID-19 pandemic: Turkey sample","As in the whole world, the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic poses many threats to healthcare workers in our country too, which leads to anxiety in healthcare workers. This study was conducted to explore the anxiety levels of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study is a cross-sectional study. The population consisted of health care workers employed in hospitals in seven regions in Turkey. All volunteer healthcare workers were included in the study, and 356 healthcare workers responded to the questionnaire. The data were collected using the State Anxiety Inventory and a questionnaire created by the researchers using an online questionnaire between 10 May 2020 and 15 May 2020. In the evaluation of the data, mean, standard deviation, percentages, t-test, one-way ANOVA, Pearson correlation, and multiple regression analysis were used. 33% of healthcare workers did not have anxiety, 50% had mild, and 17% had severe anxiety. The anxiety scores of those who were nurses (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), who were working in the emergency room (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), who were involved in treatment for COVID-19 patients (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.040), who left their homes to prevent transmission to their families and relatives during the pandemic (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.038), and whose working hours had changed (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.036) were found to be significantly higher. It was observed that there was a positive and significant relationship between the fear of death and disease transmission, uncertainty, loneliness, anger, and hopelessness, and anxiety levels in healthcare workers. The main factors that significantly affected the anxiety levels of healthcare workers were male gender, weekly working hours, the presence of chronic diseases, and feelings of anger and uncertainty. In conclusion, during the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare workers experienced some negative emotions, their anxiety levels increased, and they were psychologically affected. Planning psychosocial interventions for healthcare workers in the high-risk group will make significant contributions to the health system.","Ã…Å¾ahin, KulakaÃƒÂ§","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-01730-7","20210518","Anxiety levels of healthcare workers; COVID-19; Healthcare workers; Questionnaire","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13837,""
"The coping strategies followed by university students to mitigate the COVID-19 quarantine psychological impact","Different strategies were followed to control the spread of the COVID-19 disease worldwide. Jordan declared a military-enforced curfew for three months, which successfully controlled the disease spreading. However, the curfew impacted several aspects of students' lives and personalities. This study discusses the impact of the COVID-19 curfew restrictions on university students' mental health, as this area was not fully discussed in previous studies. An online survey was distributed to cover the psychological symptoms and coping strategies of university students. Most of them experienced short temper, anxiety, and sleep problems. Female students expressed more psychological symptoms than males, they managed their stress by sleeping, studying, and worshiping. Whereas male students were working, exercising, and playing video games. A distinct interest was noticed among students of different ages. Young students (18-25Ã‚Â years) expressed unhappiness and distress-like symptoms; they advocated sleeping and playing video games. While elder students (&gt;26Ã‚Â years) had anxiety, sleep problems, and short tempers, they managed their symptoms by studying, exercising, and worshiping. The curfew restrictions have negatively impacted the mental health of female and younger students more than other categories. These research outcomes will help decision-makers to implement healthy coping strategies to be followed during unusual conditions.

"Restarting &quot;Normal&quot; Life after Covid-19 and the Lockdown: Evidence from Spain, the United Kingdom, and Italy","In this article, we examine the expectations of the economic outlook, fear of the future, and behavioural change during the first Covid-19 wave, for three European countries (Spain, the United Kingdom, and Italy) that have been severely hit. We use a novel dataset that we collected to monitor the three countries during the crisis. As outcome variables, we used expectations (e.g., economic outlook, labour market situation, recovery), fear (e.g., scenario of new outburst, economic depression, restriction to individual rights and freedom), and behavioural change across the following dimensions: savings, cultural consumption, social capital, and risky behaviour. We provide descriptive evidence that is representative of the population of interest, and we estimate the impact of exposure to shock occurred during the crisis on the same outcome variables, using matching techniques. Our main findings are the following: we detected systematically negative expectations regarding the future and the recovery, majoritarian fears of an economic depression, a new outbreak, and a permanent restriction on freedom, a reduction in saving and in social capital. Exposure to shocks decreased expected job prospects, increased withdrawal from accumulated savings, and reduced contacts with the network relevant to job advancement, whereas it had inconclusive effects over fears.

"Contradictory Responses to the COVID-19 Pandemic in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Patients and Their Families and Caregivers in Japan","Objective The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in a shortage of medical resources, including ventilators, personal protective equipment, medical staff, and hospital beds. We investigated the impact of COVID-19 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients, their families, caregivers, and medical experts. Methods We conducted a nationwide ALS webinar about COVID-19 in May 2020 and sent a questionnaire to those enrolled. Results A total of 135 participants (31 ALS patients; 23 families and caregivers of ALS patients; 81 medical experts) responded to this cross-sectional self-report questionnaire. The results showed that tracheostomy and invasive ventilation (TIV) was used in 22.6% of ALS patients, whereas 77.4% of ALS patients were not under TIV. Among non-TIV patients (n=24), 79.2% did not want TIV in the future. However, 47.4% of non-TIV patients not wanting a tracheostomy in advanced stages replied that they would want an emergency tracheostomy if they developed COVID-19-related pneumonia. These results suggest that ALS patients may be receptive to emergency treatments for reasons other than ALS. In addition, approximately half of the ALS patients agreed with the policy of not ventilating the elderly or ALS patients in case of a ventilator shortage. Furthermore, compared with medical experts, few ALS patients reported that the chance for ALS patients to obtain work was higher due to the increasing availability of remote work. Conclusions This survey indicates that the COVID-19 pandemic might be associated with increased distress about access to care and work, inducing contradictory responses and potential hopelessness among ALS patients.","Yanagihashi, Sugisawa, Fuchimoto, Saotome, Onozawa, Matsumoto, Bokuda, Ebina, Shibukawa, Hirayama, Murakami, Washizawa, Ebihara, Kano","https://doi.org/10.2169/internalmedicine.6810-20","20210518","COVID-19; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy; tracheostomy and invasive ventilation; webinar; Aged; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; COVID-19; Caregivers; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Japan; Pandemics; Respiration, Artificial; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13840,""
"Detecting and Assessing Suicide Ideation During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic prompted a rapid shift to virtual (video and telephone) delivery of mental health care, disrupting established processes for identifying people at increased risk of suicidal behavior. Following the shift to virtual care, Kaiser Permanente Washington implemented a series of workflow changes to administer standard screening and monitoring questionnaires at virtual visits and to complete structured suicide risk assessments for patients reporting frequent suicidal ideation. These new workflows included automated distribution of questionnaires via the electronic health record (EHR) patient portal and automated alerts to clinicians regarding indicators of high risk. In March 2020, in-person mental health visits were rapidly and completely replaced by video and telephone visits. The proportion of mental health visits with completed screening and monitoring questionnaires fell from approximately 80% in early 2020 to approximately 30% in late March, then gradually recovered to approximately 60% by the end of 2020. Among patients reporting frequent suicidal ideation on monitoring questionnaires, the proportion with a recorded suicide risk assessment fell from over 90% in early 2020 to approximately 40% in late March, then gradually recovered to nearly 100% by the end of 2020. Use of EHR patient portal messaging capabilities can facilitate systematic identification and assessment of suicide risk for patients receiving mental health care by telephone or video visit.","Simon, Stewart, Gary, Richards","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcjq.2021.04.002","20210517","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13841,""
"Bio-psychosocial study on the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on depression and anxiety in a sample of 1753 French-speaking subjects","The aim of this article was to study the impact of the COVID19 lockdown on anxiety and depressive symptoms on the basis of responses to an online survey from 1753 French-speaking subjects, conducted between April 27 and May 11, 2020. Using a biopsychosocial model, the effects of socio-demographic characteristics (age, gender at birth, socio-professional category, sexual orientation), lockdown conditions (material factors: urban density of the place of residence, surface area of the place of residence during lockdown), social characteristics: living with a partner during lockdown, presence of children during lockdown) and psychosocial history (attachment styles) on anxiety -Ã‚Â evaluated on the GAD7Ã‚Â -Ã‚Â and depressionÃ‚Â -Ã‚Â evaluated on the MDIÃ‚Â - were investigated. Ordinal regression analyses were conducted. The rates of depression observed (moderate or severe depression: 22.5%) and anxiety (moderate or severe anxiety: 18.4%) were higher than usual but lower than what has been documented in other studies on the effects of lockdown. Women appeared to be more vulnerable than men (Anxiety: AOR=1.647, CI 95%=1.647-2.530; Depression: AOR=1.622, CI 95%=1.274-2.072). Bisexual individuals had an increased likelihood of anxiety symptoms (AOR=1.962, CI 95%=1.544-2.490) and depression (AOR=1.799, CI 95%=1.394-2.317). For homosexuals, only links with depression were observed (AOR=1.757, CI 95%=1.039-2.906). People in a situation of economic vulnerability were more prone to anxiety disorders (e.g. people with no working activity: AOR=1.791, CI 95%=1.147-2.790) or depression (e.g. people with no working activity: AOR=2.581, CI 95%=1.633-4.057). Links with attachment styles were also found. Fearful subjects were particularly vulnerable (anxiety: AOR=2.514, CI 95%=1.985-3.190; depression: AOR=2.521, CI 95%=1.938-3.289), followed by subjects with an anxious attachment style (anxiety: AOR=1.949, CI 95%=1.498-2.540; depression: AOR=1.623, CI 95%=1.207-2.181). The impact of lockdown on avoidant subjects only concerned depression (AOR=1.417, CI 95%=1.034-1.937). Being with a partner during lockdown appeared to have a protective effect against depression (AOR=.693, CI 95%=.555-.866). Neither the presence of children, the surface area of the lockdown residence, nor the population density of the place of residence was associated with anxiety or depression. The impact of lockdown on mental health depends on a range of dimensions that need to be apprehended in order to tailor post-lockdown psychological and social support. Management based on a biopsychosocial approach should be favored.","Gouvernet, Bonierbale","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2021.03.002","20210517","Anxiety; AnxiÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ©; Confinement Covid-19; Covid19 Lockdown; Depression; DÃƒÂ©pression; Forms of attachment; Styles dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢attachements","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13842,""
"The impact of COVID-19 on pregnant womens' experiences and perceptions of antenatal maternity care, social support, and stress-reduction strategies","The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted on maternity care, supports and women's mental health. The aim of this study was to assess pregnant women's satisfaction with antenatal care and social support and to examine stress-reduction strategies women used during the pandemic. An online survey was conducted between June and July 2020. Pregnant women, aged over 18 years were recruited. The survey included closed and open-ended questions to assess women's perceptions and satisfaction with their antenatal care, social support, and stress-reduction strategies. Descriptive statistics and multivariate analysis were used for quantitative analyses; qualitative content analysis was used for open-ended questions. 573 pregnant women completed the survey. Women reported low levels of social support which was predicted by women's mental health and demographic factors and was related to public health and maternity service restrictions. Women reported that restrictions implemented in the maternity services limited their face-to face interactions with healthcare professionals and meant their partners could not attend antenatal appointments or support them in the postpartum period in the maternity setting. The lack of information on COVID-19 and pregnancy meant women had greater uncertainty about pregnancy and birth. Our findings indicate how the lack of access to antenatal care and reduced perceived social support as a result of the restrictions implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, potentially intensifies pregnancy specific stress. There is a need for the provision of supportive care, both formally and informally, particularly with women who may be more vulnerable during a pandemic.","Meaney, Leitao, Olander, Pope, Matvienko-Sikar","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wombi.2021.04.013","20210517","Antenatal care; COVID-19; maternity care; social support; stress-reduction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13843,""
"Impact of Preinfection Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction on Outcomes in COVID-19 Infection","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has high infectivity and causes extensive morbidity and mortality. Cardiovascular disease is a risk factor for adverse outcomes in COVID-19, but baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in particular has not been evaluated thoroughly in this context. We analyzed patients in our state's largest health system who were diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 20 and May 15, 2020. Inclusion required an available echocardiogram within 1 year prior to diagnosis. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. LVEF was analyzed both as a continuous variable and using a cutoff of 40%. Among 396 patients (67 Ã‚Â± 16 years, 191 [48%] male, 235 [59%] Black, 59 [15%] LVEF Ã¢â€°Â¤40%), 289 (73%) required hospital admission, and 116 (29%) died during 85 Ã‚Â± 63 days of follow-up. Echocardiograms, performed a median of 57 (IQR 11-122) days prior to COVID-19 diagnosis, showed a similar distribution of LVEF between survivors and decedents (P = 0.84). Receiver operator characteristic analysis revealed no predictive ability of LVEF for mortality, and there was no difference in survival among those with LVEF Ã¢â€°Â¤40% versus &gt;40% (P = 0.49). Multivariable analysis did not change these relationships. Similarly, there was no difference in LVEF based on whether the patient required hospital admission (56 Ã‚Â± 13 vs 55 Ã‚Â± 13, P = 0.38), and patients with a depressed LVEF did not require admission more frequently than their preserved-LVEF peers (P = 0.87). A premorbid history of dyspnea consistent with symptomatic heart failure was not associated with mortality (P = 0.74). Among patients diagnosed with COVID-19, pre-COVID-19 LVEF was not a risk factor for death or hospitalization.","Morin, Manzo, Pantlin, Verma, Bober, Krim, Lavie, Qamruddin, Shah, Tafur Soto, Ventura, Price-Haywood","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpcardiol.2021.100845","20210517","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13844,""
"Intimate Partner Violence and its Mental Health Implications Amid COVID-19 Lockdown: Findings Among Nigerian Couples","Intimate partner violence (IPV) has been identified as a global health problem with increasing mental health consequences. During the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in Nigeria, couples were compelled to spend more time together, regardless of their pre-existing challenges. Our study aims to determine the prevalence of IPV, its forms, and mental health implications among Nigerian households amid the COVID-19 lockdown. A cross-sectional study was implemented which used the snowball sampling technique to recruit 474 participants across 31 states in Nigeria. A semi-structured online questionnaire was distributed using the WhatsApp platform. The relationship between IPV, its forms, and associated factors were analyzed using descriptive analysis and logistic regression with significant value at <i>p</i> Ã¢â€°Â¤ .05 and confidence interval of 95%. Majority (98.1%) of the participants had at least a college degree and 90.1% were employed. Overall prevalence of IPV ranged from 7.2% to 13.5%. Using the lockdown as the landmark, higher prevalence was found before than during the lockdown across physical, emotional, financial, and sexual forms of IPV. Emotional form had the highest prevalence both before and during the lockdown with 11.4% and 3.8% respectively. Furthermore, 22.6% of participants reported that the lockdown affected their mental health. Hopelessness, feelings of failure, being irritable, and constantly under strain were psychological symptoms significantly associated with IPV amid the lockdown. Decreased prevalence of IPV were found in the early phase of the pandemic, suggesting that couples can experience less partner violence during periods of confinement. Our study supports existing evidence that forms of IPV have negative mental health consequences on abused partners.","Ojeahere, Kumswa, Adiukwu, Plang, Taiwo","https://doi.org/10.1177/08862605211015213","20210517","cultural contexts; disclosure of domestic violence; domestic violence; domestic violence and cultural contexts; mental health and violence; reporting/disclosure; sexual assault","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13845,""
"COVID-19 and ECT - a Victorian perspective","(i) to describe the operational strategies implemented to practise electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) safely, and (ii) to explore the effect of the lockdown and operational strategies on the characteristics of patients who received ECT during the initial 6 months of the COVID-19 lockdown. At first, the operational strategies that were implemented at the Broadmeadows ECT suite were summarised. Subsequently, the characteristics of patients who received ECT in the lockdown period (16 March-16 September 2020) and in the comparison period (16 March-16 September 2019) were compared. Many safety measures were implemented, and there was no COVID-19 infection among mental health staff and patients. In the lockdown period, the number of patients (23.9%) and the total number of ECTs (29.4%) were less. This pattern was more prominent among the aged patients. Safe practices are essential to provide ECT during lockdowns even when the community transmission of COVID-19 is high.","Jagadheesan, Walker, Danivas, Itrat, Lakra","https://doi.org/10.1177/10398562211014224","20210517","COVID-19; ECT; community transmission; lockdown; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13846,""

"Epidemiology and organ specific sequelae of post-acute COVID19: A Narrative Review","&quot;Long COVID&quot;, a term coined by COVID-19 survivors, describes persistent or new symptoms in a subset of patients who have recovered from acute illness. Globally, the population of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 continues to expand rapidly, necessitating the need for a more thorough understanding of the array of potential sequelae of COVID-19. The multisystemic aspects of acute COVID-19 have been the subject of intense investigation, but the long-term complications remain poorly understood. Emerging data from lay press, social media, commentaries, and emerging scientific reports suggest that some COVID-19 survivors experience organ impairment and/or debilitating chronic symptoms, at times protean in nature, which impact their quality of life. In this review, by addressing separately each body system, we describe the pleiotropic manifestations reported post COVID-19, their putative pathophysiology and risk factors, and attempt to offer guidance regarding work-up, follow-up and management strategies. Long term sequelae involve all systems with a negative impact on mental health, well-being and quality of life, while a subset of patients, report debilitating chronic fatigue, with or without other fluctuating or persistent symptoms, such as pain or cognitive dysfunction. Although the pathogenesis is unclear, residual damage from acute infection, persistent immune activation, mental factors, or unmasking of underlying co-morbidities are considered as drivers. Comparing long COVID with other post viral chronic syndromes may help to contextualize the complex somatic and emotional sequalae of acute COVID-19. The pace of recovery of different aspects of the syndrome remains unclear as the pandemic began only a year ago. Early recognition of long-term effects and thorough follow-up through dedicated multidisciplinary outpatient clinics with a carefully integrated research agenda are essential for treating COVID-19 survivors holistically.","Korompoki, Gavriatopoulou, Hicklen, Ntanasis-Stathopoulos, Kastritis, Fotiou, Stamatelopoulos, Terpos, Kotanidou, Hagberg, Dimopoulos, Kontoyiannis","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2021.05.004","20210516","COVID-19; Epidemiology; long COVID","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13848,""
"COVID-19 and Children's Mental Health: Identifying Challenges and the New Normal","The novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 has had clear and direct impact on the physical health of human beings, but the mental health toll associated with this global pandemic is only beginning to be understood. Although children and adolescents have been largely spared from the more severe symptoms associated with the disease, global health organizations such as the United Nations have suggested that COVID-19 may have the longest and most severe impact on children and adolescents due to the socioeconomic, physical, psychological impacts associated with the disease itself and the measures taken to stop transmission, such as physical distancing. This paper provides an overview of the evolutionary basis for community, and the ways that social and physical distancing measures to contain COVID-19 threaten the important social learning and support that community provides. It will then discuss, based on research from prior pandemics, recommendations from global health authorities, and emerging data on the impacts of COVID-19, how this pandemic is likely to impact the mental health of children and adolescents. Finally, we offer evidenced-based suggestions about how to mitigate the effects of physical and social distancing.","Behere, Barber Garcia","https://doi.org/10.2174/1573396317666210514172829","20210516","COVID-19; Children; Mental Health; Pediatric; Psychiatry; Psychology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13849,""
"[Prevalence, structure, and risk factors for mental disorders in older adults]","This review focuses on assessing the prevalence and risk factors of mental disorders in older adults in the current era, including the COVID-19 pandemic. A systematic review of the literature in PubMed, Elsevier, Google, using keywords over the past 10 years was conducted. It is shown that data on the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in the elderly population, including in comparison with young adults, diverge significantly. The significant incidence of mental disorders among nursing home residents is highlighted. The relevance of non-psychotic disorders of the depressive and anxiety spectrum in older adults is demonstrated. The difficulty of diagnosing mental disorders associated with somatic pathology as well as cognitive disorders in elderly patients is demonstrated. Risk factors for mental disorders in older adults are socio-demographic as well as economic, psychological and somatic factors. The problem of mental health of the elderly under the COVID-19 pandemic associated with specific risk factors for mental disorders is characterized. The shortage of evidence-based research in the treatment of mental disorders in old age and the urgency to improve the organization of psychiatric care for such patients are noted. Understanding the structure and prevalence of mental disorders among the elderly will allow to optimize the work of the healthcare system.

"&quot;I'm in iso all the time anyway&quot;: A mixed methods study on the impact of COVID-19 on women with endometriosis","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in restrictions and social isolation measures, which carry mental health risks. Cancellation of surgery and appointments, medication shortages and fear of the virus itself may have further challenged wellbeing. We aimed to understand how COVID-19 has affected people with endometriosis. Using a mixed methods design, we examined; 1) the impact of COVID-19 on endometriosis related healthcare, symptoms and functioning; and 2) the relationship between a measure of fear of COVID-19 and qualitative impact in 162 women with endometriosis. We found that 60% of women reported impact of the pandemic upon healthcare, with sub-themes documenting the difficulty of cancelled and delayed treatment, specific COVID-19 barriers, and the advantages and disadvantages of telehealth. Only 23% reported negative impact on symptoms, specifically stress; 76% reported impact on daily functioning, with sub-themes related to compromised work, social life and healthy living. A 'hidden benefits' theme revealed ways that COVID-19 had improved some women's lives, including working from home, and the opportunity for healthy lifestyle choices. Logistic regressions revealed that fear of COVID-19 significantly predicted impact themes (healthcare odds ratioÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.93, 95% confidence interval: 0.87-0.98; symptoms odds ratioÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.88, 95% confidence interval: 0.82-0.95; functioning odds ratioÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.92, 95% confidence interval: 0.85-0.99).

"Influence of COVID-19 pandemic on quality of life in patients with epilepsy - Follow-up study","To perform a follow-up study of the quality of life in patients with epilepsy in the era of the COVID-19 crisis. Two months before the first case of the COVID-19 in Serbia, we obtained the Serbian Version of Quality of Life Inventory for Epilepsy 31 (SVQOLIE-31) and Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory for Epilepsy scores (SVNDDI-E) for another study. We retested the same patients one year after in COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to SVQOLIE-31, and SVNDDI-E we used a generic questionnaire compiled from items related to the COVID-19. We retested 97 out of 118 patients (82.2%) for the follow-up analysis. The average age was 36.1Ã¢â‚¬Â¯Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬Â¯12.2 (range: 18-69), and 49 were women (50.5%). The median duration of epilepsy was 13Ã¢â‚¬Â¯years (range: 1.5-48). The structural etiology of epilepsy was noted in 41 (42.3%), unknown etiology in 41 (42.3%), and genetic etiology in 15 (15.4%) patients. Fewer patients (27.8%) experienced at least one seizure three months before follow-up testing when compared to patients who experienced at least one seizure three months in initial testing (36.0%) (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.15). All patients reported full compliance with anti-seizure medication in the follow-up. The SVQOLIE-31 score during the COVID-19 pandemic visit (64.5Ã¢â‚¬Â¯Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬Â¯14.6) was significantly lower than the SVQOLIE-31 score before the pandemic (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.001). The SVNDDI-E score during the COVID-19 pandemic (10.5Ã¢â‚¬Â¯Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬Â¯3.5) was significantly higher than the SVNDDI-E score before it (pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.001). Multiple linear regression analyses revealed fear of seizures, and fear of a reduction in household income, significantly associated with SVQOLIE-31 and SVNDDI-E overall score. These variables accounted for 66% and 27% of the variance of SVQOLIE-31 and SVNDDI-E overall score. Lower quality of life, higher prevalence of depression, healthcare availability issues, and perceived fears during pandemic all suggest COVID-19 has negatively impacted lives of patients with epilepsy.","StrizoviÃ„â€¡, VojvodiÃ„â€¡, KovaÃ„ÂeviÃ„â€¡, PejoviÃ„â€¡, BukumiriÃ„â€¡, SokiÃ„â€¡, RistiÃ„â€¡","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2021.108026","20210516","Depression; Epilepsy, COVID-19; NDDI-E; QOLIE-31; Quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13852,""

"[The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on first-line primary care in southeastern France: Feedback on the implementation of a real-time monitoring system based on regional health insurance data]","Starting in spring 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic markedly impacted the French healthcare system. Lockdown and risks of exposure to the coronavirus induced patients to modify their ways of use. The objective of this article was to share feedback on the implementation of a real-time monitoring system concerning (a) the activity of private practitioners in southeastern France, and (b) the evolution of reimbursements for drugs prescribed to persons with diabetes, for treatment of mental health disorders, and for performance of some vaccines. Data regarding 2019 and 2020 were extracted from regional health insurance databases. They were used to elaborate several indicators relative to the general health insurance scheme, which were calculated and updated each week, starting with week 2. We observed a drop in private physician activity during the lockdown (-23% for general practitioners; -46% for specialist doctors), followed by a return to a semblance of normalcy. Concomitantly, a boom in teleconsultations occurred: at the height of the crisis they represented 30% of medical acts. The initial stage of the lockdown was characterized by peak provisioning for drugs, whereas vaccination strongly declined (-39% regarding measles, mumps and rubella vaccine among children aged less than 5 years; -54% regarding human papillomavirus vaccine among girls aged 10 to 14 years). The COVID-19 pandemic could lead to health effects other than those directly attributable to the coronavirus itself. Renouncing care may result in healthcare delays highly deleterious for people and society. Public authorities are preoccupied with these questions; they have set up action plans aimed at encouraging patients to seek treatment without delay. That said, the COVID-19 pandemic crisis has also created opportunities, such as the expansion of telemedicine. Although partial, these indicators can provide useful information enabling public decision makers to be reactive and to implement specific actions to meet the health needs of the population.","Davin-Casalena, Jardin, Guerrera, J Mabille, TrÃƒÂ©hard, Lapalus, MÃƒÂ©nager, Nauleau, Cassaro, Verger, Guagliardo","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.respe.2021.04.135","20210516","COVID-19; Drugs; Healthcare use; Medical practitioners; MÃƒÂ©decins; MÃƒÂ©dicaments; Outpatient care; Public health; Recours aux soins; SantÃƒÂ© publique; Soins de ville; Vaccination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13854,""

"Drug repurposing of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: Could these drugs help fight COVID-19 and save lives?","The current 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), an emerging infectious disease, is undoubtedly the most challenging pandemic in the 21st century. A total of 92,977,768 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 1,991,289 deaths were reported globally up to January 14, 2021. COVID-19 also affects people's mental health and quality of life. At present, there is no effective therapeutic strategy for the management of this disease. Therefore, in the absence of a specific vaccine or curative treatment, it is an urgent need to identify safe, effective and globally available drugs for reducing COVID-19 morbidity and fatalities. In this review, we focus on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs: a class of antidepressant drugs with widespread availability and an optimal tolerability profile) that can potentially be repurposed for COVID-19 and are currently being tested in clinical trials. We also summarize the existing literature on what is known about the link between serotonin (5-HT) and the immune system. From the evidence reviewed here, we propose fluoxetine as an adjuvant therapeutic agent for COVID-19 based on its known immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties. Fluoxetine may potentially reduce pro-inflammatory chemokine/cytokines levels (such as CCL-2, IL-6, and TNF-ÃŽÂ±) in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, fluoxetine may help to attenuate neurological complications of COVID-19.","Pashaei","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jocn.2021.03.010","20210516","Anti-inflammatory; Antidepressant drugs; COVID-19; Drug repurposing; SARS-CoV-2; Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13857,""
"The mental health crises of the families of COVID-19 victims: a qualitative study","The bereaved families of COVID-19 victims are among the most vulnerable social groups in the COVID-19 pandemic. This highly infectious and contagious disease has afflicted these families with numerous psychological crises which have not been studied much yet. The present study is an attempt at investigating the psychological challenges and issues which the families of COVID-19 victims are faced with. The present study aims to identify the Mental Health crises which the families of COVID-19 deceased victims are going through. A qualitative research, the present study uses a conventional content analysis design. The participants were 16 members of the families of COVID-19 victims selected from medical centers in Iran from February to May 2020 via purposeful sampling. Sampling continued to the point of data saturation Data were collected via semi-structured individual interviews conducted online. The collected data were analyzed according to the conventional qualitative content analysis approach. Analyses of the data yielded two main themes and seven categories. Emotional shock included (feelings of guilt and rumination, bitter farewell, strange burial and concern about unreligious burial), and fear of the future included (instability in the family, lack of job security and difficult financial conditions, Stigmatization and complications in social interactions). The families of COVID-19 deceased victims are affected by various psychological crises which have exposed them to a deep sense of loss and emotional shock. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a cultural context which recognizes and supports all the various aspects of the mental health of these families.","Mohammadi, Oshvandi, Shamsaei, Cheraghi, Khodaveisi, Bijani","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12875-021-01442-8","20210518","COVID-19; Family; Mental health crisis; Qualitative research; Victims","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-19","",13858,""
