"Psychological health status in postpartum women during COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review and meta-analysis","This systematic review and meta-analysis pooled the prevalence of psychological symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic and examined the effects of the pandemic on psychological health in postpartum women. A systematic literature search and identification were performed in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and PsycINFO databases until June 16th, 2021. The fixed or random effect models to estimate the pooled prevalence of postpartum psychological symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic and the odds ratio (OR) of COVID-19 for psychological symptoms. A total of 29 articles including 20,225 postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic and 8312 before the COVID-19 pandemic were identified. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of postpartum depressive, anxiety, stress, and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms were 26.7Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% (95Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% CI: 22.0-31.9Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%), 33.8Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% (95Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% CI: 21.1-49.4Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%), 55.0Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% (95%CI: 27.9-79.5Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%), and 33.7Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% (95%CI: 19.6-51.5Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%), respectively. The ORs of COVID-19 pandemic for postpartum depressive and anxiety symptoms were 1.54 (95Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% CI: 1.00-2.36) and 2.56 (95%CI: 1.62-4.04). Subgroup analyses revealed that women with &gt;6Ã¢â‚¬Â¯weeks after delivery, younger than 35Ã¢â‚¬Â¯years old, low income, less education and without breastfeeding experienced a higher risk of depressive or anxiety symptoms after delivery. Only a few of prospective studies were included, and significant but inevitable heterogeneities were found in some analyses. A significantly higher proportion of postpartum women were suffered from psychological symptoms during COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in those with &gt;6Ã¢â‚¬Â¯weeks after delivery, younger than 35Ã¢â‚¬Â¯years old, low income, less education and formula feeding.","Gao, Su, Zhang, Liu, Zhang, Wang, Liu, Xie, Yin, Yue","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.08.107","20220910","COVID-19; Mental health status; Meta-analysis; Postpartum women; Prevalence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-12","",37451,""
"Psychological responses, mental health, and sense of agency for the dual challenges of climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic in young people in the UK: an online survey study","The COVID-19 pandemic and climate change are both significant and pressing global challenges, posing threats to public health and wellbeing. Young people are particularly vulnerable to the distress both crises can cause, but understanding of the varied psychological responses to both issues is poor. We aimed to investigate these responses and their links with mental health conditions and feelings of agency. We conducted an online survey between Aug 5 and Oct 26, 2020, targeting a diverse sample of young people (aged 16-24 years, n=530) in the UK. The survey was distributed using a combination of a survey panel (panel sample) and direct approaches to youth groups and schools who shared the survey with young people in their networks (community sample). We collected data on respondents' psychological responses to both climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic, their sense of agency to respond to each crisis, and the range of impacts on their lives. We also collected demographics data and screened for mental health and wellbeing indicators. We used non-parametric tests for most statistical comparisons. For paired samples, we used Wilcoxon's signed-rank test, and used Mann-Whitney U-tests or Kruskal-Wallis tests for two or more independent samples. Summed scale scores were considered as interval-level data and analysed with Student's t tests and ANOVAs. Effect sizes are reported as Cohen's d and partial eta-squared (ÃŽÂ·Ã‚Â·<sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub>), respectively. After excluding 18 suspected bots and 94 incomplete responses, 530 responses were retained for analysis. Of the 518 respondents who provided demographic data, 63% were female, 71Ã‚Â·4% were White, and the mean family affluence score was 8Ã‚Â·22 (SD 2Ã‚Â·29). Most participants (n=343; 70%) did not report a history of diagnosis or treatment for a mental health disorder, but mental health scores indicated a common experience of (relatively mild) symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress. Although UK youth reported more life disruption and concern for their future due to the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change was associated with significantly greater distress overall, particularly for individuals with low levels of generalised anxiety. The COVID-19 pandemic was more associated with feelings of anxiety, isolation, disconnection, and frustration; distress around loss and grief; and effects on quality of life. Climate change was more likely to evoke emotions such as interest and engagement, guilt, shame, anger, and disgust. The greater distress attributed to climate change overall was due, in particular, to higher levels of guilt, sense of personal responsibility, and greater distress triggered by upsetting media coverage. Agency to address climate change was associated with greater climate distress, but pandemic-related distress and agency were unrelated. The COVID-19 pandemic and climate change are affecting the wellbeing of UK young people in distinct ways, with implications for health service, policy, and research responses. There is a need for mental health practitioners, policy makers, and other societal actors to account for the complex relationship between climate agency, distress, and mental wellbeing in young people.

"The experiences of parents of children in pediatric palliative care: A qualitative study","This study aims to better understand the experiences of mothers of children receiving pediatric palliative care. The qualitative phenomenological method was used to determine the mothers' experiences. The study sample included 15 mothers. Individual interviews, an introductory information form and a semi-structured interview form were used for data collection. The data were analyzed with Colaizzi's seven-step method. MAXQDA was used for coding and creating themes. Three main themes of the interviews emerged; family experiences, social life and care in the palliative care unit. The mothers said that family relationships were affected, that they experience fear of loss, that they experience depression, that all responsibility for treatment and care lies with the mothers, and that there is no social support. Mothers said that they are in the same place as mothers of children in similar situations and that they are happy and comfortable because they have single rooms. In addition, the mothers stated that they are very afraid of the COVID-19 virus infecting their children and therefore losing their children. The mothers experienced some problems such as fear of loss, depression, care burden, social support, exclusion, daily life, social relationships, feeling safe, and emotional effect. Pediatric nurses need to understand mothers' anxiety, grief, relationships with their children, and coping strategies to provide support.","Karakul, KÃ„Â±ratlÃ„Â±, Ardahan AkgÃƒÂ¼l, Ãƒâ€¡elik","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pedn.2022.08.015","20220910","Experience; Mothers; Pediatric palliative care; Qualitative study","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-12","",37453,""
"Methodological issues in conducting yoga- and meditation-based research: A narrative review and research implications","Yoga and meditation-based interventions have been extensively utilized in the field of contemporary complementary and alternative medicine for various physical and mental health conditions. Ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has rekindled the interest of researchers in yoga and meditation for its preventive and therapeutic utilities. However, the available literature in this area has several methodological concerns, limiting formers' clinical utility. A comprehensive literature on this topic would stimulate researchers and guide them to conduct research on this topic with robust methodologies. The current review highlights the methodological issues with the yoga and meditation-based Research (henceforth, MBR), discusses some of the contentious issues, and provides future directions. The PubMed, Medline, and google scholar databases were searched to screen records dealing with the methodological issues on MBR. The search yielded 299 records, upon screening, only 24 articles were found suitable for the current study. Common methodological issues with MBR: lack of the consensus definitions of the yoga and meditations, interventions lacking theoretical framework of meditation; inadequate description of the study design; difficulty with participants recruitment, setting up the control groups, and blinding; difficulty in assessing the baseline characteristics of the participants, and validity issues with the outcome measures. A few research, however, have also highlighted the potential measures to overcome these methodological challenges. Yoga and meditation-based interventions are promising for several health conditions. However, literature suffers from considerable methodological issues, thus, limiting its utility in modern clinical practice. The study findings can stimulate and guide future research on this topic.","Gupta, Dhawan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaim.2022.100620","20220910","Challenges; Interventions; Meditation; Methodological issues; Research; Yoga","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-12","",37454,""
"Sleep spindles changes in people with previous COVID-19 infection","Stage 2 sleep spindles are considered useful biomarkers for the integrity of the central nervous system and for cognitive and memory skills. We investigated sleep spindles patterns in subjects after 12 months of their hospitalization in the intensive care unit (ICU) of the Padova Teaching Hospital due to COVID-19 between March and November 2020. Before the nap, participants (13 hospitalized in ICU - ICU; 9 hospitalized who received noninvasive ventilation - nonlCU; 9 age and sex-matched healthy controls - CTRL, i.e., not infected by COVID-19) underwent a cognitive and psychological as-sessment. During the nap, high-density electroencephalography (EEG) recordings were acquired. Slow (i.e., [9]-[12] Hz) and fast (i.e.,]12-16] Hz) spindles were automatically detected. Spindle density and spindle source reconstruction in brain grey matter were extracted. The psychological assessment revealed a statistical difference comparing CTRL and nonlCU in Beck Depression Inventory score and in the Physical Quality of Life index (p<sub>value</sub> = 0.03). The cognitive assessment revealed a trend of worsening results in executive functions in COVID-19 survivors. Slow spindle density significantly decreased comparing CTRL to COVID-19 survivors (p<sub>value</sub>= 0.001). There were statistically significant differences in EEG source-waveforms fast spindle amplitude onset among the three groups, mainly between CTRL and nonlCU. Clinical Relevance- Our results suggest that nonlCU were more susceptible to the hospitalization experience than ICU participants with a slight effect on cognitive tests. This impacted the spindle generation revealing a decreased density of slow spindles and affecting the generators of fast spindles in COVID-19 survivors especially in nonlCU.","Rubega, Formaggio, Ciringione, Bertuccelli, Paramento, Sparacino, Vianello, Masiero, Del Felice","https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC48229.2022.9871679","20220910","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-12","",37455,""
"Post COVID-19 mental health symptoms and quality of life among COVID-19 frontline clinicians: a comparative study using propensity score matching approach","The extent and severity of post-COVID-19 mental health symptoms among frontline clinicians are not clear. This study compared mental health symptoms (i.e., depression, anxiety, and insomnia symptoms) and global quality of life (QOL) after the first COVID-19 outbreak between the COVID-19 treating and non-COVID-19 treating frontline clinicians. This cross-sectional, comparative, convenient-sampling study was conducted between October 13 and 22, 2020, which was five months after the first COVID-19 outbreak in China was brought under control. The severity of depression, anxiety, insomnia symptoms, and global QOL of the clinicians were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 items (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 items (GAD-7), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire-brief version (WHOQOL-BREF), respectively. The propensity score matching (PSM) method was used to identify comparable COVID-19 treating and non-COVID-19 treating frontline clinicians. A generalized linear model (GLM) was used to assess the differences in PHQ-9, GAD-7, ISI, and QOL scores between the COVID-19 treating and non-COVID-19 treating frontline clinicians. In total, 260 COVID-19 treating frontline clinicians and 260 matched non- COVID-19 treating frontline clinicians were included. Non-COVID-19 treating frontline clinicians experienced more frequent workplace violence (WPV) than the COVID-19 treating frontline clinicians (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°7.6, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.006). COVID-19 treating frontline clinicians reported higher QOL compared to their non-COVID-19 treating frontline counterparts (bÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.3, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.042), after adjusting for WPV experience. COVID-19 treating and non- COVID-19 treating frontline clinicians reported similar PHQ-9, GAD-7, and ISI total scores (all p valuesÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). This study did not reveal more severe post-COVID-19 mental health symptoms in COVID-19 treating frontline clinicians compared to non-COVID-19 treating frontline clinicians. It is possible that the implementation of timely and appropriate mental health, social and financial supports could have prevented the worsening of mental health symptoms among the COVID-19 treating frontline clinicians after the first COVID-19 outbreak in China.","Zhao, Xing, Tian, Wang, Liang, Wang, Cheung, Su, Tang, Ng, Sha, Xiang","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-022-02089-4","20220909","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-12","",37456,""
"Health behaviours the month prior to COVID-19 infection and the development of self-reported long COVID and specific long COVID symptoms: a longitudinal analysis of 1581 UK adults","Demographic and infection-related characteristics have been identified as risk factors for long COVID, but research on the influence of health behaviours (e.g., exercise, smoking) immediately preceding the index infection is lacking. The aim of this study was to examine whether specific health behaviours in the month preceding infection with COVID-19 act as upstream risk factors for long COVID as well as well as three specific long COVID symptoms. One thousand five hundred eighty-one UK adults from the UCL COVID-19 Social Study and who had previously been infected with COVID-19 were analysed. Health behaviours in the month before infection were weekly exercise frequency, days of fresh air per week, sleep quality, smoking, consuming more than the number of recommended alcoholic drinks per week (&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°14), and the number of mental health care behaviours (e.g., online mental health programme). Logistic regressions controlling for covariates (e.g., COVID-19 infection severity, socio-demographics, and pre-existing health conditions) examined the impact of health behaviours on long COVID and three long COVID symptoms (difficulty with mobility, cognition, and self-care). In the month before infection with COVID-19, poor quality sleep increased the odds of long COVID (odds ratio [OR]: 3.53; (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.01 to 6.21), as did average quality sleep (OR: 2.44; 95% CI: 1.44 to 4.12). Having smoked (OR: 8.39; 95% CI: 1.86 to 37.91) increased and meeting recommended weekly physical activity guidelines (3h hours) (OR: 0.05; 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.39) reduced the likelihood of difficulty with self-care (e.g., washing all over or dressing) amongst those with long COVID. Results point to the importance of sleep quality for long COVID, potentially helping to explain previously demonstrated links between stress and long COVID. Results also suggest that exercise and smoking may be modifiable risk factors for preventing the development of difficulty with self-care.","Paul, Fancourt","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-14123-7","20220909","COVID-19; Health behaviours; Long COVID","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-12","",37457,""
"[Experiences and Resilience of Hygiene Team Members During the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic]","In compliance with German data protections regulations, we conducted an anonymous survey among participants of the annual infectious disease and control meeting in Freiburg, Germany in October 2021. We report the results of nurse and physician members of infection control teams on their perceptions and emotions during the pandemic. Descriptive statistics and Chi Square Test with P&lt;0.05 (SPSS Statistics Standard Version) were used when applicable. Of the 391 of 750 distributed surveys, 391 were returned; 48% were infection control practitioners (IP), 12% Link Nurses (LN), 12% Board Certified Hospital Epidemiologists (HE), 17% infection control-trained physicians (ITP), 1% Occupational Health or Public Health specialists and 10% others. 72% were female, 25.3% male, 0.2% divers and 2.5% gave no answers. The 349 members of infection control teams (IP, LN, HE, ITP) reported a high level of competency, importance and appreciation and a low rate of anxiety or hopelessness. A quarter reported anger and frustration which nevertheless did not result in reduced motivation. Information provided by the German national health agency Robert Koch-Institute (RKI) was utilized most by participants. Social media, on the other hand, were criticized frequently. Cooperation within the institution and local public health authorities was good. Free text answers regarding lessons learned showed wide potential for improvement. Our survey results indicate a high level of resilience among members of infection control teams in German medical institutions despite obvious shortcomings in supplies during the first wave of the pandemic. The high level of self-perceived competency and appreciation possibly helped deal with the situation and prevented the feeling of loss of control implied in the question items ""feeling overwhelmed"" and ""hopeless"". However, the lessons learned from the pandemic need to be implemented to maintain this high level of resilience not only for infection control teams but the medical system in general. Die SARS-CoV-2 Pandemie hat Mitarbeitende im Gesundheitswesen vor vielfÃƒÂ¤ltige Herausforderungen gestellt: Dies betrifft sowohl inhaltlich-praktische Aspekte, als auch psychologische Fragen bei der Verarbeitung des Geschehens. Fragestellung und Ziele: Zielsetzung der vorliegenden Arbeit war die Evaluation der Erfahrungen der Mitglieder der Hygieneteams wÃƒÂ¤hrend der Pandemie und die Analyse der SelbsteinschÃƒÂ¤tzung der eigenen Situation zur Ermittlung von mÃƒÂ¶glichen Resilienzfaktoren. WÃƒÂ¤hrend des Freiburger Infektiologie- und Hygienekongresses 2021, der unter CoronamaÃƒÅ¸nahmen in PrÃƒÂ¤senz stattfand, wurde eine Fragebogenaktion durchgefÃƒÂ¼hrt. Die deskriptive Auswertung erfolgte mittels Excel. Zur PrÃƒÂ¼fung auf statistische Signifikanz mit einem p&lt;0,05 wurde der Chi-Quadrat-Test (SPSS Statistic Standard-Version) verwendet. 391 FragebÃƒÂ¶gen von 750 verteilten BÃƒÂ¶gen konnten ausgewertet werden. 48% des Gesamtkollektivs waren HygienefachkrÃƒÂ¤fte, 12% Hygienebeauftragte in der Pflege (sog. Link Nurses), 12% Medizin-/Krankenhaushygieniker, 17% hygienebeauftragte Ãƒâ€žrzte, 1% BetriebsÃƒÂ¤rzte oder Ãƒâ€žrzte im Ãƒâ€“ffentlichen Gesundheitsdienst und 10% fielen unter verschiedene Bereiche des ÃƒÂ¶ffentlichen Gesundheitswesens, edukative Einrichtungen und Industrie (Sonstige). 72% der Befragten waren weiblich, 25,3% mÃƒÂ¤nnlich, 0,2% divers und 2,5% machten keine Angaben. Weiter ausgewertet wurden die 349 FragebÃƒÂ¶gen der Mitglieder des Hygieneteams im engeren Sinne (HygienefachkrÃƒÂ¤fte, Hygienebeauftragte in der Pflege, Krankenhaushygieniker und hygienebeauftragte Ãƒâ€žrzte). Die Befragten gaben ein hohes SelbstgefÃƒÂ¼hl der Fachkompetenz, Wichtigkeit ihrer TÃƒÂ¤tigkeit und WertschÃƒÂ¤tzung an und ein niedriges MaÃƒÅ¸ an Ãƒâ€žngsten oder Hoffnungslosigkeit. Gut ein Viertel der Befragten berichtete ÃƒÂ¼ber Ãƒâ€žrger und Frustration ohne BeeintrÃƒÂ¤chtigung der Motivation. Hauptinformationsquelle war das Robert Koch-Institut (RKI). Soziale Medien wurden ÃƒÂ¼berwiegend schlecht beurteilt. Die innerbetriebliche Zusammenarbeit und die Kooperation mit den GesundheitsÃƒÂ¤mtern wurden mehrheitlich als gut bewertet. Unsere Befragung zeigt ein hohes MaÃƒÅ¸ an Resilienz der Hygieneteams in der Pandemie trotz offensichtlicher Probleme bei Material, Logistik und Personal, wobei selbst empfundene Fachkompetenz und die entgegengebrachte WertschÃƒÂ¤tzung als wesentliche protektive Faktoren angesehen werden kÃƒÂ¶nnen. Die aus den Erfahrungen abgeleiteten VerbesserungsvorschlÃƒÂ¤ge hinsichtlich Infrastruktur, Kommunikation und Planung fÃƒÂ¼r zukÃƒÂ¼nftige Ereignisse sollten beachtet und umgesetzt werden und dÃƒÂ¼rfen auch nach ÃƒÅ“bergang der Pandemie in eine endemische Phase mit normalisierter Versorgungsstruktur nicht wieder in Vergessenheit geraten. Damit kann nicht nur die Resilienz der Hygieneteams erhalten werden, sondern auch eine StÃƒÂ¤rkung des Gesamtsystems erreicht werden.","Schulz-StÃƒÂ¼bner, Hauer, Nopper","https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1851-4287","20220909","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-09-12","",37458,""
