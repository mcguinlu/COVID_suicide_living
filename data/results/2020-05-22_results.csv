"Prevalence of Mental Health Problems During Virus Epidemics in the General Public, Health Care Workers and Survivors: A Rapid Review of the Evidence","Background: The swift spread of SARS-CoV-2 provides a challenge worldwide. As a consequence of restrictive public health measures like isolation, quarantine, and community containment, the provision of mental health services is a major challenge. Evidence from past virus epidemics and the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak indicate high prevalence rates of mental health problems (MHP) as short- and long-term consequences. However, a broader picture of MHP among different populations is still lacking. Methods: We conducted a rapid review on MHP prevalence rates published since 2000, during and after epidemics, including the general public, health care workers, and survivors. Any quantitative articles reporting on MHP rates were included. Out of 2855 articles screened, a total of 74 were included in this review. Results: Most original studies on MHP were conducted in China in the context of SARS-CoV-1, and reported on anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress symptoms/disorder, general psychiatric morbidity, and psychological symptoms. The MHP rates across studies, populations, and epidemics vary substantially. While some studies show high and persistent rates of MHP in populations directly affected by isolation, quarantine, threat of infection, infection, or life-threatening symptoms (e.g. health care workers), other studies report minor effects. Furthermore, even less affected populations (e.g. distant to epidemic epicenter, no contact history with suspected or confirmed cases) can show high rates of MHP. Discussion: MHP vary largely across countries and risk-groups in reviewed studies. The results call attention to potentially high MHP during epidemics. Individuals affected directly by an epidemic might be at a higher risk of short or even long-term mental health impairments. This study delivers insights stemming from a wide range of psychiatric instruments and questionnaires. The results call for the use of validated and standardized instruments, reference norms, and pre-post measurements to better understand the magnitude of the MHP during and after the epidemics. Nevertheless, emerging MHP should be considered during epidemics including the provision of access to mental health care to mitigate potential mental impairments.","Zuercher, S.

"Dramatic reduction of psychiatric emergency consultations during lockdown linked to COVID-19 in Paris and suburbs","Background The COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdown may have psychiatric consequences and increase the number of psychiatric emergency consultations. Methods Three psychiatric centers in Paris and its suburbs took part in the study. We compared the number of total psychiatric emergency consultations during the 4 first weeks of the lockdown in France to the corresponding 4 weeks in 2019. We also compared the number of consultations during these 4-week time periods in 2020 and 2019 across different diagnostic categories. Findings In the 4 first weeks of the lockdown in France, 553 emergency psychiatry consultations were carried out, compared to 1224 consultations during the corresponding period of 2019, representing a 54.8 % decrease. This decrease was evident across all psychiatric disorders, including anxiety (number of consultations in 2020 representing 36.1 % of 2019), mood (41.1 %), and psychotic disorders (57.3 %). The number of suicide attempts also decreased (number of suicide attempts in 2020 representing 42.6 % of 2019). In comparison to 2019, the proportion of total consultations for anxiety disorders also decreased (16.6 % vs. 20.8 %), whilst the proportion of total consultations increased for psychotic disorders (31.1 % vs. 24.1 %). Conclusions The total number of psychiatric emergency consultations during lockdown dramatically decreased. The psychological consequences of lockdown may be delayed, indicating that psychiatric services should be prepared for a secondary increase in emergency presentations.","Pignon, B.; Gourevitch, R.; Tebeka, S.; Dubertret, C.; Cardot, H.; Dauriac-Le Masson, V.; Trebalag, A.-K.; Barruel, D.; Yon, L.; Hemery, F.; Loric, M.; Rabu, C.; Pelissolo, A.; Leboyer, M.; Schurhoff, F.; Pham-Scottez, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.19.20095901v1?rss=1""","20200522","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-22","",1162,""
"Factors Contributing to Healthcare Professional Burnout During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Rapid Turnaround Global Survey","Background: Healthcare professionals (HCPs) on the front lines against COVID-19 may face increased workload, and stress. Understanding HCPs risk for burnout is critical to supporting HCPs and maintaining the quality of healthcare during the pandemic. Methods: To assess exposure, perceptions, workload, and possible burnout of HCPs during the COVID-19 pandemic we conducted a cross-sectional survey. The main outcomes and measures were HCPs self-assessment of burnout and other experiences and attitudes associated with working during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings: A total of 2,707 HCPs from 60 countries participated in this study. Fifty-one percent of HCPs reported burnout. Burnout was associated with work impacting household activities (RR=1.57, 95% CI=1.39-1.78, P<0.001), feeling pushed beyond training (RR=1.32, 95% CI=1.20-1.47, P<0.001), exposure to COVID-19 patients (RR=1.18, 95% CI=1.05-1.32, P=0.005), making life prioritizing decisions (RR=1.16, 95% CI=1.02-1.31, P=0.03). Adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) was protective against burnout (RR=0.88, 95% CI=0.79-0.97, P=0.01). Burnout was higher in high-income countries (HICs) compared to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) (RR=1.18; 95% CI=1.02-1.36, P=0.018). Interpretation: Burnout is prevalent at higher than previously reported rates among HCPs working during the COVID-19 pandemic and is related to high workload, job stress, and time pressure, and limited organizational support. Current and future burnout among HCPs could be mitigated by actions from healthcare institutions and other governmental and non-governmental stakeholders aimed at potentially modifiable factors, including providing additional training, organizational support, support for family, PPE, and mental health resources.

"Epidemiology of sleep disorders during COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic scoping review protocol","Background: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is impacting human health globally. In addition to physical health problems, a growing burden of mental health problems has become a global concern amid this pandemic. Sleep disorders are major mental health problems associated with increased psychosocial stressors; however, no research synthesis is available on the epidemiology of sleep disorders. In this systematic scoping review, we aim to assess the current evidence on the epidemiological burden, associated factors, and interventions from the existing literature on sleep disorders. Methods: We will search seven major health databases and additional sources to identify, evaluate, and synthesize empirical studies on the prevalence and correlates of sleep disorders and available interventions addressing the same. We will use the Joanna Briggs Institute Methodology for Scoping Review and report the findings using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist. Conclusion: This review will identify the epidemiological burden of and interventions for sleep disorders. The findings of this review will be widely communicated with the research and professional community to facilitate future research and practice.","Tasnim, S.; Rahman, M.; Pawar, P.; Zou, L.; Sultana, A.; McKyer, E.

"Dreaming during the Covid-19 pandemic: Computational assessment of dream reports reveals mental suffering associated with negative feelings and contagion fear","Neuroscience and psychology agree that dreaming helps to cope with negative emotions and learn from experience. The current global threat related to the COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread social isolation. How does this situation affect dreams? Is dreaming during the pandemic related to mental suffering? Does the act of observing dreams help to mitigate mental suffering? To address these questions, we applied natural language processing tools to study 210 dream reports (n=67, Pandemic group n=42, plus control group balanced for age, sex and education) either before the Covid-19 outbreak or during March-April, 2020, following the pandemic announcement by the WHO and quarantine was imposed in Brazil. Post-announcement dreams showed a higher proportion of words related to anger and sadness, and higher average semantic similarities to the terms contamination and cleanness, which tended to increase over time. These features were associated with mental suffering related to social isolation, as they explained 39% of the variance in PANSS negative subscale (p=0.0092). Besides, dream observation was positively self-evaluated and dream similarities to contamination and cleanness revealed different impacts of the dream observation effect. These results corroborate the hypothesis that pandemic dreams reflect mental suffering, fear of contagion, and important changes in daily habits.","Mota, N.

"COVID-19 and forced alcohol abstinence in India: The dilemmas around ethics and rights","In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as with other countries across the world, the Central and State Governments of India initiated several measures to slow down the spread of the virus and to â€˜flatten the curveâ€™  One such measure was a â€˜total lockdownâ€™ for several weeks across the country  A complex and unexpected outcome of the lockdown which has medical, ethical, economic, and social dimensions is related to alcohol consumption  The lockdown and consequent acute non-availability of alcohol resulted in people with alcohol dependence going into withdrawals, black marketing of alcohol, and in extreme cases suicide resulting from the alleged frustration of not having access to alcohol  The health dilemmas around this situation are biological (e g  pushing people into risky situations-potentially fatal alcohol withdrawal, consumption of illicit or other non-consumable alcohol) and psychosocial (e g  isolation increasing the risk of relapses, loss of control over the decision to abstain which can be detrimental to recovery, restriction of access to services for alcohol problems)  The legal and rights-related dilemmas are centred around whether States have the right to impinge on individual autonomy on the grounds of public health, the capacity of the health systems to provide appropriate services to cope with those who will struggle with the unavailability of alcohol, the constitutionality of the Central government&#039;s impinging on jurisdiction of states under the guise of a health emergency caused by the pandemic, and the ability of the State to make unbiased decisions about this issue when it is highly dependent on the revenue from the sale of alcohol and associated industries  The way forward could be a pragmatic and utilitarian approach involving continued access to alcohol, while observing all physical distancing norms necessary during the pandemic, for those who want to continue drinking;and implementing innovative measures such as tele-counselling for those who wish not to return back to drinking","Nadkarni, Abhijit; Kapoor, Arjun; Pathare, Soumitra","https://www.google.com/search?q=COVID-19+and+forced+alcohol+abstinence+in+India:+The+dilemmas+around+ethics+and+rights","","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-22","",1183,""

It is essential to know the specificity of this process in the child population, as well the specific recommendations for proper prevention and care of children during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Our objective is to analyze the scientific evidence on the specific recommendations for pediatric care in cases of COVID-19 from the family and community settings.The main recommendations and preventive measures in primary health care settings and at home have been selected and analyzed from an integrative approach that includes the biopsychosocial aspects of the child during confinement.The importance of caring for children in the face of the disease lies above all in ensuring the correct measures for the prevention of contagion due to the condition of acting as possible carriers during an incubation period of up to 21 days. The recommendation is that children actively participate in routine preventive actions to contain the spread of the disease. At the household level, isolation is an important challenge for families where there are manifestations of uncertainty, fear and helplessness in the face of changes and among the recommendations are establishing routines and order through schedules of activities and leisure together with hygiene measures.Given the rapidity with which the COVID-19 pandemic has occurred, there is little evidence at the moment. Research on prevention and treatment in the pediatric age needs to be developed to improve the available recommendations.","Merino-Navarro, Dolores; PeriÃ¡nez, Cristina DÃ­az","ES","","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-22","",1185,""

Infection by the SARS-CoV2 virus leads to the COVID-19 disease which can be fatal, especially in older patients with medical co-morbidities. The impact to the US healthcare system has been disruptive, and the way healthcare services are provided has changed drastically. Here, we present a compilation of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychiatric care in the US, in the various settings: outpatient, emergency room, inpatient units, consultation services, and the community. We further present effects seen on psychiatric physicians in the setting of new and constantly evolving protocols where adjustment and flexibility have become the norm, training of residents, leading a team of professionals with different expertise, conducting clinical research, and ethical considerations. The purpose of this paper is to provide examples of &quot;how to&quot; processes based on our current front-line experiences and research to practicing psychiatrists and mental health clinicians, inform practitioners about national guidelines affecting psychiatric care during the pandemic, and inform health care policy makers and health care systems about the challenges and continued needs of financial and administrative support for psychiatric physicians and mental health systems.","Bojdani, Ermal; Rajagopalan, Aishwarya; Chen, Anderson; Gearin, Priya; Olcott, William; Shankar, Vikram; Cloutier, Alesia; Solomon, Haley; Naqvi, Nida Z; Batty, Nicolas; Festin, Fe Erlita D; Tahera, Dil; Chang, Grace; DeLisi, Lynn E","IE","","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-22","",1188,""
"The Impact of Social Media on Panic During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Iraqi Kurdistan: Online Questionnaire Study","BACKGROUND: In the first few months of 2020, information and news reports about the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were rapidly published and shared on social media and social networking sites. While the field of infodemiology has studied information patterns on the Web and in social media for at least 18 years, the COVID-19 pandemic has been referred to as the first social media infodemic. However, there is limited evidence about whether and how the social media infodemic has spread panic and affected the mental health of social media users. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine how social media affects self-reported mental health and the spread of panic about COVID-19 in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. METHODS: To carry out this study, an online questionnaire was prepared and conducted in Iraqi Kurdistan, and a total of 516 social media users were sampled. This study deployed a content analysis method for data analysis. Correspondingly, data were analyzed using SPSS software. RESULTS: Participants reported that social media has a significant impact on spreading fear and panic related to the COVID-19 outbreak in Iraqi Kurdistan, with a potential negative influence on people&#039;s mental health and psychological well-being. Facebook was the most used social media network for spreading panic about the COVID-19 outbreak in Iraq. We found a significant positive statistical correlation between self-reported social media use and the spread of panic related to COVID-19 (R=.8701). Our results showed that the majority of youths aged 18-35 years are facing psychological anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: During lockdown, people are using social media platforms to gain information about COVID-19. The nature of the impact of social media panic among people varies depending on an individual&#039;s gender, age, and level of education. Social media has played a key role in spreading anxiety about the COVID-19 outbreak in Iraqi Kurdistan.","Ahmad, Araz Ramazan; Murad, Hersh Rasool","CA","","5","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-22","",1189,""

CONCLUSIONS: Our results give early insight into the urgent need to provide continuity of care for patients at the community-level, adequate PPE to GPs and a clear guidance from public health institutions. A precarious healthcare system both at a national and regional level might have triggered negative mental health outcomes in Italian GPs.","Amerio, Andrea; Bianchi, Davide; Santi, Francesca; Costantini, Luigi; Odone, Anna; Signorelli, Carlo; Costanza, Alessandra; Serafini, Gianluca; Amore, Mario; Aguglia, Andrea","IT","","2","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-22","",1202,""
"The 5% of the Population at High Risk for Severe COVID-19 Infection Is Identifiable and Needs to Be Taken Into Account When Reopening the Economy","The goal of this column is to help mental health care professionals understand coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) so that they can better explain the complexities of the current crisis to their patients. The bottom-line of this column is that, while COVID-19 can infect virtually everyone in the human population, only about 5% are susceptible to severe infection requiring admission to an intensive care unit and/or causing a fatal outcome and this population can be identified on the basis of comorbid medical illness and/or age. These numbers are based on experience in China, the United States, and Europe. Table 1 presents an analysis conducted by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which is further supported by several other sources reviewed in the article. The population at risk for severe infection are individuals with comorbid medical illness and those 85 years of age and older. The comorbid medical illnesses identified as risk factors are preexisting respiratory and cardiovascular disease, immunocompromised status, morbid obesity (ie, body mass index &amp;#8805;40), diabetes mellitus, and possibly significant kidney or liver impairment. Parenthetically, news reports and the literature sometimes cite age 60 years and older as a risk factor but age between 60 and 85 years is likely a surrogate for having 1 or more of these comorbid medical conditions. While 5% may initially seem like a small number, it nevertheless potentially represents 16.5 million people, given the United States population of 330 million. That is a tremendous number of people requiring intensive care unit admission and/or potentially dying, and individuals in this population have overwhelmed the US health care system in some hotspots. For this reason, this column suggests taking this at-risk population into account in mitigation strategies when attempting to open the US economy. The column addresses the following questions: (1) What are the 3 aspects of the race to minimize the damage caused by COVID-19? (2) What data are currently available to help guide decisions to be made? (3) What strategies have been employed to date and how successful have they been? and (4) Might risk stratification of exposure be a viable strategy to minimize the damage caused by the virus? The race to minimize the damage caused by COVID-19 requires that we obtain knowledge about the disease and its treatment or prevention, how to best safeguard public health and avoid overwhelming the health care system, and how to minimize the societal damage caused by substantial disruption of the economy. Data gathered over the past 4 months since the COVID-19 virus emerged as a human pathogen have provided guidance for our decisions going forward. The most widely adopted strategies for dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic to date have involved the epidemiological approach of encouraging good hygiene practices and social distancing, including orders to &quot;shelter in place,&quot; quarantine of high-risk individuals, and isolation of infected individuals. The goal of this epidemiological approach has been to &quot;flatten the curve&quot; by reducing the height of the peak of the infection to avoid overwhelming the health care system and society in general, while buying time to learn more about the disease and find more effective ways to deal with it. However, now that more is known about COVID-19 and the portion of the population that is most at risk for serious adverse outcomes including death, it may be possible to move from a shelter-in-place approach for the entire population to focus on those at most risk and thus facilitate a gradual and rational phased reduction of social restrictions to reopen the economy. Such a graduated opening would be based on regions of countries meeting specific criteria in terms of being able to contain the virus, coupled with vigorous monitoring to look for outbreaks, followed by case monitoring, isolation of infected individuals and quarantine of exposed individuals, and increased use of testing for active disease as well as for immunity. Taking the data on high-risk individuals into account would allow for a gradual lifting of restrictions on the majority of the population while maintaining more stringent safeguards to protect the vulnerable portion of the population. Nevertheless, the entire population would need to continue to practice good hygiene and social distancing while simultaneously-and perhaps even more vigorously-focusing on sheltering the vulnerable population until adequate community immunity has been achieved to prevent the spread of the virus, whether that is accomplished through natural exposure alone or with the addition of safe and effective vaccine(s) which may not be available for a year. Continued widespread testing for antibodies will help determine how far or close this country is-and other countries are-from developing effective community immunity.","Preskorn, Sheldon H","US","","3","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-22","",1203,""

"Unravelling potential severe psychiatric repercussions on healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 crisis","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is putting healthcare professionals, especially those in the frontline, under extreme pressures, with a high risk of experiencing physical exhaustion, psychological disturbance, stigmatization, insomnia, depression and anxiety. We report the case of a general practitioner, without relevant medical or psychiatric history that experienced a &quot;brief reactive psychosis (298.8)&quot; under stressful circumstances derived from COVID-19. She presented with delusional ideas of catastrophe regarding the current pandemic situation, delusions of self-reference, surveillance and persecution, with high affective and behavioural involvement. Physical examination and all further additional investigations did not reveal any secondary causes.Â She was administered olanzapine 10 mg with a significant psychopathological improvements being discharged with indications to maintain the treatment. To our knowledge this is the first case of severe mental illness in a healthcare professional without previous psychiatric history due to COVID-19 outbreak. Around 85% of patients presenting a brief psychotic disorder will develop a potentially disabling serious psychotic illness in the long-term. This case represents the potentially serious mental health consequences on healthcare professionals throughout the COVID-19 crisis and emphasizes the need to implement urgent measures to maintain staff mental health during the current pandemic.","Anmella, G; Fico, G; Roca, A; GÃ³mez, M; VÃ¡zquez, M; Murru, A; Pacchiarotti, I; Verdolini, N; Vieta, E","NL","","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-22","",1206,""
"Oncology services in corona times: a flash interview among German cancer patients and their physicians","OBJECTIVE: Public discussion and health-care systems worldwide have been focusing on the COVID-19 pandemic. Does it have an impact on cancer care today? MATERIALS AND METHODS: The PRIO (&quot;Prevention and Integrative Oncology&quot;) Working Group (German Cancer Society) has initiated an online survey for physicians, medical staff and patients on April 16, 2020. Between April 16 and April 19, 47 doctors and 146 patients filled in the questionnaires. The survey is ongoing. We present the first data. RESULTS: A majority of German patients (76%) and physicians (71%) report moderate or high restriction in their daily life. A minority (patients 25%, physicians 13%) was not worried that necessary treatments or diagnostics were restricted. Organizing cancer care needs more time and efforts for 56% of all reporting doctors. 98% of all oncologists think that restriction of family visits has a negative impact on the mental health of cancer patients. Half of all participants (patients 43%, physicians 47%) expect negative consequences on the physical status of our patients. Patients feel the existing emotional stress in 34% of their physicians. 52% of physicians fear mental and/or physical longtime consequences for themselves. CONCLUSION: There is a high level of mental and physical stress triggered by the present COVID-19 management. After only a few weeks, human resources are limited.

"Informations relatives aux psychotropes et Ã  leurs adaptations Ã©ventuelles pour les patients souffrant de troubles psychiques en France pendant l&#039;Ã©pidÃ©mie Ã  SARS-CoV-2/ [Informations on psychotropics and their adaptations for patients suffering from mental disorders in France during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic]","The 2019-20Â coronavirus pandemic (SARS-CoV-2; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) has dramatic consequences on populations in terms of morbidity and mortality and in social terms, the general confinement of almost half of the world&#039;s population being a situation unprecedented in history, which is difficult today to measure the impact at the individual and collective levels. More specifically, it affects people with various risk factors, which are more frequent in patients suffering from psychiatric disorders. Psychiatrists need to know: (i) how to identify, the risks associated with the prescription of psychotropic drugs and which can prove to be counterproductive in their association with COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), (ii) how to assess in terms of benefit/risk ratio, the implication of any hasty and brutal modification on psychotropic drugs that can induce confusion for a differential diagnosis with the evolution of COVID-19. We carried out a review of the literature aimed at assessing the specific benefit/risk ratio of psychotropic treatments in patients suffering from COVID-19. Clinically, symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (fever, cough, dyspnea, digestive signs) can be caused by various psychotropic drugs and require vigilance to avoid false negatives and false positives. In infected patients, psychotropic drugs should be used with caution, especially in the elderly, considering the pulmonary risk. Lithium and Clozapine, which are the reference drugs in bipolar disorder and resistant schizophrenia, warrant specific attention. For these two treatments the possibility of a reduction in the dosage -Â in case of minimal infectious signs and in a situation, which does not allow rapid controlÂ - should ideally be considered taking into account the clinical response (even biological; plasma concentrations) observed in the face of previous dose reductions. Tobacco is well identified for its effects as an inducer of CYP1A2Â enzyme. In a COVID+ patient, the consequences of an abrupt cessation of smoking, particularly related with the appearance of respiratory symptoms (cough, dyspnea), must therefore be anticipated for patients receiving psychotropics metabolized by CYP1A2. Plasma concentrations of these drugs are expected to decrease and can be related to an increase risk of relapse. The symptomatic treatments used in COVID-19Â have frequent interactions with the most used psychotropics. If there is no curative treatment for infection to SARS-CoV-2, the interactions of the various molecules currently tested with several classes of psychotropic drugs (antidepressants, antipsychotics) are important to consider because of the risk of changes in cardiac conduction. Specific knowledge on COVID-19Â remains poor today, but we must recommend rigor in this context in the use of psychotropic drugs, to avoid adding, in patients suffering from psychiatric disorders, potentially vulnerable in the epidemic context, an iatrogenic risk or loss of efficiency.","Javelot, H; Llorca, P-M; Drapier, D; Fakra, E; Hingray, C; Meyer, G; Dizet, S; Egron, A; Straczek, C; Roser, M; Masson, M; Gaillard, R; Fossati, P; Haffen, E","FR","","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-22","",1211,""

Clinically, symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (fever, cough, dyspnea, digestive signs) can be caused by various psychotropic drugs and require vigilance to avoid false negatives and false positives. In infected patients, psychotropic drugs should be used with caution, especially in the elderly, considering the pulmonary risk. Lithium and Clozapine, which are the reference drugs in bipolar disorder and resistant schizophrenia, warrant specific attention. For these two treatments the possibility of a reduction in the dosage â€“ in case of minimal infectious signs and in a situation, which does not allow rapid control â€“ should ideally be considered taking into account the clinical response (even biological; plasma concentrations) observed in the face of previous dose reductions. Tobacco is well identified for its effects as an inducer of CYP1A2 enzyme. In a COVID+ patient, the consequences of an abrupt cessation of smoking, particularly related with the appearance of respiratory symptoms (cough, dyspnea), must therefore be anticipated for patients receiving psychotropics metabolized by CYP1A2. Plasma concentrations of these drugs are expected to decrease and can be related to an increase risk of relapse. The symptomatic treatments used in COVID-19 have frequent interactions with the most used psychotropics. If there is no curative treatment for infection to SARS-CoV-2, the interactions of the various molecules currently tested with several classes of psychotropic drugs (antidepressants, antipsychotics) are important to consider because of the risk of changes in cardiac conduction. Specific knowledge on COVID-19 remains poor today, but we must recommend rigor in this context in the use of psychotropic drugs, to avoid adding, in patients suffering from psychiatric disorders, potentially vulnerable in the epidemic context, an iatrogenic risk or loss of efficiency.","Javelot, H.; Llorca, P.-M.; Drapier, D.; Fakra, E.; Hingray, C.; Meyer, G.; Dizet, S.; Egron, A.; Straczek, C.; Roser, M.; Masson, M.; Gaillard, R.; Fossati, P.; Haffen, E.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.006","20200504","","Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-22","",1219,""
