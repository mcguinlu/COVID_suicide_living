"Systematic review protocol exploring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the wellbeing of general practitioners","Background Over recent years chronic stress and burnout have been reported by doctors working in general practice in the UK NHS and internationally. The COVID-19 pandemic has changed general practitioners working lives; adding potential pressures from avoiding infection and addressing pent-up demand for care, but also changing processes such as rapidly taking up remote consultations. To date, there has been a focus on exploring the impact of the pandemic on the wellbeing of hospital clinicians. No registered systematic reviews currently focus on exploring the impact of the pandemic on the mental health and wellbeing of general practitioners. Aims and objectives To synthesise the current international evidence base exploring the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health and wellbeing of general practitioners, and which factors are associated with their reported mental health and wellbeing during the pandemic. Methods In this paper we report a systematic review protocol, following PRISMA guidance. In our search strategy we will identify primary research studies or systematic reviews exploring the mental health and wellbeing of general practitioners during the COVID-19 pandemic in four databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsychInfo and Medrxiv) and Google Scholar. We will hand-search reference lists and grey literature. Two reviewers will undertake all stages including study selection, data extraction and quality assessment, with arbitration by a third reviewer where necessary. We will use standardised quality assessment tools to ensure transparency and reduce bias in quality assessment. Depending on the quality of included studies, we may undertake a sensitivity analysis by excluding studies from narrative synthesis that are rated as low quality using the checklists. We will describe the findings across studies using narrative thematic data synthesis, and if sufficiently homogenous data are identified, we will pool quantitative findings through meta-analysis.","Laura Jefferson; Su Golder; Veronica Dale; Holly Essex; Elizabeth McHugh; Karen Bloor","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.05.21261627","20210807","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-08","",16909,""
"On the persistence of mental health deterioration during the COVID-19 pandemic by sex and ethnicity in the UK: evidence from Understanding Society","We use longitudinal data from a representative sample of the UK and compare self-reported mental health, as measured by the GHQ-12 score, at three timepoints (2017-2019, April 2020 and March 2021), for the whole sample and by sex and ethnicity. Out of the 14,382 individuals interviewed in 2017-2019 and April 2020, 10,445 were interviewed again in March 2021. The mean GHQ-12 in April 2020 is 12.37 [95% CI: 12.22, 12.52] and in March 2021 is 12.36 [95% CI: 12.21, 12.51], above that in 2017-2019, 11.13 [95% CI: 10.99, 11.26]. We do not find evidence that the level of mental health goes back to pre-pandemic levels. In terms of inequalities, while the gender gap (mean difference between women and men) in mental health deterioration among White British is closing, there is no clear evidence that the ethnic gap (mean difference between ethnic minorities and White British) among men is changing.","Climent Quintana-Domeque; Eugenio Proto","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.04.21261600","20210807","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-08","",16910,""
"COVID-19 & Mental Health: Impact on Working people and Students","A total of N=618 responses (16-60 years) were recorded to gauge the impact of COVID-19 socially, personally, and psychologically. Comparative results based on employment status, gender, and background were evaluated to identify the impact. While all the groups maintain having information about the pandemic and necessary safety protocols, there is an observable difference in the apprehension levels of financial and mental stability. Due to job security, employed people are less tense and better connected to their family, while unemployed people and students are more concerned with their productivity and quality of work. Students also display higher feelings of uncertainty and helplessness. A considerable number of people feel lonely and deserted during the pandemic. Such thoughts may leave a lasting effect if not tackled at the earliest. While an increase in awareness about mental health is observable, rural and unemployed people are less inclined to approach a professional. The significant difference COVID 19 has created between working people and students and based on gender and background, suggests that the preventive measures to avoid its lasting effects must be devised separately.","Kshipra Moghe; Disha Kotecha; Manjusha Patil","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.05.21261663","20210807","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-08","",16911,""
"COVID-19 vaccination coverage and hesitancy among groups prioritised in Australia's vaccine rollout","Objectives: This paper examines differences in vaccination coverage and hesitancy for people in vaccine priority groups. Design, setting, participants: Using data from 2,400 Australians who participated in two waves of the Taking the Pulse of the Nation survey in April and May 2021, we describe vaccination coverage and hesitancy among vaccine priority groups including people with disability, people living with a severe mental health condition, a severe long-term health condition, those requiring frequent assistance with everyday activities, and people who provide paid or unpaid care. Main outcome measures: The proportion of the sample who were vaccinated and who were vaccine hesitant, for the whole sample and for vaccine priority groups, disaggregated by age group and gender. Results: COVID-19 vaccine coverage was estimated to be 8.2% overall, higher for people with severe long term health conditions (13.4%) and lower for people with severe mental health conditions (4.3%). Vaccine hesitancy was high overall (35.6%) and was found to be lower for people with disability (30.3%), with severe long term health conditions (27.7%), with frequent need for assistance (24.2%) and carers (30.7%), but similar for those with severe mental health conditions (36.1%). Conclusions: Low vaccination coverage and high hesitancy for people in the priority groups leaves many people at significant risk of serious disease or death if infected with COVID-19. These findings demonstrate the urgent need for governments to enable easy access to vaccination for people in priority groups and to develop communication strategies to promote vaccination uptake, co-designed with the priority groups.","Zoe Aitken; Eric Emerson; Anne Kavanagh","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.05.21261633","20210807","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-08","",16912,""
"Trends in accident-related admissions to pediatric intensive care units during the first COVID-19 lockdown in Germany","Objective: To compare the number of accident- and injury-related admissions to pediatric intensive care units (PICU) during the first German COVID-19 lockdown with previous years. To investigate if shifts in types of accidents or injuries occurred, especially regarding non-accidental injuries. Design: Retrospective observational multicenter study. Setting: 37 German PICUs. Patients: 1444 children and adolescents < 18 years admitted to German PICUs due to trauma or injuries during the first German lockdown period (16.3.-31.5.2020) and during the same periods of the years 2017-2019. Interventions: None. Measurements and main results: Standardized morbidity ratios (SMR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for the severity of disease, admission reasons, types of accidents, injury patterns, surgeries and procedures, and outcomes. Disease severity did not differ from previous years. We found an increase in ingestions (SMR 1.41 (CI 0.88 - 2.16)) and a decrease in aspirations (0.77 (0.41 - 1.32)) and burns (0.82 (0.59 - 1.12)). The total number of admissions for trauma remained constant, but traffic accidents (0.76 (0.56 - 1.01) and school/kindergarten accidents (0.25 (0.05 - 0.74) decreased. Household (1.32 (1.05 - 1.64)) and leisure accidents (1.32 (1.05 - 1.65)) increased. Injured structures did not change, but less neurosurgeries (0.69 (0.42 - 1.07)) and more visceral surgeries (2.00 (1.14 - 3.24)) were performed. Non-accidental non-suicidal injuries declined (0.85 (0.50 - 1.37)). Suicide attempts increased in adolescent boys (1.57 (0.58 - 3.42)), while there was a decrease in adolescent girls (0.86 (0.53 - 1.31)). Conclusions: Our study showed shifts in trauma types and associated surgeries during the lockdown period that are generally in line with current literature. The decreased number of non-accidental non-suicidal injuries we observed does not suggest a fundamental increase in severe child abuse during the lockdown period. The decrease in suicide attempts among adolescent girls confirms previous findings, while the increase among boys has not been described yet and deserves further investigation.","Nora Bruns; Lea Yvonne Willemsen; Katharina Holtkamp; Oliver Kamp; Marcel Dudda; Bernd Kowall; Andreas Stang; Florian Hey; Judith Blankenburg; Hemmen Sabir; Frank Eifinger; Hans Fuchs; Roland Haase; Clemens Andree; Michael Heldmann; Jenny Potratz; Daniel Kurz; Anja Schumann; Merle Mueller-Knapp; Nadine Mand; Claus Doerfel; Peter Dahlem; Tobias Rothoeft; Manuel Ohlert; Katrin Silkenbaeumer; Frank Dohle; Fithri Indraswari; Frank Niemann; Peter Jahn; Michael Merker; Nicole Braun; Francisco Brevis Nunez; Matthias Engler; Konrad Heimann; Gerhard Wolf; Dominik Wulf; Claudia Holborn; Holger Freymann; Nicolas Allgaier; Felix Knirsch; Martin Dercks; Julia Reinhard; Marc Hoppenz; Ursula Felderhoff-Mueser; Christian Dohna-Schwake","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.06.21261728","20210807","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-08","",16913,""
"Change in the chemical content of untreated wastewater of Athens, Greece under COVID-19 pandemic","COVID-19 pandemic spread rapidly worldwide with unanticipated effects on mental health, lifestyle, stability of economies and societies. Although many research groups have already reported SARS-CoV-2 surveillance in untreated wastewater, only few studies evaluated the implications of the pandemic on the use of chemicals by influent wastewater analysis. Wide-scope target and suspect screening were used to monitor the effects of the pandemic on the Greek population through wastewater-based epidemiology. Composite 24Ã‚Â h influent wastewater samples were collected from the wastewater treatment plant of Athens during the first lockdown and analyzed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. A wide range of compounds was investigated (11,286), including antipsychotic drugs, illicit drugs, tobacco compounds, food additives, pesticides, biocides, surfactants and industrial chemicals. Mass loads of chemical markers were estimated and compared with the data obtained under non-COVID-19 conditions (campaign 2019). The findings revealed increases in surfactants (+196%), biocides (+152%), cationic quaternary ammonium surfactants (used as surfactants and biocides) (+331%), whereas the most important decreases were estimated for tobacco (-33%) and industrial chemicals (-52%).

"Lonely, anxious, and uncertain: Critical risk factors for suicidal desire during the COVID-19 pandemic","Public health measures enacted early in response to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in unprecedented physical isolation. Social isolation, or the objective experience of being alone, and loneliness, the subjective feeling of being lonely, are both implicated in suicidal ideation. Anxiety sensitivity (i.e., fear of somatic anxiety) and intolerance of uncertainty (distress due to uncertainty), may also be heightened in response to the pandemic increasing risk for suicidal ideation in response to social isolation and loneliness. The direct and interactive relations loneliness, anxiety sensitivity, and intolerance of uncertainty shared with suicidal ideation were examined using structural equation modeling across two samples. Sample 1 comprised 635 people (M ageÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 38.52, SDÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 10.00; 49.0% female) recruited using Mechanical Turk in May 2020. Sample 2 comprised 435 people (M ageÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 34.92, SDÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 14.98; 76.2% female) recruited from faculty, staff, and students at a midwestern university in June 2020. Loneliness and anxiety sensitivity were positively, uniquely associated with suicidal ideation across samples. Results of this study were cross-sectional and included only self-report measures. These findings highlight loneliness and anxiety sensitivity as important correlates of suicidal ideation. Modular treatments should be employed to target these mechanisms to reduce COVID-19-related suicidal ideation.","Allan, Volarov, Koscinski, Pizzonia, Potter, Accorso, Saulnier, Ashrafioun, Stecker, Suhr, Allan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.114144","20210807","Anxiety sensitivity; COVID-19; Intolerance of uncertainty; Loneliness; Social Isolation; Suicidal Ideation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-08","",16915,""
"Increased anxiety about falls and walking ability among community-dwelling Japanese older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic","Understanding the physical and mental changes in community-dwelling elderly people is very important during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic when considering preventive measures. The purpose of this study was to clarify the changes of physical function and anxiety for activities of daily living in community-dwelling older adults, focusing on locomotor function during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study participants were 127 older people who participated in successive surveys, in the summers of 2019 and again in 2020, after the state of emergency. The Locomo 25 questionnaire, Geriatric Depression Scale-15 (GDS-15) questionnaire, medical history, and number of people living together were self-reported. The Locomo 25 covers six aspects of physical pain, movement-related difficulty, usual care, daily activity, social activities, and anxiety. The paired samples t-test revealed that Locomo 25 total scores in 2020 were significantly higher than those in 2019. The GDS-15 score showed no significant difference. The comparison of scores for each item of the Locomo 25 revealed significantly higher scores in 2020 on Q21 ('difficult to perform sports activity', PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.0021), Q22 ('restricted from meeting own friends', PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), Q23 ('restricted from joining social activities', PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), Q24 ('anxious about falling in own house', PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.0023), and Q25 ('anxious about being unable to walk in the future', PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.0016). About 2Ã¢â‚¬â€°months after declaration of the first state of emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan, social activity was severely restricted. Older adults showed almost no changes in body pain and locomotive disabilities, but increases in their anxieties about walking ability and falling were remarkable.","Nakamura, Imaoka, Nakao, Hida, Imai, Tazaki, Takeda","https://doi.org/10.1111/psyg.12750","20210807","COVID-19; Locomo 25; anxiety; fear of falling; older adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-08","",16916,""
"Psychological distress among caregivers raising a child with autism spectrum disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic may disproportionately impact parents of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Loss of services and supports, heightened fears about increased infection rates, and disruption of daily routines likely adversely affect the well-being of children with ASD and their families. The goal of this study was to examine differences in psychological distress-as defined by symptoms of anxiety, depression, loneliness, and hyperarousal-between parents raising a child with ASD and parents in the US as a whole during the early stages of the pandemic (March-April 2020). Parents raising a child with ASD (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 3556) were recruited through SPARK, a national ASD research registry, whereas a representative sample of parents in the US (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 5506) were recruited from the Pew Research Center's American Trends Panel. All data were captured via online surveys. Descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regressions examined psychological distress at the item and summary score level. Parents of children with ASD reported higher levels of overall psychological distress (48% vs. 25%; aORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.60, 95% CI: 1.32, 1.84, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Hyperarousal, or feelings of panic when thinking about COVID-19, was particularly prevalent among parents of children with ASD compared to parents in the US (25% vs. 9%; aORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2.38, 95% CI: 1.83, 3.07, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Findings highlight the importance of considering the policies and practices that contribute to poor mental health in parents, particularly those raising a child with ASD, to ensure mental health services remain accessible. LAY SUMMARY: This study examined the mental health of parents raising a child with ASD during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results demonstrated substantially higher levels of psychological distress, particularly those related to feelings of panic, among parents raising a child with ASD when compared to parents in the US as a whole. These data suggest the need for ensuring mental health services are accessible to parents, particularly those raising a child with ASD, during and after the pandemic.","Kalb, Badillo-Goicoechea, Holingue, Riehm, Thrul, Stuart, Smail, Law, White-Lehman, Fallin","https://doi.org/10.1002/aur.2589","20210807","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-08","",16917,""
"Young hospital pharmacists' job stress and career prospects amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in China","Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic posed aÃ‚Â criticalÃ‚Â threatÃ‚Â toÃ‚Â publicÃ‚Â health in the past year and has not been fully controlled so far. The nature of front-line young hospital pharmacists' occupation puts them at an increased risk of contracting any contagious disease, including COVID-19. Recent survey indicated that hospital pharmacists in China are depressive, hostile amid the pandemic. The present investigation aims to understand the job stress among young hospital pharmacists during the outbreak of COVID-19 and to provide basic information for pharmacy managers to help young fellows to cope with job stress. This study is adopting pharmacist job stress questionnaire as the key instrument of data collection through WJX App in mobile phone. Demographic information, career prospects and stress management proposals were obtained synchronously. Quantitative data were processed with SPSS. Significant differences were examined using analysis of variance and Chi-square analysis. About 60% of 289 questionnaire respondents complained of job stress (178 respondents). According to the narrative description of the data, young pharmacists' gender, education background, hospital grade, and specific work post had no significant effect on job stress difference. However, young pharmacists in different age-groups and professional titles showed different job stress. Pharmacists at the age of 31-35 complained more stress than the others. Pharmacists with high professional title (deputy chief pharmacist) complained more stress than the others. About 65% of 289 respondents had long-term plan for their practice, although 61% of young pharmacists felt troubled or worried with their future. As for stress management proposal, almost all young pharmacists hoped to improve their professional identity via raising their wages. More than half of young pharmacists suffer from job stress amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in China, and various intervention measures should be taken to relieve the stress and finally improve their social identity.","Wu, Cai, Fang, Wang, Xu","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40545-021-00355-2","20210807","COVID-19; China; Intervention; Job stress; Young pharmacists","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-08","",16918,""
"Hope level and associated factors among parents of retinoblastoma patients during COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study","The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a global public health emergency. So far, only a limited number of studies have investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pneumonia pandemic on the mental health of parents having children with cancer. This study investigated the hope, and relevant influencing factors (depression, anxiety, demographic data) among parents whose children had retinoblastoma (RB) during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional survey and a convenient sampling survey were conducted on 317 parents of RB children admitted to the Ninth People's Hospital affiliated with Shanghai Jiao Tong University, School of Medicine, and Qilu Children's Hospital of Shandong University. The survey tools included Demographic Questionnaire, Herth Hope Index (HHI), The Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), and the Patient Health Questionnaires (PHQ)-2. The hope level score of the parents of RB patients was (35.36Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.42), which was at the medium level. The highest dimension of hope score was inner positive readiness and expectancy (12.07Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.57), and the lowest dimension was interconnectedness with self and others (11.50Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.64). The incidence rate of depression and anxiety was 29.97% (95/317) and 41.32% (131/317), respectively. Monoculus or binoculus disease, sleep status, health status, and depression /anxiety had statistically significant effects on the parental hope level (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that time since diagnosis, education level, treatment type and depression were independent influencing factors (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05), accounting for 22.60% of the variation in hope level. During the COVID-19 pandemic, medical staff should formulate targeted intervention measures according to different characteristics of ocular disease, time since diagnosis, treatment type, parental educational level and emotional state in order to improve the level of parental hope.","Zeng, Cao, Zhao, Li, Hou","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03401-0","20210807","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Hope level; Pediatric oncology; Retinoblastoma; Risk factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-08","",16919,""
"COVID-19, social isolation and the mental health of autistic people and their families: A qualitative study","In this study, we show that autistic people and their families have found it very difficult to deal with the lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic. Autistic and non-autistic researchers spoke to 144 people, including 44 autistic adults, 84 parents of autistic children and 16 autistic young people (12-18Ã¢â‚¬â€°years old). We asked them about their everyday lives and mental health during lockdown. People told us that they enjoyed having fewer obligations and demands compared to pre-COVID-19 life. They felt that life was quieter and calmer. But people also told us again and again how much they missed meeting people in real life, especially their friends, and their therapists and support workers. People told us that their mental health suffered because they did not have contact with their friends and services. Importantly, many people (including researchers) think that autistic people do not want friends or to be around people. But our results show that is not true. Many autistic people do want friends and to be around other people. Some people's mental health has been damaged by not being able to see people during COVID-19. Autistic people need support in many areas of life so they can keep socialising and seeing their friends even through difficult times, like pandemics.","Pellicano, Brett, den Houting, Heyworth, Magiati, Steward, Urbanowicz, Stears","https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613211035936","20210807","COVID-19; participatory research; qualitative research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-08","",16920,""
"How well do children in the North East of England function after a mental health crisis during the COVID-19 pandemic: A service evaluation","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected millions of people, and some researchers postulate that a mental health crisis will follow. The immediate effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on children's mental health are now starting to be published, and results appear to be mixed. There is no research, to the authors' knowledge, that empirically examines the functioning of young people following intervention from Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) Crisis Teams in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic. This service evaluation aims to do this using data from an NHS trust that supports 1.4Ã‚Â million people in the North East of England. We compared functioning, as measured by the Outcome Rating Scale (ORS), before and after treatment for young people discharged from the CAMHS Crisis Team between December 2019 and December 2020. ORS scores were significantly higher at the end of treatment (t(420) = -57.36, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) with a large effect size (d = -1.56).

"COVID-19 Pandemic-Related Depression and Insomnia among Psychiatric Patients and the General Population","The COVID-19 pandemic and limited access to healthcare professionals pose a serious risk of worsening mental conditions. This study was designed to examine the changes in symptoms of insomnia and depression during the pandemic as compared to before the pandemic, as well as the factors correlated with abovementioned mental state deterioration. The study was conducted from 1 April to 15 May 2020, on 212 psychiatric outpatients and 207 healthy controls. Participants completed a survey focused on symptoms during and prior to COVID-19 (the Beck Depression Inventory, the Athens Insomnia Scale). The following correlations were analyzed: demographics, social support, work status, income, and possible participants' and their relatives' COVID-19 diagnoses. Insomnia and depression severity intensified during the pandemic in both groups and were associated with age, gender, education, employment, and financial status. No correlations between social support nor becoming sick with COVID-19 and insomnia or depression were observed.

"Prevalence of Depression among Healthcare Workers during the COVID-19 Outbreak: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","There is evidence of a high psychological toll from the COVID-19 pandemic in healthcare workers. This paper was aimed at conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting levels of depression among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 and estimating the pooled prevalence of depression. We searched for cross-sectional studies listed on PubMed from 1 December 2019 to 15 September 2020 that reported prevalence of depression in healthcare workers, nurses, medical doctors, and COVID-19 frontline professionals. The pooled proportions of depression were calculated with random effects models. We identified 57 studies from seventeen countries. The pooled prevalence of depression in healthcare workers was 24% (95% CI: 20-28%), 25% for nurses (95% CI: 18-33%), 24% for medical doctors (95% CI: 16-31%), and 43% for frontline professionals (95% CI: 28-59%). The proportion of depression in nurses and medical doctors during the COVID-19 pandemic was similar to that found in the general population as previously reported in other meta-analyses conducted with smaller numbers of studies. Importantly, almost half of the frontline healthcare workers showed increased levels of depression. There is need for a comprehensive, international response to prevent and treat common mental health problems in healthcare workers.","Olaya, PÃƒÂ©rez-Moreno, Bueno-Notivol, Gracia-GarcÃƒÂ­a, Lasheras, SantabÃƒÂ¡rbara","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10153406","20210807","COVID-19; depressive symptoms; frontline; medical doctors; nurses; pooled prevalence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-08","",16923,""
"COVID-19: A New Challenge for Pulmonary Rehabilitation?","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), currently one of the immense burdens for global healthcare, is often characterized by rapid progression and the occurrence of symptoms particularly affecting the respiratory system. Continuous refinement of treatment protocols improves prognosis; however, COVID-19 survivors are often left with the symptomatic burden of dyspnea and fatigue. Therefore, it is necessary to continue comprehensive treatment including pulmonary rehabilitation. This study aimed to review the available literature on pulmonary rehabilitation in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. The pulmonary rehabilitation programs implemented various forms, i.e., aerobic exercise, breathing exercises, effective cough exercises, diaphragmatic breathing, and respiratory muscle training. Based on the literature review, it was found that pulmonary rehabilitation programs result in an improvement of respiratory function, reduction of fatigue and dyspnea, and improvement in exercise endurance and quality of life after completing both short-term and long-term programs, but depression and anxiety problems did not improve. Pulmonary rehabilitation combined with psychological therapy is crucial for COVID-19 survivors and plays a substantial role in patients' recovery.","KoÃ…â€šodziej, WyszyÃ…â€žska, Bal-BocheÃ…â€žska","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10153361","20210807","SARS-CoV-2; coronavirus; depression; pulmonary rehabilitation; quality of life; respiratory function","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-08","",16924,""
"Hospitalisation for Drug Infusion Did Not Increase Levels of Anxiety and the Risk of Disease Relapse in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease during COVID-19 Outbreak","During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, immunomodulatory therapies and hospital admission were suspected to increase the risk of infection. Nevertheless, patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) treated with intravenous (i.v.) biologics had to move to hospitals for drug infusion. We investigated the impact of hospitalisation in patients with IBD. We conducted a survey including consecutive IBD patients initially in clinical and biochemical remission treated with biologics at the end of the first lockdown period. Patients underwent the normally scheduled clinical visits, performed at hospital for i.v.-treated patients or at home for patients treated with s.c. drugs. We administered to all patients the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire and other 12 questions, specifically related to COVID-19 and its implications. A total of 189 IBD patients were recruited, 112 (59.3%) treated with i.v. drugs and 77 (40.7%) with s.c. ones. No relapses were recorded in either group (hospitalized vs. non-hospitalized, <i>p</i> = ns), as well as which, COVID-19 infections were not demonstrated in patients in contact with people with suspected symptoms or directly experiencing them. The total HADS score obtained by the sum of all items was also almost identical between groups (37.1 Ã‚Â± 2.8 vs. 37.2 Ã‚Â± 2.8; <i>p</i> = 0.98). In patients treated with i.v. drugs receiving a televisit (<i>n</i> = 17), the rate of satisfaction with telemedicine (58.8%) was significantly lower compared with those treated with s.c. drugs (94.8%; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0005). Our results suggest that hospitalisation during the COVID-19 outbreak does not increase the risk of COVID-19 infection as well as the risk of IBD relapse; moreover, the similar levels of anxiety in both groups could confirm that there is no need to convert patients from i.v. to s.c. therapy.","Bertani, Barberio, TricÃƒÂ², Zanzi, Maniero, Ceccarelli, Marsilio, Coppini, Lorenzon, Mumolo, Zingone, Costa, Savarino","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10153270","20210807","COVID-19; CrohnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease; biologics; clinical; ulcerative colitis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-08","",16925,""
"SARS-CoV-2 Spike Mutations, L452R, T478K, E484Q and P681R, in the Second Wave of COVID-19 in Maharashtra, India","As the global severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic expands, genomic epidemiology and whole genome sequencing are being used to investigate its transmission and evolution. Against the backdrop of the global emergence of ""variants of concern"" (VOCs) during December 2020 and an upsurge in a state in the western part of India since January 2021, whole genome sequencing and analysis of spike protein mutations using sequence and structural approaches were undertaken to identify possible new variants and gauge the fitness of the current circulating strains. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that newly identified lineages B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2 were predominantly circulating. The signature mutations possessed by these strains were L452R, T478K, E484Q, D614G and P681R in the spike protein, including within the receptor-binding domain (RBD). Of these, the mutations at residue positions 452, 484 and 681 have been reported in other globally circulating lineages. The structural analysis of RBD mutations L452R, T478K and E484Q revealed that these may possibly result in increased ACE2 binding while P681R in the furin cleavage site could increase the rate of S1-S2 cleavage, resulting in better transmissibility. The two RBD mutations, L452R and E484Q, indicated decreased binding to select monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and may affect their neutralization potential. Further in vitro/in vivo studies would help confirm the phenotypic changes of the mutant strains. Overall, the study revealed that the newly emerged variants were responsible for the second wave of COVID-19 in Maharashtra. Lineage B.1.617.2 has been designated as a VOC delta and B.1.617.1 as a variant of interest kappa, and they are being widely reported in the rest of the country as well as globally. Continuous monitoring of these and emerging variants in India is essential.","Cherian, Potdar, Jadhav, Yadav, Gupta, Das, Rakshit, Singh, Abraham, Panda, Team","https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms9071542","20210807","B.1.617.1; B.1.617.2; India; Maharashtra; SARS-CoV-2; evolution; modeling; second wave; whole genomes","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-08","",16926,""
"Concerns and Support after One Year of COVID-19 in Austria: A Qualitative Study Using Content Analysis with 1505 Participants","The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent governmental restrictions have had a major impact on the daily lives of Austrians and negatively affected their mental health. A representative sample of N = 1505 individuals was recruited via Qualtrics<sup>Ã‚Â®</sup> to participate in an online survey between 23 December 2020 and 4 January 2021. A qualitative study design was used to determine the problem areas that emerged since the beginning of the pandemic (question 1), the factors that were the source of the greatest current concern (question 2), the biggest worries when thinking about the future (question 3), and what the most important source of support (question 4) during the pandemic was. The written responses were analyzed using conventional content analysis following a framework for qualitative research and reported in the form of descriptive statistics. Restrictions imposed by the government, sociopolitical developments, work- and health-related issues, and economic disruptions were identified as being the greatest concerns. Conversely, social contacts within and outside the family were the most important source of support, followed by recreational activities and distraction. Greater consideration should be given to psychosocial factors in future decisions to contain the pandemic. More detailed qualitative research, in particular, to collect the personal experience of more vulnerable groups such as young people, women, and the unemployed, is needed.","Schaffler, GÃƒÂ¤chter, Dale, Jesser, Probst, Pieh","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18158218","20210807","Austria; COVID-19 pandemic; concerns; distress; problem areas; stress coping","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-08","",16927,""
"How Does the Assessment of Work Organization during the COVID-19 Pandemic Relate to Changes in the Well-Being of Health System Workers?","In the case of various emergencies, especially pandemics, healthcare workers are faced with disproportionate pressures. Organizational support plays a significant role in protecting the psychological and physical health of healthcare workers. This interdisciplinary research aims to determine how changes in the physical and psychological well-being of healthcare and pharmacy workers during the first wave of the COVID-19 lockdown are related to work organization factors that support safety and stability. A quantitative research strategy was applied in the research. Data from an electronic survey assessed the changes in the physical and psychological well-being of healthcare and pharmacy workers during the lockdown period and the organizational factors supporting safety and stability. The sample of the quantitative research consisted of 967 employees of healthcare institutions and pharmacies in Lithuania. This research broadens the concept of organizational factors and provides data on their interaction with the changes of employee well-being indicators in a pandemic situation. It was found that positive changes in the evaluation of physical as well as psychological well-being during the COVID-19 lockdown could be consistently predicted by all the analyzed safety and stability supporting organizational factors that were found to be associated with subjective physical well-being and psychological well-being even when adjusting for the effect of socio-demographic factors (gender, age, work field, and specialty). The identification and proper management of organizational factors was significant for the psychological and physical well-being of healthcare workers during the lockdown period. It was found that all estimates of safety and stability supporting organizational factors during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown were positively related and could act as protective factors to the subjective physical and psychological well-being of healthcare and pharmacy workers.","KubilienÃ„â€”, GriciÃ…Â«tÃ„â€”, MiglinÃ„â€”, KukulskienÃ„â€”, StankÃ…Â«nienÃ„â€”, Ã…Â½emaitienÃ„â€”","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18158202","20210807","COVID-19 pandemic; mental health; organizational factors; survey; well-being of healthcare workers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-08","",16928,""
"The Humanoid Robot Sil-Bot in a Cognitive Training Program for Community-Dwelling Elderly People with Mild Cognitive Impairment during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Randomized Controlled Trial","Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a stage preceding dementia, and early intervention is critical. This study investigated whether multi-domain cognitive training programs, especially robot-assisted training, conducted 12 times, twice a week for 6 weeks can improve cognitive function and depression decline in community-dwelling older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 135 volunteers without cognitive impairment aged 60 years old or older. Participants were first randomized into two groups. One group consisted of 90 participants who would receive cognitive training and 45 who would not receive any training (NI). The cognitive training group was randomly divided into two groups, 45 who received traditional cognitive training (TCT) and 45 who received robot-assisted cognitive training (RACT). The training for both groups consisted of a daily 60 min session, twice a week for six weeks. RACT participants had significantly greater post-intervention improvement in cognitive function (<i>t</i> = 4.707, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), memory (<i>t</i> = -2.282, <i>p</i> = 0.007), executive function <i>(t</i> = 4.610, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and depression (<i>t</i> = -3.307, <i>p</i> = 0.004).

"A Virtual Reality-Based Self-Help Intervention for Dealing with the Psychological Distress Associated with the COVID-19 Lockdown: An Effectiveness Study with a Two-Week Follow-Up","The aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of a novel self-administered at-home daily virtual reality (VR)-based intervention (COVID Feel Good) for reducing the psychological burden experienced during the COVID-19 lockdown in Italy. A total of 40 individuals who had experienced at least two months of strict social distancing measures followed COVID Feel Good between June and July 2020 for one week. Primary outcome measures were depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms, perceived stress levels, and hopelessness. Secondary outcomes were the experienced social connectedness and the level of fear experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Linear mixed-effects models were fitted to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention. Additionally, we also performed a clinical change analysis on primary outcome measures. As concerning primary outcome measures, participants exhibited improvements from baseline to post-intervention for depression levels, stress levels, general distress, and perceived stress (all <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) but not for the perceived hopelessness (<i>p</i> = 0.110). Results for the secondary outcomes indicated an increase in social connectedness from T0 to T1 (<i>p</i> = 0.033) but not a significant reduction in the perceived fear of coronavirus (<i>p</i> = 0.412). Among these study variables, these significant improvements were maintained from post-intervention to the 2-week follow-up (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). Results indicated that the intervention was associated with good clinical outcomes, low-to-no risks for the treatment, and no adverse effects or risks. Globally, evidence suggests a beneficial effect of the proposed protocol and its current availability in 12 different languages makes COVID Feel Good a free choice for helping individuals worldwide to cope with the psychological distress associated with the COVID-19 crisis, although large scale trials are needed to evaluate its efficacy.","Riva, Bernardelli, Castelnuovo, Di Lernia, Tuena, Clementi, Pedroli, Malighetti, Sforza, Wiederhold, Serino","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18158188","20210807","COVID-19; digital technology; psychological stress; self-help technology; virtual reality; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-08","",16930,""

This longitudinal study aimed to better understand the changes in adolescents' internalizing symptoms and the underlying mechanisms of parental stress due to COVID-19. We asked 1053 parents of adolescents to complete an online survey during the second and fifth weeks and at the end of home confinement (i.e., four weeks later). Results showed that parents reported their adolescents' anxiety and depression symptoms were more severe at Time 2 than at the first administration. Anxiety symptoms slightly decreased at Time 3, while there was no significant change in depression symptoms. Moreover, parents' expressive suppression mediated the association between parental stress and adolescents' anxiety and depression symptoms, respectively. The findings suggest that as restriction increased, adolescents' anxiety and depression became more severe. Moreover, due to the link between parental stress and adolescents' internalizing disorders helping families to cope with the distress due to the pandemic may have a positive impact on parents, the child, and the family as a whole (i.e., the family climate).","Liang, Mazzeschi, Delvecchio","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18158074","20210807","COVID-19; adolescent; anxiety; depression; expressive suppression; parental stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-08","",16932,""
"The Early Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Health Facilities and Psychiatric Professionals","(1) Background: While in many countries, the psychiatric and mental health sectors had been in crisis for years, the onset of a novel coronavirus pandemic impacted their structures, organizations, and professionals worldwide. (2) Methods: To document the early impacts of the COVID-19 health crisis on psychiatry and mental health sectors, a systematic review of the international literature published in 2020 was conducted in PubMed (MEDLINE), Cairn.info, and SantÃƒÂ©Psy (Ascodocpsy) databases. (3) Results: After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 72 articles from scientific journals were selected, including papers documenting the early impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the organization of psychiatric care delivery, work processes in psychiatry and mental health units, and personal experiences of mental health professionals. This review identified the contributions aimed at preventing the onset of mental disorders in the early stages of the health crisis. It lists the organizational changes that have been implemented in the first place to ensure continuity of psychiatric care while reducing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. It questions the evolution of the rights and duties of mental health professionals in the first months of the pandemic. (4) Discussion and conclusions: Although this literature review exclusively documented the early impacts of the COVID-19 health crisis, it is of significant interest, as it pictures the unprecedent situation in which psychiatry and mental health care professionals found themselves in the first stages of the pandemic. This work is a preliminary step of a study to be conducted with mental health professionals on an international scale-the Psy-GIPO2C project-based on more than 15 group interviews, 30 individual interviews, and 2000 questionnaires.

The associations between the outcome (experience of financial loss, changes in food intake and impact of the pandemic on daily lives) and the explanatory (age, sex, education level, anxiety, depression, HIV status) variables were determined using logistic regression analysis. Of the 4439 respondents, 2487 (56.0%) were financially insecure, 907 (20.4%) decreased food intake and 4029 (90.8%) had their daily life negatively impacted. Males (AOR:0.84), people who felt depressed (AOR:0.62) and people living with HIV -PLHIV- (AOR:0.70) had significantly lower odds of financial insecurity. Older respondents (AOR:1.01) had significantly higher odds of financial insecurity. Those depressed (AOR:0.62) and PLHIV (AOR:0.55) had significantly lower odds of reporting decreased food intake. Respondents who felt anxious (AOR:0.07), depressed (AOR: 0.48) and who were PLHIV (AOR:0.68) had significantly lower odds of reporting a negative impact of the pandemic on their daily lives.

"Loneliness during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Comparison between Older and Younger People","The precautionary measures and uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic have serious psychological impacts on peoples' mental health. We used longitudinal data from Hiroshima University to investigate loneliness before and during the pandemic among older and younger people in Japan. We provide evidence that loneliness among both older and younger people increased considerably during the pandemic. Although loneliness among younger people is more pervasive, the magnitude of increase in loneliness during the pandemic is higher among older people. Our logit regression analysis shows that age, subjective health status, and feelings of depression are strongly associated with loneliness before and during the pandemic. Moreover, household income and financial satisfaction are associated with loneliness among older people during the pandemic while gender, marital status, living condition, and depression are associated with loneliness among younger people during the pandemic. The evidence of increasing loneliness during the pandemic is concerning for a traditionally well-connected and culturally collectivist society such as Japan. As loneliness has a proven connection with both physical and mental health, we suggest immediate policy interventions to provide mental health support for lonely people so they feel more cared for, secure, and socially connected.","Khan, Kadoya","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18157871","20210807","COVID-19 pandemic; Japan; comparative analysis; logit regression; loneliness; older and younger people; social isolation; socio-demographic and psychological factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-08","",16936,""
"Smart City and Crisis Management: Lessons for the COVID-19 Pandemic","COVID-19 shocked cities around the world and revealed the vulnerability of urban lives and functions. Most cities experienced a catastrophic disturbance that has lasted for a long time. Planning plays a critical role in responding efficiently to this crisis and enabling rapid functional recovery in the post-disaster era.

Specifically, digitalized cities could ensure the well-being of their residents and maintain continuity of urban functions.

Systematic literature review and subjective content analysis are employed to investigate the effects of technology on community well-being and making cities more resilient in past crises. This study shows that different technology-driven policies and actions enable crisis management, enhance community well-being, and increase urban resilience. Technology has enhanced coping and recovery capacities by increasing participation and social connectedness, enhancing physical and mental health and maintaining the functionality of education and economic systems. These have been achieved through various solutions and technologies such as social media, telehealth, tracking and monitoring systems, sensors and locational applications, teleworking systems, etc. These solutions and technologies have also been used during the COVID-19 pandemic to enhance community well-being and sustain urban functions. However, technology deployment might have adverse effects such as social exclusion, digital divide, privacy and confidentiality violation, political bias and misinformation dissemination, and inefficient remote working and education. It is suggested that to mitigate these side effects, policymakers should liberate the process of digitalization, increase the accessibility to digital services, and enhance digital literacy.","Hassankhani, Alidadi, Sharifi, Azhdari","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18157736","20210807","COVID-19; community well-being; crisis management; smart city; urban resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-08","",16937,""
