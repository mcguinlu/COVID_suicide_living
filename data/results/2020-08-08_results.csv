"The importance of nature to city living during the COVID-19 pandemic: Considerations and goals from environmental psychology","The COVID-19 pandemic has produced an opportunity for urban planners, government decision-makers, health practitioners, and environmental psychologists to further understand human psychosocial wellbeing in cities. Given a growing base of evidence illustrating that interaction with nature positively affects mood and mental health, preserving access to green spaces in cities during this time of mandated social isolation should be considered imperative for as long as possible. This think-piece highlights that parks, community gardens, and other natural areas are essential to urban dwellers, especially if directives to physically distance from one another become longstanding or recurrent. Public decision-makers should aim to develop simple, relatively inexpensive strategies to augment the usability of nature in innovative ways that make it possible to enjoy them while respecting distance guidelines. Also discussed is the notion that a predominant goal for social scientists and urban practitioners during this crisis will be to learn how people view the ways in which public parks and wilder urban areas mitigate their response to worry, isolation, and an altered form of civic engagement. Research on the extent to which â€˜sense of placeâ€™ changes for city dwellers during this global circumstance will be important for planners and social scientists alike.","McCunn, Lindsay J.","https://doi.org/10.1080/23748834.2020.1795385","","Database: ELSEVIER; Publication details: Cities Health;2020.; Publication details: Cities Health;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-08","",3708,""
"Urbanization and biodiversity loss in the post-COVID-19 era: complex challenges and possible solutions","Although biodiversity conservation and restoration can significantly contribute to environmental health in urban areas, rapid urbanization undermines biodiversity in various ways. We hypothesize that one challenge that will arise after the COVID-19 pandemic is the accelerated expansion of urban areas through two distinct mechanisms: more informal settlements due to increased poverty and increased urban sprawl due to increased suburban development. In response to this challenge, we call for a global agenda to put the concept of wildlife-supportive green space design into action. We suggest 12 major issues for future research and practice that should be scrutinized in the post-COVID-19 era.","Rastandeh, Amin; Jarchow, Meghann","https://doi.org/10.1080/23748834.2020.1788322","","Database: ELSEVIER; Publication details: Cities Health;2020.; Publication details: Cities Health;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-08","",3709,""
"The impact of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus on inbound tourism in South Korea toward sustainable tourism","Despite the declaration of the end of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS) outbreak in December 2015 in South Korea that the epidemic lasted for 2 months, the depressed domestic economy and tourism sector did not immediately restore. Thus, it is important to explore how much of an impact the disease had and how long the damage lasted. Using quantitative time-series models, the present study explored the influence of MERS on inbound tourism in South Korea and estimates the concrete impact of MERS on the market in 2015. Monthly international tourist arrival data were provided by the Korea Tourism Organization from January 2009 to December 2015. The results showed that the contagious disease was statistically and negatively significant for inbound tourists visiting South Korea. During the time of MERS, from June 2015 to September 2015, the total effect was estimated to be -1,968,765 tourists with a loss of 3.1 billion USD in receipts. This study can not only better estimate the impact on tourism number of inbound tourist arrivals, but also supports policy-makers in their attempts to establish proper policies to assure tourists of their safety in such crises.","Choe, Yunseon; Wang, Junhui; Song, HakJun","https://doi.org/10.1080/09669582.2020.1797057","","Database: ELSEVIER; Publication details: J.

"Technology as a Coping Tool during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Implications and Recommendations","The COVID-19 outbreak has caused unprecedented social disruption. This collective trauma has resulted in school closures, shuttered businesses, rising unemployment, and a spike in emotional distress from the pandemic and related secondary stressors. In this time of crisis, and due to sweeping stay-at-home orders across the United States and internationally, billions of individuals are engaging in work and school from home. This has resulted in an increasing reliance on technology to accomplish these tasks. Moreover, there has been a substantial rise in the use of technology as a way to stay connected to loved ones, for entertainment, for telehealth services, and to engage in at-home-fitness. This commentary reviews literature that discusses the potential harm of increased technology use as well as its benefits. If mindfully leveraged, technology can be harnessed to promote increased social connectedness, work productivity, and leisure time. Mental health services may be more widely distributed through telehealth and related services, improving access and reducing health disparities. Recommendations about how technology can promote effective coping and improve physical and mental health during and after the COVID-19 pandemic are discussed. This article is protected by copyright.

"Patient experiences of fertility clinic closure during the COVID-19 pandemic: appraisals, coping and emotions","What are appraisals, coping strategies and emotional reactions of patients to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) fertility clinic closures? Clinic closure was appraised as stressful due to uncertainty and threat to the attainability of the parenthood goal but patients were able to cope using strategies that fit the uncertainty of the situation. Psychological research on COVID-19 suggests that people are more anxious than historical norms and moderately to extremely upset about fertility treatment cancellation owing to COVID-19. The study was of cross-sectional design, comprising a mixed-methods, English language, anonymous, online survey posted from April 09 to April 21 to social media. Eligibility criteria were being affected by COVID-19 fertility clinic closure, 18 years of age or older and able to complete the survey in English. In total, 946 people clicked on the survey link, 76 did not consent, 420 started but did not complete survey, and 450 completed (48% completion, 446 women, four men). Overall 74.7% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°336) of respondents were residents in the UK with an average age of 33.6 years (SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.4) and average years trying to conceive, 3.5 years (SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.22). The survey comprised quantitative questions about the intensity of cognitive appraisals and emotions about clinic closure, and ability to cope with clinic closure. Open-text questions covered their understanding of COVID-19 and its effect on reproductive health and fertility plans, concerns and perceived benefits of clinic closure, and knowledge about closure. Sociodemographic information was collected. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used on quantitative data. Thematic qualitative analysis (inductive coding) was performed on the textual data from each question. Deductive coding grouped themes from each question into meta-themes related to cognitive stress and coping theory. Most patients (81.6%, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°367) had tests or treatments postponed, with these being self (41.3%, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°186) or publicly (46.4%, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°209) funded. Patients appraised fertility clinic closure as having potential for a more negative than positive impact on their lives, and to be very or extremely uncontrollable and stressful (p Ã¢â€°Â¤ .001). Most reported a slight to moderate ability to cope with closure. Data saturation was achieved with all open-text questions, with 33 broad themes identified and four meta-themes linked to components of the cognitive stress and coping theory. First, participants understood clinic closure was precautionary due to unknown effects of COVID-19 but some felt clinic closure was unfair relative to advice about getting pregnant given to the public. Second, closure was appraised as a threat to attainability of the parenthood goal largely due to uncertainty of the situation (e.g., re-opening, effect of delay) and intensification of pre-existing hardships of fertility problems (e.g., long time waiting for treatment, history of failed treatment). Third, closure taxed personal coping resources but most were able to cope using thought-management (e.g., distraction, focusing on positives), getting mentally and physically fit for next treatments, strengthening their social network, and keeping up-to-date. Finally, participants reported more negative than positive emotions (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€° .001) and almost all participants reported stress, worry and frustration at the situation, while some expressed anger and resentment at the unfairness of the situation. Overall, 11.9% were not at all able to cope, with reports of intense feelings of hopelessness and deteriorating wellbeing and mental health. The survey captures patient reactions at a specific point in time, during lockdown and before clinics announced re-opening. Participants were self-selected (e.g., UK residents, women, 48% starting but not completing the survey), which may affect generalisability. Fertility stakeholders (e.g., clinics, patient support groups, regulators, professional societies) need to work together to address the great uncertainty from COVID-19. This goal can be met proactively by setting up transparent processes for COVID-19 eventualities and signposting to information and coping resources. Future psychological research priorities should be on identifying patients at risk of distress with standardised measures and developing digital technologies appropriate for the realities of fertility care under COVID-19.

"Exposure to COVID-19 patients increases physician trainee stress and burnout","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has put considerable physical and emotional strain on frontline healthcare workers. Among frontline healthcare workers, physician trainees represent a unique group-functioning simultaneously as both learners and caregivers and experiencing considerable challenges during the pandemic. However, we have a limited understanding regarding the emotional effects and vulnerability experienced by trainees during the pandemic. We investigated the effects of trainee exposure to patients being tested for COVID-19 on their depression, anxiety, stress, burnout and professional fulfillment. All physician trainees at an academic medical center (n = 1375) were invited to participate in an online survey. We compared the measures of depression, anxiety, stress, burnout and professional fulfillment among trainees who were exposed to patients being tested for COVID-19 and those that were not, using univariable and multivariable models. We also evaluated perceived life stressors such as childcare, home schooling, personal finances and work-family balance among both groups. 393 trainees completed the survey (29% response rate). Compared to the non-exposed group, the exposed group had a higher prevalence of stress (29.4% vs. 18.9%), and burnout (46.3% vs. 33.7%). The exposed group also experienced moderate to extremely high perceived stress regarding childcare and had a lower work-family balance. Multivariable models indicated that trainees who were exposed to COVID-19 patients reported significantly higher stress (10.96 [95% CI, 9.65 to 12.46] vs 8.44 [95% CI, 7.3 to 9.76]; P = 0.043) and were more likely to be burned out (1.31 [95% CI, 1.21 to1.41] vs 1.07 [95% CI, 0.96 to 1.19]; P = 0.002]. We also found that female trainees were more likely to be stressed (P = 0.043); while unmarried trainees were more likely to be depressed (P = 0.009), and marginally more likely to have anxiety (P = 0.051). To address these challenges, wellness programs should focus on sustaining current programs, develop new and targeted mental health resources that are widely accessible and devise strategies for creating awareness regarding these resources.","Kannampallil, Goss, Evanoff, Strickland, McAlister, Duncan","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237301","20200807","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-08","",3714,""
"Barriers and facilitators to optimal supportive end-of-life palliative care in long-term care facilities: a qualitative descriptive study of community-based and specialist palliative care physicians' experiences, perceptions and perspectives","The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted ongoing challenges to optimal supportive end-of-life care for adults living in long-term care (LTC) facilities. A supportive end-of-life care approach emphasises family involvement, optimal symptom control, multidisciplinary team collaboration and death and bereavement support services for residents and families. Community-based and palliative care specialist physicians who visit residents in LTC facilities play an important role in supportive end-of-life care. Yet, perspectives, experiences and perceptions of these physicians remain unknown. The objective of this study was to explore barriers and facilitators to optimal supportive end-of-life palliative care in LTC through the experiences and perceptions of community-based and palliative specialist physicians who visit LTC facilities. Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews, basic qualitative description and directed content analysis using the COM-B (capability, opportunity, motivation - behaviour) theoretical framework. Residential long-term care. 23 physicians who visit LTC facilities from across Alberta, Canada, including both in urban and rural settings of whom 18 were community-based physicians and 5 were specialist palliative care physicians. Motivation barriers include families' lack of frailty knowledge, unrealistic expectations and emotional reactions to grief and uncertainty. Capability barriers include lack of symptom assessment tools, as well as palliative care knowledge, training and mentorship. Physical and social design barriers include lack of dedicated spaces for death and bereavement, inadequate staff, and mental health and spiritual services of insufficient scope for the population. Findings reveal that validating families' concerns, having appropriate symptom assessment tools, providing mentorship in palliative care and adapting the physical and social environment to support dying and grieving with dignity facilitates supportive, end-of-life care within LTC.","Harasym, Brisbin, Afzaal, Sinnarajah, Venturato, Quail, Kaasalainen, Straus, Sussman, Virk, Holroyd-Leduc","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-037466","20200807","adult palliative care; geriatric medicine; qualitative research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-08","",3715,""
"The impact of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic on lifestyle behaviors and their association with subjective wellbeing among the general population in the Mainland China: a cross-sectional study","The world is experiencing an extraordinary, life-altering challenge due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. However, it is unclear whether the lifestyle will change under the situations of COVID-19 epidemic. To explore perceived lifestyle changes, after the outbreak of COVID-19, and their association with subjective wellbeing (SWB) among the general population in the Mainland China. An online survey was conducted through a media platform in May 2020. Lifestyle behaviors including leisure-time physical exercise, leisure-time screen time and dietary intake were self-reported. SWB was measured using the General Wellbeing Schedule (GWS). Other covariates including socio-demographic factors, self-rate physical health, perceived social support and loneliness were also assessed by a structured questionnaire. Multivariate ordinal regression method was used to analyze the association between SWB and lifestyle behaviors as well as perceived lifestyle changes. A total of 1,033 participants aged between 18 and 60 years were included in this study. The mean GWS score was 71.7 points and more than half of participants reported no perceived lifestyle changes. About 70% of the respondents reported spending more time on screen, whereas about 30% reported an increased frequency of vegetable and fruits intake after the outbreak of COVID-19. Physical inactivity (odds ratio(OR) =1.16,95% confidence interval (CI):1.02-1.48), infrequent vegetable intake (OR=1.45,95%CI: 1.10-1.90), infrequent fruits intake (OR=1.31,95%CI: 1.01-1.70) and often skipping breakfast (OR=1.43, 95%CI: 1.08-1.91) were associated with lower SWB after adjusting for socio-demographic factors, self-rate physical health, perceived social support and loneliness. Moreover, participants who perceived a decrease in the frequency of vegetable, fruits and breakfast intake were more likely to report lower SWB. The COVID-19 pandemic may have positive or negative impact on some aspects of lifestyle behaviors. Both unhealthy lifestyle behaviors and negative lifestyle changes were associated with lower SWB. Therefore, these findings provide scientific information for the lifestyle guidelines in the management of COVID-19 as well as for the public mental health interventions.","Hu, Lin, Chiwanda Kaminga, Xu","https://doi.org/10.2196/21176","20200807","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-08","",3716,""

"Crowdsourced smartphone data reveal altered sleep/wake pattern in quarantined Chinese during the COVID-19 outbreak","The Chinese Government quarantined Wuhan on 23 January 2020 and thereafter the Hubei province, affecting a total of 59 million citizens, to cease the spread of the coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19). The effects of this lockdown on the psychological and mental health of both the affected and unaffected Chinese are largely unknown currently. We utilized one of the largest crowdsourced databases (Sleep as Android) that consisted of 15,681 sleep records from 563 users in China to estimate the change in the sleep pattern of Chinese users during the span of 30 December 2019 to 8 March 2020 with reference to 64,378 sleep records of 1,628 users for the same calendar period of years 2011-2019. The sleep pattern in China changed drastically after 23 January 2020 when the law of quarantine and suspension of Wuhan became effective. The two major findings are: (1) Chinese people increased their sleep duration by an average of 20Ã‚Â min and delayed their sleep onset by an average of 30 min at weekdays, while they maintained a similar sleep duration at weekends, and (2) larger changes were found in several subgroups, including those in Wuhan (80 sleep records from 3 users), female subjects, and those aged Ã¢â€°Â¤ 24Ã‚Â years. Overall, Chinese people slept later and longer than usual during the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine.","Lee, Marek, NÃƒÂ¡levka","https://doi.org/10.1080/07420528.2020.1792486","20200807","COVID-19 pandemic confinement; altered sleep duration and pattern; crowdsourcing; sleep as Android App; wuhan China","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-08","",3718,""
