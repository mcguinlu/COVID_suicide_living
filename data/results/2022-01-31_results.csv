"â€˜Feeling Fatâ€™ Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic: Examining the Role of Emotion Dysregulation in the Body Displacement Hypothesis","â€˜Feeling fat,â€™ the somatic experience of being overweight not entirely explained by objective weight, may occur due to the projection of negative affect onto the body. Individuals may manage â€˜feeling fatâ€™ via eating pathology (e.g., binge eating or dietary restriction) rather than address the source of negative affect. Thus, â€˜feeling fatâ€™ may occur in the absence of adaptive emotion regulation strategies. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased negative affect widely and may potentially contribute to the experience of â€˜feeling fatâ€™ and eating pathology among individuals with emotion dysregulation. This study examined whether emotion dysregulation moderates â€˜feeling fatâ€™s role as a mechanism underlying the relationship between COVID-19-related distress and eating pathology. This uniqueness of this model to eating pathology was investigated by comparing effects for binge eating and dietary restriction versus anxiety, depression, and problematic alcohol use. Structural equation modelling was used to analyze questionnaire data from 877 participants (77.3% women). â€˜Feeling fatâ€™ explained significant variance in the relationship between COVID-19-related distress and both binge eating and restriction. Emotion dysregulation moderated the strength of these relationships. However, â€˜feeling fatâ€™s role in the relationship between pandemic-related distress and negative psychological outcomes was not unique to eating pathology and did not vary based upon emotion dysregulation. Individuals with elevated emotion dysregulation are more likely to report eating pathology, but not other outcomes, when experiencing increased â€˜feeling fatâ€™. In contrast, â€˜feeling fatâ€™ underlies the relationship between COVID-19-related distress and transdiagnostic psychological outcomes, meaning â€˜feeling fatâ€™ should be considered a risk for psychopathology beyond eating disorders.","Adrienne Mehak et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E003D-8D8-D1F","20220130","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Feeding and Eating Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; emotion dysregulation; eating pathology; psychopathology; covid-19; feeling fat","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-31","",26261,""
