"High School Sports During the CoVID-19 Pandemic: The Impact of Sport Participation on the Health of Adolescents","During the fall of 2020, some high schools across the US allowed their students to participate in interscholastic sports while others cancelled or postponed their sport programs due to concerns regarding COVID-19 transmission. It is unknown what effect this has had on the physical and mental health of adolescents. Identify the impact of playing a sport during the COVID-19 pandemic on the health of student athletes. Cross-sectional study. Sample recruited via email. 559 STATE-XXX high school athletes (age=15.7Ã‚Â±1.2 yrs., female=44%) from 44 high schools completed an online survey in October 2020. A total of 171 (31%) athletes played (PLY) a fall sport, while 388 (69%) did not play (DNP). Demographics included: sex, grade and sports played. Assessments included the General Anxiety Disorder-7 Item (GAD-7) for anxiety, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Item (PHQ-9) for depression, the Pediatric Functional Activity Brief Scale (PFABS) for physical activity, and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 (PedsQL) for quality of life. Univariable comparisons between the two groups were made via t-tests or chi-square tests. Means for each continuous outcome measure were compared between the groups by ANOVA models that controlled for Age, Sex, Teaching method (Virtual, Hybrid, or In-person), and the % of students eligible for free lunch. PLY group participants were less likely to report moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety (PLY=6.6%, DNP=44.1%, p&lt;0.001) and depression (PLY=18.2%, DNP=40.4%, p&lt;0.001). PLY athletes reported higher (better) PFABS scores (mean: [95%CI]), (PLY=23.2[22.0,24.5], DNP=16.4[15.0,17.8], p &lt;0.001) and higher (better) PedsQL total scores (PLY=88.4[85.9,90.9], DNP=79.6[76.8,82.4], p &lt;0.001). Adolescents who played a sport during the COVID-19 pandemic reported fewer symptoms of anxiety and depression, as well as higher physical activity and quality of life scores compared to adolescent athletes who did not play a sport.","McGuine, Biese, Hetzel, Schwarz, Kliethermes, Reardon, Bell, Brooks, Watson Md","https://doi.org/10.4085/1062-6050-0121.21","20210526","COVID-19; Depression; Public health; Youth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-27","",14053,""
"Examination of the impact of COVID-19 public health quarantine measures on acute mental health care services: A retrospective observational study","This study assesses for the impact of Covid-19 public health quarantine measures on acute care psychiatric admissions, by comparing admission data from the quarantine period to a comparator period. A chart review was conducted for all admissions to an urban acute care psychiatric centre from Mar 22 - June 5 2020 (quarantine) and January 5 - Mar 21 2020 (comparator). Data was collected on the number of admissions, demographics, patients' psychiatric history, characteristics of admissions, discharge information, patients' substance use and social factors. Data was analyzed using a student's t-test for continuous variables and Chi squared analyses for categorical variables. Results demonstrated 185 admissions during quarantine and 190 during the comparator, with no significant differences in the distribution of admissions across time periods. There was a significantly greater frequency of admissions in the 35-44 age bracket and admissions involving substance use during quarantine. Additionally, admissions during quarantine were significantly shorter, with increased frequency of involuntary status and use of seclusion. The data suggests a vulnerability specific to individuals in their 30-40s during quarantine and demonstrates a need to better understand factors impacting this group. It also suggests that quarantine is associated with changes to substance use, potentiating high acuity illness requiring admission.","Nejati, Crocker, Kolajova, Morrison, Simon, Sridharan, Tibbo","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113999","20210526","Inpatients; Mental disorders; Pandemics; Psychotic disorders; Substance related disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-27","",14054,""
"Evolving factors influencing consumers' attitudes towards the use of eHealth applications: implications on the future of Neom","Factors affecting the adoption and use of eHealth applications have been extensively researched from different perspectives in different regions. However, with the changing circumstances (e.g. the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic), new influencing factors might evolve and can influence the attitudes of consumers towards using eHealth applications. The purpose of this study was to identify and evaluate the evolving factors affecting consumer attitudes towards the use of eHealth applications and provide implications for the future of Neom. An online survey questionnaire was used to collect data from 976 eHealth consumers in Saudi Arabia, which included 527 male and 449 female participants. Findings were analysed using the statistical means and standard deviations for each item in the questionnaire to analyse the role of each factor in depth. Statistical t-tests were used to identify significant differences between the groups categorised by age and gender. 'Necessity but not interest' (mean 4.5 [standard deviation {SD} 1.12]) and fear (mean 4.5 [SD 1.13]) and psychological factors including depression (mean 4.4 [SD 1.54]), stress (mean 4.2 [SD 1.09]) and anxiety (mean 4.3 [SD 1.61]) were identified to be major evolving influencing factors, while other factors including performance expectancy, ease of use, enjoyment and incentives were identified to be comparatively less influential. Increasing adoption of eHealth mainly due to necessity but not out of interest can have serious implications for patients and the adoption of eHealth technologies in the future.","Algumzi","https://doi.org/10.1093/inthealth/ihab020","20210526","attitudes; digital health; eHealth; influencing factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-27","",14055,""
"Losing a Generation: The Impact of COVID-19 on Older Americans","As COVID-19 is killing untold numbers of older adults around the world, it is important to reflect on the loss of this generation. Approximately eight in 10 deaths were in people aged Ã¢â€°Â¥65 years. This is a devastating loss to our society-losses that will last long after the pandemic has run its course. Lock-downs and visitor restrictions that were meant to protect older adults created an isolation that often led to declining health. Ageist stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination are internalized by older adults as they face being devalued and viewed as a burden. Reflecting on what has been lost with the deaths of so many from this older generation can spur us to think about how society failed to protect them and to find ways to move beyond the stigma attached to being old. We have much to learn from this generation.

"Changes of evening exposure to electronic devices during the COVID-19 lockdown affect the time course of sleep disturbances","During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown, there was a worldwide increase in electronic devices' daily usage. Prolonged exposure to backlit screens before sleep influences the circadian system leading to negative consequences on sleep health. We investigated the relationship between changes in evening screen exposure and the time course of sleep disturbances during the home confinement period due to COVID-19. 2,123 Italians (mean age Ã‚Â± standard deviation, 33.1 Ã‚Â± 11.6) were tested longitudinally during the third and the seventh week of lockdown. The web-based survey evaluated sleep quality and insomnia symptoms through the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Insomnia Severity Index. The second assessment survey inquired about intervening changes in backlit screen exposure in the two hours before falling asleep. Participants who increased electronic device usage showed decreased sleep quality, exacerbated insomnia symptoms, reduced sleep duration, prolonged sleep onset latency, and delayed bedtime and rising time. In this subgroup, the prevalence of poor sleepers and individuals reporting moderate/severe insomnia symptoms increased. Conversely, respondents reporting decreased screen exposure exhibited improved sleep quality and insomnia symptoms. In this subgroup, the prevalence of poor sleepers and moderate/severe insomniacs decreased. Respondents preserving screen time habits did not show variations of the sleep parameters. Our investigation demonstrated a strong relationship between modifications of evening electronic device usage and time course of sleep disturbances during the lockdown period. Monitoring the potential impact of excessive evening exposure to backlit screens on sleep health is recommendable during the current period of restraining measures due to COVID-19.","Salfi, Amicucci, Corigliano, D'Atri, Viselli, Tempesta, Ferrara","https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsab080","20210526","COVID-19; electronic devices; evening screen exposure; insomnia; lockdown; sleep health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-27","",14058,""
"Racial/Ethnic, Social, and Geographic Trends in Overdose-Associated Cardiac Arrests Observed by US Emergency Medical Services During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Provisional records from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) through July 2020 indicate that overdose deaths spiked during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, yet more recent trends are not available, and the data are not disaggregated by month of occurrence, race/ethnicity, or other social categories. In contrast, data from emergency medical services (EMS) provide a source of information nearly in real time that may be useful for rapid and more granular surveillance of overdose mortality. To describe racial/ethnic, social, and geographic trends in EMS-observed overdose-associated cardiac arrests during the COVID-19 pandemic through December 2020 and assess the concordance with CDC-reported provisional total overdose mortality through May 2020. This cohort study included more than 11Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000 EMS agencies in 49 US states that participate in the National EMS Information System and 83.7 million EMS activations in which patient contact was made. Year and month of occurrence of overdose-associated cardiac arrest; patient race/ethnicity; census region and division; county-level urbanicity; and zip code-level racial/ethnic composition, poverty, and educational attainment. Overdose-associated cardiac arrests per 100Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000 EMS activations with patient contact in 2020 were compared with a baseline of values from 2018 and 2019. Aggregate numbers of overdose-associated cardiac arrests and percentage increases were compared with provisional total mortality in CDC records from rolling 12-month windows with end months spanning January 2018 through July 2020. Among 33.4 million EMS activations in 2020, 16.8 million (50.2%) involved female patients and 16.3 million (48.8%) involved non-Hispanic White individuals. Overdose-associated cardiac arrests were elevated by 42.1% nationally in 2020 (42.3 per 100Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000 EMS activations at baseline vs 60.1 per 100Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000 EMS activations in 2020). The highest percentage increases were seen among Latinx individuals (49.7%; 38.8 per 100Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000 activations at baseline vs 58.1 per 100Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000 activations in 2020) and Black or African American individuals (50.3%; 21.5 per 100Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000 activations at baseline vs 32.3 per 100Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000 activations in 2020), people living in more impoverished neighborhoods (46.4%; 42.0 per 100Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000 activations at baseline vs 61.5 per 100Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000 activations in 2020), and the Pacific states (63.8%; 33.1 per 100Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000 activations at baseline vs 54.2 per 100Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000 activations in 2020), despite lower rates at baseline for these groups. The EMS records were available 6 to 12 months ahead of CDC mortality figures and showed a high concordance (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.98) for months in which both data sets were available. If the historical association between EMS-observed and total overdose mortality holds true, an expected total of approximately 90Ã¢â‚¬Â¯632 (95% CI, 85Ã¢â‚¬Â¯737-95Ã¢â‚¬Â¯525) overdose deaths may eventually be reported by the CDC for 2020. In this cohort study, records from EMS agencies provided an effective manner to rapidly surveil shifts in US overdose mortality. Unprecedented overdose deaths during the pandemic necessitate investments in overdose prevention as an essential aspect of the COVID-19 response and postpandemic recovery. This is particularly urgent for more socioeconomically disadvantaged and racial/ethnic minority communities subjected to the compounded burden of disproportionate COVID-19 mortality and rising overdose deaths.","Friedman, Mann, Hansen, Bourgois, Braslow, Bui, Beletsky, Schriger","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2021.0967","20210526","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-27","",14059,""

"Psychosocial Intervention Model of Kerala, India During Pandemic COVID-19: &quot;Ottakkalla Oppamundu (You're not alone, we're with you)&quot;","Globally, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in several psychosocial manifestations across all socioeconomic strata. This study attempted to explore the details of a psychosocial support system implemented in Kerala, India, to address psychosocial issues during this pandemic. It employed a descriptive approach using qualitative and quantitative methods. The results can be summarized into 4 overarching themes: (1) process of implementation, (2) issues addressed, (3) experiences, and (4) success stories. This intervention targeted the whole population, with a specific focus on quarantined/isolated individuals and selected vulnerable groups. COVID pandemic has sowed several negative emotions, such as anxiety; and stigma and fearful thoughts, including suicidal ideations; trepidation regarding family members; and misinfodemics in general. Social and religious corollaries of the pandemic have intensified the psychological agony. The study provides an overview of the psychosocial intervention adopted by the state during the pandemic, which has helped both the beneficiaries and the providers. It has also helped to promote positive thinking and change the attitude toward the disease among the beneficiaries. It is highly commendable that timely intervention could obviate quite a few psychiatric emergencies, including suicides and aggressive behaviors. Considering its efficiency, flexibility, and sustainability, this model can be replicated in any setting.","Ravindran, Anjali Krishnan, Kiran, Mohan, Shinu","https://doi.org/10.1177/00207314211019240","20210526","corona; coronaphobia; mental health; misinfodemics; psychosocial support; quarantine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-27","",14061,""
"[Astenic disorders within the framework of post-covid syndrome]","The direct neurotropic and neurotoxic effect of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on the central nervous system, as well as the stressful effect of various factors of the COVID-19 pandemic, contribute to the development of the so-called post-COVID syndrome.

"Impact of COVID-19 on eating habits, physical activity and sleep in Brazilian healthcare professionals","During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, Brazilian healthcare professionals could have been experiencing impacts on their routine, behavior and mental health. To investigate changes in the daily life and sleeping habits of healthcare professionals in Brazil. We conducted an observational and cross-sectional study from May to July 2020. A Google Forms questionnaire was made available to Brazilian healthcare professionals on the WhatsApp mobile application and through the website of the Brazilian Hospital Services Company. The sample (n=710) was mostly composed of women (80.8%), aged between 30 and 40 years old (46.6%), predominantly physicians (41.8%) and residing mostly in the state of ParaÃƒÂ­ba (66.9%), Brazil. Approximately two-thirds of the total sample had some sleep-related complaints, 25.8% due to difficulty initiating sleep, 29.6% due to difficulty staying asleep and 32.5% due to early morning waking. From the population studied, 28.7% (n=204) reported the use of insomnia medication, and 60.3% (n=123) of these were self-medicating. Some participants reported a change in diet (n=557; 78.5%), especially related to the increase in carbohydrate intake (n=174; 24.5%), and 27% (n=192) of the individuals reported an increase of the consumption of alcoholic beverages. Of the total, 561 (81.8%) reported a change in the practice of physical activity. In this study, Brazilian healthcare professionals showed aspects of quality of life that were more affected during the COVID-19 pandemic than the prevalence seen in surveys of international studies for the general population.","Mota, Oliveira Sobrinho, Morais, Dantas","https://doi.org/10.1590/0004-282X-ANP-2020-0482","20210526","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-27","",14064,""
"Short-Term Impact of Social Distancing Measures During the COVID-19 Pandemic on Cognitive Function and Health Perception of Brazilian Older Adults: A Pre-Post Study","Social distancing, a critical measure to manage COVID-19 transmission, is consistently associated with social isolation, a major health issue. Social isolation negatively impacts mental and physical health, particularly among older adults. A pre-post comparison study examined changes in cognitive function and perceived health among 36 community-dwelling Brazilian older adults, assessed pre and post social distancing measures enacted due to COVID-19. A significant increase in cognitive function was found 1 month into social distancing (<i>M</i> = 16.3, <i>p</i> = .002, power = 0.88), with declining scores for vitality (<i>M</i> = -29.3, <i>p</i> &lt; .001, power = 0.99) and mental health (<i>M</i> = -38.1, <i>p</i> &lt; .001, power = 0.99), particularly among participants who lived alone (<i>t</i> = -3.8, <i>p</i> = .001).

Although not entirely as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, the pandemic has certainly contributed significantly to raising mental health issues across the world. What the pandemic demonstrated is the world needs to face global mental health challenges appropriately, which in turn reinforces global health. Key organisations and individuals such as the United Nations (UN) and UN Secretary General for mental health, played a major role in responding to the mental health challenges specifically resulting from Covid-19. This is demonstrated by the production of the UN Policy Briefing in May (UN 2020a)Ã‚Â and with it an accompanying statement (UN 2020b). The statement essentially emphasized that all Governments must place mental health services central in any response to the Covid-19 pandemic. It also stressed &quot;when the pandemic is brought under control, grief, anxiety and depression will continue to affect people and communities&quot;. In effect, mental health must be a central component of ongoing care.","Illingworth","https://doi.org/10.1111/jpm.12774","20210526","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-27","",14066,""
"Burnout in Portuguese physiotherapists during COVID-19 pandemic","This study described the burnout experienced by physiotherapists during the COVID-19 pandemic and analysed the role of possible factors of this occupational phenomenon. Cross-sectional study based on a web-based survey applied to physiotherapists living in Portugal. The survey included sociodemographic, health status and clinical practice questions. The Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (personal, work- and patient-related burnout), the Resilience Scale, the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales and the Satisfaction with Life Scale were used. A total of 511 physiotherapists (median 33Ã‚Â years old, 82% females) completed the survey. The participants worked mainly in private practice (50%) and wards (35%). During COVID-19, 52% were working directly with patients, but only 18% were working with COVID-19 patients. Personal (42%), work- (42%) and patient-related burnout (25%) was observed. Three significant models explained personal- (R<sup>2</sup> Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 51%), work- (R<sup>2</sup> Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 31%) and patient-related burnout (R<sup>2</sup> Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 16%). Lower levels of resilience and higher levels of depression and stress were significantly associated with personal, work- and patient-related burnout. Being female and working directly with patients were additionally associated with both personal and work-related burnout. Having health problems and working with COVID-19 patients were only associated with personal burnout. More than 40% of physiotherapists experienced personal and work-related burnout and 25% patient-related burnout, with resilience, depression and stress having a relevant role in the three burnout dimensions. Early detection and management strategies need to be implemented to address physiotherapists' physical and psychological fatigue and exhaustion.","JÃƒÂ¡come, Seixas, SerrÃƒÂ£o, Teixeira, Castro, Duarte","https://doi.org/10.1002/pri.1915","20210526","burnout; healthcare workers; rehabilitation; resilience; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-27","",14067,""
"Evaluation of anxiety, depression and sleep quality in full-time teleworkers","Mental health-related positive and negative aspects of telework are understudied. This study aimed to evaluate anxiety, depression and sleep quality in full-time teleworkers during lockdown imposed by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and explore potential relationships between these variables, sociodemographic characteristics, quality of life and perceived productivity. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 143 full-time teleworkers. Participants were assessed for anxiety, depression and sleep quality using validated clinical instruments. This study found a high prevalence of poor sleep quality (74%, NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 106). Participants reported anxiety/depressive symptoms with the predominance of anxiety and very high levels of sleep impairment. Better sleep quality was associated with longer sleep duration and better job satisfaction, whereas the use of hypnotic medication and higher depression/anxiety scores seem to point a correlation with sleep impairment. Anxiety/depression positively correlated with worse sleep quality and negatively associated with quality of life. Male sex was negatively associated with perceived productivity. A higher prevalence of poor sleep quality was found in comparison with other studies performed during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as high levels of anxiety and depression. These results highlight the relevance of considering the potential negative impact of telework on mental health.","Afonso, Fonseca, Teodoro","https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdab164","20210526","COVID-19; mental health; occupational health; psychiatry; sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-27","",14068,""

"Perceived COVID-19 health threat increases psychological distress among Black Americans","The present study used data from the American Trends Panel to examine the interplay between the perceived COVID-19 health threat, discriminatory beliefs in medical settings, and psychological distress among Black Americans. We measured psychological distress as an average of five items modified from two established scales and used self-reports of perceived COVID-19 health threat and beliefs about discrimination in medical settings as focal predictors. Ordinary least squares regression was used to examine these relationships. Holding all else constant, we found that perceived COVID-19 health threat and the belief that Black Americans face racial discrimination in medical settings were both positively and significantly associated with higher levels of psychological distress. We also found a significant perceived COVID-19 health threat by belief about discrimination in medical settings interaction in the full model.

"Mental health and suicidal ideation in US military veterans with histories of COVID-19 infection","There have been reports of increased prevalence in psychiatric conditions in non-veteran survivors of COVID-19. To date, however, no known study has examined the prevalence, risk and protective factors of psychiatric conditions among US military veterans who survived COVID-19. Data were analysed from the 2019 to 2020 National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study, which surveyed a nationally representative, prospective cohort of 3078 US veterans. Prepandemic and 1-year peripandemic risk and protective factors associated with positive screens for peripandemic internalising (major depressive, generalised anxiety and/or posttraumatic stress disorders) and externalising psychiatric disorders (alcohol and/or drug use disorders) and suicidal ideation were examined using bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. A total of 233 veterans (8.6%) reported having been infected with COVID-19. Relative to veterans who were not infected, veterans who were infected were more likely to screen positive for internalising disorders (20.5% vs 13.9%, p=0.005), externalising disorders (23.2% vs 14.8%, p=0.001) and current suicidal ideation (12.0% vs 7.6%, p=0.015) at peripandemic. Multivariable analyses revealed that greater prepandemic psychiatric symptom severity and COVID-related stressors were the strongest independent predictors of peripandemic internalising disorders, while prepandemic trauma burden was protective. Prepandemic suicidal ideation, greater loneliness and lower household income were the strongest independent predictors of peripandemic suicidal ideation, whereas prepandemic community integration was protective. Psychiatric symptoms and suicidal ideation are prevalent in veterans who have survived COVID-19. Veterans with greater prepandemic psychiatric and substance use problems, COVID-related stressors and fewer psychosocial resources may be at increased risk of these outcomes.","Na, Tsai, Harpaz-Rotem, Pietrzak","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjmilitary-2021-001846","20210526","adult psychiatry; depression &amp; mood disorders; epidemiology; mental health; substance misuse; suicide &amp; self-harm","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-27","",14072,""

The EuroQol group five dimensions three level (EQ-5D-3L) to measure the QoL of survivors of COVID-19, and the Family Reported Outcome Measure (FROM-16) to assess the impact on their partner/family member's QoL. The survey was completed by 735 COVID-19 survivors (mean age=48 years; females=563) at a mean of 12.8 weeks after diagnosis and by 571 partners and 164 family members (n=735; mean age=47 years; females=246) from Europe (50.6%), North America (38.5%) and rest of the world (10.9%). The EQ-5D mean score for COVID-19 survivors was 8.65 (SD=1.9, median=9; range=6-14). 81.1% (596/735) reported pain and discomfort, 79.5% (584/735) problems with usual activities, 68.7% (505/735) anxiety and depression and 56.2% (413/735) problems with mobility. Hospitalised survivors (20.1%, n=148) and survivors with existing health conditions (30.9%, n=227) reported significantly more problems with mobility and usual activities (p&lt;0.05), with hospitalised also experiencing more impact on self-care (pÃ¢â€°Â¤0.001).

We sought to assess the risks and benefits of different respiratory support strategies, employed in intensive care units during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic on intubation and intensive care unit (ICU) mortality rates. Subanalysis of a prospective, multinational registry of critically ill COVID-19 patients. Patients were subclassified into standard oxygen therapy Ã¢â€°Â¥10 L/min (SOT), high-flow oxygen therapy (HFNC), noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NIV), and early IMV, according to the respiratory support strategy employed at the day of admission to ICU. Propensity score matching was performed to ensure comparability between groups. Initially, 1421 patients were assessed for possible study inclusion. Of these, 351 patients (85 SOT, 87 HFNC, 87 NIV, and 92 IMV) remained eligible for full analysis after propensity score matching. 55% of patients initially receiving noninvasive respiratory support required IMV. The intubation rate was lower in patients initially ventilated with HFNC and NIV compared to those who received SOT (SOT: 64%, HFNC: 52%, NIV: 49%, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.025). Compared to the other respiratory support strategies, NIV was associated with a higher overall ICU mortality (SOT: 18%, HFNC: 20%, NIV: 37%, IMV: 25%, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.016). In this cohort of critically ill patients with COVID-19, a trial of HFNC appeared to be the most balanced initial respiratory support strategy, given the reduced intubation rate and comparable ICU mortality rate. Nonetheless, considering the uncertainty and stress associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, SOT and early IMV represented safe initial respiratory support strategies. The presented findings, in agreement with classic ARDS literature, suggest that NIV should be avoided whenever possible due to the elevated ICU mortality risk.","Wendel Garcia, Aguirre-Bermeo, Buehler, Alfaro-Farias, Yuen, David, Tschoellitsch, Wengenmayer, Korsos, Fogagnolo, Kleger, Wu, Colombo, Turrini, Potalivo, Rezoagli, RodrÃƒÂ­guez-GarcÃƒÂ­a, Castro, Lander-Azcona, MartÃƒÂ­n-Delgado, Lozano-GÃƒÂ³mez, Ensner, Michot, Gehring, Schott, Siegemund, Merki, Wiegand, Jeitziner, Laube, Salomon, Hillgaertner, Dullenkopf, Ksouri, Cereghetti, Grazioli, BÃƒÂ¼rkle, Marrel, Fleisch, Perez, Baltussen Weber, Ceruti, Marquardt, HÃƒÂ¼bner, Redecker, Studhalter, Stephan, Selz, Pietsch, Ristic, Heise, Meyer Zu Bentrup, Franchitti Laurent, Fodor, Gaspert, Haberthuer, Colak, Heuberger, Fumeaux, Montomoli, Guerci, Schuepbach, Hilty, Roche-Campo, Wendel Garcia, Aguirre-Bermeo, Buehler, Alfaro-Farias, Yuen, David, Tschoellitsch, Wengenmayer, Korsos, Fogagnolo, Kleger, Wu, Colombo, Turrini, Potalivo, Rezoagli, RodrÃƒÂ­guez-GarcÃƒÂ­a, Castro, Lander-Azcona, MartÃƒÂ­n-Delgado, Lozano-GÃƒÂ³mez, Ensner, Michot, Gehring, Schott, Siegemund, Merki, Wiegand, Jeitziner, Laube, Salomon, Hillgaertner, Dullenkopf, Ksouri, Cereghetti, Grazioli, BÃƒÂ¼rkle, Marrel, Fleisch, Perez, Baltussen Weber, Ceruti, Marquardt, HÃƒÂ¼bner, Redecker, Studhalter, Stephan, Selz, Pietsch, Ristic, Heise, Meyer Zu Bentrup, Franchitti Laurent, Fodor, Gaspert, Haberthuer, Colak, Heuberger, Fumeaux, Montomoli, Guerci, Schuepbach, Hilty, Roche-Campo, Algaba-Calderon, Apolo, Aslanidis, Babik, Boroli, Brem, Brenni, Brugger, Camen, Catena, Ceriani, Chau, Christ, Cogliati, Concha, Delahaye, Drvaric, EscÃƒÂ³s-Orta, Fabbri, Facondini, Filipovic, GÃƒÂ¡mez-Zapata, Gerecke, Gommers, Hillermann, Ince, Jenni-Moser, Jovic, Jurkolow, Klarer, Lambert, Laurent, Lavanchy, Lienhardt-Nobbe, Locher, Losser, Lussman, Magliocca, Margarit, MartÃƒÂ­nez, Mauri, Mayor-VÃƒÂ¡zquez, Meier, Moret-Bochatay, Murrone, Naon, Neff, Novy, Petersen, Pugin, Ramelet, Rilinger, Rimensberger, Sepulcri, Shaikh, Sieber, Simonini, Spadaro, Sridharan, Stahl, Staudacher, Taboada-Fraga, Tellez, Urech, Vitale, Vizmanos-Lamotte, Welte, Zalba-Etayo, Zellweger","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13054-021-03580-y","20210526","ARDS; COVID-19; High flow oxygen therapy; Invasive mechanical ventilation; Noninvasive mechanical ventilation; Patient self-inflicted lung injury; Respiratory support; Standard oxygen therapy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-27","",14077,""
"Prevalence and correlates of anxiety and depression in frontline healthcare workers treating people with COVID-19 in Bangladesh","Healthcare workers (HCWs) who are in the frontline during the COVID-19 pandemic are often under significant pressures that may predispose them to symptoms of poor mental health. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of anxiety and depression among HCWs and factors correlated with mental health concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh.Ã‚Â And, it also aimedÃ‚Â to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Bangla version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). A cross-sectional survey was conducted between July and August, 2020. A self-reported online questionnaire was utilized to collect data. The survey included questions concerning socio-demographic, lifestyle, and work setting, as well as the HADS.Ã‚Â A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and multiple linear regression analysis were performed. Data from 803 HCWs (50.7% male; mean age: 27.3 [SDÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 6.9]; age range: 18-58 years) were included in the finalÃ‚Â analysis.Ã‚Â The Bangla HADS was psychometrically sound, and demonstrated good internal consistency and reliability (ÃŽÂ± = 0.83), and excellent construct validity. Prevalence estimates of anxiety and depression were 69.5%, and 39.5%, respectively, for less severe symptomology (at least borderline abnormal), and 41.2% and 15.7% for more severe (at least abnormal) symptomology. Regression analyses with the total HADS score as a dependent variable revealed significant (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.05) associations with female gender, moderate and poor health status, infrequent physical exercising, smoking, having had regrets about one's profession because of the pandemic and associated experiences, not updating on the latest COVID-19-related research, experiencing discrimination in the workplace, and facing social problems due to working in a lab or hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic. Symptoms of anxiety and depression are prevalent among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. The findings suggest a need for screening for mental health concerns, and employing early intervention to help these individuals.","Tasnim, Sujan, Islam, Ritu, Siddique, Toma, Nowshin, Hasan, Hossain, Nahar, Islam, Islam, Potenza, van Os","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03243-w","20210526","Anxiety; Bangladesh; COVID-19; Depression; Healthcare workers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-27","",14078,""
"Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children","Early reports suggested that pediatric COVID-19 cases were less severe in children. Most children requiring intensive care admission in these reports had underlying medical conditions. Shortly after the surge of adult COVID-19 cases in Detroit, Michigan, previously healthy children began to present with shock with multiorgan dysfunction, elevated inflammatory markers, and physical exam findings with features of Kawasaki disease. This disease process was later called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C.) In this case series, we describe three previously healthy children who presented with severe manifestations of MIS-C, including cardiogenic shock and profound systemic inflammation. These children developed severely depressed myocardial function with end-organ injury and were cannulated to veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) due to cardiogenic shock with arrhythmia. All three children improved with VA-ECMO support and anti-inflammatory treatment. All had complete recovery of myocardial function at discharge and 6-month follow-up with no significant morbidity.","Schneider, Tilford, Safa, Dentel, Veenstra, Ang, Cashen","https://doi.org/10.1177/02676591211020904","20210526","COVID-19; ECMO; MIS-C; cardiogenic shock; pediatrics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-27","",14079,""
"Depression, anxiety and stress among Swedish university students before and during six months of the COVID-19 pandemic: A cohort study","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound effect on societies and citizens worldwide, raising concerns about potential mental health impacts. We aimed to describe trajectories of depression, anxiety and stress symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak compared to before the outbreak, and to determine if trajectories were modified by pre-pandemic loneliness, poor sleep quality and mental health problems. We conducted a cohort study with 1836 Swedish university students entering the study before 13 March 2020, the onset of the pandemic, with follow-ups within three (FU1) and six months (FU2) of the outbreak. Generalized Estimating Equations were used to estimate mean differences in symptom levels over time-periods, and to estimate potential effect modifications. We found small differences in mean levels of the depression, anxiety and stress scale (DASS-21) over time. Compared to before the pandemic, depression increased by 0.25 points of 21 (95% CI: 0.04 to -0.45) at FU1 and decreased by 0.75/21 (95% CI:-0.97 to -0.53) at FU2. Anxiety decreased from baseline to FU1 by 0.09/21 (95% CI: -0.24 to -0.07) and by 0.77/21 (95% CI: -0.93 to -0.61) to FU2. Stress decreased from baseline to FU1 by 0.30/21 (95% CI: -0.52 to -0.09) and by 1.32/21 (95% CI: -1.55 to -1.09) to FU2. Students with pre-pandemic loneliness, poor sleep quality or pre-pandemic mental health problems did not have worse trajectories of mean mental health symptoms. Symptom levels were relatively stable during the first three months of the pandemic, while there was a slight decrease during the summer months, probably due to seasonality effects.","Johansson, CÃƒÂ´tÃƒÂ©, Hogg-Johnson, Rudman, Holm, Grotle, Jensen, Sundberg, Edlund, Skillgate","https://doi.org/10.1177/14034948211015814","20210526","COVID-19; Depression; Sweden; anxiety; coronavirus; mental health; stress; students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-27","",14080,""
"Vicarious Racism and Vigilance During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Mental Health Implications Among Asian and Black Americans","Experiences of vicarious racism-hearing about racism directed toward one's racial group or racist acts committed against other racial group members-and vigilance about racial discrimination have been salient during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study examined vicarious racism and vigilance in relation to symptoms of depression and anxiety among Asian and Black Americans. We used data from a cross-sectional study of 604 Asian American and 844 Black American adults aged Ã¢â€°Â¥18 in the United States recruited from 5 US cities from May 21 through July 15, 2020. Multivariable linear regression models examined levels of depression and anxiety by self-reported vicarious racism and vigilance. Controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, among both Asian and Black Americans, greater self-reported vicarious racism was associated with more symptoms of depression (Asian: <i>ÃŽÂ²</i> = 1.92 [95% CI, 0.97-2.87]; Black: <i>ÃŽÂ²</i> = 1.72 [95% CI, 0.95-2.49]) and anxiety (Asian: <i>ÃŽÂ²</i> = 2.40 [95% CI, 1.48-3.32]; Black: <i>ÃŽÂ²</i> = 1.98 [95% CI, 1.17-2.78]). Vigilance was also positively related to symptoms of depression (Asian: <i>ÃŽÂ²</i> = 1.54 [95% CI, 0.58-2.50]; Black: <i>ÃŽÂ²</i> = 0.90 [95% CI, 0.12-1.67]) and anxiety (Asian: <i>ÃŽÂ²</i> = 1.98 [95% CI, 1.05-2.91]; Black: <i>ÃŽÂ²</i> = 1.64 [95% CI, 0.82-2.45]). Mental health problems are a pressing concern during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results from our study suggest that heightened racist sentiment, harassment, and violence against Asian and Black Americans contribute to increased risk of depression and anxiety via vicarious racism and vigilance. Public health efforts during this period should address endemic racism as well as COVID-19.","Chae, Yip, Martz, Chung, Richeson, Hajat, Curtis, Rogers, LaVeist","https://doi.org/10.1177/00333549211018675","20210526","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; vicarious racism; vigilance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-27","",14081,""
