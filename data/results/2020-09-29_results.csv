This paper reports on experience with the emergency organization of the volunteer and collaborative Working Group (GT, in Portuguese) on mental health and psychosocial care aimed at producing rapid responses for health services in the context of COVID-19. The study involved the identification and systematization of current evidence in the scientific literature on mental health and psychosocial care in public health emergencies and pandemics, with the establishment of a network involving 117 researchers and 25 institutions, and the organization of themes for the elaboration of materials, referenced on the response phases in public health emergencies and pandemics. In less than 60 days, 18 technical documents were produced, ranging from services organization and management for different vulnerable groups. The materials became references in health institutions and services. A national course on mental health and psychosocial care in COVID-19 was also organized, with more than 60,000 people registered. The experience provides food for thought and a contribution for future experiences involving knowledge translation in the current pandemic and in future public health emergencies and pandemics, with the following: (1) combination of volunteer and collaborative work involving professionals with experience in the organization of services and care in past events; (2) reliance on institutional support and resources; (3) speed and credibility of work involving the establishment of networks of professionals and institutions; and (4) responses to the urgent needs with the capacity to shape paths for care in mental health and psychosocial care.","Kabad, Juliana Fernandes; Noal, DÃ©bora da Silva; Passos, Maria Fabiana Damasio; Melo, Bernardo Dolabella; Pereira, Daphne Rodrigues; Serpeloni, Fernanda; Souza, Michele Souza E; Kadri, Michele Rocha El; Lima, Carolyne Cesar; Magrin, Nicolly Papacidero; Freitas, Carlos Machado","http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&nrm=iso&lng=pt&tlng=pt&pid=S0102-311X2020000906001; http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&nrm=iso&lng=pt&tlng=pt&pid=S0102-311X2020000906001","","Country: BR; BRASIL; BRAZIL; BRASIL; BRESIL; BRASILE; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Cad Saude Publica;36(9): e00132120, 2020.; Publication details: Cad Saude Publica;36(9): e00132120, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-29","",5290,""
"Targeting the endolysosomal host-SARS-CoV-2 interface by clinically licensed functional inhibitors of acid sphingomyelinase (FIASMA) including the antidepressant fluoxetine","The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Related Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a global health emergency. As only very limited therapeutic options are clinically available, there is an urgent need for the rapid development of safe, effective, and globally available pharmaceuticals that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry and ameliorate COVID-19 severity. In this study, we explored the use of small compounds acting on the homeostasis of the endolysosomal host-pathogen interface, to fight SARS-CoV-2 infection. We find that fluoxetine, a widely used antidepressant and a functional inhibitor of acid sphingomyelinase (FIASMA), efficiently inhibited the entry and propagation of SARS-CoV-2 in the cell culture model without cytotoxic effects and also exerted potent antiviral activity against two currently circulating influenza A virus subtypes, an effect which was also observed upon treatment with the FIASMAs amiodarone and imipramine. Mechanistically, fluoxetine induced both impaired endolysosomal acidification and the accumulation of cholesterol within the endosomes. As the FIASMA group consists of a large number of small compounds that are well-tolerated and widely used for a broad range of clinical applications, exploring these licensed pharmaceuticals may offer a variety of promising antivirals for host-directed therapy to counteract enveloped viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and COVID 19.","Schloer, Sebastian; Brunotte, Linda; Goretzko, Jonas; Mecate-Zambrano, Angeles; Korthals, Nadia; Gerke, Volker; Ludwig, Stephan; Rescher, Ursula","https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2020.1829082","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Emerg Microbes Infect;: 1-26, 2020 Sep 25.; Publication details: Emerg Microbes Infect;: 1-26, 2020 Sep 25.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-29","",5291,""
"COVID-19 pandemic- knowledge, perception, anxiety and depression among frontline doctors of Pakistan","BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a global pandemic and has become a major public health burden worldwide. With already fragile healthcare systems it can have long lasting effects in developing countries. Outbreaks especially a pandemic situation evokes fear related behaviors among healthcare professionals and there is always an increased risk of mental health disorders. Therefore, this study aims to determine knowledge and perception about this pandemic, prevalence and factors associated with anxiety/depression among frontline physicians of Pakistan. METHODS: Data were collected through an online survey released in the last week of March-2020. 389 frontline physicians from all four provinces and 65 cities of Pakistan participated. Survey questionnaire consisted of 4 parts including informed consent section, demographic section, knowledge and perception about COVID-19 pandemic and assessment of depression through World Health Organization Self-reporting questionnaire (SRQ-20). A score of 8 or above on SRQ-20 was used as cut-off to label the participant as depressed. Data was analyzed using SPSS version22. RESULTS: A 43% prevalence of anxiety/depression among frontline physicians of Pakistan was reported. Almost all the doctors had moderate to high knowledge score. Majority of participants marked N-95 mask as ""essential"" during aerosol generating procedures, assessing patients with respiratory symptoms, in COVID patient-care area, ER triage and direct care of COVID-19 patient. Only 12% of the doctors were fully satisfied with the provision of PPEs and almost 94% felt unprotected. In multivariable model, assessing more than five COVID suspects/day (aOR = 2.73, 95% CI: 1.65-4.52), working 20 h/week or less (aOR = 2.11, 1.27-3.49), having children among household members (aOR = 1.58, 95% CI: 1.00-2.50) and moderate to low knowledge of the infection (aOR = 2.69, 95% CI: 1.68-4.31) were found to be independent predictors of anxiety/depression among physicians. CONCLUSION: Anxiety/depression among more than a third of frontline doctors of Pakistan warrants the need to address mental health of doctors caring for patients during this pandemic; control modifiable factors associated with it and explore the effectiveness of interventions to promote psychological well-being of physicians.","Amin, Faridah; Sharif, Salman; Saeed, Rabeeya; Durrani, Noureen; Jilani, Daniyal","https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12888-020-02864-x","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMC Psychiatry;20(1): 459, 2020 09 23.; Publication details: BMC Psychiatry;20(1): 459, 2020 09 23.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-29","",5292,""
"Depression, stress, anxiety and their predictors in Iranian pregnant women during the outbreak of COVID-19","BACKGROUND: Pregnancy as a sensitive period of a woman's life can be affected by various psychological factors that can have adverse effects on the woman, her fetus and future baby. Since COVID-19 is a new phenomenon with limited information available, it may have adverse psychological effects on pregnant women. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the status of depression, stress, anxiety and their predictors in Iranian pregnant women during the outbreak of COVID-19. METHODS: This descriptive-analytical cross-sectional study was performed on 205 pregnant women covered by Tabriz health centers in Iran. The sampling method used was cluster sampling. The data collection tool was the socio-demographic characteristics questionnaire and the DASS-21 (Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21), which were completed online by pregnant women. The general linear model was used to determine the predictive factors of depression, anxiety and stress. RESULTS: The mean (SD) score of depression, stress, and anxiety were 3.91 (3.9), 6.22 (4.25), and 3.79 (3.39), respectively; the score range of 0 to 21. Depression, stress, and anxiety symptoms were observed in 32.7, 32.7, and 43.9% of the participants, respectively, with varying degrees from mild to very severe. Based on the adjusted general linear model, variables of education level, spouse's job and marital life satisfaction were the predictors of depressive symptoms. Variables of spouse's education level, spouse's support, marital life satisfaction and the number of pregnancies were the predictive factors of anxiety symptoms and the variables of spouse's education level, household income sufficiency, spouse's support and marital life satisfaction were predictors of stress symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the role of marital life satisfaction, high level of spouse's education and income in reducing symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression in pregnant women in critical situations such as the prevalence of COVID-19, it seems that using strategies to promote marital life satisfaction and socio-economic status can play an effective role in controlling anxiety and reducing stress and depression in pregnant women.","Effati-Daryani, Fatemeh; Zarei, Somayeh; Mohammadi, Azam; Hemmati, Elnaz; Ghasemi Yngyknd, Sakineh; Mirghafourvand, Mojgan","https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40359-020-00464-8","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMC Psychol;8(1): 99, 2020 Sep 22.; Publication details: BMC Psychol;8(1): 99, 2020 Sep 22.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-29","",5293,""
"Prevalence of Perceived Stress, Anxiety, Depression, and Obsessive-Compulsive Symptoms in Health Care Workers and Other Workers in Alberta During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-Sectional Survey","BACKGROUND: During pandemics, effective containment and mitigation measures may also negatively influence psychological stability. As knowledge about COVID-19 rapidly evolves, global implementation of containment and mitigation measures has varied greatly, with impacts to mental wellness. Assessing the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health needs of health care workers and other workers may help mitigate mental health impacts and secure sustained delivery of health care and other essential goods and services. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the self-reported prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms in health care workers and other workers seeking support through Text4Hope, an evidence-based SMS text messaging service supporting the mental health of residents of Alberta, Canada, during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey gathered demographic (age, gender, ethnicity, education, relationship, housing and employment status, employment type, and isolation status) and clinical characteristics using validated tools (self-reported stress, anxiety, depression, and contamination/hand hygiene obsessive-compulsive symptoms). Descriptive statistics and chi-square analysis were used to compare the clinical characteristics of health care workers and other workers. Post hoc analysis was conducted on variables with >3 response categories using adjusted residuals. Logistic regression determined associations between worker type and likelihood of self-reported symptoms of moderate or high stress, generalized anxiety disorder, and major depressive disorder, while controlling for other variables. RESULTS: Overall, 8267 surveys were submitted by 44,992 Text4Hope subscribers (19.39%). Of these, 5990 respondents were employed (72.5%), 958 (11.6%) were unemployed, 454 (5.5%) were students, 559 (6.8%) were retired, 234 (2.8%) selected ""other,"" and 72 (0.9%) did not indicate their employment status. Most employed survey respondents were female (n=4621, 86.2%). In the general sample, the 6-week prevalence rates for moderate or high stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms were 85.6%, 47.0%, and 44.0%, respectively. Self-reported symptoms of moderate or high stress, anxiety, and depression were all statistically significantly higher in other workers than in health care workers (P<.001). Other workers reported higher obsessive-compulsive symptoms (worry about contamination and compulsive handwashing behavior) after the onset of the pandemic (P<.001), while health care worker symptoms were statistically significantly higher before and during the COVID-19 pandemic (P<.001). This finding should be interpreted with caution, as it is unclear the extent to which the adaptive behavior of health care workers or the other workers might be misclassified by validated tools during a pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Assessing symptoms of prevalent stress, anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive behavior in health care workers and other workers may enhance our understanding of COVID-19 mental health needs. Research is needed to understand more fully the relationship between worker type, outbreak phase, and mental health changes over time, as well as the utility of validated tools in health care workers and other workers during pandemics. Our findings underscore the importance of anticipating and mitigating the mental health effects of pandemics using integrated implementation strategies. Finally, we demonstrate the ease of safely and rapidly assessing mental health needs using an SMS text messaging platform during a pandemic.

"Early experiences of radiographers in Ireland during the COVID-19 crisis","Imaging is crucial for assessing the severity and progression of COVID-19. Radiographers are amongst the first-line health professionals that may be exposed to infected persons. This work describes the early experience of radiographers in Ireland to the impact of COVID-19 using two electronic surveys distributed 6 weeks apart. Results were analysed using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. A total of 370 responded to the first survey and 276 the second, with all six Irish health regions represented. Three quarters of radiographers (77%) reported having adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) available to them. However, almost half of the radiographers were inadvertently exposed to COVID-19-positive patients without appropriate PPE, largely attributed to poor communication and testing. Anxiety levels while initially high, reduced substantially 6 weeks into the crisis period. However, obvious distress was noted amongst some respondents. Forty percent of radiographers reported burnout symptoms due to the COVID-19 crisis and 30% reported considering changing jobs or retiring since the COVID-19 outbreak. Clear communication regarding changing protocols and importantly patients' infectious status are essential to safeguard healthcare workers and to minimise unnecessary anxiety and distress. Attention is required to staff mental health including the identification of burnout symptoms to prevent long-term negative consequences of the pandemic on radiography services.","Foley, O'Loughlin, Creedon","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13244-020-00910-6","20200928","Burnout; COVID-19; Coronavirus; Infection control; Radiographers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-29","",5295,""

"Applying Psychotherapeutic Principles to Bolster Resilience Among Health Care Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the entire globe with overwhelming speed and impact. The pandemic is both highly threatening and poorly understood, typical of deeply distressing conditions. Stress associated with uncertain recommendations from authorities, fear of illness and contagion for oneself and one's loved ones, extended periods of isolation, moral conflicts, financial instability, perception of discrimination and/or stigma, and ongoing loss and grief imperil mental health and resilience among the general population and high-risk groups. Health care workers (HCWs) face additional challenges that increase their vulnerability to distress and burnout. Bolstering resilience among HCWs can allow them to continue working with the intensity and focus their jobs require, which in turn supports the overall functioning of the health care system. Given their training in understanding wellness, distress, and psychotherapeutic treatment, mental health clinicians are well positioned to respond to this need. By studying the lessons from past and present experiences with public health emergencies and by incorporating principles from psychotherapeutic literature and training, clinicians can help facilitate an informed and effective response. The goal of this article is to discuss the development of a resilience coaching model that is rooted in principles from psychotherapeutic literature and practice to support psychological well-being among hospital-based HCWs. This model, developed to support the authors' health care colleagues working in a Toronto hospital, is generalizable, can be adapted for use by any mental health clinician, and makes explicit how previous training in psychotherapy may be applied to coaching and supporting frontline HCWs.","Rosen, Preisman, Hunter, Maunder","https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.psychotherapy.20200020","20200928","Activities Therapy; Coaching; Consultation/Liaison Psychiatry; Mental Health Care Service Delivery Systems; Psychotherapy; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-29","",5297,""
"Parenting Stress During the COVID-19 Outbreak: Socioeconomic and Environmental Risk Factors and Implications for Children Emotion Regulation","The COVID-19 outbreak imposed to Italian families many changes in their daily life increasing the risk of developing psychological problems. The present study explored risk factors associated with parenting stress and implications for children's emotion regulation in families with different socioeconomic risks. Parents of 2-14Ã‚Â years old children completed a survey reporting difficulties experienced due to the lockdown, level of household chaos, parenting stress, parent involvement in the child's daily life, and children emotion regulation competences. The general mean levels of parenting stress and children emotion regulation abilities were not at clinical level compared with Italian norms. Household chaos predicted higher levels of parenting stress, which, in turn, was associated with less effective emotion regulation in children through the mediating role of parental involvement. More stressed parents were less involved in their children's activities, decreasing children's effective emotion regulation. Only for SES no-risk families, the lockdown constraints increased parenting stress. For SES at-risk families, the impact of parenting stress and involvement on children regulation strategies was stronger, with a protective role played by parental involvement on children's negativity not evident for SES no-risk families. Dealing with the lockdown is a stressful experience for parents who have to balance personal life, work, and children upbringing, without other help. This situation potentially impairs their ability to be supportive caregivers and is consequently detrimental for children well-being. Policies should take into consideration the implications of the lockdown for families' mental health and tailor supportive interventions according to family's risk factors.","Spinelli, Lionetti, Setti, Fasolo","https://doi.org/10.1111/famp.12601","20200928","COVID-19; Children; Children Emotion Regulation; Parenting Stress; Parents; Quarantine; SES risk","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-29","",5298,""

"[Qualitative study on working experience of COVID-19 care nurses]","To study the working experience of COVID-19 care nurses. Twenty two nurses taking care of COVID-19 patients were interviewed by means of descriptive phenomenology. All the data were transcribed and recorded, and then processed into WORD documents.

Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used. The calls related to pandemic were divided into four categories: medical, psychological, information and the others. The secondary categories of psychological calls were determined by text analysis. The number of calls were calculated weekly and the number of various types of calls over time were analyzed. We used stratified random sampling method to extract 600 cases of all kinds of calls related to pandemic and conducted a semantic analysis, through marking new, similar combination to form a feature set, then summed up the call content characteristics of each stage. Two hundred callers were followed up to understand how they felt about the call process in four aspects: the waiting time, call duration, the degree of problem-solving and the way to end the call. In a total of 13 746 calls, 8978 were related to pandemic, among which 12.59%(1130/8978) were about medical issues, 26.50%(2379/8978) were about mental health, 27.18%(2440/8978) were about information regarding the pandemic and 33.74%(3029/8978) were about other pandemic related issues. Pandemic situation, relevant policy release, frequency of advertising campaigns were predictors of the number of calls per day during the pandemic (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05 or <i>P</i>&lt;0.01). The number of calls differed by gender and identities of callers (both <i>P</i>&lt;0.05). Finally 181 callers accepted telephone follow-up. Among them, 51.38%(93/181) of the callers thought that the waiting time was too long, 33.15%(60/181) of the callers thought that the call time was insufficient, 80.66%(146/181) of callers believed that the hotline could partially or completely resolve their concerns, and 39.23%(71/181) of the callers said the operator proposed to end the call. s The changes of the number and content of the mental health assistance hotline calls reflected that the public mental health status experienced four stages during the pandemic: confusion, panic, boredom, and adjustment. The specialized mental health assistance hotlines should be further strengthened, and the efficiency should be improved. Mental health interventions should be tailored and adopted according to the characteristics of the public mental health status at different stages of the pandemic.","Wang, Xu, Xu, Zhang, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.3785/j.issn.1008-9292.2020.08.05","20200928","Coronavirus disease 2019; Psychology; Public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-29","",5301,""
"Fear of Covid-19, psychological distress, work satisfaction and turnover intention among frontline nurses","To examine the relative influence of fear of COVID-19 on nurses' psychological distress, work satisfaction and intent to leave their organisation and the profession. The emergence of COVID-19 has significantly impacted the psychological and mental well-being of frontline healthcare workers, including nurses. To date, no studies have been conducted examining how this fear of COVID-19 contributes to health, well-being and work outcomes in frontline nurses. This is a cross-sectional research design involving 261 frontline nurses in the Philippines. Five standardised scales were used for data collection. Overall, the composite score of the fear of COVID-19 scale was 19.92. Job role and attendance of COVID-19-related training predicted fear of COVID-19. An increased level of fear of COVID-19 was associated with decreased job satisfaction, increased psychological distress, and increased organisational and professional turnover intentions. Frontline nurses who reported not having attended COVID-19-related training and those who held part-time job roles reported increased fears of COVID-19. Addressing the fear of COVID-19 may result in improved job outcomes in frontline nurses, such as increased job satisfaction, decreased stress levels and lower intent to leave the organisation and the profession. Organisational measures are vital to support the mental health of nurses and address their fear of COVID-19 through peer and social support, psychological and mental support services (e.g., counselling or psychotherapy), provision of training related to COVID-19, and accurate and regular information updates.","Labrague, de Los Santos","https://doi.org/10.1111/jonm.13168","20200928","COVID-19; coronavirus; fear; job satisfaction; nursing; psychological distress; turnover intention","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-29","",5302,""
"The Impact of COVID-19-based Suspension of Surgeries on Plastic Surgery Practices: A Survey of ACAPS Members","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic led to a drastic decline in the number of elective surgeries performed in the United States. Many national societies and local governments provided recommendations for surgeons to initially suspend and progressively resume elective surgery. The authors used a survey to the American Council of Academic Plastic Surgeons (ACAPS) to assess the effect on plastic surgeons. An electronic survey questionnaire was distributed to 532 members of ACAPS. Data on individual and plastic surgery practice demographics, COVID-19 prevention measures, and procedures or services that were being performed or delayed were collected and analyzed. An estimated 161 members (30.2%) completed the survey. Changes in hospital policy were cited as the most common reason (89%) for determining which procedures were currently offered. Results vary by specialty. Notably, &lt;10% of respondents who normally offered aesthetic procedures currently offered any procedures during the survey. Subspecialty-specific results and prevention measures when seeing clinic patients are further summarized and discussed. Plastic surgeons have seen a drastic decrease in the variety of procedures and services they are allowed to offer during the COVID-19 pandemic. To help plan a return to normalcy, surgeons should create and implement plans to protect patients and staff from coronavirus transmission, assure financial solvency, and consider the effects of delayed surgeries on both the physical and mental health of their patients. In doing so, surgeons and their patients will be better prepared in the event of a resurgence of the virus.","Sarac, Schoenbrunner, Wilson, Chiu, Janis","https://doi.org/10.1097/GOX.0000000000003119","20200928","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-29","",5303,""

"Changes in Diet, Sleep, and Physical Activity Are Associated With Differences in Negative Mood During COVID-19 Lockdown","The United Kingdom and Scottish governments instigated a societal lockdown in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Subsequently, many experienced substantial lifestyle changes alongside the stresses of potentially catching the virus or experiencing bereavement. Stressful situations and poorer health behaviors (e.g., higher alcohol consumption, unhealthy diet, poorer sleep quality, physical inactivity) are frequently linked to poor mental health. Our objective was to examine changes in health behaviors and their relationship with negative mood during COVID-19 lockdown. We also considered associations between health behaviors and socio-demographic differences and COVID-19-induced changes. 399 participants completed a questionnaire asking about their personal situation and health behaviors during lockdown as well as a negative mood scale. The significance threshold for all analyses was ÃŽÂ± = 0.05. Poorer diet was linked to more-negative mood, and to changes to working status. Poorer sleep quality was linked with more-negative mood, and with 'shielding' from the virus. Being less physically active was related to more-negative mood and student status, whereas being more physically active was linked to having or suspecting COVID-19 infection within the household. Increased alcohol consumption was linked to living with children, but not to negative mood. Changes to diet, sleep quality, and physical activity related to differences in negative mood during COVID-19 lockdown. This study adds to reports on poor mental health during lockdown and identifies lifestyle restrictions and changes to health behaviors which may, to some extent, be responsible for higher negative mood. Our data suggests that it is advisable to maintain or improve health behaviors during pandemic-associated restrictions.","Ingram, Maciejewski, Hand","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.588604","20200928","COVID-19; alcohol; diet; lockdown; mental health; mood; physical activity; sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-29","",5305,""
"COVID-19 Place Confinement, Pro-Social, Pro-environmental Behaviors, and Residents' Wellbeing: A New Conceptual Framework","Residents' wellbeing in the present COVID-19 global health crisis requires a deeper understanding to determine appropriate management strategies to promote sustainable behaviors and contribute to human and planetary health. Residents' behavior can have a profound influence in contributing to personal and global community's health by responding effectively to emergency strategies in disease outbreaks such as the Coronavirus. It is evident that an understanding of residents' behavior(s) pre COVID-19 across fields have relied on over-simplistic models, many of which will need to be revisited. Our interaction with people and nature while respecting social distancing has profound positive impacts on our physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual wellbeing. The current health pandemic has called that people be confined in their homes across many nations as a means to control the spread of the virus and save lives. This calls for research exploring the mechanisms; this paper develops and proposes a conceptual framework suggesting that place confinement promotes pro-social and household pro-environmental behaviors which could become habitual and contribute further to our people's and our planet's health. The proposed model concerns socio-economically favored social sectors whose survival is not as threatened by the pandemic as the poor sectors where wellbeing (and mental health) are at high risk. Some evidence shows that human connectedness to place may contribute to engagement in desirable behaviors. Interaction with other members of the household can help create meanings leading to collective actions promoting psychological wellbeing. Promoting hygienic behaviors in the household (frequent hand washing) while at the same time being conscious not to keep the water flowing when not required would contribute to a range of benefits (health, financial, biospheric, altruistic) and promote wellbeing. Engaging in pro-social behaviors may result in positive effects on psychological wellbeing, reducing mental distress giving rise to a sense of attachment and belongingness, trust and overall life satisfaction. Engaging people in low-effort pro-environmental behavior to maintain some levels of physical activity and biological harmony with natural environmental settings (e.g., gardening) may help reduce anxiety and distress. This is the first study exploring the interplay of relationships between place confinement, pro-social behavior, household pro-environmental behaviors, place attachment as a multi-dimensional construct and presenting their relationships to residents' wellbeing. Behavioral change interventions are proposed to promote lifestyle change for people's wellbeing and broader societal benefits.","Ramkissoon","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.02248","20200928","COVID-19; behavior change; habits; health; place attachment; place confinement; pro-environmental and pro-social behavior; residentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-29","",5306,""

"COVID-19 Lockdown and Its Adverse Impact on Psychological Health in Breast Cancer","The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak generated an unprecedented set of emotional challenges for women diagnosed with breast cancer. In the United Kingdom (UK), the pandemic significantly disrupted oncology services as resources were reassigned to care for COVID-19 patients. In addition to service disruptions, many women received a UK Government letter advising them to shield for 12-weeks. We aimed to explore the effect of disruption to scheduled oncology services and the UK Government shielding letter on emotional and cognitive vulnerability. A further aim was to investigate the relationship between COVID-19 related emotional vulnerability (COVID-EMV) and anxiety, depression and perceived cognitive function. Women diagnosed with primary breast cancer (<i>N</i> = 234) completed a series of online questionnaires to assess their cognitive and emotional wellbeing as well as their COVID-EMV. Results indicated that disrupted oncology services had a significant impact on COVID-EMV, anxiety and depression, with those experiencing disruptions expressing higher general emotional vulnerability as well as COVID-EMV. Further, the UK Government letter had a significant effect on perceived cognitive function; those who received the letter reported poorer cognitive function. Regression analyses revealed that after allowing for the effects of sociodemographic and clinical variables, women's COVID-EMV significantly predicted worse outcomes of anxiety, depression and perceived cognitive function. Our findings indicate that concerns about COVID-19 amongst women affected by breast cancer leads to increased risk of developing affective disorder, such as anxiety and depression symptomatology, among this sample. We advocate the rapid implementation of accessible interventions designed to promote emotional resilience in the breast cancer population.","Swainston, Chapman, Grunfeld, Derakshan","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.02033","20200928","COVID-19; anxiety; breast cancer; cognition; depression; psycho-oncology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-29","",5308,""
"Knowledge, Attitude, and Practices Regarding COVID-19 Among Chronic Illness Patients at Outpatient Departments in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a major threat to human life around the world. This study aims to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practices regarding COVID-19 among people with chronic diseases at the outpatient departments in Ho Chi Minh City. A cross-sectional study was carried out between February and March 2020 using a convenience sampling strategy in three hospitals in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) via the use of a structured self-administered questionnaire. Factors relating to practices, prevalence ratio (PR), and 95% confidence interval were estimated by using the Poisson regression with robust options. P-value &lt;0.05 was considered as statistically different. A total of 522 participants had a mean age of 51.5 Ã‚Â± 10.6 years. Most of them reported seeing information regarding the COVID-19 pandemic (93.7%) via television and social media (72.8% and 62.1%, respectively). Just over two-thirds of the participants (68.4%) answered with sufficient knowledge of COVID-19. Most respondents had a positive attitude toward COVID-19 (90.8%), although some misconceptions existed. Almost over three-fourths of them (77.2%) maintained good practices for prevention. The rate of good practices in those who had sufficient knowledge was 1.24 times greater than that among those who had insufficient knowledge (PR 1.24, 95% CI: 1.10-1.41, P&lt;0.05). Also, the rate of good practices in males was lower than that of females (PR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.83-0.99, P&lt;0.05). There still exists an amount of insufficient knowledge and negative attitude regarding COVID-19, which may be barriers to good prevention practices among chronic illness patients. Education programs need to continue via television and social media and emphasize that people with chronic diseases are more likely to experience severe symptoms, including death from COVID-19. Additionally, management authorities should prolong specific policies to protect the more vulnerable in our community.","Huynh, Nguyen, Tran, Nguyen, Nguyen, Do, Nguyen, Phan, Vu, Nguyen","https://doi.org/10.2147/RMHP.S268876","20200928","COVID-19; attitude; chronic disease; knowledge; practice","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-29","",5309,""
"Predicting Psychological State Among Chinese Undergraduate Students in the COVID-19 Epidemic: A Longitudinal Study Using a Machine Learning","The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) not only caused physical abnormalities, but also caused psychological distress, especially for undergraduate students who are facing the pressure of academic study and work. We aimed to explore the prevalence rate of probable anxiety and probable insomnia and to find the risk factors among a longitudinal study of undergraduate students using the approach of machine learning. The baseline data (T1) were collected from freshmen who underwent psychological evaluation at two months after entering the university. At T2 stage (February 10th to 13th, 2020), we used a convenience cluster sampling to assess psychological state (probable anxiety was assessed by general anxiety disorder-7 and probable insomnia was assessed by insomnia severity index-7) based on a web survey. We integrated information attained at T1 stage to predict probable anxiety and probable insomnia at T2 stage using a machine learning algorithm (XGBoost). Finally, we included 2009 students (response rate: 80.36%). The prevalence rate of probable anxiety and probable insomnia was 12.49% and 16.87%, respectively. The XGBoost algorithm predicted 1954 out of 2009 students (translated into 97.3% accuracy) and 1932 out of 2009 students (translated into 96.2% accuracy) who suffered anxiety and insomnia symptoms, respectively. The most relevant variables in predicting probable anxiety included romantic relationship, suicidal ideation, sleep symptoms, and a history of anxiety symptoms. The most relevant variables in predicting probable insomnia included aggression, psychotic experiences, suicidal ideation, and romantic relationship. Risks for probable anxiety and probable insomnia among undergraduate students can be identified at an individual level by baseline data. Thus, timely psychological intervention for anxiety and insomnia symptoms among undergraduate students is needed considering the above factors.","Ge, Zhang, Wu, Mu","https://doi.org/10.2147/NDT.S262004","20200928","COVID-19; anxiety; cohort; insomnia; machine learning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-29","",5310,""

"Anxiety Severity Levels and Coping Strategies during the COVID-19 Pandemic among People Aged 15 Years and Above in Gonabad, Iran","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is a global health problem. It is necessary to provide evidence on its unprecedented psychological effects to develop effective psychological interventions. The current study aims to determine the anxiety severity level, coping strategies, and influencing factors in response to the COVID-19 pandemic among people aged 15 years and above in Gonabad, Iran. We conducted a cross-sectional survey via online questionnaires between February and March 2020. We evaluated the anxiety severity levels and coping strategies using the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) and Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations-Short Form (CISS-SF), respectively. Multinomial and ordinal logistic regression models were used to identify the predictors of coping strategies and anxiety. Totally, 500 people completed the questionnaires (response rate: 73%). Of them, 53.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 48.9%- 57.8%) suffered moderate to severe levels of anxiety. More than half of the respondents (52.0%; 95% CI: 47.5%-56.4%) utilized emotional-based or avoidant coping strategies. People with no academic education (odds ratio [OR]: 2.16; 95% CI: 1.41- 3.31) and without physical exercise (OR: 2.04; 95% CI: 1.22-3.33) preferred emotional-based coping instead of problem-based coping strategy. Female gender (OR: 1.60, 95%, CI: 1.13-2.28), underlying medical conditions (OR: 2.52, 95% CI: 1.65-3.87), and emotional-based coping (OR: 4.06, 95% CI: 2.76-5.99) were associated with higher severity levels of anxiety. The severity of anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic was significant among participants. Further attention is needed to enhance the mental health of the vulnerable population during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings also identified some factors related to the severity level of anxiety related to COVID-19 that could help formulate better psychological interventions.","Mohammadzadeh, Delshad Noghabi, Khosravan, Bazeli, Armanmehr, Paykani","https://doi.org/10.34172/aim.2020.76","20200927","Anxiety; COVID-19; Iran; Pandemics; Psychological adaptation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-29","",5312,""
"Potential psychosocial impact of COVID-19 on children: A scoping review of pandemics & epidemics","Context: Physical distancing and health measures, such as school closures and work-at-home mandates, implemented to mitigate the transmission of COVID-19, will likely have far-reaching impacts on childrenâ€™s psychosocial health and well-being. Objective: We aimed to examine extant literature on pandemics to identify the expected impact of COVID-19 on childrenâ€™s psychosocial health and secondary outcomes, including nutritional, financial and child safety outcomes. Data Sources: Articles were searched within the Medline, Global Health, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases on June 11th, 2020. Gray literature was also examined from the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations International Fund (UNICEF) until July 24th, 2020. Study Selection: A total of 8332 articles were screened for eligibility by two independent reviewers. Of these, 7,919 and 413 articles were from academic databases and additional sources, respectively. Data Extraction: Results on child outcomes were extracted and collated. Results: Seventy-three articles met inclusion criteria. Children have faced significant challenges with 12% of total articles indicating loneliness/depression, 21% anxiety, 7% grief, 10% stress-related disorders, 25% child abuse, 8% family conflict, and 12% stigma during pandemics/epidemics. Furthermore, 25% of articles indicated economic challenges, 23% negative academic impacts, 33% improper nutrition, and 21% reduced opportunities for play/increased screen time. These challenges were exacerbated among children who were female, having a disability, or being a migrant/displaced child. Conclusion: Pandemics and epidemics have had diverse and widespread negative consequences for children. Findings can inform the development and implementation of resources during the COVID-19 pandemic to protect child health and well-being.","Kaitlyn A Merrill et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46150-0A4-8C1","20200929","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; school closure; children; pandemic; isolation; psychosocial; epidemic; mental health; covid-19","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-29","",5313,""
