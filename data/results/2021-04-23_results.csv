"Emotional symptoms, mental fatigue and behavioral adherence after 72 continuous days of strict lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic in Argentina","Background: An early, total, and prolonged lockdown was adopted in Argentina during the first wave of COVID-19 as the main sanitary strategy to reduce the spread of the virus in the population. Reports from early stages of the lockdown evidenced elevated emotional symptomatology. Aims: The aim of this study was to explore: 1) if the prolongation of the lockdown was associated with elevated emotional symptoms; 2) if the prolonged lockdown affected adherence, a phenomenon called 'behavioral fatigue'; and 3) how financial concerns in a developing country affected adherence to the lockdown and emotional status of the population. Method: A survey was designed to evaluate the psychological correlates of the pandemic after an average of 72 days of continuous lockdown in Argentina.. The survey included standardized questionnaires to assess the severity of depressive (PHQ-9) and anxious (GAD-7) symptoms, a questionnaire to evaluate mental fatigue, and several additional instruments to assess other variables of interest: risk perception, lockdown adherence, financial concerns, daily stress, loneliness, intolerance to uncertainty, negative repetitive thinking, and cognitive problems. Three LASSO regression analyses were carried to evaluate the predictive role of the different variables over depression, anxiety, and lockdown adherence Results: The survey was responded by 3617 individuals over the age of 18 (85.2% female) from all the provinces of Argentina. Using the Oxford stringency index, Argentina had one of the most stringent and prolonged lockdowns when the sample was collected with 63 to 77 continuous days with a stringency index of more than 85/100. 45.6% of the sample met the cut-off for depression and 27% for anxiety. Previous mental health treatment, low income, being younger, and being female were associated with higher levels of emotional symptoms. Mental fatigue, cognitive failures, and financial concerns were also associated with emotional and subjective complaints, but not with adherence to the lockdown. In the regression models, mental fatigue, cognitive failures, and loneliness were the most important variables to predict depression, meanwhile intolerance to uncertainty and lockdown difficulty were the most important in the case of anxiety. Perceived threat was the most important variable predicting lockdown adherence. Conclusions: Emotional symptoms persisted and even increased during the extended lockdown, but we found no evidence of behavioral fatigue. Instead, mental fatigue, cognitive difficulties, and financial concerns were expressions of the emotional side of the pandemic and the restrictive measures.","Fernando Torrente; Adrian Ezequiel Yoris; Daniel M Low; Pablo Lopez; Pedro Bekinschtein; Gustavo Vazquez; Facundo Manes; Marcelo Cetkovich","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.21.21255866","20210423","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-23","",13095,""
"Patient symptoms and experience following COVID-19: results from a UK wide survey","Objectives To investigate the experience of people who continue to be unwell after acute COVID-19, often referred to as 'Long-COVID', both in terms of their symptoms and their interactions with healthcare. Design We conducted a mixed-methods analysis (quantitative and qualitative) of responses to a survey accessed through a UK online post-COVID support and information hub between April 2020 and December 2020 about people's experiences after having acute COVID-19. Participants Of 3290 respondents, 78% were female, median age range 45-54 years, 92.1% reported white ethnicity; 12.7% had been hospitalised. 494 respondents (16.5%) completed the survey between 4 and 8 weeks of the onset of their symptoms, 641 (21.4%) between 8 and 12 weeks and 1865 (62.1%) more than 12 weeks after. Results The ongoing symptoms most frequently reported were; breathing problems (92.1%), fatigue (83.3%), muscle weakness or joint stiffness (50.6%), sleep disturbances (46.2%), problems with mental abilities (45.9%) changes in mood, including anxiety and depression (43.1%) and cough (42.3%). Symptoms did not appear to be related to the severity of the acute illness or to the presence of pre-existing medical conditions. Analysis of free text responses revealed three main themes (1) Experience of living with COVID-19 - physical and psychological symptoms that fluctuate unpredictably; (2) Interactions with healthcare; (3) Implications for the future - their own condition, society and the healthcare system and the need for research Conclusion People living with persistent problems after the acute phase of COVID-19 report multiple and varying symptoms that are not necessarily associated with initial disease severity or the presence of pre-existing health conditions. Many have substantial unmet needs and experience barriers to accessing healthcare. Consideration of patient perspective and experiences will assist in the planning of services to address this.","Sara C Buttery; Keir E J Philip; Parris J Williams; Andrea Fallas; Brigitte West; Andrew Cumella; Cheryl Cheung; Samantha Walker; Jennifer K Quint; Michael I Polkey; Nicholas S Hopkinson","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.15.21255348","20210422","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-23","",13096,""
"High-dimensional characterization of post-acute sequalae of COVID-19","The acute clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are well characterized<sup>1,2</sup>; however, its post-acute sequalae have not been comprehensively described. Here, we use the national healthcare databases of the US Department of Veterans Affairs to systematically and comprehensively identify 6-month incident sequalae including diagnoses, medication use, and laboratory abnormalities in 30-day survivors of COVID-19. We show that beyond the first 30 days of illness, people with COVID-19 exhibit higher risk of death and health resource utilization. Our high dimensional approach identifies incident sequalae in the respiratory system and several others including nervous system and neurocognitive disorders, mental health disorders, metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, malaise, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, and anemia. We show increased incident use of several therapeutics including pain medications (opioids and non-opioids), antidepressants, anxiolytics, antihypertensives, and oral hypoglycemics and evidence of laboratory abnormalities in multiple organ systems. Analysis of an array of pre-specified outcomes reveals a risk gradient that increased across severity of the acute COVID-19 infection (non-hospitalized, hospitalized, admitted to intensive care). The findings show that beyond the acute illness, substantial burden of health loss - spanning pulmonary and several extrapulmonary organ systems - is experienced by COVID-19 survivors. The results provide a roadmap to inform health system planning and development of multidisciplinary care strategies to reduce chronic health loss among COVID-19 survivors.","Al-Aly, Xie, Bowe","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03553-9","20210422","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-23","",13097,""
"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic related lockdown on Suicide: Analysis of newspaper reports during pre-lockdown and lockdown period in Bangladesh and India","The economic and social devastation wrought by the COVID-19 crisiscoupled with the unavailability of traditional coping resources is a &quot;perfect storm&quot; for suicide. Evidence suggests that its impact may be disproportionately high in low-and-middle-income countries. The study aimed to assess and compare nature and correlates of suicidesfrom news reportsduring the immediate pre-lockdown and lockdown phase of COVID-19 in Bangladesh and India. We performed analysis of suicide reports from purposively selected online vernacular and English newspapers of Bangladesh and two states/union territory in India, between January to June 2020. We divided the time period of observation into two phases: pre-lockdown and lockdown phase. Country wise findings between the two phases were compared in terms of demographic and characteristics of the reported suicide. A total of 769 news reports wereanalysed; 141 from Bangladesh and 628 from India. When compared to the pre-lockdown period, the odds of suicide by hanging was significantly higher during lockdownin India (adjusted Odds Ratios [aOR] = 3.8, p = 0.018) and Bangladesh (aOR = 3.1, p = 0.048). Suicide demographics in India were different from Bangladesh during lockdown; more males died by suicide in India (aOR = 2.7, p = 0.023) and more people died by hanging (aOR = 2.6, p = 0.029). The pandemic restrictions impacted suicide demographics in the studied regions of India and Bangladesh. Further research using population-based time-series data are warranted to investigate the issue.","Kar, Menon, Arafat, Rai, Kaliamoorthy, Akter, Shukla, Sharma, Roy, Sridhar","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2021.102649","20210422","Bangladesh; COVID-19; India; Newspaper report; Pandemic; Suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-23","",13098,""
"Adolescent psychopathological profiles and the outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic: Longitudinal findings from the UK Millennium Cohort Study","Public health measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 have resulted in adverse effects, including high level of psychological distress, anxiety, and depression. This study explored adolescent psychopathological profiles at age 17, and their role in predicting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic at age 19. The analyses used a sample of 904 participants (mean ageÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯19.17Ã¢â‚¬Â¯years) from the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) sweep 7 who completed the mental health questions from January 2018 to March 2019 (mean ageÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯17.18Ã¢â‚¬Â¯years) and the COVID-19 Survey in May 2020. Adolescent psychopathological profiles were identified by means of latent class analysis. Four psychopathological profiles were identified: &quot;low-symptom class&quot; (60.17% of participants), &quot;high-symptom class&quot; (23.01% of participants), &quot;substance/behavioural addictions class&quot; (12.03% of participants), and &quot;emotion-dysregulation class&quot; (4.79% of participants). Adolescents in the high-symptom and emotional-dysregulation classes had the worst outcome during the lockdown. Specifically, they experienced more stress, conflict and loneliness, and lower levels of perceived social support than adolescents in the other psychopathological classes. Adolescents in the emotional-dysregulation class also consumed more alcohol and had worse financial situation during the lockdown compared to pre- lockdown period. Adolescent psychopathological profiles predicted mental health impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak.","Essau, de la Torre-Luque","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2021.110330","20210422","Adolescent; COVID-19; Millennium Cohort Study; Psychopathological profiles","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-23","",13099,""
"Tai chi improves psychoemotional state, cognition, and motor learning in older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic","The aim of this study was to determine the effect of a 10-week tai chi intervention on psychoemotional state, cognition, and motor learning in older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants aged 60-78Ã¢â‚¬Â¯years were randomized to either a control group (nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯15) or a tai chi group (nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯15) for a 10-week period. The tai chi group received two, 8-form tai chi classes of 60Ã¢â‚¬Â¯min duration per week. Changes in psychoemotional state, cognition, and the learning of fast and accurate reaching movements were assessed. In addition, the potential roles of the autonomic nervous system and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were investigated. Tai chi practice decreased (PÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.05) perceived stress, whereas no change in autonomic nervous system activity was observed. Improvements in mental switching correlated with decreased depressive symptoms and increased BDNF levels (PÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.05), whereas improvements in inhibitory control tended to correlate with BDNF levels (PÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.08). Improvements in visuospatial processing tended to correlate with decreased depressive symptoms (PÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.07) while improved visuospatial processing correlated with improved motor planning during learning tasks (PÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.05). This study suggests that tai chi is an effective intervention that can be delivered under pandemic conditions to improve mental and physical function in older adults.","Solianik, MickeviÃ„ÂienÃ„â€”, Ã…Â½libinaitÃ„â€”, Ã„Å’ekanauskaitÃ„â€”","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exger.2021.111363","20210422","BDNF; Cognitive function; Depression; Heart rate variability; Motor function; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-23","",13100,""

We used risk ratio analysis to quantify the relationship between binary variables and Ãâ€¡2 testing to quantify the statistical significance of these relationships. Median age of respondents was 30 years (interquartile range, 26-36 years) and 63% were physicians. The top three sources of information used by HCWs for COVID-19 management included the Ministry of Health of each country, the WHO, and social media. Forty-nine percent reported a decrease in income since the start of the pandemic, with the majority experiencing between a 1% and a 25% salary reduction. Sixty-six percent reported some access to personal protective equipment; only 14% reported appropriate access. Moreover, one third of respondents reported no availability of ventilators at their facility. Strikingly, the percentage of HCWs reporting never feeling depressed changed from 61% before the pandemic to 31% during the pandemic, with a corresponding increase in daily depressive symptoms from 2% to 20%. Most respondents (&gt; 97%) correctly answered survey questions about COVID-19 symptoms, virus transmission, and prevention. Our survey revealed African HCWs face a variety of personal and professional context-dependent challenges. Ongoing support of HCWs through and after the COVID-19 pandemic is essential.","Quadri, Sultan, Ali, Yousif, Moussa, Fawzy Abdo, Hassany, Kayandabila, Benjamin, Jacobson, Ssebambulidde, Ochola, Ijeoma, Debes","https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.20-1478","20210422","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-23","",13108,""
"Digitalising a Brief Intervention to Reduce Intrusive Memories of Psychological Trauma for Healthcare Staff Working During COVID-19: An Exploratory Pilot Study with Nurses","The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the worldwide need for simple, remotely delivered (digital), scalable interventions that can also be used preventatively to protect the mental health of healthcare staff exposed to psychologically traumatic events during their COVID-19 related work. We have developed a brief behavioral intervention which aims to reduce the number of intrusive memories of traumatic events, but has only been delivered face-to-face so far. After digitalising intervention materials, here, the intervention is delivered digitally to target-users (healthcare staff) for the first time. Adaption for staff's working context in a hospital setting used a co-design approach. Aims of this mixed method exploratory pilot study with healthcare staff who experienced working in the pandemic were to: 1) Pilot the intervention that we have (a) digitalised (for remote delivery and with remote support) and (b) adapted for this target population (healthcare staff working clinically during a pandemic) to explore its ability to reduce the number of intrusive memories of traumatic events, as well as improve related symptoms (e.g. posttraumatic stress) and participant's perception of their functioning; 2) Explore feasibility and acceptability of both digitalised intervention and digitalised data collection. We worked closely with target-users with lived experience of working clinically during the COVID-19 pandemic in a hospital context, here registered nurses who experienced intrusive memories from traumatic events at work (N=3). We used a mixed-method design and exploratory quantitative and qualitative analysis. After completing the digitalised intervention once with remote researcher support (approximately 25 minutes) and a brief follow-up check-in, participants learnt to use the intervention independently. All three participants reported zero intrusive memories during week 5 (primary outcome, 100% digital data capture). Prior to study inclusion, pre-intervention two or more intrusions in the week were reported (assessed retrospectively). There was a general pattern of symptom reduction and improvement in perceived functioning (e.g. concentration) at follow-up. Digitalised intervention and data collection were perceived as feasible and rated as acceptable (e.g. all three participants would recommend it to a colleague). Participants were positive towards the digital intervention as a useful tool that could readily be incorporated into work life and repeated in the face of ongoing/repeated trauma exposure. The digitalised intervention when adapted for this population was well received by participants. Since it could be tailored around work/daily life and used preventatively, the digital intervention may hold promise for healthcare staff pending future evaluations of efficacy. Limitations include the small sample, lack of daily intrusion frequency data in the week before the intervention, and lack of control condition. Following this co-design process in adapting/improving intervention delivery and evaluation, a next step is to investigate the efficacy of the digitalised intervention in a randomised controlled trials.","Singh, Kanstrup, Depa, Falk, LindstrÃƒÂ¶m, Dahl, GÃƒÂ¶ransson, Rudman, Holmes","https://doi.org/10.2196/27473","20210422","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-23","",13109,""
"Characterizing Healthcare Delays and Interruptions in the US During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Data from an Internet-Based Cross-Sectional Survey","The COVID-19 pandemic has broader geographic spread and potentially longer lasting effects than previous disasters. Necessary preventive precautions for the transmission of COVID-19 resulted in delays of in-person healthcare services, especially at the outset of the pandemic. Among a US sample, we examined the rates of delays (defined as cancellations and postponements) to healthcare at the outset of the pandemic and characterized the reasons for delays. As part of an internet-based survey distributed on social media in April 2020, we asked a US-based convenience sample of 2,570 participants about delays to their healthcare due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Participant demographics and self-reported worries about general health and the COVID-19 pandemic were explored as potent determinants of healthcare delays. Along with all delays, we focused on three main types of delays as the primary outcomes in the study: 1) dental, 2) preventive, and 3) diagnostic care. For each outcome, we used bivariate statistical tests (t-tests and chi-square tests) and multiple logistic regression models to study which factors are associated with healthcare delays. The top reported barrier to receiving healthcare was fear of COVID-19 infection (34%). Almost half (n = 1,227, 48%) of participants reported experiencing healthcare delays. Among those who experienced healthcare delays and further clarified the type of delay they experienced, the top three reported types of care affected included: 1) dental (n = 351, 38%); 2) preventive (n = 269, 29%); and 3) diagnostic (n = 151, 16%) care. Logistic regression models show that age, gender, sexual identity, education, and self-reported worry about general health are significantly associated with experiencing healthcare delays overall. Self-reported worry about general health was negatively related to experiencing delays in dental care, while this predictor was positively associated with delays in diagnostic testing in the logistic regression model. Additionally, age was positively associated with delays in diagnostic testing. No factors remained significant in the multiple logistic regression for delays in preventive care, although race was marginally significant (p=.056), with people of color reporting experiencing less delays than their white counter parts. Lessons learned from the initial surge of COVID-19 cases can help inform systemic mitigation strategies for potential future disruptions. This research addresses the demand-side of healthcare delays by exploring the determinants of delays. More research on healthcare delays during the pandemic is needed, including the short- and long-term impacts on patient-level outcomes including mortality, morbidity, mental health, quality of life, and experience of pain.","Papautsky, Rice, Ghoneima, McKowen, Anderson, Wootton, Veldhuis","https://doi.org/10.2196/25446","20210422","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-23","",13110,""
"Which lives are worth saving? Biolegitimacy and harm reduction during COVID-19","Despite the promise to save every life, the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed social and racial inequalities, precarious living conditions, and engendered an exponential increase in overdose deaths. Although some lives are considered sacred, others are deliberately sacrificed. This article draws on the theoretical work of Foucault and scholars who further developed his concept of biopolitics. While biopolitics aims to ameliorate the health of populations, Foucault never systematically accounted for the unequal value of lives. In the name of saving the biological lives of people who use drugs (PWUD) during the pandemic, the harm reduction movement has emphasized the need for safe supply, decriminalization, and housing; governments have started implementing these measures, which were previously rejected as utopian and unrealistic. Paradoxically, the use of drugs itself, and therefore the increased risk of death from overdose or other medical sequelae, is the only way PWUD can achieve enough visibility to be recognized as a life worth saving. The humanitarian rationale of harm reduction concerns itself with the biological life and stipulates social and political rights in the name of its sacredness. This is what anthropologist Fassin and others called biolegitimacy-the recognition of life reduced to its physiological, biological essence.","Larocque, Foth","https://doi.org/10.1111/nin.12417","20210422","COVID-19; anthropology; discourse; foucault; governmentality; harm reduction; politics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-23","",13111,""
"Is Physical Activity Associated with Less Depression and Anxiety During the COVID-19 Pandemic? A Rapid Systematic Review","The Covid-19 pandemic is affecting the entire world population. During the first spread, most governments have implemented quarantine and strict social distancing procedures. Similar measures during recent pandemics resulted in an increase in post-traumatic stress, anxiety and depression symptoms. The development of novel interventions to mitigate the mental health burden are of utmost importance. In this rapid review, we aimed to provide a systematic overview of the literature with regard to associations between physical activity (PA) and depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. We searched major databases (PubMed, EMBASE, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science) and preprint servers (MedRxiv, SportRxiv, ResearchGate, and Google Scholar), for relevant papers up to 25/07/2020. We included observational studies with cross-sectional and longitudinal designs. To qualify for inclusion in the review, studies must have tested the association of PA with depression or anxiety, using linear or logistic regressions. Depression and anxiety must have been assessed using validated rating scales. Effect sizes were represented by fully adjusted standardized betas and odds ratios (OR) alongside 95% confidence intervals (CI). In case standardized effects could not be obtained, unstandardized effects were presented and indicated. We identified a total of 21 observational studies (4 longitudinal, 1 cross-sectional with retrospective analysis, and 16 cross-sectional), including information of 42,293 (age 6-70Ã‚Â years, median femaleÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°68%) participants from five continents. The early evidence suggests that people who performed PA on a regular basis with higher volume and frequency and kept the PA routines stable, showed less symptoms of depression and anxiety. For instance, those reporting a higher total time spent in moderate to vigorous PA had 12-32% lower chances of presenting depressive symptoms and 15-34% of presenting anxiety. Performing PA during Covid-19 is associated with less depression and anxiety. To maintain PA routines during Covid-19, specific volitional and motivational skills might be paramount to overcome Covid-19 specific barriers. Particularly, web-based technologies could be an accessible way to increase motivation and volition for PA and maintain daily PA routines.","Wolf, Seiffer, Zeibig, Welkerling, Brokmeier, Atrott, Ehring, Schuch","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40279-021-01468-z","20210422","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-23","",13112,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on screen media use in patients referred for ADHD to child and adolescent psychiatry: an introduction to problematic use of the internet in ADHD and results of a survey","The COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown have been associated with multiple consequences for mental health, including an excessive and potentially harmful increase in screen media use. The specific consequences for children, adolescents and young adults with ADHD are still unknown. In the first part of this study, a short review of problematic use of the internet (PUI) in ADHD is presented, showing that patients with ADHD are at risk for different aspects of PUI, such as excessive gaming or problematic social media use. In the second part, we report original data of an online survey on screen media use before, during and after the lockdown completed by parents of children and adolescents clinically referred for ADHD. Parents rated children's/adolescents' media-related behavior and media time on a new screening questionnaire for PUI. Each item was rated three times, referring to the observed behavior before, during and 1-2Ã‚Â months after the lockdown. NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°126 parents of patients referred for ADHD aged 10-18Ã‚Â years participated in the study. Total media time increased by 46% during the lockdown and did not completely return to pre-Corona levels afterwards. Patients with difficulties concentrating, high irritability or deterioration of ADHD problems under lockdown spent more time with screen media than those with milder or no such problems. While the effects of the lockdown on screen media use and its negative impact on everyday life appear to be largely reversible, a small proportion of patients with ADHD apparently continue to show increased media use.","Werling, Walitza, Drechsler","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00702-021-02332-0","20210422","Adolescents; Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; COVID-19; Gaming; Problematic use of the internet; Social media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-23","",13113,""
"Development of a Resource Guide to Support the Engagement of Mental Health Providers and Patients With Digital Health Tools: Multimethod Study","As mental illness continues to affect 1 in 5 individuals, and the need for support has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, the promise of digital mental health tools remains largely unrealized due to a lack of uptake by patients and providers. Currently, most efforts on supporting the uptake of digital mental health tools remain fragmented across organizations and geography. There is a critical need to synthesize these efforts in order to provide a coordinated strategy of supporting the adoption of digital mental health tools. The specific aim of this project is to develop a web-based resource document to support the engagement of mental health providers and patients in the use of digital mental health tools. The web-based resource was developed using a multimethod approach. A grey literature review was conducted in 2019 to identify relevant toolkits that are available in the public domain. This was supplemented with an environmental scan where individuals with expertise in the development, acquisition, implementation, and evaluation of digital mental health tools were invited to contribute additional tools or documents not identified in the grey literature search. An engagement workshop was held with stakeholders to explore how the resource document should be developed and delivered. These findings were collectively used to develop the final iteration of the resource document. Based on a gray literature review and environmental scan with 27 experts, 25 resources were identified and included in the resource guide. These resources were developed for patients and providers by organizations from 5 countries. An engagement workshop was held with 14 stakeholders, and barriers related to cultural sensitivity, sustainability, and accessibility of the toolkit were identified. The final iteration of the resource document was developed by the research team using findings from the gray literature review, environmental scan, and engagement workshop. The contents of the 45-page resource guide are directed at mental health care providers, administrators, and patients (inclusive of families and caregivers). The use of a multimethod approach led to the development of a resource guide that builds on existing evidence on digital mental health tools and was co-designed with stakeholders and end-users. The resource guide is now publicly available online for free and is being promoted through digital health and mental health websites. Future work should explore how this document can be integrated into clinical care delivery and pathways.","Strudwick, McLay, Lo, Shin, Currie, Thomson, Maillet, Strong, Miller, Shen, Campbell","https://doi.org/10.2196/25773","20210422","COVID-19; digital health; health informatics; mental health; nursing informatics; psychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-23","",13114,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on post-traumatic stress symptoms in the general population: An integrative review","The coronavirus pandemic highlights the urgent need for increased support related to mental health concerns. This study aimed to synthesize the findings of empirical studies reporting the post-traumatic stress symptoms in the general population during the coronavirus pandemic. Whittemore and Knafl's (Journal of Advanced Nursing, 52, 546, 2005) integrative review methodology was used to analyse and synthesize the peer-reviewed studies. Five electronic databases, PubMed, CINAHL, PsychINFO, Cochrane and Google Scholar were searched using terms related to the coronavirus pandemic and post-traumatic stress symptoms. The quality of the studies was screened and evaluated using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. The sample size of the 16 studies included in this review ranged from 41 to 3480 participants, with a total of 18Ã‚Â 039 participants. The majority of the participants' ages ranged from 30 to 39Ã‚Â years, and 57% of the participants were female. The following factors related to post-traumatic stress symptoms during the coronavirus pandemic were identified as follows: (i) risk factors included social discrimination, fear of uncontrolled contagion and financial burden or economic instability; and, (ii) protective factors included social support and timely government action. A traumatic experience itself can trigger the onset of post-traumatic stress disorder; however, depending on the risk and protection factors, each individual can experience different post-traumatic stress symptoms. Thus, mental health nurses should comprehensively understand how to reduce the influence of risk factors and enhance protective factors when dealing with the pandemic and related trauma. This study's findings are beneficial for identifying, preventing and managing post-traumatic stress symptoms associated with the coronavirus and future pandemics.","Hong, Kim, Park","https://doi.org/10.1111/inm.12875","20210422","COVID-19; mental health; pandemics; post-traumatic stress disorders; psychological adaptation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-23","",13115,""
"Mindfulness-based interventions: an overall review","This is an overall review on mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs). We identified studies in PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, AMED, Web of Science and Google Scholar using keywords including 'mindfulness', 'meditation', and 'review', 'meta-analysis' or their variations. MBIs are effective for improving many biopsychosocial conditions, including depression, anxiety, stress, insomnia, addiction, psychosis, pain, hypertension, weight control, cancer-related symptoms and prosocial behaviours. It is found to be beneficial in the healthcare settings, in schools and workplace but further research is warranted to look into its efficacy on different problems. MBIs are relatively safe, but ethical aspects should be considered. Mechanisms are suggested in both empirical and neurophysiological findings. Cost-effectiveness is found in treating some health conditions. Inconclusive or only preliminary evidence on the effects of MBIs on PTSD, ADHD, ASD, eating disorders, loneliness and physical symptoms of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and respiratory conditions. Furthermore, some beneficial effects are not confirmed in subgroup populations. Cost-effectiveness is yet to confirm for many health conditions and populations. Many mindfulness systematic reviews and meta-analyses indicate low quality of included studies, hence high-quality studies with adequate sample size and longer follow-up period are needed. More research is needed on online mindfulness trainings and interventions to improve biopsychosocial health during the COVID-19 pandemic; Deeper understanding of the mechanisms of MBIs integrating both empirical and neurophysiological findings; Long-term compliance and effects of MBIs; and development of mindfulness plus (mindfulness+) or personalized mindfulness programs to elevate the effectiveness for different purposes.","Zhang, Lee, Mak, Ho, Wong","https://doi.org/10.1093/bmb/ldab005","20210422","biopsychosocial health; compliance; ethics; mechanisms; mindfulness-based interventions; safety","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-23","",13116,""
"Multicenter study of US trauma centers examining the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on injury causes, diagnoses and procedures","The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in nationwide social distancing and shelter-in-place orders meant to curb transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The effect of the pandemic on injury patterns has not been well described in the USA. The study objective is to determine the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the distribution and determinants of traumatic injuries. This retrospective multi-institutional cohort study included all hospital admissions for acute traumatic injury at six community level I trauma centers. Descriptive statistics were used to compare injury causes, diagnoses and procedures over two similar time periods: prepandemic (March 11-June 30, 2019) and pandemic (March 11-June 30, 2020). There were 7308 trauma patients included: 3862 (53%) prepandemic and 3446 (47%) during the pandemic. Cause of injury significantly differed by period (p&lt;0.001). During the pandemic, there were decreases in motor vehicle crashes (from 17.0% to 14.0%, p&lt;0.001), worksite injuries (from 5.2% to 4.1%, p=0.02), pedestrian injuries (from 3.0% to 2.2%, p=0.02) and recreational injuries (from 3.0% to 1.7%, p&lt;0.001), while there were significant increases in assaults (6.9% to 8.5%, p=0.01), bicycle crashes (2.8% to 4.2%, p=0.001) and off-road vehicle injuries (1.8% to 3.0%, p&lt;0.001). There was no change by study period in falls, motorcycle injuries, crush/strikes, firearm and self-inflicted injuries, and injuries associated with home-improvement projects. Injury diagnoses differed between time periods; during the pandemic, there were more injury diagnoses to the head (23.0% to 27.3%, p&lt;0.001) and the knee/leg (11.7% to 14.9%, p&lt;0.001). There were also increases in medical/surgical procedures (57.5% to 61.9%, p&lt;0.001), administration of therapeutics/blood products (31.4% to 34.2%, p=0.01) and monitoring (11.0% to 12.9%, p=0.01).

"Decline in the mental health of nurses across the globe during COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Nurses represent the major proportion of frontline health care professionals delivering 24/7 services to patients with an increased vulnerability towards COVID-19 infection. Mental health issues among nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic are poorly reported across the globe. Henceforth, a systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to explore the prevalence and determinants of mental health outcomes (anxiety, stress, depression, PTSD, insomnia) among nurses across the globe due to the COVID-19. A PRISMA compliant systematic review (PROSPERO-CRD 42020204120) was carried out to identify articles from multiple databases reporting the prevalence of mental health outcomes among nurses. Proportion random effect analysis, <i>I<sup>2</sup></i> statistic, quality assessment, and sensitivity analysis were carried out. Pooled data on mental health outcomes were generated from 25 cross-sectional studies: 32% anxiety (95% confidence interval (CI)Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°21%-44%, n (number of studies)Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°21, N (sample size)Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°13Ã¢â‚¬â€°641), 40.6% stress (95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°25.4%-56.8%, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°10, NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4204), 32% depression (95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°21%-44%, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°17, NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°12Ã¢â‚¬â€°294), 18.6% PTSD (95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.8%-38%, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3, NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°638), 38.3% insomnia (95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.8%-78.6%, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2, NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°261) and significant risk factors for mental ailments includes; caring for COVID-19 patients, being a female, low self-efficacy, resilience, social support and having physical symptoms (sore-throat, breathlessness, cough, lethargy, myalgia, fever). The study results highlighted a higher proportion of poor mental health outcomes namely, anxiety, stress, depression, PTSD and insomnia among nurses from different parts of the world. Poor mental health outcomes among nurses warrants the need to implement proactive psychological interventions to deter the collapse of health care systems in responding to the pandemic and in particular all possible efforts should be undertaken to mitigate the risk factors. Health care organizations should provide support to nurses with sufficient flexibility. The disaster preparedness plan envisaged by nations should have provisions to address the mental health of nurses. Greater investment in addressing the global shortage of nurses should be given priority in national health policies. Attractive salary packages should be offered to nurses to prevent their emigration from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

"Cutting-Edge Microscopy Systems as Remote Teaching and Research Tools for Undergraduate Students","Whether due to illness, weather, safety, or other concerns, it is very difficult for biology students to gather meaningful and timely data without access to campus. This has been especially evident during the COVID-19 pandemic, in which most laboratory exercises have been conducted as a simulation. Simulated experiments provide a stopgap for certain courses, but for upper-level and research courses, they are often insufficient. Many new microscopy tools now on the market can be adapted to allow students to generate and analyze novel data with little aid from instructors. Remote brightfield-based systems like the CytoSMART Lux2 can be used to gather real-time insight into the progression of cell growth, cell migration, and cell viability over time. The data from these systems can be viewed via the Internet or downloaded for later analysis. Confocal microscopy also offers unique remote-learning opportunities. Because these fluorescence-based microscopes are controlled almost exclusively by a computer, free &quot;remote desktop&quot; software can allow students to learn how to use this cutting-edge technology and can also allow for the generation and analysis of novel data. While these systems can be expensive, they offer a variety of benefits for undergraduate students and researchers, whether they are in the laboratory or working remotely.","Thompson","https://doi.org/10.1128/jmbe.v22i1.2495","20210422","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-23","",13119,""
"Anxiety and Adaptation of Behavior in Pregnant Zhuang Women During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Mixed-Mode Survey","This study explored the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health and adaptation of behavior of Zhuang women in China to provide more specific guidance for the social and medical practice of pregnant women during public health emergencies. This cross-sectional study recruited 446 pregnant Zhuang women from obstetric outpatient clinics in four tertiary hospitals and online maternity schools in Nanning, Guangxi, between February 24 and March 1, 2020. Self-designed questionnaires and the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale were used. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence rate of anxiety among women was 36.77%, and some adaptation of behavior was observed. Logistic regression analysis showed that pregnant women who had an annual household income of less than $7,000, were primiparous, went out for prenatal examination, wanted to self-monitor during pregnancy but did not know how to do it, believed that they should be strictly isolated at home and cancel prenatal examinations, and expected to receive pregnancy healthcare through teleconsultation services showed a higher risk of anxiety. Nevertheless, pregnant Zhuang women who were 22-35 years old, undergraduate-educated, and in their second trimester were less likely to suffer from anxiety. The COVID-19 pandemic has a significant psychological impact on pregnant women from ethnic minorities. Factors related to quarantine and social isolation policies appear to drive changes in behaviors and anxiety disorders. Multidisciplinary mental health services and culturally sensitive interventions are necessary for minority pregnant women, especially for low-income primiparous women in the first or third trimester.","Ge, Shi, Wu, Liu, Chen, Deng","https://doi.org/10.2147/RMHP.S303835","20210422","behavior; coronavirus disease 2019; minority; pregnant women; psychological","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-23","",13120,""
"Impact of meloxicam on respiratory virus titers and health outcomes when administered concurrently with a modified live respiratory vaccine in abruptly weaned beef steers","Abruptly weaned crossbred steer calves (N = 271) were used in a randomized, blinded 2-arm clinical trial to assess the impact of a long-acting non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug on bovine herpesvirus type 1, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus type 3, and coronavirus titers and health outcomes when administered concurrently with a modified live respiratory vaccine upon arrival at a feedlot. Treatment groups included a control (saline; <i>n</i> = 135) and an experimental group (injectable meloxicam; <i>n</i> = 136). Viral antibody titers and body weight were measured on arrival, day 7, and day 21, along with a final weight on day 45. Body weight and antibody titers for all viruses increased over time (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001); however, there were no differences by treatment group or a significant group Ãƒâ€” time interaction when evaluated using repeated measures analysis of variance. Interestingly, the use of meloxicam was associated with increased treatment risk (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, the administration of meloxicam may adversely affect health; however, a decreased vaccine response is likely not a contributing factor.

"Pregnant in the United States in the COVID-19 pandemic: A collision of crises we cannot ignore","NO abstract intended, Introduction is listed here The COVID-19 pandemic and call for social justice is occurring when the United States, unlike its peer countries, has already experienced a steady 20-year rise in maternal morbidity and mortality with pregnant women today facing a 50 percent higher risk of mortality than their mothers. 1 Most vulnerable are women of color, black and American Indian/Alaska Native women, who have experienced longstanding disparities in access to and quality of healthcare and may begin pregnancy with hypertension, diabetes, and obesity, complications known to be more common in women enduring segregation. 2-4 Initially, the race-related health disparities and resultant disproportionately higher rates of COVID-19 cases and mortality in indigenous communities and black, latinx, or other communities of color were mistakenly considered innate racial differences. More recently, these higher rates have been attributed to underlying social, structural, and environmental determinants of health including resource inequities, inadequate housing, and occupational and environmental hazards that result in greater exposure to and less protection from COVID-19. 5,6 Augmented by the added physiologic stress of pregnancy, these comorbidities and disparities compound the risk of pregnancy-associated cardiomyopathy, thromboembolism, and hemorrhage, often resulting in lasting physical and mental health consequences.","Stratton, Gorodetsky, Clayton","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnma.2021.03.008","20210422","COVID-19 pandemic; Maternal morbidity and mortality; Medical comorbidities; Racial disparities; Social justice","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-23","",13122,""

"Promoting Population Behavioral Health in a Safety-Net Health System During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has been expected to lead to substantial increases in need for behavioral health care. A population health framework can facilitate the development of interventions and policies to promote the equitable distribution of care across the population. This column describes the application of population behavioral health principles in a safety-net health system during the pandemic. The approach includes stepped models of care, interventions to target individuals at high behavioral health risk, and measurement-based care. Early data suggest that these strategies have resulted in expanded behavioral health care capacity.","Lim, Fulwiler, Carson, Huang, Robinson, Schuman-Olivier, O'Brien, Wang, Tepper","https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.202000546","20210422","COVID-19; community health services; mental health services; population health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-23","",13124,""

"Parent-for-child Mask Wearing Behavior during the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Investigation of Attitudes, Beliefs and Norms using the Theory of Planned Behavior","Background: Mask continue to be a necessity until a large proportion of the population, including children, receive immunizations for COVID-19. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between parental attitudes and beliefs about masks and parent-for-child mask behavior using the Theory of Planned Behavior. Method: We administered a survey in August 2020 to parents of school-aged children residing in the United States and Canada. Measures included sociodemographic variables for the parent and child, attitudes, norms and perceived control over childrenâ€™s mask use, and enforcement of mask wearing among children (also titled â€œparent-for-child mask behaviorâ€). Data were anlyzed using structural equation modelling. Results: We collected data from 866 parents and 43.5% had children with pre-existing health conditions (e.g., allergies, anxiety, impulsivity, skin sensitivity, asthma) that made extended mask wearing difficult. Among the full sample, negative attitudes (ÃŸ=-.20, p = .006), norms (ÃŸ = .41, p = .002), and perceived control (ÃŸ = .33, p = .006) predicted intentions. Norms (ÃŸ = .50, p = .004) and intentions (ÃŸ = .28, p = .003) also predicted parent-for-child mask use, while attitudes and perceived control did not. Intentions mediated the associations between the predictors (attitudes, norms, perceived control) and outcome (mask behavior). Subgroup analyses revelaved intentions as the key predictor of parent-for-child mask use among children with pre-conditions and norms as the key predictor among children without pre-conditions. Conclusion: Future public health messaging should target parental intentions, attitudes and beliefs about masks wearing among children.","Adina Coroiu et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46200-F18-FF3","20210422","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; protective behavior; covid-19; theory of planned behavior; parent-for-child behavior; mask use","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-23","",13126,""
