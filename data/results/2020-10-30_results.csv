"COVID-19 collateral: Indirect acute effects of the pandemic on physical and mental health in the UK","Background: Concerns have been raised that the response to the UK COVID-19 pandemic may have worsened physical and mental health, and reduced use of health services. However, the scale of the problem is unquantified, impeding development of effective mitigations. We asked what has happened to general practice contacts for acute physical and mental health outcomes during the pandemic? Methods: Using electronic health records from the Clinical Research Practice Datalink (CPRD) Aurum (2017-2020), we calculated weekly primary care contacts for selected acute physical and mental health conditions (including: anxiety, depression, acute alcohol-related events, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] exacerbations, cardiovascular and diabetic emergencies). We used interrupted time series (ITS) analysis to formally quantify changes in conditions after the introduction of population-wide restrictions ('lockdown') compared to the period prior to their introduction in March 2020. Findings: The overall population included 9,863,903 individuals on 1st January 2017. Primary care contacts for all conditions dropped dramatically after introduction of population-wide restrictions. By July 2020, except for unstable angina and acute alcohol-related events, contacts for all conditions had not recovered to pre-lockdown levels. The largest reductions were for contacts for: diabetic emergencies (OR: 0.35, 95% CI: 0.25-0.50), depression (OR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.52-0.53), and self-harm (OR: 0.56, 95% CI: 0.54-0.58). Interpretation: There were substantial reductions in primary care contacts for acute physical and mental conditions with restrictions, with limited recovery by July 2020. It is likely that much of the deficit in care represents unmet need, with implications for subsequent morbidity and premature mortality. The conditions we studied are sufficiently severe that any unmet need will have substantial ramifications for the people experiencing the conditions and healthcare provision. Maintaining access must be a key priority in future public health planning (including further restrictions).

"Mental Health Impact of the First Wave of COVID-19 Pandemic on Spanish Healthcare Workers: a Large Cross-sectional Survey","Introduction: Healthcare workers are vulnerable to adverse mental health impacts of COVID-19. We assessed prevalence of mental disorders and associated factors during the first wave of the pandemic among healthcare professionals in Spain. Methods: All workers in 18 healthcare institutions (6 AACC) in Spain were invited to a series of online surveys assessing a wide range of individual characteristics, COVID-19 infection status and exposure, and mental health status. Here we report: current mental disorders (Major Depressive Disorder-MDD- [PHQ-8 [&ge;] 10], Generalized Anxiety Disorder-GAD- [GAD-7 [&ge;] 10], Panic attacks, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder -PTSD- [PCL-5 [&ge;] 7]; and Substance Use Disorder -SUD-[CAGE-AID[&ge;]2]. Severe disability assessed by the Sheehan Disability Scale was used to identify ""disabling"" current mental disorders. Results: 9,138 healthcare workers participated. Prevalence of screen-positive disorder: 28.1% MDD; 22.5% GAD, 24.0% Panic; 22.2% PTSD; and 6.2% SUD. Overall 45.7% presented any current and 14.5% any disabling current mental disorder. Healthcare workers with prior lifetime mental disorders had almost twice the prevalence of current disorders than those without. Adjusting for all other variables, odds of any disabling mental disorder were: prior lifetime disorders (TUS: OR=5.74; 95%CI 2.53-13.03; Mood: OR=3.23; 95%CI:2.27-4.60; Anxiety: OR=3.03; 95%CI:2.53-3.62); age category 18-29 years (OR=1.36; 95%CI:1.02-1.82), caring ""all of the time"" for COVID-19 patients (OR=5.19; 95%CI: 3.61-7.46), female gender (OR=1.58; 95%CI: 1.27-1.96) and having being in quarantine or isolated (OR= 1.60; 95CI:1.31-1.95). Conclusions: Current mental disorders were very frequent among Spanish healthcare workers during the first wave of COVID-19. As the pandemic enters its second wave, careful monitoring and support is needed for healthcare workers, especially those with previous mental disorders and those caring COVID-19 very often.","Jordi Alonso; Gemma Vilagut; Philippe Mortier; Montse Ferrer; Itxaso Alayo; AndrÃ©s AragÃ³n-PeÃ±a; Enric AragonÃ¨s; Mireia Campos; Isabel del Cura-GonzÃ¡lez; JosÃ© I.

"The COVID-19 Healthcare Personnel Study (CHPS): Overview, Methods and Preliminary Report","Introduction. The COVID-19 Healthcare Personnel Study (CHPS) was designed to assess and mitigate adverse short and long-term physical and mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on New York's health care workforce. Here we report selected baseline results. Methods. Online survey of New York State physicians, nurse practitioners and physician assistants registered with the New York State Department of Health. Survey-weighted descriptive results were analyzed using frequencies, proportions, and means, with 95% confidence intervals. Odds ratios were calculated for association using survey-weighted logistic regression. Results. Approximately 51.5% (95% CI 49.1, 54.0) of the survey-weighted respondents reported having worked directly or in close physical contact with COVID-19 patients. Of those tested for COVID-19, 27.3% (95% CI 22.5, 32.2) were positive. Having symptoms consistent with COVID-19 was associated with reporting a subsequent positive COVID-19 test (OR=14.0, 95% CI 5.7, 34.7). Over half of the respondents, (57.6%) reported a negative impact of the COVID-19 efforts on their mental health. Respondents who indicated that they were redeployed or required to do different functions than usual in response to COVID-19 were more likely to report negative mental health impacts (OR=1.3, 95% CI 1.1, 1.6). Conclusions. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York State in Spring 2020, more than half of physicians, nurse practitioners and physician assistants included in this study responded to the crisis, often at a cost to their physical and mental health and disruption to their lives.","- The COVID-19 Healthcare Personnel Study (CHPS); Charles DiMaggio; David Abramson; Ezra Susser; Christina Hoven; Qixuan Chen; Howard Andrews; Daniel Herman; Jonah Kreniske; Megan Ryan; Ida Susser; Lorna Thorpe; Guohua Li","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.29.20222372","20201030","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-30","",6519,""
"The psychological impact of coronavirus on university students and its socio-economic determinants in Malaysia","This article examines the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) upon university students anxiety level and finds the factors associated with the anxiety disorder in Malaysia. We collected data from 958 students from 16 different universities using an originally designed questionnaire. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale 7-item (GAD-7) was used to estimate the anxiety. We find that 12.3% students were normal, whereas 30.5% were experiencing mild, 31.1% moderate,and 26.1% severe anxiety. Surprisingly, only 37.2% of students were aware of mental health support which was provided by their universities. Moreover,it was found that gender as male (Odds Ratio (OR= 0.798, 95% Confidence Interval (CI)= 0.61-1.04)) and having internet access (OR = 0.44, 95% CI= 0.24-0.80) were alleviating factors for the anxiety. Whereas, age above than 20 years (OR= 1.30, 95% CI= 0.96-1.75), ethnicity Chinese (OR=1.72, 95% CI= 0.95-3.1), any other disease (OR=2.0, 95% CI=1.44-2.79), decreased family income (OR=1.71, 95% CI=1.34-2.17), more time spent on watching COVID-19 related news (OR=1.52, 95% CI=1.17-1.97), and infected relative or friends (OR=1.62, 95% CI=1.06-2.50) were risk factors for anxiety among students. We suggest that the government of Malaysia should monitor the mental health of the university students more closely and universities should open online mental health support clinics to avoid the adverse impacts of the anxiety disorder.","Muhammad Irfan; Faizah Shahudin; VINCENT HOOPER; Waqar Akram; Rosmaiza Ghani","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.27.20220723","20201030","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-30","",6520,""
"Rapid Support for older adults during the initial stages of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Results from a Geriatric Psychiatry helpline","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic and governmental lockdown measures disproportionally impacts older adults. This study presents the results from a psychiatric helpline for older adults in Mannheim, Germany, during the lockdown, set up to provide information and psychosocial support measures. We aim to elucidate the needs of older adults, their reported changes and the psychological impact during the initial stages of the health crisis. Methods: 55 older adults called the psychiatric helpline between April and June 2020. Information on demographics, previous diagnosis of psychiatric and somatic diseases as well as changes in daily life due to the pandemic was collected anonymously. Current mental health status was assessed using the depression HAMD-7 and the anxiety HAM-A scales. Results: Most callers were women, older adults (M = 74.69 years), single and retired. 69% of callers reported new or an increase in psychiatric symptoms, with anxiety and depressive symptoms being the most common ones. Age was significantly negatively correlated to higher levels of anxiety and depression symptoms. Individuals with a previous diagnosis of a psychiatric disease reported significantly higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms than those without a diagnosis. Conclusion: In older adults, the perceived psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis appears to ameliorate with age. Individuals with a history of psychiatric disease are most vulnerable to negative mental health outcomes. Rapid response in the form of a geriatric helpline are useful initiatives to support the needs and the psychological well-being of older adults during a health crisis.","Anna-Sophia Wahl; Gloria S.

"For the Greater Good? The Devastating Ripple Effects of the Covid-19 Crisis","As the crisis around Covid-19 evolves, it becomes clear that there are numerous negative side-effects of the lockdown strategies implemented by many countries  Currently, more evidence becomes available that the lockdowns may have more negative effects than positive effects  For instance, many measures taken in a lockdown aimed at protecting human life may compromise the immune system, and purpose in life, especially of vulnerable groups  This leads to the paradoxical situation of compromising the immune system and physical and mental health of many people, including the ones we aim to protect  Also, it is expected that hundreds of millions of people will die from hunger and postponed medical treatments  Other side effects include financial insecurity of billions of people, physical and mental health problems, and increased inequalities  The economic and health repercussions of the crisis will be falling disproportionately on young workers, low-income families and women, and thus exacerbate existing inequalities  As the virus outbreak and media coverage spread fear and anxiety, superstition, cognitive dissonance reduction and conspiracy theories are ways to find meaning and reduce anxiety  These behavioral aspects may play a role in the continuance of lockdown decisions  Based on theories regarding agnotology (i e , the ways ignorance or doubt about certain topics is created by means of withholding or presenting information in a certain way), social influence, superstition and stress and coping, I seek to explain the social and behavioral aspects of human behavior in times of crises  Both the Covid-19 crisis itself as well as the resulting economic and (mental) health crisis are global problems that may require global solutions  I present a model of drivers and outcomes of lockdown behaviors and offer suggestions and a tool to counteract the negative psychological effects by means of online life crafting therapeutic writing interventions  Â© Copyright Â© 2020 Schippers","Schippers, M.

"Levels and variables associated with psychological distress during confinement due to the coronavirus pandemic in a community sample of Spanish adults","Due to the Covid-19 pandemic's consequences and the state of alarm, literature has shown that people worldwide have experienced severe stressors that have been associated with increased prevalence of emotional distress. In this study we explored psychological distress (depression, anxiety, and somatization symptoms) using an online survey platform in a sample of 1781 Spanish adults during the confinement due to COVID-19, relationships between distress and sleep problems, affect, pain, sleep, emotional regulation, gender, type of housing, history of psychopathology, and living alone during the confinement, and differences depending on demographic and psychological variables. Results showed that between 25-39% of the sample referred to clinically significant levels of distress. In addition, women showed higher levels of distress, negative affect, perception of pain, and cognitive reappraisal, and lower levels of emotional suppression and sleep quality than men. A history of psychopathology, being younger, living alone or in a flat was associated with higher distress. Finally, the variables most strongly related to distress were negative and positive affect, levels of pain, sleep quality, and emotional suppression. Our results highlight the important role of emotional suppression, cognitive reappraisal, and loneliness, and the impact of being a woman and younger in Spain during the Covid -19 pandemic. Therefore, it would be necessary to provide assessments of distress levels in these population groups and focus psychological preventive and therapeutic online interventions on expressing emotions and preventing loneliness.","PÃƒÂ©rez, Masegoso, HernÃƒÂ¡ndez-Espeso","https://doi.org/10.1002/cpp.2523","20201029","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-30","",6554,""

"Twitter discussions and emotions about COVID-19 pandemic: a machine learning approach","Public response to the COVID-19 pandemic is important to be measured. Twitter data are an important source for the infodemiology study of public response monitoring. The objective of the study is to examine coronavirus disease (COVID-19) related discussions, concerns, and sentiments that emerged from tweets posted by Twitter users. We analyze 4 million Twitter messages related to the COVID-19 pandemic using a list of 20 hashtags such as &quot;coronavirus,&quot; &quot;COVID-19,&quot; &quot;quarantine&quot; from March 7 to April 21 in 2020. We use a machine learning approach, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to identify popular unigram, bigrams, salient topics and themes, and sentiments in the collected tweets. Popular unigrams include &quot;virus,&quot; &quot;lockdown,&quot; and &quot;quarantine.&quot; Popular bigrams include &quot;COVID-19,&quot; &quot;stay home,&quot; &quot;corona virus,&quot; &quot;social distancing,&quot; and &quot;new cases.&quot; We identify 13 discussion topics and categorize them into 5 different themes, such as &quot;public health measures to slow the spread of COVID-19,&quot; &quot;social stigma associated with COVID-19,&quot; &quot;coronavirus news cases and deaths,&quot; &quot;COVID-19 in the United States,&quot; and &quot;coronavirus cases in the rest of the world.&quot; Across all identified topics, the dominant sentiments for the spread of coronavirus are anticipation that measures that can be taken, followed by a mixed feeling of trust, anger, and fear for different topics. The public reveals a significant feeling of fear when discussing the coronavirus new cases and deaths than other topics. The study shows that Twitter data and machine learning approaches can be leveraged for infodemiology study by studying the evolving public discussions and sentiments during the COVID-19. As the situation evolves rapidly, several topics are consistently dominant on Twitter, such as &quot;the confirmed cases and death rates,&quot; &quot;preventive measures,&quot; &quot;health authorities and government policies,&quot; &quot;COVID-19 stigma,&quot; and &quot;negative psychological reactions (e.g., fear).&quot; Real-time monitoring and assessment of the Twitter discussions and concerns can be promising for public health emergency responses and planning.

"Racial disparities in medication use: imperatives for managed care pharmacy","The COVID-19 pandemic and the social unrest pervading U.S. cities in response to the killings of George Floyd and other Black citizens at the hands of police are historically significant. These events exemplify dismaying truths about race and equality in the United States. Racial health disparities are an inexcusable lesion on the U.S. health care system. Many health disparities involve medications, including antidepressants, anticoagulants, diabetes medications, drugs for dementia, and statins, to name a few. Managed care pharmacy has a role in perpetuating racial disparities in medication use. For example, pharmacy benefit designs are increasingly shifting costs of expensive medications to patients, creating affordability crises for lower income workers, who are disproportionally persons of color. In addition, the quest to maximize rebates serves to inflate list prices paid by the uninsured, among which Black and Hispanic people are overrepresented. While medication cost is a foremost barrier for many patients, other factors also propagate racial disparities in medication use. Even when cost sharing is minimal or zero, medication adherence rates have been documented to be lower among Blacks as compared with Whites. Deeper understandings are needed about how racial disparities in medication use are influenced by factors such as culture, provider bias, and patient trust in medical advice. Managed care pharmacy can address racial disparities in medication use in several ways. First, it should be acknowledged that racial disparities in medication use are pervasive and must be resolved urgently. We must not believe that entrenched health system, societal, and political structures are impermeable to change. Second, the voices of community members and their advocates must be amplified. Coverage policies, program designs, and quality initiatives should be developed in consultation with those directly affected by racial disparities. Third, the industry should commit to dramatically reducing patient cost sharing for essential medication therapies. Federal and state efforts to limit annual out-of-pocket pharmacy spending should be supported, even though increased premiums may be an undesirable (yet more equitable) consequence. Finally, information about race should be incorporated into all internal and external reporting and quality improvement activities. <b>DISCLOSURES:</b> No funding was received for the development of this manuscript.

"Virtual mental health care in the Veterans Health Administration's immediate response to coronavirus disease-19","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has increased the need for psychological care in the global population and has created new barriers to accessing services. Hospitals, mental health facilities, and other clinics face the challenge of providing continued care to a population that is under severe stress, while minimizing in-person visits that risk spreading the virus. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is the largest integrated health care system in the United States, providing care at 1,286 sites. VHA ensured the continuity of mental health services after the COVID-19 outbreak by rapidly expanding its use of telemental health methods in the first weeks after the U.S. pandemic outbreak. VHA provided nearly 1.2 million telephone and video encounters to veterans in April 2020 and reduced in-person visits by approximately 80% when compared with the October 2019 to February 2020 period before the pandemic. By June 2020, VHA had an 11-fold increase in encounters using direct-to-home video and a fivefold increase in telephone contacts relative to before the pandemic. This article discusses research on the effectiveness of telemental health, VHA policies before COVID-19 that facilitated the use of telemental health systemwide, and VHA's actions that rapidly scaled use of telemental health during the first months of the outbreak. Key challenges and lessons learned from VHA's experience and implications for providers and health care systems regarding the use of telemental health to meet patients' mental health care needs during the pandemic are also discussed.

"Adolescent Patient Engagement Through Telepsychiatry: A Case Report Application","The COVID-19 pandemic has changed psychopharmacological prescribing and management of patients around the world. Social distancing requirements led to a transition from face-to-face patient visits to telepsychiatry. Relaxed federal reimbursement policies during the COVID-19 pandemic expanded patient awareness and access to virtual care. For many psychiatric advanced practice RNs (APRNs), the transition to telepsychiatry was intended as a temporary solution until it is possible to return to in-person patient care. Instead, virtual care has become an expectation of patients and agencies. The current article presents a case study example of an adolescent psychiatric patient, exploring the challenges of therapeutic alliance, patient engagement, psychiatric evaluation, laboratory orders, deprescribing, and psychopharmacological adherence. The case study discusses considerations for APRNs who use telemental health in child and adolescent psychiatry and resources for clinical practice.

"Adaptation of a Digital Health Innovation to Prevent Relapse and Support Recovery in Youth Receiving Services for First-Episode Psychosis: Results From the Horyzons-Canada Phase 1 Study","Developing a digital health innovation can require a substantial amount of financial and human resource investment before it can be scaled for implementation across geographical, cultural, and health care contexts. As such, there is an increased interest in leveraging eHealth innovations developed and tested in one country or jurisdiction and using these innovations in local settings. However, limited knowledge exists on the processes needed to appropriately adapt digital health innovations to optimize their transferability across geographical, cultural, and contextual settings. We report on the results of an adaptation study of Horyzons, a digital health innovation originally developed and tested in Australia. Horyzons is designed to prevent relapses and support recovery in young people receiving services for first-episode psychosis (FEP). The aim of this study is to assess the initial acceptability of Horyzons and adapt it in preparation for pilot testing in Canada. This research took place in 2 specialized early intervention clinics for FEP, located in 1 urban and 1 urban-rural setting, in 2 Canadian provinces. A total of 26 participants were recruited: 15 clinicians (age range 26-56 years) and 11 patients (age range 19-37 years). Following the digital health adaptation framework developed by our team, we used a mixed methods approach, combining descriptive quantitative and qualitative methods across 3 stages of data collection (focus groups, interviews, and consultations), analysis, and adaptations. Overall, patients and clinicians appreciated the strengths-based approach and social media features of Horyzons. However, participants expressed concerns related to implementation, especially in relation to capacity (eg, site moderation, crisis management, internet speed in rural locations). They also provided suggestions for adapting content and features, for example, in relation to community resources, volume of text, universal accessibility (eg, for individuals with limitations in vision), and optimization of platform accessibility through mobile devices. Additional aspects of the innovation were flagged for adaptation during the final stages of preparing it for live implementation. These included terms of use, time zone configuration to reflect local time and date, safety and moderation protocols, the need help now feature, and the list of trigger words to flag posts indicative of potential risk. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and public health guidelines for social distancing, there is an increasing interest and need to leverage the internet and mobile technologies for delivering youth mental health services. As countries look to one another for guidance on how to navigate changing social dynamics, knowledge on how to utilize and adapt existing innovations across contexts is now more important than ever. Using a systematic approach, this study illustrates the methods, processes, results, and lessons learned on adapting a digital health innovation to enhance its local acceptability.

"Priority concerns for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic","The approach taken to support individuals during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic needs to take into account the requirements of people with intellectual disabilities and/or autism, who represent a major vulnerable group, with higher rates of co-occurring health conditions and a greater risk of dying prematurely. To date, little evidence on COVID-related concerns have been produced and no report has provided structured feedback from the point of view of people with intellectual disabilities and/or autism or of their family/carers. To provide systemised evidence-based information of the priority concerns for people with intellectual disabilities and/or autism regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. Senior representatives of major UK-based professional and service-user representative organisations with a stake in the care of people with intellectual disabilities and/or autism were contacted to provide a list of concerns across three domains: 'mental health and challenging behaviour', 'physical health and epilepsy' and 'social circumstances and support'. The feedback was developed into statements on frequently reported priorities. These statements were then rated independently by expert clinicians. A video-conference meeting to reconcile outliers and to generate a consensus statement list was held. Thirty-two organisations were contacted, of which 26 (81%) replied. From the respondent's data, 30 draft consensus statements were generated. Following expert clinician review, there was initially strong consensus for seven statements (23%), increasing to 27 statements (90%) following video conferencing. These recommendations highlight the expectations of people with intellectual disabilities and/or autism in the current pandemic. This could support policymakers and professionals' deliver and evidence person-centred care.","Tromans, Kinney, Chester, Alexander, Roy, Sander, Dudson, Shankar","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2020.122","20201029","COVID-19; autism; developmental disability; intellectual disability","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-30","",6561,""
"Fear of COVID-19 scale: Validity, reliability and factorial invariance in Argentina's general population","This study evaluated the psychometric properties of the Scale of Fear of COVID-19 (FCV-19S) in a sample of 1,291 Argentines. The two-related factor structure of the FCV-19S had satisfactory goodness-of-fit indices using structural equation modeling and item response theory. Further results showed that the reliability was adequate, the factor structure was strictly invariable across age groups, and the model that evaluated the relationships between fear of COVID-19, anxiety, and depression had adequate goodness of fit indices as well. The results indicated that FCV-19S has strong psychometric properties to measure fear of COVID-19 in the general population of Argentina.","Caycho-RodrÃƒÂ­guez, Vilca, Cervigni, Gallegos, Martino, Portillo, BarÃƒÂ©s, Calandra, Burgos Videla","https://doi.org/10.1080/07481187.2020.1836071","20201029","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-30","",6562,""
"Targeting sedentary behavior as a feasible health strategy during COVID-19","Sedentary behavior is associated with poor physical and mental health. Targeting sedentary behavior is a simple strategy that may help counter physical and mental health concerns associated with COVID-19-related social restrictions. Of course, traditional strategies such as achieving optimal exercise and physical activity levels are also important and should be recommended. However, even under normal circumstances, the difficulty in promoting lasting exercise habits at multiple levels (e.g. individual, environment, policy) are well documented, and chances of maintaining or improving these factors is now even lower. Thus, relative to other lifestyle behaviors - sedentary behavior may be more amenable to change. Moreover, reducing sedentary behavior may be less susceptible to influence from factors associated with health disparities such as age, race, and socio-economic status compared to exercise or physical activity. Sedentary behavior is a feasible health strategy that should be targeted during COVID-19.","Zieff, Bates, Kerr, Moore, Hanson, Battaglini, Stoner","https://doi.org/10.1093/tbm/ibaa101","20201029","COVID-19; Lifestyle behaviors; Mental health; Physical health; Sedentary behavior; Socioecological model","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-30","",6563,""
"[Mental health status and its influencing factors among general population and medical personnel in Guangdong Province during COVID-19 pandemic]","To investigate the mental health status and its influencing factors among general population and healthcare professionals in Guangdong Province during COVID-19 pandemic. A online questionnaire-based survey was conducted from March 11st to March 15th, 2020.The questionnaire consisted of 4 parts to survey the participants'basic information, understanding of COVID-19 outbreak-associated information, cognition of COVID-19 pandemic and status of anxiety and depression.A total of 1433 valid responses were collected, including 706 from the general population and 727 from healthcare professionals.Cronbach's ÃŽÂ± coefficient and exploratory factor analysis were used for reliability and validity assessment.Chi-square, Wilcoxon and Kruskal-Wallis test were used for univariate analysis and ordinal or nominal logistic regression was used for multivariate analysis of the data. There was no significant difference between the general population and the healthcare professionals in terms of anxiety, depression and cognition of COVID-19 outbreak after adjustment for demographic variables, but the levels of anxiety and depression of these participants were both higher than those before the pandemic.In the participants from the general population, multivariate logistic regressions showed an OR for anxiety of 1.93(1.18, 3.17) among those who spent 1-2 h a day in reading COVID-19-related news, while those who spent over 3 h had an OR value for anxiety of 1.88(1.14, 3.11);the unmarried individuals had a depression OR of 2.19(1.51, 3.18). Inaccurate cognition of COVID-19 outbreak was positive correlated with the occurrence of anxiety and depression.Unmarried individuals and those with higher educational levels had better cognition of COVID-19 outbreak.Among the healthcare professionals, multivariate logistic regressions suggested that insufficient rest time and worries about contracting the virus contributed to the occurrence of anxiety and depression.Among the nursing staff, the OR of obvious depression was 2.99(1.45, 6.18).Compared to healthcare professionals not working in designated hospital for COVID-19, those who work in the designated hospitals had ORs for obvious and severe depression of 0.48(0.25, 0.93) and 0.39(0.17, 0.89), respectively.Concerns over contracting the virus increased the possibility of incorrect cognition of COVID-19. Psychological interventions are essential for both the general population and healthcare professionals, especially for unmarried individuals in the general population and the nursing staff.An excessive exposure to COVID-19-related information may have detrimental effects on the mental health.For healthcare professionals, sufficient rest needs to be ensured, and education programs on COVID-19 should be implemented among both residents and healthcare professionals to improve their mental health.","Liu, Zhang, LÃƒÂ¼, Liang, Deng, Feng","https://doi.org/10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2020.10.22","20201029","coronavirus disease 2019; general population; healthcare professionals; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-30","",6564,""
"Relationships between changes in self-reported physical activity, sedentary behaviour and health during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in France and Switzerland","To assess whether changes in physical activity and sedentary behaviour during the COVID-19 lockdown are associated with changes in mental and physical health. Observational longitudinal study. Participants living in France or Switzerland responded to online questionnaires measuring physical activity, physical and mental health, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Paired sample t-tests were used to assess differences in physical activity and sedentary behaviour before and during lockdown. Multiple linear regressions were used to investigate associations between changes in physical activity and changes in mental and physical health during lockdown. 267 (wave1) and 110 participants (wave2; 2 weeks later) were recruited. Lockdown resulted in higher time spent in walking and moderate physical activity (~10min/day) and in sedentary behaviour (~75min/day), compared to pre COVID-19. Increased physical activity during leisure time from week 2 to week 4 of lockdown was associated with improved physical health (ÃŽÂ²=.24, <i>p</i>=.002). Additionally, an increase in sedentary behaviour during leisure time was associated with poorer physical health (ÃŽÂ²=-.35, <i>p</i>=.002), mental health (ÃŽÂ²=-.25, <i>p</i>=.003), and subjective vitality (ÃŽÂ²=-.30, <i>p</i>=.004).

"Parkinson's Disease Remote Patient Monitoring During the COVID-19 Lockdown","<b>Objective:</b> To evaluate the feasibility of a smartphone remote patient monitoring approach in a real-life Parkinson's disease (PD) cohort during the Italian COVID-19 lockdown. <b>Methods:</b> Fifty-four non-demented PD patients who were supposed to attend the outpatient March clinic were recruited for a prospective study. All patients had a known UPDRS-III and a modified Hoehn and Yahr (H&amp;Y) score and were provided with a smartphone application capable of providing indicators of gait, tapping, tremor, memory and executive functions. Different questionnaires exploring non-motor symptoms and quality of life were administered through phone-calls. Patients were asked to run the app at least twice per week (i.e., full compliance). Subjects were phone-checked weekly throughout a 3-week period for compliance and final satisfaction questionnaires. <b>Results:</b> Forty-five patients (83.3%) ran the app at least once; Twenty-nine (53.7%) subjects were half-compliant, while 16 (29.6%) were fully compliant. Adherence was hindered by technical issues or digital illiteracy (38.7%), demotivation (24%) and health-related issues (7.4%). Ten patients (18.5%) underwent PD therapy changes. The main factors related to lack of compliance included loss of interest, sadness, anxiety, the absence of a caregiver, the presence of falls and higher H&amp;Y. Gait, tapping, tremor and cognitive application outcomes were correlated to disease duration, UPDRS-III and H&amp;Y. <b>Discussion:</b> The majority of patients were compliant and satisfied by the provided monitoring program. Some of the application outcomes were statistically correlated to clinical parameters, but further validation is required. Our pilot study suggested that the available technologies could be readily implemented even with the current population's technical and intellectual resources.","Motolese, Magliozzi, Puttini, Rossi, Capone, Karlinski, Stark-Inbar, Yekutieli, Di Lazzaro, Marano","https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2020.567413","20201029","COVID; Parkinson's disease (PD); remote patient monitoring (RPM); smartphone; telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-30","",6568,""

"Nexus planning as a pathway towards sustainable environmental and human health post Covid-19","The Covid-19 pandemic has exposed the fragility of linear and monocentric approaches in addressing today's complex, cross-cutting, and interconnected challenges. Experiences from the Covid-19 have shown that focusing on one sector during a crisis only aggravates the stresses in other sectors as decision-makers often view the world from a linear perspective, with the thought that a click of a button would get the economy and society back on track. This study argues that linearity forgets the interconnectedness of systems and how their systemic properties shape their interactions, interdependencies, and interrelationships, whereas nexus planning integrates and simplifies socio-ecological systems, indicates priority areas for intervention, and reduces risk and vulnerability. The lockdowns implemented during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic resulted in job losses, company closures, and economic recessions, demonstrating that linear approaches often over-emphasise on a limited set of attributes of a system, notably efficiency, at the expense of other aspects. While linear approaches have been beneficial to some extent for long, the Covid-19 pandemic exposed how they transfer stresses to other sectors, and compromise resilience-building initiatives, allowing failure to cascade from one sector to the other. Nexus planning emphasises on cross-sectoral sustainability and enhances socio-economic resilience against future shocks.","Nhamo, Ndlela","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.110376","20201029","Covid-19; Nexus thinking; Public health; Resilience; Risk management; Zoonoses","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-30","",6570,""

We aimed to investigate the serial mediation effect of insomnia and exhaustion in the relationship between secondary traumatic stress (STS) and mental health complaints among the frontline healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this cross-sectional study, 126 frontline healthcare workers from Romania completed validated surveys between March and April 2020. PROCESS macros were used to test the proposed hypotheses of the three-path mediation model. We computed the models for insomnia as the first mediator (M1) and exhaustion (M2) as our second mediator. STS was significantly related to insomnia. Insomnia was significantly related to exhaustion, and STS was positively related to exhaustion. In the third model, exhaustion was strongly and positively related to mental health complaints. The total indirect effect was positive, and the sequential indirect impact of STS on mental health complaints via both mediators in series (insomnia and exhaustion) was significant. Secondary traumatic stress had a positive direct effect on mental health complaints. In our limited sample, the results show that frontline medical staff during the COVID-19 outbreak have high STS, which are related to mental health complaints through insomnia and exhaustion.","Secosan, Virga, Crainiceanu, Bratu","https://doi.org/10.3390/bs10110164","20201029","SARS COV-2; exhaustion; frontline clinicians; insomnia; mental health; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-30","",6574,""
"Insomnia, Perceived Stress, and Family Support among Nursing Staff during the Pandemic Crisis","The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to cause mental health issues, especially for healthcare professionals. The aim of this study was to investigate levels of perceived stress, insomnia, and the sense of family support among nurses in pandemic conditions. We administered in a sample of 150 nurses from different hospital departments during the COVID-19 pandemic the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and Family Support Scale (FSS). Individual and demographic data were recorded. In total, 120 women and 30 men completed the study questionnaires. Almost half of the participants (49.7%) reported the presence of insomnia and more than half (50.3%) experienced increased stress levels. Scores on the Athens Insomnia Scale correlated positively with Perceived Stress Scale scores (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01), and negatively with Family Support Scale scores (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). Significantly negative correlations were observed among scores on the Perceived Stress Scale and the Family Support Scale (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). The regression models revealed that 'scores on Perceived Stress Scale' and 'years of work experience' were significant predictors of 'scores on Athens Insomnia Scale', each explaining 43.6% and 2.3% of the variance. 'Scores on Athens Insomnia Scale' and 'scores on Family Support Scale' were significant predictors of 'scores on Perceived Stress Scale', explaining 43.7% and 9.2% of the variance. In conclusion, we confirmed that working with COVID-19 patients has a negative impact on the sleep of nurses, possibly mediated by increased levels of stress. Family support, as a protective factor, appears to moderate the deleterious consequences of stress.","Tselebis, Lekka, Sikaras, Tsomaka, Tassopoulos, Ilias, Bratis, Pachi","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare8040434","20201029","COVID-19; family support; insomnia; nurses; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-30","",6575,""

We tested SCOVID scale content validity with 19 experts. For factorial and construct validity, reliability, and measurement error, we administered the 20-item SCOVID scale to a sample of 461 Italians in May/June 2020 (mean age: 48.8, SD Ã‚Â± 15.8). SCOVID scale item content validity ranged between 0.85-1.00, and the total scale content validity was 0.94. Confirmatory factor analysis supported SCOVID scale factorial validity (comparative fit index = 0.91; root mean square error of approximation = 0.05). Construct validity was supported by significant correlations with other instrument scores measuring self-efficacy, positivity, quality of life, anxiety, and depression. Reliability estimates were good with factor score determinacy, composite reliability, global reliability index, Cronbach's alpha, and test-retest reliability ranging between 0.71-0.91. The standard error of measurement was adequate. The SCOVID scale is a new instrument measuring self-care in the COVID-19 pandemic with adequate validity and reliability. The SCOVID scale can be used in practice and research for assessing self-care in the COVID-19 pandemic to preventing COVID-19 infection and maintaining wellbeing in the general population.","De Maria, Ferro, Ausili, Alvaro, De Marinis, Di Mauro, Matarese, Vellone","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17217834","20201029","COVID-19; infectious diseases; psychometrics; reliability; self-care; validity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-30","",6576,""

"An Analysis of Caller Behaviour to a Crisis Helpline Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The World Health Organisation declared an outbreak of the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) to be an international pandemic in March 2020. While new confirmed cases of the disease and death tolls rise at an alarming rate on a daily basis, there is concern that the pandemic and counteracting measures could cause an increase in distress amongst the public. Hence, there could be an increase in need for emotional support within the population, which is complicated further by the reduction of existing face-to-face mental health services as a result of measures taken to limit the spread of the virus. The objective was to determine whether the COVID-19 pandemic has had any influence in calls made to Samaritans Ireland. This study presents an analysis of calls made to Samaritans Ireland (a national crisis helpline within the Republic of Ireland) in a four-week period before the first confirmed case of COVID-19 (calls=41648, callers= 3752) and calls made to the service within a four-week period after a restrictive lockdown was imposed by the Republic of Ireland government (calls=46043, callers=3147). Statistical analysis was conducted to explore any differences in duration of calls between both periods at a global level and at an hourly level. K-means clustering was performed to determine the types of callers that avail of the helpline based on their helpline call usage behaviour and to assess the impact of the pandemic on caller type usage patterns. The analysis revealed that calls were of a longer duration in the post-lockdown period, in comparison with pre-COVID period. There were changes in the behaviour of individuals in the cluster types defined by caller behaviour, where some caller types tended towards making longer calls with the service in the post-lockdown period. There were also changes in caller behaviour patterns with regards to the time of day of the call, with variations in the duration of calls at particular times of day, where average call durations increased in the early hours of the morning. The results from this study highlight the impact of COVID-19 on a national crisis helpline service. Statistical differences were observed in caller behaviour between the pre- and active lockdown periods. The findings suggest that service users may perhaps have relied on crisis helpline services more during the lockdown period due to an increased sense of isolation, worsening of underlying mental illness due to the pandemic and reduced or overall removal of access to other support resources. Practical implications and limitations are discussed.","Turkington, Mulvenna, Bond, Ennis, Potts, Moore, Hamra, Morrissey, Isaksen, Scowcroft, O'Neill","https://doi.org/10.2196/22984","20201028","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-30","",6580,""
"The Relationship between Public Emotions and Rumors Spread during the COVID-19 Epidemic in China","In the context of COVID-19, various online rumors led to inappropriate behaviors in response to the epidemic among people, and adversely influenced people's physical and mental health. A better understanding of the relationship between public emotions and rumors during the epidemic may generate some useful strategies of guiding public emotions and dispelling rumors. To explore whether public emotions are related to the dissemination of at times online rumors in the context of COVID-19. Sina Weibo is a social media platform in China. We used Scrapy to gather the data from Weibo published by People's Daily after January 8, 2020, and netizens' comments under each Weibo post. Nearly one million comments were divided into five categories (anger, fear, happiness, sadness, and neutral) according to the emotional information in these contents by manual identification. Rumors data was collected through a platform &quot;Tencent myth busters&quot;. Cross-correlations analysis was used to examine the relationship between public emotions and rumors. The results indicated that the angrier the public got, the more rumors there would be, r = 0.48, P &lt; .001. Similar findings were found in the relationship between fear and rumors, r = 0.51, P &lt; .001; and the relationship between sadness and rumors, r = 0.47, P &lt; .001. Furthermore, we found that happiness lagged behind by one day with the increase of rumors, r = 0.56, P &lt; .001. In addition, our data showed that there was a significant positive correlation between fear and fearful rumors, r = 0.34, P = .02. Our findings provide several suggestions for relevant authorities and policy makers in guiding emotions of the public during public health emergencies. First, during a large-scale quarantine period, the authorities can use web-based monitoring to detect public emotions and behaviors in real time, and provide timely guidance to channel public emotions and behaviors, Second, rumors are a catalyst for public emotions, and disproving them timely would be helpful to increase positive emotions of the public. Third, media platforms should strengthen the monitoring of online rumors, identify and verify emotional rumors in a timely manner, and minimize the spread of fearful rumors to reduce the public's fear.","Dong, Tao, Xia, Xu, Ye, Jiang, Liu","https://doi.org/10.2196/21933","20201028","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-30","",6581,""
"Loneliness, Mental Health, and Substance Use among US Young Adults during COVID-19","As COVID-19 converges with loneliness and addiction epidemics in the US, both public health and mental health experts forecast dramatic increases in substance use and mental health conditions. This cross-sectional study evaluated relationships of loneliness with depression, anxiety, alcohol use, and drug use during COVID-19, and assessed perceived increases in these symptoms in young adults. Between April 22 and May 11, 2020, 1,008 participants ages 18-35 were recruited through social media to a one-time, online anonymous survey. Symptomatology was assessed using six scales. Perceived changes since COVID-19 were evaluated using 5-point Likert scales. Forty-nine percent of respondents reported loneliness scores above 50; 80% reported significant depressive symptoms; 61% reported moderate to severe anxiety; 30% disclosed harmful levels of drinking. While only 22% of the population reported using drugs, 38% reported severe drug use. Loneliness was associated with higher levels of mental health symptomatology. Participants reported significant increases across mental health and substance use symptoms since COVID-19. While direct impacts of COVID-19 could only be calculated with pre-pandemic assessments of these symptoms, estimates indicate elevated psychosocial symptomatology and suggest that symptoms could have worsened since the pandemic. Findings underscore the importance of prevention and intervention to address these public health problems.","Horigian, Schmidt, Feaster","https://doi.org/10.1080/02791072.2020.1836435","20201028","COVID-19; alcohol use; anxiety; depression; drug use; loneliness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-30","",6582,""
"N-Terminomics for the Identification of in vitro Substrates and Cleavage Site Specificity of the SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease","The genome of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, encodes for two proteases, a papain like (PL) protease and the so-called main protease (M<sup>pro</sup> ), a chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease, also named 3CL<sup>pro</sup> or non-structural protein 5 (nsp5). M<sup>pro</sup> is activated by autoproteolysis, and is the main protease responsible for cutting the viral polyprotein into functional units. Aside from this, it has been described that M<sup>pro</sup> proteases are also capable of processing host proteins, including those involved in the host innate immune response. To identify substrates of the three main proteases from SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and hCoV-NL63 coronviruses, we performed an LC-MS based N-terminomics in vitro analysis using recombinantly expressed proteases and lung epithelial and endothelial cell lysates as substrate pools. For SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> we identified 445 cleavage events from over 300 proteins, while 151 and 331 M<sup>pro</sup> derived cleavage events were identified for SARS-CoV and hCoV-NL63, respectively. These data enable to better understand the cleavage site specificity of the viral proteases and will help to identify novel substrates in vivo.

"Cognitive profile following COVID-19 infection: Clinical predictors leading to neuropsychological impairment","Cognitive manifestations associated with the severity of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection are unknown. An early detection of neuropsychological manifestations could modify the risk of subsequent irreversible impairment and further neurocognitive decline. In our single-center cohort study, we included all consecutive adult patients, aged between 20 and 60 years old with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Neuropsychological assessment was performed by the same trained neuropsychologist from April, 22nd through June 16th, 2020. Patients with previous known cognitive impairment, any central nervous system or psychiatric disease were excluded. Demographic, clinical, pharmacological and laboratory data were extracted from medical records. Thirty-five patients met inclusion criteria and were included in the study. Patients presenting headache, anosmia, dysgeusia, diarrhea and those who required oxygen therapy had lower scores in memory, attention and executive function subtests as compared to asymptomatic patients. Patients with headache and clinical hypoxia scored lower in the global Cognitive Index (PÃ‚Â Ã¢â‚¬â€¹=Ã‚Â Ã¢â‚¬â€¹0.002, PÃ‚Â Ã¢â‚¬â€¹=Ã‚Â Ã¢â‚¬â€¹0.010).

"Depression, anxiety, and stress mediate the associations between internet gaming disorder, insomnia, and quality of life during the COVID-19 outbreak","For many individuals, the COVID-19 outbreak has increased their psychological distress, changed their behaviors, and impacted their health. With more time spent indoors, many individuals have engaged in increased videogame playing. However, the associations between such behaviors during the COVID-19 outbreak period is unclear. The present study examined the mediation role of psychological distress (depression, anxiety, and stress) in the association between internet gaming disorder (IGD) and two health outcomes (insomnia quality of life) among adolescents during this COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional study comprising adolescents (<i>N</i>=1512) aged 13 to 18 years (mean age=15.51 years) was utilized to assess measures on insomnia, depression, anxiety, and stress, IGD, and quality of life during COVID-19 pandemic. There were small to large significant relationships between the variables. Depression, anxiety and stress served as a strong mediator in the association between IGD and insomnia and quality of life. IGD directly influenced insomnia and quality of life among the participants. IGD is associated with different psychosocial outcomes comprising multiple pathways. Parents need to pay special attention to how much time and how frequently their children play videogames. Parents may need to assist their children in coping with psychological distress during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic period.","Fazeli, Mohammadi Zeidi, Lin, Namdar, Griffiths, Kwasi Ahorsu, Pakpour","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.abrep.2020.100307","20201028","Internet gaming disorder; adolescence; anxiety; depression; insomnia; quality of life; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-30","",6586,""

"Early psychological impact of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and lockdown in a large Spanish sample","Epidemic outbreaks have significant impact on psychological well-being, increasing psychiatric morbidity among the population. We aimed to describe the early psychological impact of COVID-19 and its contributing factors in a large Spanish sample, globally and according to mental status (never mental disorder NMD, past mental disorder PMD, current mental disorder CMD). An online questionnaire was conducted between 19 and 26 March, five days after the official declaration of alarm and the lockdown order. Data included sociodemographic and clinical information and the DASS-21 and IES questionnaires. We analysed 21Ã¢â‚¬â€°207 responses using the appropriate descriptive and univariate tests as well as binary logistic regression to identify psychological risk and protective factors. We found a statistically significant gradient in the psychological impact experienced in five domains according to mental status, with the NMD group being the least affected and the CMD group being the most affected. In the three groups, the depressive response was the most prevalent (NMDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°40.9%, PMDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°51.9%, CMDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°74.4%, <i>F</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1011.459, <i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Risk factors were female sex and classification as a case in any psychological domain. Protective factors were younger age and ability to enjoy free time. Variables related to COVID-19 had almost no impact except for having COVID-19 symptoms, which was a risk factor for anxiety in all three groups. Our results can help develop coping strategies addressing modifiable risk and protective factors for each mental status for early implementation in future outbreaks.","GarcÃƒÂ­a-ÃƒÂlvarez, de la Fuente-TomÃƒÂ¡s, GarcÃƒÂ­a-Portilla, SÃƒÂ¡iz, Lacasa, Dal Santo, GonzÃƒÂ¡lez-Blanco, Bobes-BascarÃƒÂ¡n, GarcÃƒÂ­a, VÃƒÂ¡zquez, Iglesias, Cao, FernÃƒÂ¡ndez, BascarÃƒÂ¡n FernÃƒÂ¡ndez, FernÃƒÂ¡ndez, Revuelta, Zazo, Madera, ÃƒÂlvarez, SÃƒÂ¡nchez, Delgado, SuÃƒÂ¡rez, Miranda, TreviÃƒÂ±o, CalzÃƒÂ³n, Abad, Duque, Riera, GonzÃƒÂ¡lez, Pedrero, Bobes","https://doi.org/10.7189/jogh.10.020505","20201029","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-30","",6589,""

"The psychological typhoon eye effect during the COVID-19 outbreak in China: the role of coping efficacy and perceived threat","The influence of COVID-19 on mental health problems has received considerable attention. However, only a few studies have examined the relationship between exposure to COVID-19 and mental health problems, and no empirical study has tested the mechanisms between them. We conducted a survey in 31 provinces of China during 3-13 March 2020 to test the effect of the exposure level on mental health problems. Our sample comprised 2987 participants who reported their perceived threat, coping efficacy, mental health problems and other demographic variables. Multiple mediators path analysis was used in the data analysis. The results showed that the level of exposure to COVID-19 in China was negatively associated with mental health problems, which confirmed the &quot;Psychological Typhoon Eye&quot; effect. Further analyses indicated that both perceived threat and coping efficacy partially mediated the relationship between them. However, coping efficacy explained the &quot;Psychological Typhoon Eye&quot; effect. Perceived threat mediated the positive relationship between exposure level and mental health problems. This study detected the psychological typhoon eye effect and demonstrated the mediating role of coping efficacy and perceived threat between exposure to COVID-19 and mental health problems. Our findings suggest that policy makers and psychological workers should provide enough psychological services to low-risk areas as the high-risk areas.

A cross-sectional self-report survey methodology was used to gather the following data from Chinese citizens: sociodemographic information, physical and mental health disorder history, daily online time, social media exposure, feeling toward social media exposure, perception of the disease, infection cases in the local area, and previous experiences with stressful life incidents. Levels of anxiety and depression were self-reported employing the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale and the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item scale, respectively. Among the 6130 participants, the prevalence of anxiety and depression was 7.1 and 12%, respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that psychological disturbances were associated with gender, people with religious background, being a medical professional, having physical or mental health disease, difficulty accessing medical aids, experience with traumatic incidents, the perceived possibility of sequelae after being cured of COVID-19, daily online time, the source of the information relevant to COVID-19, frequency of receiving information regarding COVID-19, and negative feelings triggered by social media. There needs to be a consistent message from authorities to reduce the panic and confusion of the public, and to decrease public exposure to persistently negative information.

The perceived threat of COVID-19 has the potential to cause severe psychological maladjustment. The aim of the study is to explore Spanish radiographers' concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic. This study was quantitative, observational and cross-sectional. The sample was made up of 546 radiographers working in Spain during the outbreak. The instrument used for analysis was an ad hoc questionnaire with socio-demographic questions and the questionnaire on perception of threat from COVID-19 validate to spanish healthcare professionals. The sample consisted of 70.1% of female, 29.7% of male and 0.2% undeclare sex participants.

In the present study, we assessed the effect of the pandemic on stress levels in <i>N</i> = 2053 Italian adults, and characterized more vulnerable individuals on the basis of sociodemographic features and stable psychological traits. A set of 18 psycho-social variables, generalized regressions, and predictive machine learning approaches were leveraged. We identified higher levels of perceived stress in the study sample relative to Italian normative values. Higher levels of distress were found in women, participants with lower income, and participants living with others. Higher rates of emotional stability and self-control, as well as a positive coping style and internal locus of control, emerged as protective factors. Predictive learning models identified participants with high perceived stress, with a sensitivity greater than 76%. The results suggest a characterization of people who are more vulnerable to experiencing high levels of stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. This characterization may contribute to early and targeted intervention strategies.","Flesia, Monaro, Mazza, Fietta, Colicino, Segatto, Roma","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9103350","20201022","COVID-19; coping; mental health; personality; public health; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-30","",6599,""
"Use of Yoghurt Enhanced with Volatile Plant Oils Encapsulated in Sodium Alginate to Increase the Human Body's Immunity in the Present Fight Against Stress","(1) Background: The COVID-19 pandemic and the imposition of strict but necessary measures to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus have been, and still are, major stress factors for adults, children, and adolescents. Stress harms human health as it creates free radicals in the human body. According to various recent studies, volatile oils from various aromatic plants have a high content of antioxidants and antimicrobial compounds. An external supply of antioxidants is required to destroy these free radicals. The main purpose of this paper is to create a yoghurt with high antioxidant capacity, using only raw materials from Romania; (2) Methods: The bioactive components used to enrich the cow milk yoghurt were extracted as volatile oils out of four aromatic plants: basil, mint, lavender and fennel. Initially, the compounds were extracted to determine the antioxidant capacity, and subsequently, the antioxidant activity of the yoghurt was determined. The 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhy-drazyl (DPPH) method was used to determine the antioxidant activity; (3) Results: The results show that cow milk yoghurt enhanced with volatile oils of basil, lavender, mint and fennel, encapsulated in sodium alginate has an antioxidant and antimicrobial effect as a staple food with multiple effects in increasing the body's immunity. The antioxidant activity proved to be considerably higher than the control sample. The highest antioxidant activity was obtained on the first day of the analysis, decreasing onwards to measurements taken on days 10 and 20. The cow milk yoghurt enriched with volatile basil oil obtained the best results; (4) Conclusions: The paper shows that yoghurts with a high antioxidant capacity were obtained, using only raw materials from Romania. A healthy diet, compliance with safety conditions and finding appropriate and safe methods to increase the body's immunity is a good alternative to a major transition through harder times, such as pandemics. The creation of food products that include natural antioxidant compounds combines both the current great possibility of developing food production in Romania and the prevention and reduction of the effects caused by pandemic stress in the human body.","TiÃˆâ€ºa, Constantinescu, TiÃˆâ€ºa, Georgescu","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17207588","20201026","antioxidants; food management; mental health; public health; stress; Alginates; Animals; Antioxidants; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Immune System; Pandemics; Plant Oils; Pneumonia, Viral; Romania; Stress, Psychological; Yogurt","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-30","",6600,""
"COVID-19 outbreak-related psychological distress among healthcare trainees: a cross-sectional study in China","The COVID-19 outbreak has caused enormous strain on healthcare systems, and healthcare trainees, which comprise the future healthcare workforce, may be a vulnerable group. It is essential to assess the psychological distress experienced by healthcare trainees during the COVID-19 outbreak. A cross-sectional study with 4184 healthcare trainees at Sichuan University in China was implemented during 7-13 February 2020. Participants were grouped by training programmes (medicine, medical technology and nursing) and training stages (undergraduate, postgraduate and residency). COVID-19-related psychological distress and acute stress reaction (ASR) were assessed using the Kessler 6-item Psychological Distress Scale and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, respectively. We estimated the ORs of distress by comparing trainees across programmes and training stages using multivariable logistic regression. Significant psychological distress was found in 1150 (30.90%) participants and probable ASR in 403 (10.74%). Compared with the nursing trainees, the medical trainees (OR 1.54, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.22 to 1.95) reported a higher burden of psychological distress during the outbreak, while the medical technology trainees (OR 1.25, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 0.97 to 1.62) reported similar symptom scores. Postgraduates (OR 1.55, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.16 to 2.08) in medicine had higher levels of distress than their undergraduate counterparts did, whereas the nursing residents (OR 0.38, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 0.20 to 0.71) reported a lower burden than did nursing undergraduates. A positive association was found between having active clinical duties during the outbreak and distress (OR 1.17, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 0.98 to 1.39), particularly among the medical trainees (OR 1.85, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.47 to 2.33) and undergraduates (OR 4.20, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.61 to 11.70).

"Sudden and persistent disphonia in the framework of COVID-19: the case report of a nurse","In December 2019, clusters of atypical pneumonia with unknown etiology emerged in the city of Wuhan in China. In early January 2020, the Center for Disease Control in China announced that it was identified a new coronavirus, first tentatively named 2019-nCoV and officially named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. On 11 February 2020 the WHO identified the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 as COVID-19 (COronaVIrus Disease-19 based on the year of appearance). Although only a few months have passed since the beginning of this pandemic, numerous studies, case reports, reviews by leading international scientific and medical journals have been published. However, given the unpredictability of virus behaviour and the still limited knowledge about it, many aspects of the infection are still little known. A recent epidemiological study has shown the presence of dysphonia in some patients with COVID-19, with a minority reporting aphonia during the clinical course of the disease. This case study draws attention on a 50-year-old female nurse presented with a history of fatigue for small efforts and persistent dysphonia at the Occupational Health Department of a major University Hospital in central Italy. The patient had a history of COVID-19 infection, which lasted about two months with pulmonary and extrapulmonary symptoms. After two RT-PCR negativities for SARS-CoV-2, dysphonia and fatigue due to minor efforts persisted. The patient, following the persistence of the symptomatology, carried out numerous specialist examinations, which showed no organic alterations. Based on her clinical and instrumental history, we hypothesized a psychogenetic dysphonia related to COVID-19. This case report highlights the importance of personalized medicine with long-term follow-up and good psychological support in patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and in particular in the categories at greatest risk of both contagion and adverse physical and mental outcomes like health care workers.","Buselli, Corsi, Necciari, Pistolesi, Baldanzi, Chiumiento, Del Lupo, Guerra, Cristaudo","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2020.100160","20201022","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Health care workers; Mental health; Occupational health; Psychogenic dysphonia; SARS-COV-2; Secondary traumatization; Somatic symptom disorder; Work-related stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-30","",6602,""
"Higher binding affinity of Furin to SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein D614G could be associated with higher SARS-CoV-2 infectivity","The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused an exponential rise in death rates and hospitalizations. The aim of this study was to characterize the D614Ã¢â‚¬â€°G mutation of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein, which may affect viral infectivity. The effect of D614Ã¢â‚¬â€°G mutation on the structure and thermodynamic stability of S-protein was analyzed using DynaMut and SCooP. HDOCK and PRODIGY were used to model furin protease binding to the S-protein RARR cleavage site and calculate binding affinities. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were used to predict S-protein apo structure, S-protein-furin complex structure, and the free binding energy of the complex. The D614Ã¢â‚¬â€°G mutation in the G clade of SARS-CoV-2 strains introduced structural mobility and decreased thermal stability of S-protein (ÃŽâ€ÃŽâ€G: -0.086Ã¢â‚¬â€°kcal/mol). The mutation resulted in a stronger binding affinity (K<sub>d</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.6Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ãƒâ€”Ã¢â‚¬â€°10<sup>-8</sup>) to furin which may enhance S-protein cleavage. Results were corroborated by MD simulations demonstrating higher binding energy of furin to S-protein D614 mutant (-61.9Ã¢â‚¬â€°kcal/mol compared with -56.78Ã¢â‚¬â€°kcal/mol for wild-type S-protein). The D614Ã¢â‚¬â€°G mutation in the G clade induced the flexibility of S-protein, resulting in increased furin binding which may enhance S-protein cleave and infiltration of host cells. As such, SARS-CoV-2 D614Ã¢â‚¬â€°G mutation may result in a more virulent strain.","Mohammad, Alshawaf, Marafie, Abu-Farha, Abubaker, Al-Mulla","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.10.033","20201022","COVID-19; G clade; S-protein; SARS-CoV-2; furin; interatomic binding; molecular dynamic simulations; thermodynamic stability","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-30","",6603,""

"Current Data Gaps in Modeling Essential Worker Absenteeism Due to COVID-19","With the uncertain physical and mental health implications of COVID-19 infection, companies have taken a myriad of actions that aim to reduce the risk of employees contracting the virus, with most grounded in reducing or eliminating in-person interactions. Our preliminary analysis indicates that while there is some data to support modelling absenteeism, there are gaps in the available evidence, requiring the use of assumptions that limit precision and efficacy for decision support. Improved data on time-to-recovery after hospitalization, absenteeism due to family or other household member illness, and mental health's impact on returning to work will support the development of more robust absenteeism models and analytical approaches.","White, Schlegelmilch, Ratner, Saxena, Wongsodirdjo, Aguilar, Kushner, Ortega, Paaso, Bahramirad","https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2020.353","20201029","COVID-19; absenteeism; critical Infrastructure; modelling; pandemics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-30","",6606,""

"Global Changes and Factors of Increase in Caloric/Salty Food Intake, Screen Use, and Substance Use During the Early COVID-19 Containment Phase in the General Population in France: Survey Study","The international outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has led many countries to enforce drastic containment measures. It has been suggested that this abrupt lockdown of populations will foster addiction-related habits such as caloric/salty food intake, screen use, and substance use. Our aim was to assess the global changes and factors of increase in addiction-related habits during the early COVID-19 containment phase in France. A web-based survey was provided from day 8 to day 13 of the containment and was completed by 11,391 participants. The questions explored sociodemographic features, psychiatric/addiction history, material conditions of lockdown, general stress, mental well-being, and reported changes in several addiction-related behaviors. Global changes were described and factors of increase were explored using population-weighted and adjusted logistic regression models, providing adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and their 95% confidence intervals. Overall, the respondents reported more increases in addiction-related habits than decreases, specifically 28.4% (caloric/salty food intake), 64.6% (screen use), 35.6% (tobacco use), 24.8% (alcohol use), and 31.2% (cannabis use). Reduced well-being scores and increased stress scores were general factors of increase in addiction-related habits (P&lt;.001 for all habits). Factors of increase in caloric/salty food intake (n=10,771) were female gender (aOR 1.62, 95% CI 1.48-1.77), age less than 29 years (P&lt;.001), having a partner (aOR 1.19, 95% CI 1.06-1.35), being locked down in a more confined space (per 1 square meter/person decrease: aOR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.03), being locked down alone (aOR 1.29, 95% CI 1.11-1.49), and reporting current (aOR 1.94, 95% CI 1.62-2.31) or past (aOR 1.27, 95% CI 1.09-1.47) psychiatric treatment. Factors of increase in screen use (n=11,267) were female gender (aOR 1.31, 95% CI 1.21-1.43), age less than 29 years (P&lt;.001), having no partner (aOR 1.18, 95% CI 1.06-1.32), being employed (P&lt;.001), intermediate/high education level (P&lt;.001), being locked down with no access to an outdoor space (aOR 1.16, 95% CI 1.05-1.29), being locked down alone (aOR 1.15, 95% CI 1.01-1.32), living in an urban environment (P&lt;.01), and not working (P&lt;.001). Factors of increase in tobacco use (n=2787) were female gender (aOR 1.31, 95% CI 1.11-1.55), having no partner (aOR 1.30, 95% CI 1.06-1.59), intermediate/low education level (P&lt;.01), and still working in the workplace (aOR 1.47, 95% CI 1.17-1.86). Factors of increase in alcohol use (n=7108) were age 30-49 years (P&lt;.05), a high level of education (P&lt;.001), and current psychiatric treatment (aOR 1.44, 95% CI 1.10-1.88). The only significant factor of increase in cannabis use (n=620) was intermediate/low level of education (P&lt;.001). The early phase of COVID-19 containment in France led to widespread increases in addiction-related habits in the general population. Reduced well-being and increased stress were universal factors of increase. More specific factors were associated with increases in each of the explored habits.","Rolland, Haesebaert, Zante, Benyamina, Haesebaert, Franck","https://doi.org/10.2196/19630","20201002","COVID-19; addiction; containment; eating behaviors; internet use; lifestyle; mental health; online survey; pandemic; public health; screen use; substance use; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Behavior, Addictive; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Diet; Feeding Behavior; Female; France; Health Behavior; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prevalence; Screen Time; Sodium Chloride, Dietary; Substance-Related Disorders; Young Adult","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-30","",6608,""

"COVID-19 psychological impact in 3109 healthcare workers in Spain: The PSIMCOV group","The current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has a great impact worldwide. Healthcare workers play an essential role and are one of the most exposed groups. Information about the psychosocial impact on healthcare workers is limited. 3109 healthcare workers completed a national, internet-based, cross-sectional 45-item survey between 9 and 19 April 2020. The objective is to assess the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spanish healthcare workers. A Psychological Stress and Adaptation at work Score (PSAS) was defined combining four modified versions of validated psychological assessment tests (A) Healthcare Stressful Test, (B) Coping Strategies Inventory, (C) Font-Roja Questionnaire and (D) Trait Meta-Mood Scale. The highest psychosocial impact was perceived in Respiratory Medicine, the mean (S.D.) PSAS was 48.3 (13.6) and Geriatrics 47.6 (16.4). Higher distress levels were found in the geographical areas with the highest incidence of COVID-19 (&gt;245.5 cases per 100 000 people), PSAS 46.8 (15.2); p &lt; 0.001. The least stress respondents were asymptomatic workers PSAS, 41.3 (15.4); p &lt; 0.001, as well as those above 60 years old, PSAS, 37.6 (16); p &lt; 0.001. Workers who needed psychological therapy and did not receive it, were more stressed PSAS 52.5 (13.6) than those who did not need it PSAS 39.7 (13.9); p &lt; 0.001. The psychological impact in healthcare workers in Spain during COVID-19 emergency has been studied. The stress perceived is parallel to the number of cases per 100 000 people. Psychotherapy could have a major role to mitigate the experimented stress level.","Romero, Delgado, CatalÃƒÂ¡, Ferrer, Errando, Iftimi, Benito, de AndrÃƒÂ©s, Otero","https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291720001671","20200909","Covid-19; SARS-CoV-2; healthcare workers; mental health; pandemic; psychological","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-30","",6612,""
"Smoking Is Associated With COVID-19 Progression: A Meta-analysis","Smoking depresses pulmonary immune function and is a risk factor contracting other infectious diseases and more serious outcomes among people who become infected. This paper presents a meta-analysis of the association between smoking and progression of the infectious disease COVID-19. PubMed was searched on April 28, 2020, with search terms &quot;smoking&quot;, &quot;smoker*&quot;, &quot;characteristics&quot;, &quot;risk factors&quot;, &quot;outcomes&quot;, and &quot;COVID-19&quot;, &quot;COVID&quot;, &quot;coronavirus&quot;, &quot;sar cov-2&quot;, &quot;sar cov 2&quot;. Studies reporting smoking behavior of COVID-19 patients and progression of disease were selected for the final analysis. The study outcome was progression of COVID-19 among people who already had the disease. A random effects meta-analysis was applied. We identified 19 peer-reviewed papers with a total of 11,590 COVID-19 patients, 2,133 (18.4%) with severe disease and 731 (6.3%) with a history of smoking. A total of 218 patients with a history of smoking (29.8%) experienced disease progression, compared with 17.6% of non-smoking patients. The meta-analysis showed a significant association between smoking and progression of COVID-19 (OR 1.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.42-2.59, p = 0.001). Limitations in the 19 papers suggest that the actual risk of smoking may be higher. Smoking is a risk factor for progression of COVID-19, with smokers having higher odds of COVID-19 progression than never smokers. Physicians and public health professionals should collect data on smoking as part of clinical management and add smoking cessation to the list of practices to blunt the COVID-19 pandemic.","Patanavanich, Glantz","https://doi.org/10.1093/ntr/ntaa082","20200902","Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Progression; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Risk Factors; Smoking","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-30","",6613,""
"Mental and social health in the German old age population largely unaltered during COVID-19 lockdown: results of a representative survey","Background: Older individuals are at increased risk of a severe and lethal course of COVID-19. They have typically been advised to practice particularly restrictive social distancing (â€˜cocooningâ€™), which has sparked much debate on mental and social health consequences in older individuals. We aim to provide evidence. Methods: A computer-assisted standardized telephone interview was conducted in a randomly selected and representative sample of the German old age population (n = 1,005; age =65 years) during lockdown in April 2020. Assessments included sociodemographic factors, aspects of the personal life situation during lockdown, attitudes towards COVID-19, and standardized screening measures on depression, anxiety, somatization, posttraumatic stress, perceived stress, loneliness and social support. Sampling-weighted descriptive statistics and multiple multivariable regression analyses were conducted. Results: Participants were M = 75.5 (SD = 7.1) years old; 56.3% were women. At data collection, COVID-19 lockdown had been in force for M = 28.0 (SD = 4.8) days. Overall, older individuals were worried about COVID-19, but supportive of the lockdown. Mean scores and prevalence estimates of measured mental and social health variables were comparable to figures reported before the pandemic, except slightly higher perceived stress and higher perceived social support. There were only few significant associations of aspects of the personal life situation during lockdown and attitudes towards COVID-19 with mental and social health variables, while resilience explained a large amount of variance. Conclusions: In the short-term, the mental and social health of the German old age population was largely unaltered during COVID-19 lockdown, suggesting resilience against the challenging pandemic situation. Our results refute common ageist stereotypes of â€œthe weak and vulnerable elderlyâ€ that were present during the pandemic. Long-term observations are needed to provide robust evidence.","Susanne RÃ¶hr et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46195-084-F92","20200715","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; epidemiology; quarantine; mental health; lockdown; old age; coronavirus; covid-19; covid-19 pandemic; social health; elderly; pandemic; survey; psychosocial health","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-10-30","",6614,""
