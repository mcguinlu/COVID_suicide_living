"COVID-19 epidemic and public mental health care in Italy: ethical considerations","In order to prevent spread of COVID-19, World Health Organization (WHO) has specified that measures such as cleaning hands regularly with alcohol-based hand sanitizer or washing with soap and water, avoiding touching nose, eyes, mouth and social distancing should be followed by people  Another important measure for containing spread is by Testing-Testing and Testing  By testing, patients affected by COVID-19 can be isolated and further spread from them can be prevented  For testing , clinical specimen inactivation should be performed in a bio-safety level-3 (BSL-3) laboratory and after this step, routine testing can be performed in a bio-safety level-2 laboratory  Based on the infection and death rates in the current pandemic situation, few high-level bio-safety facilities are required to handle this deadly virus associated with potential exposure risks  It would take a long time, a large staff and many resources to construct a new fixed bio-safety facility, thus delaying the prevention and control of the pandemic  Therefore, a mobile BSL-3 laboratory with both bio-safety and flexibility is urgently needed to manage the pandemic and emergent public health incidents  To meet this requirement, the author has designed a mobile virology research and diagnostic laboratory with inputs from ESIC Medical College, Hyderabad, identified two companies which specialize in fabrication of shelters and containment facilities, realized and installed it within 15 days of time  This state-of-the-art, one of its kind laboratory was inaugurated by Hon'ble Raksha Mantri on 23 April, 2020  The MVRDL developed as per WHO and ICMR bio-safety standard (BSL-3) can be used: â€¢ To conduct real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test for diagnosing COVID-19  Possibility to test up to 2000 samples per day  â€¢ For virus culturing for drug screening, convalescent plasma-derived therapy  â€¢ To aid in the development of vaccine and development of diagnostic kits","Pelizza, Lorenzo, Pupo, Simona","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00127-020-01907-8","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology;2020.; Publication details: Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2304,""
"Emerging public health challenge in UK: perception and belief on increased COVID19 death among BAME healthcare workers","BACKGROUND: Coronavirus infection Disease 19 impacted every part of the world and routine life. Recent report from the Office of national statistics in UK reported disproportionate death among Black Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) population. NHS is heavily relied on the BAME work force both in front line and in the community. We attempted to explore the beliefs and perception about reported worrying issue among BAME health work force in a Diverse city of Leicester. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional survey using 20 questions in an electronic format. The target population was identified through Leicester Asian Doctors Society and Leicester Asian Nurses Society. The questionnaire was then distributed electronically to the members. Survey questionnaire was accessed by 372, incomplete response (172) were excluded and 200 completed responses were analysed. RESULTS: Majority of BAME workforce are routinely involved in front line duties. More than 70% were anxious about their role during this pandemic. The Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) supply was adequate, and the support received from the local healthcare providers was more than satisfactory. The work force perceived co-morbidity, lack of PPE and testing were one of the few reasons for increased death in BAME. BAME group felt adequate provision of PPE, increased testing and improving mental health well-being is required to alleviate concerns and improve BAME working life in NHS. CONCLUSION: BAME workforce are routinely involved in front line work and current anxiety level is very high. Adequate provision of mental health support with clear risk stratification for return to work is required urgently.","Moorthy, Arumugam; Sankar, Thangasamy K","https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdaa096","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Public Health (Oxf);2020 Jul 03.; Publication details: J Public Health (Oxf);2020 Jul 03.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2305,""

"Does 'Fear of COVID-19' trigger future career anxiety? An empirical investigation considering depression from COVID-19 as a mediator","BACKGROUND: Due to the outbreak of COVID-19, the mental health of the people all around the world is severely disrupted. AIM: The purpose of this study is to identify whether 'Fear of COVID-19' impacted on future workforces' career anxiety at the first place and whether depression from COVID-19 has any indirect effect on 'Fear of COVID-19' and future workforces' career anxiety. METHOD: Based on three different scales related to 'Fear of COVID-19', depression and career anxiety, a structured questionnaire was developed and the survey data was collected for this study. RESULTS: The empirical result of the study reveals that, due to the outbreak of COVID-19 fear, the future workforce is getting anxious about their future career. Again, depression from COVID-19, caused by 'Fear of COVID-19', as a mediator, has a significant indirect impact on the relationship between 'Fear of COVID-19' and future career anxiety, resulting in a full mediation. This means, due to the outbreak of 'Fear of COVID-19' people are becoming depressed and anxious about their future career which is creating a long-term negative effect on human psychology. CONCLUSION: These research findings will be a major tool for the policymakers, as well as the human resource planning professionals, to sketch plans after COVID-19 pandemic. This study is a novel work combining the concepts of fear and depression with career anxiety in a pandemic situation like COVID-19, and also assists future researchers in many folds.","Mahmud, Md Shahed; Talukder, Mesbah Uddin; Rahman, Sk Mahrufur","https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0020764020935488","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Soc Psychiatry;: 20764020935488, 2020 Jul 02.; Publication details: Int J Soc Psychiatry;: 20764020935488, 2020 Jul 02.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2307,""
"The Covid-19 pandemic seen from the frontline","COVID-19 disease caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus produces respiratory symptoms, predominantly of the upper airways, which can progress to pneumonia after 7 days with persistent fever, cough and dyspnea, and even develop a syndrome of acute respiratory distress (ARDS), multi-organ failure and death. Since COVID-19 disease was declared by the WHO there has been a redistribution of the healthcare system for these types of patients, especially in the front line, which is, in primary care, emergencies and in intensive care units (ICU). In primary care, the fundamental role is the diagnosis of the suspected patients, follow-up mainly by telemedicine (specially telephone calls) to detect warning signs in case of worsening and subsequent referral to the emergency department; as well as explaining home isolation measures. In the emergency department, it is included the management of suspicious cases and, if it any risk factor is found, complementary tests are carried out for precise diagnosis and admission assessment; In case of oxygen saturation <95% and poor general condition, valuation is requested for admission to the ICU. Depending on the severity of the patient, he/she would be or not a candidate for invasive mechanical ventilation, which must be performed by trained personnel to prevent the spread of the infection minimizing the risk of contagion. ARDS's treatment strategies include pulmonary protection ventilation, prone position, recruitment maneuvers and, less frequently, oxygenation by extracorporeal membrane. Among the specific treatments for COVID-19 stand out mainly drugs to reduce viral load, although sometimes specific drugs will be needed to treat hyperinflammation, hypercoagulability and concomitant infections. One of the goals to be achieved is for patients to recover and be able to successfully return to work; for this purpose, an adequate physical and psychological rehabilitation program is essential, as about 50% have symptoms of anxiety and depression.","Carmona, Luz Elena Ojeda; Nielfa, MarÃ­a Del Carmen CÃ³rdoba; Alvarado, Alvaro Luis Diaz","https://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1677-5538.IBJU.2020.S123","","Country: BR; BRASIL; BRAZIL; BRASIL; BRESIL; BRASILE; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int Braz J Urol;462020 Jun 05.; Publication details: Int Braz J Urol;462020 Jun 05.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2308,""

"The impact of COVID-19 on patients with Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder;a pilot study","Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD) is a CNS neuroinflammatory disorder, mediated by the pathogenic autoantibody aquaporin-4 (AQP4-IgG)  Current treatment includes long-term use of immunomodulatory therapies, leading to increased rates of infections among this population  It is of interest therefore, to study how the COVID-19 pandemic affects NMOSD patients in terms of their disease activity  A 15-point questionnaire was administered to 33 participants living in Northern California with NMOSD, MS and other related disorders  Although none of the participants were diagnosed with COVID-19, our results show that 2 participants with NMOSD experienced new onset of neurological symptoms and 2 experienced worsening of previous neurological symptoms â€“ suggesting a possible effect of pandemic-related stress on this CNS autoimmune disorder  Background Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is a group of chronic, immune-mediated, inflammatory and degenerative conditions predominantly affecting the central nervous system (CNS) (Wingerchuk et al , 2015)  Patients with NMOSD are often immunocompromised as a result of exposure to long-term immune modulatory therapies to prevent irreversible and progressive neurologic disabilities caused by relapses (GlÃ¼ck et al , 2005)  In addition, patients often experience worsening of pre-existing symptoms or relapses under stressful situations (Kessler et al , 2016)  This pilot study investigates the impact of the pandemic COVID-19 on patients with NMOSD in terms of clinical relapses and susceptibility to infection utilizing a clinical questionnaire  Methods : We used a 15-point clinical questionnaire (see Appendix A) to investigate the association between NMOSD and COVID-19 infection among 33 subjects (19 NMOSD and 14 controls) living in Northern California during the months of March and April 2020  Controls consisted of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and transverse myelitis (TM)  All NMOSD and MS patients had confirmed diagnoses using the Wingerchuck 2015 and McDonald 2010 criteria, respectively  The questionnaire consisted of questions regarding NMOSD diagnosis (2), current immunomodulatory therapies (2), seasonal flu (2), COVID-19 (3), change in neurological symptoms (5), and other (1)  Participants that experienced new neurological symptoms were contacted by phone to determine the potential effect of pandemic-related stress on the development of new symptoms (see Appendix B)  The study population was composed of participants followed at the Stanford Neuroimmunology Clinic, some of which were enrolled in the Collaborative International Research in Clinical and Longitudinal Experience Study in NMOSD (CIRCLES) study, and consisted of primarily Caucasians (52%, 17/33), women (64%, 21/33), and NMOSD patients (58%, 19/33)  A difference in proportions z score test was used to determine whether NMOSD patients had a higher risk of experiencing worsening of symptoms or new symptoms compared to control subjects during the early COVID-19 pandemic  This study was approved by the Stanford University Institutional Review Board  Findings : In our current study, 85% of total subjects (28/33) responded to the questionnaire â€“ of which 89% (17/19) were NMOSD and 79% (11/14) were control subjects  Among the NMOSD patients, 18% (3/17) were diagnosed with MOG-associated disease, 59% (10/17) were NMO-IgG seropositive, and 24% (4/17) were NMO-IgG seronegative  In the control group 73% (8/11) carried the diagnosis of MS and 27% (3/11) were diagnosed with transverse myelitis (TM)  All of the NMOSD patients included in the study were treated with preventative immune therapy â€“ among which 88% (15/17) were treated with rituximab while the remaining 12% (2/17) were treated with azathioprine (6%) and tocilizumab (6%)  Only 64% (7/11) of the controls were on preventative immunomodulatory therapies, 36% (4/11) of which were treated with ocrelizumab, 9% (1/11) with alemtuzumab, 9% (1/11) with glatiramer acetate, and 9% (1/11) with natalizumab  Upon investigating the incidence of COVID-19 infection, 11% (3/28) (2 NMOSD and 1 control) of the subjects experienced respiratory symptoms including fever, chills, and shortness of breath  We also observed that 71% (20/28) of the subjects received prior influenza vaccination  None of the subjects who experienced infectious symptoms were tested for seasonal influenza and/or SARS-CoV2 infection  In addition, 14% (4/28) of subjects (2 NMOSD, 2 control) experienced worsening of pre-existing neurological symptoms, which include cognitive symptoms, fatigue and spasticity  12% (2/17) NMOSD patients developed new neurological symptoms suggestive of a clinical relapse  However, none of the patients experienced symptoms severe enough to seek medical attention (Table 1) Both of these patients reported experiencing more stress than usual prior to the onset of these new symptoms  They also experienced symptoms related to stress, including insomnia, anxiety and depression  Additionally, both of these patients remained compliant with their preventative medications â€“ with no delays  Stress was not measured in participants who did not exhibit new neurological symptoms  A difference in proportions z score test found no significant difference between risk of experiencing worsening of symptoms (2/17 NMOSD vs  2/11 controls) or new symptoms (2/17 NMOSD vs  0/11 controls) between NMOSD and control subjects (p&gt;0 05)  Additionally, there was no significant difference in experiencing flu-like symptoms (2/17 NMOSD vs  1/11 control) between NMOSD and control study groups

"Guidance for the Treatment and Management of COVID-19 Among People with Intellectual Disabilities","The current COVID-19 pandemic is a pressing world crisis and people with intellectual disabilities (IDs) are vulnerable due to disparity in healthcare provision and physical and mental health multimorbidity. While most people will develop mild symptoms upon contracting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), some will develop serious complications. The aim of this study is to present guidelines for the care and treatment of people with IDs during the COVID-19 pandemic for both community teams providing care to people with IDs and inpatient psychiatric settings. The guidelines cover specific issues associated with hospital passports, individual COVID-19 care plans, the important role of families and carers, capacity to make decisions, issues associated with social distancing, ceiling of care/treatment escalation plans, mental health and challenging behavior, and caring for someone suspected of contracting or who has contracted SARS-CoV-2 within community or inpatient psychiatric settings. We have proposed that the included conditions recommended by Public Health England to categorize someone as high risk of severe illness due to COVID-19 should also include mental health and challenging behavior. There are specific issues associated with providing care to people with IDs and appropriate action must be taken by care providers to ensure that disparity of healthcare is addressed during the COVID-19 pandemic. We recognize that our guidance is focused upon healthcare delivery in England and invite others to augment our guidance for use in other jurisdictions.","Alexander, Regi; Ravi, Ambiga; Barclay, Helene; Sawhney, Indermeet; Chester, Verity; Malcolm, Vicki; Brolly, Kate; Mukherji, Kamalika; Zia, Asif; Tharian, Reena; Howell, Andreana; Lane, Tadhgh; Cooper, Vivien; Langdon, Peter E.","https://doi.org/10.1111/jppi.12352","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: J.

"To punish or to assist? Divergent reactions to ingroup and outgroup members disobeying social distancing","In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, societies face the formidable challenge of developing sustainable forms of sociability-cumsocial-distancing - enduring social life while containing the virus and preventing new outbreaks. Accordant public policies often balance between retributive (punishment-based) and assistance (solidarity-based) measures to foster responsible behaviour. Yet, the uncontrolled spreading of the disease has divided public opinion about which measures are best suited, and it has made salient group disparities in behaviour, potentially straining intergroup relations, elevating heated emotions, and undercutting coordinated international responses. In a 2Â Ã—Â 2 between-subjects experiment, British citizens (NÂ =Â 377) read about national in-group or outgroup members (categorical differentiation), who were either conforming to or deviating from the corona regulations (normative differentiation). Participants then reported moral emotions towards the target national group and indicated support for public policies. In general, support for assistance policies outweighed support for retributive measures. Second, however, norm deviation was associated with less positive and more negative moral emotions, the latter category further relating to more punitiveness and less assistance support. Finally, respondents who read about norm-violating outgroup members especially reported support for retributive measures, indicating that people might use norm deviation to justify outgroup derogation. We discuss implications for policymakers and formulate future research avenues.","Van Assche, Jasper; Politi, Emanuele; Van Dessel, Pieter; Phalet, Karen","https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bjso.12395","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Br J Soc Psychol;: e12395, 2020 Jun 30.; Publication details: Br J Soc Psychol;: e12395, 2020 Jun 30.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2344,""
"Prevalence of and Risk Factors Associated With Mental Health Symptoms Among the General Population in China During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic","Importance: People exposed to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and a series of imperative containment measures could be psychologically stressed, yet the burden of and factors associated with mental health symptoms remain unclear. Objective: To investigate the prevalence of and risk factors associated with mental health symptoms in the general population in China during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: This large-sample, cross-sectional, population-based, online survey study was conducted from February 28, 2020, to March 11, 2020. It involved all 34 province-level regions in China and included participants aged 18 years and older. Data analysis was performed from March to May 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: The prevalence of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and acute stress among the general population in China during the COVID-19 pandemic was evaluated using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Insomnia Severity Index, and Acute Stress Disorder Scale. Logistic regression analyses were used to explore demographic and COVID-19-related risk factors. Results: Of 71Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯227 individuals who clicked on the survey link, 56Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯932 submitted the questionnaires, for a participation rate of 79.9%. After excluding the invalid questionnaires, 56Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯679 participants (mean [SD] age, 35.97 [8.22] years; 27Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯149 men [47.9%]) were included in the study; 39Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯468 respondents (69.6%) were aged 18 to 39 years. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the rates of mental health symptoms among the survey respondents were 27.9% (95% CI, 27.5%-28.2%) for depression, 31.6% (95% CI, 31.2%-32.0%) for anxiety, 29.2% (95% CI, 28.8%-29.6%) for insomnia, and 24.4% (95% CI, 24.0%-24.7%) for acute stress. Participants with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 and their family members or friends had a high risk for symptoms of depression (adjusted odds ratios [ORs], 3.27 [95% CI, 1.84-5.80] for patients; 1.53 [95% CI, 1.26-1.85] for family or friends), anxiety (adjusted ORs, 2.48 [95% CI, 1.43-4.31] for patients; 1.53 [95% CI, 1.27-1.84] for family or friends), insomnia (adjusted ORs, 3.06 [95% CI, 1.73-5.43] for patients; 1.62 [95% CI, 1.35-1.96] for family or friends), and acute stress (adjusted ORs, 3.50 [95% CI, 2.02-6.07] for patients; 1.77 [95% CI, 1.46-2.15] for family or friends). Moreover, people with occupational exposure risks and residents in Hubei province had increased odds of symptoms of depression (adjusted ORs, 1.96 [95% CI, 1.77-2.17] for occupational exposure; 1.42 [95% CI, 1.19-1.68] for Hubei residence), anxiety (adjusted ORs, 1.93 [95% CI, 1.75-2.13] for occupational exposure; 1.54 [95% CI, 1.30-1.82] for Hubei residence), insomnia (adjusted ORs, 1.60 [95% CI, 1.45-1.77] for occupational exposure; 1.20 [95% CI, 1.01-1.42] for Hubei residence), and acute stress (adjusted ORs, 1.98 [95% CI, 1.79-2.20] for occupational exposure; 1.49 [95% CI, 1.25-1.79] for Hubei residence). Both centralized quarantine (adjusted ORs, 1.33 [95% CI, 1.10-1.61] for depression; 1.46 [95% CI, 1.22-1.75] for anxiety; 1.63 [95% CI, 1.36-1.95] for insomnia; 1.46 [95% CI, 1.21-1.77] for acute stress) and home quarantine (adjusted ORs, 1.30 [95% CI, 1.25-1.36] for depression; 1.28 [95% CI, 1.23-1.34] for anxiety; 1.24 [95% CI, 1.19-1.30] for insomnia; 1.29 [95% CI, 1.24-1.35] for acute stress) were associated with the 4 negative mental health outcomes. Being at work was associated with lower risks of depression (adjusted OR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.79-0.91]), anxiety (adjusted OR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.86-0.99]), and insomnia (adjusted OR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.81-0.94]). Conclusions and Relevance: The results of this survey indicate that mental health symptoms may have been common during the COVID-19 outbreak among the general population in China, especially among infected individuals, people with suspected infection, and people who might have contact with patients with COVID-19. Some measures, such as quarantine and delays in returning to work, were also associated with mental health among the public. These findings identify populations at risk for mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic and may help in implementing mental health intervention policies in other countries and regions.","Shi, Le; Lu, Zheng-An; Que, Jian-Yu; Huang, Xiao-Lin; Liu, Lin; Ran, Mao-Sheng; Gong, Yi-Miao; Yuan, Kai; Yan, Wei; Sun, Yan-Kun; Shi, Jie; Bao, Yan-Ping; Lu, Lin","https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.14053","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JAMA Netw Open;3(7): e2014053, 2020 Jul 01.; Publication details: JAMA Netw Open;3(7): e2014053, 2020 Jul 01.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2345,""
"Mood, anxiety and olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19: evidence of central nervous system involvement?","INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to determine the burden of depressed mood and anxiety in COVID-19, and associated disease characteristics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a prospective, cross-sectional study of 114 COVID-19 positive patients diagnosed using RT-PCR-based testing over a 6-week period. The 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) and the 2-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder questionnaire (GAD-2) were used to measure depressed mood and anxiety level, respectively, at enrollment and for participants' baseline, pre-COVID-19 state. Severity of smell loss, loss of taste, nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea/mucus production, fever, cough and shortness of breath (SOB) during COVID-19 were assessed. RESULTS: PHQ-2 and GAD-2 significantly (p<0.001) increased from baseline to enrollment. PHQ-2 was associated with smell loss (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR]=1.40, 95%CI: 1.10-1.78, p=0.006), age (aIRR=1.02, 95%CI: 1.01-1.04, p=0.006), and baseline PHQ-2 score (aIRR=1.39, 95%CI: 1.09-1.76, p=0.007). GAD-2 score was associated with smell loss (aIRR=1.29, 95%CI: 1.02-1.62, p=0.035), age (aIRR=1.02, 95%CI: 1.01-1.04, p=0.025) and baseline GAD-2 score (aIRR=1.55, 95%CI: 1.24-1.93, p<0.001). Loss of taste also exhibited similar associations with PHQ-2 and GAD-2. PHQ-2 and GAD-2 scores were not associated with severities of any other symptoms during the COVID-19 course. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the occurrence of symptoms-such as SOB-associated with severe manifestations of COVID-19, only the severities of smell and taste loss were associated with depressed mood and anxiety.

"Coronavirus disease 2019: Knowledge, attitude, and practice of pregnant women in a tertiary hospital in Abakaliki, southeast Nigeria","OBJECTIVE: To determine the knowledge, attitude, and practice of antenatal attendees towards COVID-19 in Alex Ekwueme Federal University Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki, Nigeria. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was carried out among 430 consenting pregnant women attending antenatal clinics between March 1 and May 30, 2020, using pretested questionnaires. RESULTS: The mean age and mean gestational age of the respondents were 30.04 years (95% confidence interval [CI] 28.9-31.1) and 26.3 weeks (95% CI 23.3-29.3), respectively. More than four-fifths (82%) of the women believed that COVID-19 is real and their main source of information was mass media. The majority had adequate knowledge of COVID-19. More than half of the respondents said COVID-19 is a curable disease and that chloroquine can be used. The majority showed a good attitude and preventice practice of COVID-19 disease; however, one-fourth (24%) thought that infected individuals should be killed to prevent the spread of the virus. CONCLUSION: The study population has good knowledge, attitude, and practice of COVID-19 disease. However, it is worrisome that some respondents thought that infected individuals should be killed. Proper education must be given to the populace to avert these negative attitudes while promoting a positive preventive attitude.","Anikwe, Chidebe C; Ogah, Christian O; Anikwe, Ifeyinwa H; Okorochukwu, Bartholomew C; Ikeoha, Cyril C","https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ijgo.13293","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Gynaecol Obstet;2020 Jul 01.; Publication details: Int J Gynaecol Obstet;2020 Jul 01.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2348,""

This paper highlights several clinical, administrative, medicolegal and IT implications of Covid-19 on the delivery of mental healthcare to an elderly vulnerable patient cohort due to recommended social distancing measures. Our Psychiatry of Later Life team has adapted to this by restricting face-to-face consultation, while continuing to provide telephone support. We have modified our documentation standard and have improved some aspects of our team working by facilitating flexible working arrangement and relevant training for staff as well as by embracing new technology. Notwithstanding the challenges therefore, this exceptional time has also opened avenues for new and innovative opportunities that can be further explored even when the current crisis eventually passes.","Usman, Memoona; Fahy, Sabina","https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/ipm.2020.86","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Ir J Psychol Med;: 1-9, 2020 Jul 02.; Publication details: Ir J Psychol Med;: 1-9, 2020 Jul 02.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2349,""

"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): an evidence map of medical literature","BACKGROUND: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in December 2019, a substantial body of COVID-19 medical literature has been generated. As of June 2020, gaps and longitudinal trends in the COVID-19 medical literature remain unidentified, despite potential benefits for research prioritisation and policy setting in both the COVID-19 pandemic and future large-scale public health crises. METHODS: In this paper, we searched PubMed and Embase for medical literature on COVID-19 between 1 January and 24 March 2020. We characterised the growth of the early COVID-19 medical literature using evidence maps and bibliometric analyses to elicit cross-sectional and longitudinal trends and systematically identify gaps. RESULTS: The early COVID-19 medical literature originated primarily from Asia and focused mainly on clinical features and diagnosis of the disease. Many areas of potential research remain underexplored, such as mental health, the use of novel technologies and artificial intelligence, pathophysiology of COVID-19 within different body systems, and indirect effects of COVID-19 on the care of non-COVID-19 patients. Few articles involved research collaboration at the international level (24.7%). The median submission-to-publication duration was 8 days (interquartile range: 4-16). CONCLUSIONS: Although in its early phase, COVID-19 research has generated a large volume of publications. However, there are still knowledge gaps yet to be filled and areas for improvement for the global research community. Our analysis of early COVID-19 research may be valuable in informing research prioritisation and policy planning both in the current COVID-19 pandemic and similar global health crises.","Liu, Nan; Chee, Marcel Lucas; Niu, Chenglin; Pek, Pin Pin; Siddiqui, Fahad Javaid; Ansah, John Pastor; Matchar, David Bruce; Lam, Sean Shao Wei; Abdullah, Hairil Rizal; Chan, Angelique; Malhotra, Rahul; Graves, Nicholas; Koh, Mariko Siyue; Yoon, Sungwon; Ho, Andrew Fu Wah; Ting, Daniel Shu Wei; Low, Jenny Guek Hong; Ong, Marcus Eng Hock","https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12874-020-01059-y","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMC Med Res Methodol;20(1): 177, 2020 Jul 02.; Publication details: BMC Med Res Methodol;20(1): 177, 2020 Jul 02.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2351,""

"Validation of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale in a US College Sample","The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted college studentsâ€™ coursework, stress levels, and perceived health. Various estimates indicate that high proportions of college students have experienced increased amounts of stress (Dziech, Inside Higher Education, 2020; Hartocollis, New York Times, 2020), yet other sources indicate that many college students respond to these changes with resilience (Kelley, Cornell Chronicle, 2020). A method for assessing student anxiety regarding the pandemic is thus needed. The Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) (Ahorsu et al., International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction, 2020) is a seven-item scale which has been validated and shown to possess good psychometric qualities in studies of participants from multiple countries. The current study used a cross-sectional convenience sample of US college student participants (n = 237) and found that the FCV-19S has high reliability and validity as demonstrated by its internal consistency and strong one-factor solution. Scores on the FCV-19S were positively correlated with anxiety for students who were married or of Asian descent. Additionally, the FCV-19S was only moderately correlated with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Scale (GAD-7), suggesting that the FCV-19S may bring added utility to research and clinical practice with populations impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Perz, Catherine A.; Lang, Brent A.; Harrington, Rick","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00356-3","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Int.

"Prospects for improving future mental health of children through prenatal maternal micronutrient supplementation in China","Prenatal micronutrients in pregnant womenâ€™s diets, including supplements, have an essential role in fetal brain development and may reduce the risk of mental disorders in offspring. Folic acid, vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acids, and choline have been investigated for this purpose. Folic acid supplementation throughout pregnancy has well-established positive effects. Vitamin D, administered to the mother before birth or to the newborn, has also been shown to reduce the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders. Omega-3 fatty acids during pregnancy have a more uncertain role, with recent trials questioning a beneficial effect on cognition and attention deficit disorder, despite positive effects on prematurity and neonatal wheezing prevention. Choline supplementation is associated with positive effects on cognition and behavior, including early behaviors associated with the development of autism and schizophrenia. There is no experience yet with COVID-19, but adverse effects on fetal brain development of most common coronaviruses are mitigated by higher choline levels. Maternal dietary supplementation of nutrients is a benign and inexpensive intervention in pregnancy to prevent life-long disability from mental illness. Use of dietary supplements in poorer, rural areas of China is below recommendations. Physicians, midwives, and public health officials in China can promote prenatal nutrient supplementation to reduce the future burden of mental illnesses that might be prevented before birth.","Li, Ying; Freedman, Robert","https://doi.org/10.1002/ped4.12199","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Pediatr.

This study (completed before the COVID-19 pandemic) used a multiple baseline single-case design to compare the relative effectiveness of in-person supervision and telesupervision  For the small sample of supervisee participants, in-person supervision and telesupervision had equivalent outcomes;there was no significant decrease in participant-rated supervision satisfaction or supervisory working alliance after participants switched from the initial in-person supervision format to telesupervision  In follow-up interviews, participants discussed 4 themes which may be relevant to mental health care professionals adopting telesupervision: (a) differences between modalities, (b) characteristics of an effective supervisor, (c) the role of technology, and (d) personal preference  These results add to a small but growing evidence base that suggests telesupervision is a viable alternative to in-person supervision  Practical recommendations for telesupervision during the COVID-19 pandemic are also discussed","Tarlow, Kevin R.; McCord, Carly E.; Nelon, Jordan L.; Bernhard, Paula A.","https://doi.org/10.1037/int0000210","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Journal of Psychotherapy Integration;30(2):383-393, 2020.; Publication details: Journal of Psychotherapy Integration;30(2):383-393, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2385,""

METHODS: Transcript data from 31 synchronous, text-based chats collected during the onset of state-based ""social distancing"" ordinances in Spring 2020 were analyzed. RESULTS: While encountering COVID-19-related stressors likely to be experienced by youth generally, participants' experiences were concomitantly imbued with LGBTQ-specific intrapersonal, interpersonal, and structural challenges. Difficulties included maintaining mental health, being isolated with unsupportive families, and loss of in-person identity-based socialization and support.

"Transplant Patients' Isolation and Social Distancing Because of COVID-19: Analysis of the Resilient Capacities of the Transplant in the Management of the Coronavirus Emergency","BACKGROUND: One of the peculiar aspects of the transplant patient's life is that, in the post-surgery phase, the patient lives in an ""isolation"" condition, having to pay particular attention to the living environment and preferring a limited social life given that the immunosuppressive treatment entails immunodepression in the patient. With coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID)-19, as in a post-surgery situation, social isolation is being implemented. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study started on March 17, 2020, and ended on April 24, 2020. Consulting/phone interviews were made. The phone questionnaire, submitted to 71Â patients, consisted of a set of 15 questions that investigated structure and psychological resistance. Eight patients have been monitored exclusively for the psychological aspect through a more articulate supporting path. RESULTS: In essence, from the overall analysis of the data derived from the study of the positioning of patients based on the stage of renal function, the bands related to the development of psychopathological aspects, and the use of positive personal resources, it emerges that patients in stage V kidney failure are in the first bracket as regards the development of psychopathological aspects (absence of these experiences) and in the third bracket as regards the good use of positive resources to deal with isolation. Therefore, it can be deduced that, although with data that can be expanded, a serious or medium-serious situation from an organic point of view in this socio-health emergency situation is well addressed by the transplanted patient. CONCLUSION: Transplant patients have faced the measure of social distancing adequately and in adherence to the treatment thanks to the phone assistance of all the medical-surgical and psychological team.","Lupi, Diana; Binda, Barbara; Montali, Filippo; Natili, Andrea; Lancione, Laura; Chiappori, Davide; Parzanese, Ida; Maccarone, Daniela; Pisani, Francesco","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.transproceed.2020.05.031","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Transplant Proc;2020 May 30.; Publication details: Transplant Proc;2020 May 30.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2407,""

"Modeling Nigerian Covid-19 cases: A comparative analysis of models and estimators","COVID-19 remains a major pandemic currently threatening all the countries of the world. In Nigeria, there were 1, 932 COVID-19 confirmed cases, 319 discharged cases and 58 deaths as of 30th April 2020. This paper, therefore, subjected the daily cumulative reported COVID-19 cases of these three variables to nine (9) curve estimation statistical models in simple, quadratic, cubic, and quartic forms. It further identified the best of the thirty-six (36) models and used the same for prediction and forecasting purposes. The data collected by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control for sixty-four (64) days, two (2) months and three (3), were daily monitored and eventually analyzed. We identified the best models to be Quartic Linear Regression Model with an autocorrelated error of order 1 (AR(1)); and found the Ordinary Least Squares, Cochrane Orcutt, Hildrethâ€“Lu, and Prais-Winsten and Least Absolute Deviation (LAD) estimators useful to estimate the modelsâ€™ parameters. Consequently, we recommended the daily cumulative forecast values of the LAD estimator for May and June 2020 with a 99% confidence level. The forecast values are alarming, and so, the Nigerian Government needs to hastily review her activities and interventions towards COVID-19 to provide some tactical and robust structures and measures to avert these challenges.","Ayinde, Kayode; Lukman, Adewale F.; Rauf, Rauf I.; Alabi, Olusegun O.; Okon, Charles E.; Ayinde, Opeyemi E.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2020.109911","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Chaos Solitons Fractals;(138)20200901.; Publication details: Chaos Solitons Fractals;(138)20200901.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2415,""
"Emociones, preocupaciones y reflexiones frente a la pandemia del COVID-19 en Argentina; Emotions, concerns and reflections regarding the COVID-19 pandemic in Argentina","Resumen El objetivo de este trabajo es explorar los sentimientos y expectativas que genera el COVID-19 en Argentina durante la primera etapa de la pandemia. Se aplicÃ³ una encuesta de la OrganizaciÃ³n Mundial de la Salud adaptada al contexto local. Se incluyeron preguntas abiertas para indagar sentimientos de las personas frente al COVID-19, y se realizÃ³ un anÃ¡lisis de contenido. Como resultados se advierte que la poblaciÃ³n encuestada siente incertidumbre, miedo y angustia, pero tambiÃ©n emerge un sentimiento de responsabilidad y cuidado frente al COVID-19. AsÃ­ mismo se destacan sentimientos positivos para la sociedad como una valoraciÃ³n de la interdependencia social. Los resultados arribados seÃ±alan que el impacto en la salud mental es desigual segÃºn el gÃ©nero, el nivel educativo alcanzado y el confort percibido en el hogar. El estudio permite concluir que las dimensiones emocionales y vinculares de las personas resultan aspectos centrales ante la pandemia del COVID-19 en Argentina. Es recomendable que estas dimensiones, asÃ­ como y su impacto subjetivo y social diferencial entre los diversos grupos poblacionales, sean consideradas en la planificaciÃ³n de polÃ­ticas para afrontar el COVID-19.; Abstract The scope of this work is to explore the feelings and expectations that COVID-19 has generated in Argentina during the first stage of the pandemic. A survey of the World Health Organization adapted to the local context was applied. Open-ended questions were included to study people's feelings about COVID-19, and content analysis was subsequently conducted. In terms of results, it is revealed that the population surveyed feels uncertainty, fear and anguish, albeit a feeling of responsibility and care in the face of COVID-19 also emerges. Moreover, positive feelings regarding society stand out as an achievement of social interdependence. The results obtained show that the impact on mental health differs in accordance with gender, educational level, and perceived comfort in the home. The study concludes that the emotional and bonding dimensions of people are central to confronting the COVID-19 pandemic in Argentina. It is recommended that these dimensions, as well as their subjective and differential social impact among the different population groups, should be considered in the planning of policies to address the COVID-19 pandemic.","Johnson, MarÃ­a Cecilia; Saletti-Cuesta, Lorena; Tumas, Natalia","http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1413-81232020000702447","","Country: BR; BRASIL; BRAZIL; BRASIL; BRESIL; BRASILE; Database: LILACS; Publication details: CiÃªnc.

"Clinical and Surgical Assistance in Prostate Cancer during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Implementation of assistance protocols","PURPOSE: Propose an approach of prostate cancer (PCa) patients during COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a review of current literature related to surgical and clinical management of patients during COVID-19 crisis paying special attention to oncological ones and especially those suffering from PCa. Based on these publications and current urological guidelines, a manual to manage PCa patients is suggested. RESULTS: Patients suffering from cancer are likely to develop serious complications from COVID-19 disease together with an increased risk of postoperative morbidity and mortality. Therefore, the management of oncological patients should be taken into special consideration and most of the treatments postponed. In case the procedure is not deferrable, it should be adapted to the current situation. While the shortest radiotherapy (RT) regimens should be applied, surgical procedures must undergo the following recommendations proposed by main surgical associations. PCa prognosis is generally favourable and therefore one can safely delay most of the biopsies up to 6 months without interfering with survival outcomes in the vast majority of cases. In the same way, most of the localised PCa patients are suitable for active surveillance (AS) or hormonal therapy until local definitive treatment could be reconsidered. In metastatic as well as castration resistant PCa stages, adding androgen receptor targeted agents (abiraterone, apalutamide, darolutamide or enzalutamide) to androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) could be considered in high risk patients. On the contrary, chemotherapy, immunotherapy and Radium-223 must be avoided with regard to the consequence of hematologic toxicity and risk of COVID-19 infection because of immunodepression. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the biopsies should be delayed while AS is advised in those patients with low risk PCa. ADT allows us to defer definitive local treatment in many cases of intermediate and high risk PCa. In regard to metastatic and castration resistant PCa, combination therapies with abiraterone, apalutamide, darolutamide or enzalutamide could be considered. Chemotherapy, Radium-223 and immunotherapy are discouraged.","Sanchez, Lara Rodriguez; Cathelineau, Xavier; Pinto, Alexis Alva; Borque-Fernando, Ãngel; Gil, Maria JesÃºs; Yee, Chi-Hang; Sanchez-Salas, Rafael","https://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1677-5538.IBJU.2020.S106","","Country: BR; BRASIL; BRAZIL; BRASIL; BRESIL; BRASILE; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int Braz J Urol;462020 Jun 17.; Publication details: Int Braz J Urol;462020 Jun 17.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2417,""
"Singapore COVID-19 Pandemic Response as a Successful Model Framework for Low-Resource Health Care Settings in Africa?","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus continues to spread and evolve across the planet. The crosscutting impacts of the virus, individual country responses to the virus, and the state of preparedness of local public health systems greatly vary across the world. The ostensibly late arrival of the virus in Africa has allowed learning, innovation, and adaptation of methods that have been successful in the early-hit countries. This article analyzes how Singapore has responded to the COVID-19 pandemic and proposes that adaptations of the Singapore pandemic response model would bode well for Africa's response to the COVID-19 pandemic in ways that also take into account regional differences in health care infrastructures, socioeconomic resilience, poverty, and the vast population diversity in the African continent. As the pandemic evolves, the lessons learned in Asia, in particular, and the emerging new experiences in African countries should inform, ideally in real time, how best to steer the world populations into safety, including those in low-resource health care settings. Finally, we note that the current COVID-19 pandemic is also a test for our collective ability to scale and surge public health in response to future and likely equally challenging zoonosis infections that jump from animals to humans, not to mention climate change-related planetary health calamities in the 21st century. Hence, what we learn effectively from the current COVID-19 pandemic shall have broad, enduring, and intergenerational relevance for the future of planetary heath and society.","Kuguyo, Oppah; Kengne, Andre Pascal; Dandara, Collet","https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/omi.2020.0077","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: OMICS;2020 Jun 16.; Publication details: OMICS;2020 Jun 16.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2418,""

"Impact of COVID-19 on gaming disorder: Monitoring and prevention","The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has necessitated physical distancing, lockdown, contact tracing, and self-quarantine so as to prevent the spread of the disease. Amid the outbreak, gaming data usage has reportedly increased in the United States, and game download volume has reached a record high in Europe. Because gaming can be used to cope with the psychological stress from the outbreak, therefore mental health professionals should be aware of how increased gaming during the pandemic may contribute to risk of gaming disorder, especially if the pandemic persists. Mental health professionals should thus formulate safe social interaction alternatives for people, particularly adolescents, who have gaming disorder risk.","Ko, Yen","https://doi.org/10.1556/2006.2020.00040","20200707","COVID-19; adolescents; gaming disorder; physical distancing; psychological impact","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2427,""
"Pediatric mental and behavioral health in the period of quarantine and social distancing (COVID-19)","The COVID-19 pandemic has spread rapidly throughout the world and has generated a long-term impact. The pandemic has caused great harm to society and also caused serious psychological trauma to many people. Pediatrics are a vulnerable group in this global public health emergency, as their nervous systems, endocrine systems and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axes are not well developed. Psychological crises often cause pediatrics to produce feelings of abandonment, despair, incapacity and exhaustion, and even raising the risk of suicide. Children with mental illnesses are especially vulnerable during the quarantine and social distancing period. The inclusion of psychosocial support for pediatrics and their families are part of the health responses to disaster and disaster recovery. Based on the bio-psycho-social model, some pediatrics may have catastrophic thoughts and are prone to experience despair, numbness, flashback and other serious emotional and behavioral reactions. In severe cases, there may be symptoms of psychosis or post-traumatic stress disorder. Timely and appropriate protections are needed to prevent the occurrence of psychological and behavioral problems. The emerging digital applications and health services such as telehealth, social media, mobile health and remote interactive online education are able to bridge the social distance and support mental and behavioral health for pediatric populations. Based on the psychological development characteristics of pediatrics, this study also illustrates interventions on the psychological impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. Even though the world has been struggling to curb the influences of the pandemic, the quarantine and social distancing policies will have long-term impacts on pediatrics. Innovative digital solutions and informatics tools are needed more than ever to mitigate the negative consequences on pediatrics. Healthcare delivery and services should envision and implement innovative paradigms to meet broad well-being needs and pediatric health as the quarantine and social distancing over a longer term become a new reality. Future research on pediatric mental and behavioral health should pay more attention to novel solutions that incorporate cutting edge interactive technologies and digital approaches, leveraging considerable advances in pervasive and ubiquitous computing, human-computer interaction, health informatics and among many others. Digital approaches, health technologies and informatics are supposed to be designed and implemented to support public health surveillance and critical responses to pediatrics' growth and development. For instance, human-computer interactions, augmented reality and virtual reality could be incorporated to remote psychological supporting service for pediatric health; mobile technologies could be used to monitor pediatrics' mental and behavioral health while protecting their individual privacy; big data and artificial intelligences could be utilized to support decision-making on whether pediatrics should go out for physical activities and whether schools should be reopened, etc. Implications to clinical practice, psychological therapeutic practices and future research directions to address current efforts gaps have been highlighted.","Ye","https://doi.org/10.2196/19867","20200707","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2428,""
"Risk, resilience, psychological distress, and anxiety at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany","The current COVID-19 pandemic comes with multiple psychological stressors due to health-related, social, economic, and individual consequences and may cause psychological distress. The aim of this study was to screen the population in Germany for negative impact on mental health in the current COVID-19 pandemic and to analyze possible risk and protective factors. A total of 6,509 people took part in an online survey in Germany from 27 March to 6 April. The questionnaire included demographic information and ascertained psychological distress, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and risk and protective factors. In our sample, over 50% expressed suffering from anxiety and psychological distress regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants spent several hours per day thinking about COVID-19 (MÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 4.45). Psychological and social determinants showed stronger associations with anxiety regarding COVID-19 than experiences with the disease. The current COVID-19 pandemic does cause psychological distress, anxiety, and depression for large proportions of the general population. Strategies such as maintaining a healthy lifestyle and social contacts, acceptance of anxiety and negative emotions, fostering self-efficacy, and information on where to get medical treatment if needed, seem of help, while substance abuse and suppression of anxiety and negative emotions seem to be associated with more psychological burden.","Petzold, Bendau, Plag, Pyrkosch, Mascarell Maricic, Betzler, Rogoll, GroÃƒÅ¸e, StrÃƒÂ¶hle","https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.1745","20200707","adjustment disorders; anxiety/anxiety disorders; coping; corona; depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2429,""
"A nation-wide survey on emotional and psychological impacts of COVID-19 social distancing","Social distancing is crucial in order to flatten the curve of COVID-19 virus spreading. Isolation, scarcity of resources and the lack of social contacts may have produced a negative impact on people's emotions and psychological well-being. This study aims to explore the reasons and the ways through which social distancing generates negative emotions in individuals who experienced the lockdown. To a larger extent, the objective is to check the existence of relations between negative emotions and the satisfaction of basic needs. In Italy 140,656 online interviews were collected from March 22 to April 2, 2020. Data analysis was carried out using mono and bivariate statistical analysis, K-means clustering and the Principal Components Analysis (PCA). The parameters for the identification of six clusters were: the intensity of the respondent's basic emotions and the layers of Maslow's hierarchy of needs. The majority of people involved in an emergency situation, implying a collapse of social contacts, experience some kind of emotional reactions. In our study, we found a correlation between basic emotions and Maslow's hierarchy of needs. In times of crisis, the most basic needs are the physiological ones. Fear, anger and sadness are predominant in all population groups; anger and disgust mainly appear when people are exposed to the risk of not being able to meet subsistence needs, thus perceiving a lack of economic security. The well-known Maslow's theory of human needs seems to fit well with the outbreak of negative emotions in the context of COVID-19. This study demonstrates the existence of links between negative emotions and primary needs that mainly refer to the first three levels of Maslow's pyramid. As a result of COVID-19 worldwide pandemic, many people have been sucked into the bottom layers of the pyramid. This change in individual basic needs has triggered a relevant transformation in individual emotional status and a shift towards negative emotions.","Cerbara, Ciancimino, Crescimbene, La Longa, Parsi, Tintori, Palomba","https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202006_21711","20200707","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2430,""
"COVID-19 pandemic lockdown: An emotional health perspective of Indians on Twitter","Novel corona virus (2019-nCoV) has spread in the world since its first human infection in December 2019. India has also witnessed a rising number of infections since March 2020. The Indian government imposed lockdowns in the nation to control the movement of its citizens thereby confining the spread of the virus. Tweeters resorted to usage of social media platform to express their mind. Through this article, an attempt has been made to understand the mind-set of Indian people using Python and R statistical software, during the recent lockdown 2.0 (15 April 2020 to 3 May 2020) and lockdown 3.0 (4 May 2020 to 17 May 2020) through their tweets on the social media platform Twitter. Also, opinion on e-commerce during this pandemic has been analysed. Analysis has been performed using Python and R statistical software. Also, recent articles related to COVID-19 have been considered and reviewed. Although the country had a positive approach in lockdown 2.0 with only few instances of sadness, disgust and others, the majority of the people had a negative approach in lockdown 3.0.

"Prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression among the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review and meta-analysis","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on public mental health. Therefore, monitoring and oversight of the population mental health during crises such as a panedmic is an immediate priority. The aim of this study is to analyze the existing research works and findings in relation to the prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression in the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, articles that have focused on stress and anxiety prevalence among the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic were searched in the Science Direct, Embase, Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science (ISI) and Google Scholar databases, without a lower time limit and until May 2020. In order to perform a meta-analysis of the collected studies, the random effects model was used, and the heterogeneity of studies was investigated using the I<sup>2</sup> index. Moreover. data analysis was conducted using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) software. The prevalence of stress in 5 studies with a total sample size of 9074 is obtained as 29.6% (95% confidence limit: 24.3-35.4), the prevalence of anxiety in 17 studies with a sample size of 63,439 as 31.9% (95% confidence interval: 27.5-36.7), and the prevalence of depression in 14 studies with a sample size of 44,531 people as 33.7% (95% confidence interval: 27.5-40.6). COVID-19 not only causes physical health concerns but also results in a number of psychological disorders.

"Augmenting Evidence-Based Care With a Texting Mobile Interventionist: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial","This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and clinical utility of training intensive psychiatric community care team members to serve as &quot;mobile interventionists&quot; who engage patients in recovery-oriented texting exchanges. A 3-month pilot randomized controlled trial was conducted to compare the mobile interventionist approach as an add-on to assertive community treatment (ACT) versus ACT alone. Participants were 49 individuals with serious mental illness (62% with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder, 24% with bipolar disorder, and 14% with depression). Clinical outcomes were evaluated at baseline, posttreatment, and 6-month follow-up, and satisfaction was evaluated posttreatment. The intervention appeared feasible (95% of participants assigned to the mobile interventionist arm initiated the intervention, texting on 69% of possible days and averaging four messages per day), acceptable (91% reported satisfaction), and safe (no adverse events reported). Exploratory posttreatment clinical effect estimations suggested greater reductions in the severity of paranoid thoughts (Cohen's d=-0.61) and depression (d=-0.59) and improved illness management (d=0.31) and recovery (d=0.23) in the mobile interventionist group. Augmentation of care with a texting mobile interventionist proved to be feasible, acceptable, safe, and clinically promising. The findings are encouraging given the relative ease of training practitioners to serve as mobile interventionists, the low burden placed on patients and practitioners, and the simplicity of the technology. The technical resources are widely accessible to patients and practitioners, boding well for potential intervention scalability. When pandemics such as COVID-19 block the possibility of in-person patient-provider contact, evidence-based texting interventions can serve a crucial role in supporting continuity of care.","Ben-Zeev, Buck, Meller, Hudenko, Hallgren","https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.202000239","20200707","assertive community treatment; bipolar disorder; depression; digital interventions; mHealth; schizophrenia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2434,""
"Effects of Covid-19 Lockdown on Mental Health and Sleep Disturbances in Italy","Italy was the first European country that entered a nationwide lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since quarantine can impact on mental health, this study aimed to estimate the prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and sleeping disturbances in the Italian population during lockdown. The factors that might influence such outcomes were explored. A national cross-sectional survey was performed during the last 14 days of the Italian lockdown. Questionnaires assessed socio-demographics characteristic, behaviors and healthcare access. The outcomes were assessed using Patient Health Questionnaire-2 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2. Participants with sleep disturbances completed the Insomnia Severity Index. The sample size was 1515. Depression and anxiety symptom prevalence was 24.7% and 23.2%; 42.2% had sleep disturbances and, among them, 17.4% reported moderate/severe insomnia. Being female, an increased time spent on the internet and an avoidance of activities through peer pressure increased the likelihood of at least one mental health outcome. Increasing age, an absence of work-related troubles and being married or being a cohabitant reduced such a probability. Females and participants with chronic conditions were associated with a higher prevalence of sleep disturbances. It is crucial to study effective interventions, specifically planning strategies, for more vulnerable groups and to consider the role of the internet.","Gualano, Lo Moro, Voglino, Bert, Siliquini","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17134779","20200707","anxiety; depression; patient health questionnaire; quarantine; sleep wake disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2435,""

Through collection of 2132 questionnaire responses in field research, the present researchers analyzed the data using descriptive statistics and various approaches. In conclusion, the public's high level of willingness to share information, sufficient knowledge of and consensus on epidemic prevention between individuals and families, strict compliance with relevant regulations, effective preventive measures, and adequate public facilities have contributed to control of COVID-19. However, vigilance and awareness of the pandemic in some individuals, epidemic-prevention campaigns, and community-based preventive measures were insufficient. Some citizens subsequently suffered from headaches, anxiety, and mood instability. Furthermore, demographic variables (place of residence, sex, age, and occupation) and physical and mental health status produced various effects on citizens' awareness, attitude, and behavior regarding epidemic prevention as well as the perceived effect of COVID-19 on physical and mental health.","Hsu, Lin, Wang, Jhang","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17134694","20200707","Coronavirus Disease 2019; Taiwan; prevention measures","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2436,""

"COVID stress syndrome: Concept, structure, and correlates","Research shows that the COVID Stress Scales have a robust multifactorial structure, representing five correlated facets of COVID-19-related distress: (a) Fear of the dangerousness of COVID-19, which includes fear of coming into contact with fomites potentially contaminated with SARSCoV2, (b) worry about socioeconomic costs of COVID-19 (e.g., worry about personal finances and disruption in the supply chain), (c) xenophobic fears that foreigners are spreading SARSCoV2, (d) traumatic stress symptoms associated with direct or vicarious traumatic exposure to COVID-19 (nightmares, intrusive thoughts, or images related to COVID-19), and (e) COVID-19-related compulsive checking and reassurance seeking. These factors cohere to form a COVID stress syndrome, which we sought to further delineate in the present study. A population-representative sample of 6,854 American and Canadian adults completed a self-report survey comprising questions about current mental health and COVID-19-related experiences, distress, and coping. Network analysis revealed that worry about the dangerousness of COVID-19 is the central feature of the syndrome. Latent class analysis indicated that the syndrome is quasi-dimensional, comprising five classes differing in syndrome severity. Sixteen percent of participants were in the most severe class and possibly needing mental health services. Syndrome severity was correlated with preexisting psychopathology and with excessive COVID-19-related avoidance, panic buying, and coping difficulties during self-isolation. The findings provide new information about the structure and correlates of COVID stress syndrome.

"Psychological Symptoms During the Two Stages of Lockdown in Response to the COVID-19 Outbreak: An Investigation in a Sample of Citizens in Northern Spain","Spain has been in a state of emergency since 14th March due to the COVID-19 crisis. This state of emergency means that the population must comply with strict rules such as lockdown (confinement to their homes except for essential trips) and social distancing. The aim of this study was to examine the psychological state of the general population in a sample recruited in Northern Spain. Sociodemographic and psychological data were gathered, assessing variables such as stress, anxiety, and depression. A questionnaire was administered at the beginning of the lockdown and three weeks later. The sample was recruited using an online questionnaire by means of a non-probabilistic snowball sampling methodology. A total of 1,933 people participated in this study. The results reveal that more than a quarter of the participants have reported symptoms of depression (27.5%), anxiety (26.9%) and stress (26.5%) and as the time spent in lockdown has progressed, psychological symptoms have risen. In relation to gender, data indicate that men have higher levels of depression than women, and similar levels of anxiety and stress. Greater symptomatology has also been found among the younger population and in people with chronic diseases. We discuss the need to continue carrying out these types of studies to prevent and treat psychological problems that could emerge amidst this pandemic.","Ozamiz-Etxebarria, Idoiaga Mondragon, Dosil SantamarÃƒÂ­a, Picaza Gorrotxategi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01491","20200707","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; lockdown; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2440,""
"Cancer, immune suppression and Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19): Need to manage drug safety (French Society for Oncology Pharmacy [SFPO] guidelines)","The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is disrupting our health environment. As expected, studies highlighted the great susceptibility of cancer patients to COVID-19 and more severe complications, leading oncologists to deeply rethink patient cancer care. This review is dedicated to the optimization of care pathways and therapeutics in cancer patients during the pandemic and aims to discuss successive issues. First we focused on the international guidelines proposing adjustments and alternative options to cancer care in order to limit hospital admission and cytopenic treatment in cancer patients, most of whom are immunocompromised. In addition cancer patients are prone to polypharmacy, enhancing the risk of drug-related problems as adverse events and drug-drug interactions. Due to increased risk in case of COVID-19, we reported a comprehensive review of all the drug-related problems between COVID-19 and antineoplastics. Moreover, in the absence of approved drug against COVID-19, infected patients may be included in clinical trials evaluating new drugs with a lack of knowledge, particularly in cancer patients. Focusing on the several experimental drugs currently being evaluated, we set up an original data board helping oncologists and pharmacists to identify promptly drug-related problems between antineoplastics and experimental drugs. Finally additional and concrete recommendations are provided, supporting oncologists and pharmacists in their efforts to manage cancer patients and to optimize their treatments in this new era related to COVID-19.","Slimano, Baudouin, Zerbit, Toulemonde-Deldicque, Thomas-Schoemann, Chevrier, Daouphars, Madelaine, Pourroy, Tournamille, Astier, Ranchon, Cazin, Bardin, Rioufol","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ctrv.2020.102063","20200707","COVID-19; Clinical trials; Drug safety; Drug-drug interactions; Drug-related problems; Herb-Drug interactions; Immune depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2441,""

"Psychological impact of COVID-19 on a sample of Spanish health professionals","After the outbreak of the COVID-19 was considered a global pandemic in March 2020, the state of alarm was declared in Spain. In this situation, health professionals are experiencing high levels of stress due to the overload of work the pandemic is generating and the conditions in which they are working. The aim of this study was to evaluate the factors that can destabilize the mental health of these professionals in our context. The sample was composed of 421 health professionals. The data were gathered by an online questionnaire sent to them by e-mail. The DASS-21 was used to assess anxiety, stress and depression, and the EAI to measure sleep difficulties. In addition, other descriptive variables that could be related to psychological symptomatology were collected from the sample. The results show that the COVID-19 pandemic has generated symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression and insomnia among health workers, with higher levels among women and older professionals. Some factors such as having been in contact with the virus or fear at work, triggered greater symptomatology. In this critical situation, professionals are in the front line and therefore, are directly exposed to certain risks and stressors. This contributes to the development of diverse psychological symptoms. Consequently, it is recommended to offer them psychological help in order to reduce the emotional impact of the COVID-19, and thus, to ensure not only the mental health of our health professionals, but also the adequate care they provide.","Dosil SantamarÃƒÂ­a, Ozamiz-Etxebarria, Redondo RodrÃƒÂ­guez, Jaureguizar Alboniga-Mayor, Picaza Gorrotxategi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rpsm.2020.05.004","20200707","Ansiedad; Anxiety; COVID-19; DepresiÃƒÂ³n; Depression; Health proffesionals; Insomnia; Insomnio; Personal sanitario","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2443,""

"[Problems of mental health in the situation of COVID-19 pandemic]","The WHO declared COVID-19 pandemic, the deterioration of the epidemic situation in Russia, the lockdown and the growing fear in society caused by panic rumors and misinformation spread on social networks and the media pose urgent organizational and medical tasks for our psychiatric service. Based on the experience of other countries that have already encountered the massive spread of COVID-19, the author presents a review of the proposed urgent and preventive organizational and treatment measures and suggests practical recommendations on urgent temporary reorganization of the psychiatric service, and the provision of psychological and psychotherapeutic support to the most vulnerable groups of the population, including medical personnel working with patients with COVID-19, and the management of mentally ill patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome. As the primary goals, it is proposed to separate the flows of people in need of psychological support and psychiatric care, and organize the remote provision of these services (hotline phones and telemedicine consultations). Particular attention is paid to the management of mentally ill patients with coronavirus respiratory syndrome and the characteristics of psychopharmacological therapy with an overview of the potential risks of side-effects and complications related primarily to respiratory function, including those due to adverse drug interactions.

Evidence generated to-date on the virulence and pathogenicity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) suggests that COVID-19 may be considered a perfect storm, caused by a nature's virtually perfect biological weapon. This conclusion is supported by an updated analysis of pathogenesis and clinical progression of this infectious disease. It is now readily apparent that COVID-19 is not a clear-cut disorder, but is instead a gradually evolving pathology, characterized by a series of stages sustained by different molecular and biological mechanisms. The disease can hence be divided in at least five different phases (incubation, respiratory, pro-inflammatory, pro-thrombotic, and death or remission). Whilst the virus triggers direct cytopathic injury during the initial stage of illness, in the following evolving phases, it is the host itself that undergoes an almost suicidal reaction, sustained, amplified and maintained by the immune, complement and hemostatic systems. Another peculiar property making SARS-CoV-2 a devious and vicious pathogen is the biophysical structure of its receptor biding domain, which needs to be primed by human proteases, thus being less efficiently targetable by the host immune system. The unique pathophysiology of COVID-19 requires the customization of therapy by individual patient characteristics and according to the phase-specific, evolving derangement of the multiple biological pathways.","Lippi, Sanchis-Gomar, Henry","https://doi.org/10.21037/atm-20-3989","20200704","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); coagulation; coronavirus; inflammation; pathogenesis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2448,""
"Emotional distress in young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic: evidence of risk and resilience from a longitudinal cohort study","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and associated lockdown could be considered a 'perfect storm' for increases in emotional distress. Such increases can only be identified by studies that use data collected before and during the pandemic. Longitudinal data are also needed to examine (1) the roles of previous distress and stressors in emotional distress during the pandemic and (2) how COVID-19-related stressors and coping strategies are associated with emotional distress when pre-pandemic distress is accounted for. Data came from a cohort study (N = 768). Emotional distress (perceived stress, internalizing symptoms, and anger), COVID-19-related stressors, and coping strategies were measured during the pandemic/lockdown when participants were aged 22. Previous distress and stressors were measured before COVID-19 (at age 20). On average, participants showed increased levels of perceived stress and anger (but not internalizing symptoms) during the pandemic compared to before. Pre-COVID-19 emotional distress was the strongest predictor of during-pandemic emotional distress, followed by during-pandemic economic and psychosocial stressors (e.g. lifestyle and economic disruptions) and hopelessness, and pre-pandemic social stressors (e.g. bullying victimization and stressful life events). Most health risks to self or loved ones due to COVID-19 were not uniquely associated with emotional distress in final models. Coping strategies associated with reduced distress included keeping a daily routine, physical activity, and positive reappraisal/reframing. In our community sample, pre-pandemic distress, secondary consequences of the pandemic (e.g. lifestyle and economic disruptions), and pre-pandemic social stressors were more consistently associated with young adults' emotional distress than COVID-19-related health risk exposures.","Shanahan, Steinhoff, Bechtiger, Murray, Nivette, Hepp, Ribeaud, Eisner","https://doi.org/10.1017/S003329172000241X","20200706","COVID-19; distress; mental health; resilience; stress; young adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2449,""

"Psychological problems associated with coping strategies: a web-based study in Peruvian population during the COVID-19 pandemic","ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus disease has quickly spread to all corners across Latin-American countries. Its exponential capacity has overwhelmed even the most resilient health systems (1). The already significant impact of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) on the global scale is worsened by psychological responses that may aggravate the health crisis. OBJECTIVE: This study is aimed at collecting demographic information, prevalence of psychological morbidities and associated coping styles during the COVID-19 pandemic on Peruvian population. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted through online survey using snowball sampling techniques after the state of emergency was declared in PerÃº. The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ -28) identify somatic symptom, anxiety/ insomnia, social misfunctioning and depression prevalence and the Coping Strategy Questionnaire (COPE-28) maps strategies addressing recent stress. RESULTS: We collected data from 434 self-selected participants within 18-68 years old (ME =33.87), by analysing the socio-economic information in which the majority of the respondents were women (61.3%), aged between 18 and 28 (41.7%), from well-educated groups (>=85.0 %), Peruvian (94.2%), working citizen (57.4%) and single (71.20 %). Nearly 40.8% rated psychological problems, expressing fear of being infected by coronavirus (71.43%). Regression analysis shows that female gender is associated to higher somatic (p<0.001*, C.I: -2.75 to -.99) and anxiety/insomnia symptoms (p=0.00*, C.I: -2.98 to 0.84). Depression and social dysfunction are experienced at any age. Educational status is protective against developing psychological disorders (p<0.05). While active responses (Acceptance and Social support) are scarcely used by individuals with psychological problems; Passive strategies are commonly reported (Denial, Self-Distraction, Self-Blame, Disconnection, and Emotional discharge). CONCLUSION: These findings provide a better understanding of psychological disorders resulting from the current pandemic in Peruvian population. This evidence informs the need to strengthen mental health programs, especially in less privileged groups after the Covid-19 pandemic.","Rita Judith Ames-Guerrero et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AF-D39-1F2","20200615","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; psychological morbidities; public health; mental health; coping strategies; primary prevention","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2453,""
"Resilience During Uncertainty Greater Social Connectedness During COVID-19 Lockdown is Associated with Reduced Distress and Fatigue","Background: Social connections are crucial for our health and well-being. This is especially true during times of high uncertainty and distress, such as during the COVID-19 lockdown. This period was characterized by unprecedented social distancing measures resulting in significant changes to peopleâ€™s usual social lives. Given the potential effects of this disruption on peopleâ€™s wellbeing, it is crucial to identify factors which are associated with negative health outcomes, and conversely, those that promote resilience during times of adversity. Aims: We examined the relationship between individualsâ€™ levels of social connectedness during lockdown and self-reported stress, worry, and fatigue. Method: Survey data was collected from 981 individuals in a representative sample of Austrian citizens. Data collection occurred during the last week of a six-week nationwide lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The final sample consisted of 902 participants. Participants were asked to complete validated questionnaires to assess levels of social connectedness as well as measures of perceived stress, worryâ€”both general and COVID-19 specificâ€”and symptoms of fatigue during the previous two weeks. Results: Our results demonstrate that greater social connectedness during the lockdown period was associated with lower levels of perceived stress, as well as general and COVID-19 specific worries. Furthermore, we found a negative relationship between fatigue and social connectedness, which was mediated by feelings of stress, general worries, and COVID-19 specific worriesâ€”respectively, indicating that individuals with smaller network sizes, who were highly distressed during the pandemic, were also likely to report feeling more fatigued. Conclusion: Our findings highlight the important role that social connections play in promoting resilience by buffering against negative physical and mental health outcomes, particularly in times of adversity.","Jonas P.

"Heart Rate Variability Moderates the Link Between COVID-19 Stress and Emotional Problems in Adolescents: Evidence for Differential Susceptibility","The COVID-19 pandemic is a unique period of stress and uncertainty that will have significant implications for adolescent mental health. Nevertheless, stress about COVID-19 may be more consequential for some adolescentsâ€™ mental health than for others. We examined whether heart rate variability (HRV) indicated differential susceptibility to mental health difficulties associated with COVID-19 stress. Approximately four years prior to the pandemic, we assessed resting HRV and HRV reactivity to a well-validated stress paradigm in 87 adolescents. During the pandemic, these adolescents (ages 13-19) reported on their health-related stress and concerns about COVID-19 and their recent emotional problems. The association between COVID-19 stress and emotional problems was significantly stronger for adolescents who previously exhibited higher resting HRV or higher HRV reactivity. For adolescents who exhibited lower resting HRV or lower HRV reactivity, COVID-19 stress was not associated with emotional problems. Thus, parasympathetic functioning may reflect differential susceptibility to the effects of COVID-19 stress on mental health during the pandemic.","Jonas G.

"The Contagion Fear and Threat Scale: Measuring COVID-19 Fear in Australian, Indian, and Nepali University Students","The present study describes the adaption and scale validation of a brief measure of contagion-related fear and threat in Australian, Indian, and Nepali university students in Australia at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Adapted from Ho, Kwong-Lo, Mak, and Wongâ€™s (2005) SARS fear scale, the Contagion Fear and Threat Scale (CFTS) was developed rapidly to capture COVID-19 pandemic-related fear. The 10-item scale was administered to 164 Australian, 111 Indian, and 147 Nepali university students studying in Australia in May-June 2020. Factor analysis revealed two 5-item factors in the Australian student sample: Fear of Infection and Existential Threat. These factors were largely reflected in the Indian student sample but substantially different in the Nepali student sample. The convergent and discriminant validity of the full CFTS, Fear, and Threat scales are indicated via correlations with established measures of depression, anxiety, stress, subjective wellbeing, and locus of control. Psychometric variance of the CFTS between the three samples are considered in terms of demographic, sociocultural, and linguistic differences.","Francesca Eileen Collins","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46121-590-B7C","20200706","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Individual Differences; australian; university students; mental health; covid-19; contagion-related fear; scale validation; covid-19-related fear; nepali; fear; indian","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2456,""
"Social isolation, mental health and use of digital interventions in youth during the COVID-19 pandemic: a nationally representative survey","Background: Public health measures to curb SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates may have negative psychosocial consequences in youth. Digital interventions may help to mitigate these effects. We aimed to investigate the associations between social isolation, COVID-19-related worries/anxieties, objective social risk indicators, psychological distress and use of digital mobile health (mHealth) interventions in youth during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Data were collected as part of the â€œHealth And Innovation During COVID-19 Surveyâ€ â€”a cross-sectional panel study including a representative sample of individuals aged 16 to 25 years (N=666; Mage 21Â·3) (assessment period: 07.05.-16.05.2020). Data were collected on social isolation, COVID-19-related worries/anxieties, objective social risk indicators, psychological distress as well as the current use of and attitude towards digital interventions. Outcomes: Social isolation, lack of company, worrying, and objective social risk indicators were associated with psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Dose-response relationships were found. For instance, psychological distress was progressively more likely to occur as levels of reported social isolation increased (with reporting â€˜neverâ€™ as reference group: â€˜very rarelyâ€™: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2Â·4,CI 1Â·0 â€“ 5Â·7, p=0Â·041; â€˜rarelyâ€™: aOR 3Â·6, CI 1Â·7 â€“ 7Â·7, p=0Â·001; â€˜occasionallyâ€™: aOR 8Â·4, CI 4Â·0 â€“ 17Â·5, p<0Â·001; â€˜oftenâ€™: aOR 20Â·6, CI 9Â·3 â€“ 45Â·7, p<0Â·001;â€™very oftenâ€™: aOR 43Â·4, CI 14Â·7 â€“ 128Â·2, p<0Â·001). There was evidence that psychological distress, and high levels of social isolation, lack of company, and worrying were associated with a positive attitude towards using digital interventions, whereas only severe levels of psychological distress and worries were associated with actual use (aOR 2Â·0, CI 1Â·3 - 3Â·0, p=0Â·001; aOR 1Â·6, CI 1Â·1 â€“ 2Â·2, p=0Â·005, respectively). Interpretation: Public health measures during pandemics may be associated with social isolation and poor mental health outcomes in youth. Digital interventions may help mitigate the negative psychosocial impact without risk for viral infection given there is an objective need and subjective demand.","Christian Rauschenberg et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461D5-4B2-395","20200629","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; social isolation; public mental health; youth mental health; mhealth; social risk; worrying; covid-19","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2457,""
"Digital interventions to mitigate the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on public mental health: a rapid meta-review","Background: Digital interventions may be used to mitigate psychosocial consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic but evidence-based recommendations are lacking. The aim of this rapid meta-review was to investigate the theoretical base, user perspective, safety, effectiveness, and cost effectiveness of digital interventions in public mental health provision (i.e. mental health promotion, prevention of, and treatment for mental disorder). Methods: A rapid meta-review was conducted. MEDLINE, PsychINFO, and CENTRAL databases were searched on May 11, 2020. Study inclusion criteria were broad and considered systematic reviews that investigated digital tools for health promotion, prevention, or treatment of mental health conditions likely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings: We identified 813 reviews of which 82 met inclusion criteria. Overall, there is good evidence on the usability, safety, acceptance/satisfaction, and effectiveness of eHealth interventions while evidence on mHealth apps is promising, especially if social components (e.g. blended care) and strategies to promote adherence are incorporated. Although most digital interventions focus on the prevention or treatment of mental disorders, there is some evidence on mental health promotion. However, evidence on long-term clinical effects, process quality, and cost-effectiveness is very limited. Interpretation: Accumulating evidence suggests negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on public mental health. There is evidence that digital interventions are particularly suited to mitigating psychosocial consequences at the population level. Decision-makers should develop digital strategies for continued mental health care and the development and implementation of mental health promotion and prevention programs in times of quarantine and social distancing.","Christian Rauschenberg et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AD-08E-865","20200629","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Treatment; intervention; ehealth; digital psychiatry; telemedicine; mhealth; covid-19; prevention; mental health promotion","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2458,""

Here, we leverage national panel data before and during New Zealandâ€™s COVID-19 lockdown to clarify distress buffers (2018/2020, N = 940). To distinguish lockdown-related distress from natural disasters, we investigate distress dynamics following the Christchurch earthquakes (2011, N = 6,806). During lockdown, there were small increases in hopelessness, restlessness, and nervousness, and substantial increases in worthlessness. A sense of neighbourhood community became decoupled from this distress, which high levels of social belonging and health satisfaction did not prevent. A silver lining was a relief from feelings of effort fostered by social belonging. By contrast, the Christchurch earthquakes increased all distress indicators and distress buffers performed consistently. We infer that losses of employment and social routines during New Zealandâ€™s lockdown, in a setting of government income and health protections, precipitated bittersweet mental health dynamics. That certain pandemic mental health burdens are avoidable has applied interest.","Joseph Bulbulia et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46002-880-A11","20200626","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; covid-19; wellbeing; social capital; ordinal; worthlessness; employment; lockdown; bayesian; anxiety; routine; kessler-6; buffer","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2460,""

Across two studies, we observed that stronger self-other connectedness and frequent social communication with others during the first few weeks into the quarantine period led to worsened well-being and decreased general confidence. In study 1 (n = 331), we showed that people who reported higher social connectedness and more frequent social interaction experienced declined well-being. In study 2 (n = 327), we replicated the backfiring effect and showed that those who engaged in frequent social interaction, especially in COVID-19 related conversations, reported decreased general confidence, which mediated the accelerating effect of social interaction on panic buying.

Some people have responded to the rising of the pandemic by engaging in panic buying behaviors, a phenomenon that has not been well-understood in the past. People who believe in these conspiracies may experience a heightened sense of powerlessness and vulnerability. As a result, they may be particularly susceptible to palliatively and compensatorily engage in the panic buying behaviors (i.e., stockpiling).

"Early Life Stress Predicts Depressive Symptoms in Adolescents During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Mediating Role of Perceived Stress","Background: Exposure to early life stress (ELS) is alarmingly prevalent, and has been linked to the high rates of depression documented in adolescence. Researchers have theorized that ELS may increase adolescentsâ€™ vulnerability or reactivity to the effects of subsequent stressors, placing them at higher risk for developing symptoms of depression. Methods: We tested this formulation in a longitudinal study by assessing levels of stress and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic in a sample of adolescents from the San Francisco Bay Area (N=100; 43 male; ages 13-20 years) who had been characterized 4-7 years earlier (M=5.27, SD=0.75 years) with respect to exposure to ELS and symptoms of depression. Results: As expected, severity of ELS predicted levels of depressive symptoms during the pandemic (r(98)=0.25, p=.012), which were higher in females than in males (t(98)=-3.36, p=.001). Importantly, the association between ELS and depression was mediated by adolescentsâ€™ reported levels of stress, even after controlling for demographic and other COVID-19-related variables. Conclusions: These findings underscore the importance of monitoring the mental health of vulnerable children and adolescents during this pandemic and targeting perceived stress and isolation in high-risk youth.","Ian Gotlib et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4608F-A98-64F","20200619","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; covid-19; perceived stress; depression; early life stress; adolescence","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2463,""
"National Longitudinal Investigation of COVID-19 Lockdown Distress Reveals Critical Roles of Health Satisfaction and Social Belonging","New Zealandâ€™s COVID-19 lockdown in March/April 2020 imposed stringent economic and social restrictions which occurred in a setting of pervasive health and economic uncertainties. Here, we identify mechanisms of psychological distress trajectory within the same individuals from a nationally diverse sample (2018/2020, N = 940). To distinguish pandemic-lockdown distress from natural-disaster distress, we additionally investigate mental health following the Christchurch earthquakes (2011, N = 6,806). During lockdown, there was a three-fold increase in feelings of worthlessness. Neither a sense of neighbourhood community, nor business-satisfaction, nor satisfaction with the government prevented this distress. Social-belonging and health-satisfaction were psychological distress buffers. A silver lining was relief from feelings of effort which social-belonging fostered. By contrast, the Christchurch earthquakes increased all distress indicators and distress buffers performed consistently. We observe that losses of employment and social routines during New Zealandâ€™s lockdown, in a setting of effective income and health protections, precipitated bittersweet mental health dynamics. That distress containment was evident even among those low in government confidence, low in a sense of neighbourhood community, and low in business satisfaction implies that shifting political, social and economic perceptions is not essential for pandemic distress management. Psychological distress mitigation during a pandemic lockdown arises when a populationâ€™s health and income are palpably secured, and where people actually experience high levels of interpersonal connection and belonging with people they already know.","Joseph Bulbulia et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46163-B20-33A","20200623","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods|Statistical Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Individual Differences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2464,""
"A Person-Centered Approach to Profiling COVID-Related Experiences in the United States: Preliminary Findings from the Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory (EPII)","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on individuals, families, and communities around the world. Intensive health precautions have created constraints on mobility, work, education, family life, and interpersonal relationships. Preliminary survey studies have reported an increase in the prevalence and severity of psychosocial impairments in the pandemicâ€™s immediate wake. However, the impact of specific pandemic-related experiences and patterns of experiences has not been systematically assessed and studied. The goal of the present study was to develop and conduct a preliminary empirical test of a novel, comprehensive assessment of pandemic-related experiences, the Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory (EPII), using person-centered latent class analysis (LCA). Aims were to (1) test the hypothesis that LCA would identify unique subgroups based on patterns of negative and positive pandemic-related experiences across personal and social domains, and (2) examine whether identified subgroups would significantly differ on sociodemographic characteristics and indicators of mental health and functioning. Results supported hypotheses, with several unique subgroups identified across domains that were differentiated on sociodemographic characteristics and measures of perceived stress, depression, anxiety, PTSD, and perceived social support. Findings support the EPII as an instrument for measuring tangible and meaningful experiences in the context of an unprecedented pandemic disaster. This study, combined with future research with the EPII, may serve to inform public health strategies for supporting families and communities in the current pandemic and under similar mass public health crisis circumstances in the future.","Damion Grasso et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460A1-77D-707","20200701","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Assessment; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Mental Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; mental health; epidemic; pandemic; covid-19","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2465,""
"Change in Mental Health Symptoms During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Role of Appraisals and Daily Life Experiences","Intro: When confronted with major threats such as the COVID-19 pandemic, people often experience (temporary) decline in well-being. The central purpose of this study was to identify mechanisms underlying stability and change of well-being in times of threat like the COVID-19 pandemic. We examined change in mental health symptoms and its relationships with appraisals of the pandemic and daily life experiences during the pandemic, including affective states, stress, and mindfulness. Methods: We conducted a study across 3.5 weeks, including pretest, posttest, and a diary phase in-between. In this report, we worked with a sample of 460 adults, pre- and post-test information, as well as a total of 7189 observations from the diary phase. Results: Results showed that less fortunate change in mental health symptoms across three weeks was predicted by more negative affect and less mindfulness, specifically less attention to the present moment, in daily life. Furthermore, less fortunate change in mental health symptoms was correlated with change towards less fortunate appraisals of the appraisals. Finally, we showed that more general views of the pandemic (i.e., appraisals) were interrelated to experiences in daily life, with more negative appraisals of the pandemic predicting more negative affect and stressor occurrence as well as less mindfulness. Discussion: These findings speak to the dynamic nature of well-being and appraisals in times of threat, and they show how experiences in daily life matter for change in well-being","Annette Brose et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46234-9E1-68B","20200630","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Emotional Development; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; stress; covid-19; well-being; mental health; ambulatory assessment; mindfulness; affect","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2466,""
"Media Consumption and Mental Health during COVID-19 lockdown: A UK Cross-sectional study across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern","As individuals adjust to new â€˜normsâ€™ and ways of living during the COVID-19 lockdown, there is a continuing need for up-to-date information and guidance. This has elevated the importance of media channels, such as social media and traditional media. Evidence suggests that frequent media exposure is related to a higher prevalence of mental health problems, especially anxiety and depression. The aim of this study is to determine whether COVID-19 related media consumption is associated with changes in mental health outcomes. This paper presents baseline data from the COVID-19 Psychological Wellbeing Study. The results showed a statistically significant correlation between COVID-19 media exposure and increases in anxiety (GAD-7) and depression (PHQ-9). The study suggested that media usage is statistically significantly associated with anxiety and depression on the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scales with excessive media exposure related to higher anxiety and depression scores.","Ruth Neill et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460F8-B20-1EF","20200701","PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; covid-19; depression; mental health; media consumption; anxiety","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2467,""
"Twitter and Census Data Analytics to Explore Socioeconomic Factors for Post-COVID-19 Reopening Sentiment","Investigating and classifying sentiments of social media users (e.g., positive, negative) towards an item, situation, and system are very popular among the researchers. However, they rarely discuss the underlying socioeconomic factor associations for such sentiments. This study attempts to explore the factors associated with positive and negative sentiments of the people about reopening the economy, in the United States (US) amidst the COVID-19 global crisis. It takes into consideration the situational uncertainties (i.e., changes in work and travel pattern due to lockdown policies), economic downturn and associated trauma, and emotional factors such as depression. To understand the sentiment of the people about the reopening economy, Twitter data was collected, representing the 51 states including Washington DC of the US. State-wide socioeconomic characteristics of the people (e.g., education, income, family size, and employment status), built environment data (e.g., population density), and the number of COVID-19 related cases were collected and integrated with Twitter data to perform the analysis. A binary logit model was used to identify the factors that influence people toward a positive or negative sentiment. The results from the logit model demonstrate that family households, people with low education levels, people in the labor force, low-income people, and people with higher house rent are more interested in reopening the economy. In contrast, households with a high number of members and high income are less interested to reopen the economy. The accuracy of the model is good (i.e., the model can correctly classify 56.18\% of the sentiments). The Pearson chi2 test indicates that overall this model has high goodness-of-fit. This study provides a clear indication to the policymakers where to allocate resources and what policy options they can undertake to improve the socioeconomic situations of the people and mitigate the impacts of pandemics in the current situation and as well as in the future.","Mokhlesur Rahman et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4616E-F5C-0B1","20200630","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods|Statistical Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2468,""
"Exposure to COVID-19 Pandemic Stress: Associations with Depression and Anxiety in Emerging Adults in the US","Background: Stressful events associated with the COVID-19 pandemic are likely to have significant effects on psychiatric symptoms, and well-validated methods for assessing psychosocial experiences related to the pandemic are needed. We developed the Pandemic Stress Questionnaire (PSQ) and tested its psychometric properties, characterized experiences in emerging adults, and examined associations with internalizing symptoms. Methods: Emerging adults (N=450) completed the PSQ and measures of internalizing symptoms and perceived stress through an online platform in May 2020. One month later, 288 participants completed a follow-up questionnaire to assess the stability of the PSQ and prospective associations between stress and internalizing symptoms. Results: Results supported the validity and stability of the PSQ and indicated that experiences of stress are highly prevalent, particularly among younger, female, and Black emerging adults. Pandemic-related stress was moderately associated with depression and anxiety at each assessment, but did not predict change in symptoms when controlling for baseline symptoms. Conclusions: The PSQ is a promising measure for assessing COVID-19 pandemic-related events in research and clinical practice. Results provide empirical support for the range of life disruptions as a result of the pandemic and highlight individual differences and experiences associated with the greatest risk for depression and anxiety.","Autumn Kujawa et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4614D-D78-F8E","20200629","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; coronavirus; young adult; pandemics; depression; anxiety","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2469,""
"Stress and Parenting during the Global COVID-19 Pandemic","Background: Stress and compromised parenting often place children at risk of abuse and neglect. Child maltreatment has generally been viewed as a highly individualistic problem by focusing on stressors and parenting behaviors that impact individual families. However, because of the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), families across the world are experiencing a new range of stressors that threaten their health, safety, and economic well-being. Objective: This study examined the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in relation to parental perceived stress and child abuse potential. Participants and Setting: Participants included parents (N = 183) with a child under the age of 18 years in the western United States. Method: Tests of group differences and hierarchical multiple regression analyses were employed to assess the relationships among demographic characteristics, COVID-19 related disruptions, mental health risk, protective factors, perceived stress, and child abuse potential. Results: Greater COVID-19 related disruptions and high anxiety and depressive symptoms are associated with higher perceived stress and child abuse potential. In addition, higher perceived stress is associated with higher child abuse potential. Conversely, greater parental support and perceived control during the pandemic may have a protective effect against perceived stress and child abuse potential. Results also indicate racial and ethnic differences in COVID-19 related disruptions, but not in mental health risk, protective factors, perceived stress, or child abuse potential. Conclusion: Findings suggest that although families experience elevated stressors from COVID-19, providing parental support and increasing perceived control may be promising intervention targets.","Samantha M.

"Generalized anxiety and depressive symptoms in various age groups during the COVID-19 lockdown Specific predictors and differences in symptoms severity","Background. Previous studies carried out in different countries indicated that young adults experience higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms than older age groups during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, little is known about which epidemic-related difficulties and factors may contribute to these forms of emotional distress in various age groups. Purpose. The aim of the current study was to investigate: (i) differences in levels of depressive and generalized anxiety symptoms, as well as perceived difficulties related to pandemic across four age groups in the Polish population; (ii) which factors and difficulties related to pandemic are predictors of generalized anxiety and depressive symptoms in various age groups during the COVID-19 lockdown. Method. A total of 1115 participants (aged 18-85) took part in the study. The group was a representative sample of the Polish population in terms of sex, age, and place of residence. Participants completed online: The Patient Health Questionnaire-9, The Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Scale of Perceived Health and Life Risk of COVID-19, Social Support Sale, Scale of Epidemic-Related Difficulties. Results. Younger age groups (18-29 and 30-44) experienced higher levels of depressive and generalized anxiety symptoms than older adults (45-59 and 60-85 years). Difficulties in relationships and at home were amongst the strongest predictors of depressive and generalized anxiety symptoms in all age groups. Fear and uncertainty related to the spread of the virus were one of the most important predictors of emotional distress in all the groups apart from the adults between 18-29 years, whereas difficulties related to external restrictions were one of the most significant predictors of depressive and anxiety symptoms only in the youngest group. Conclusions. Our results indicate that the youngest adults and those experiencing difficulties in relationships among household members were the most vulnerable to depressive and generalized anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 lockdown. Thus, it is important to plan preventive and therapeutic interventions to support these at-risk individuals in dealing with the challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Malgorzata Gambin et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460AE-A00-BD9","20200629","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Early Adulthood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Middle Adulthood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Old Age; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; covid-19 outbreak; lockdown; depressive symptoms; anxiety symptoms; epidemic-related difficulties","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2471,""

"Report1: Impact of Covid-19 on young people aged 13-24 in the UK- preliminary findings","COVID-19 has led to an unprecedented disruption of normal social relationships and activities, which are so important during the teen years and young adulthood, and to education and economic activity worldwide. The impact of this on young peopleâ€™s mental health and future prospects may affect their need for support and services, and the speed of the nationâ€™s social recovery afterwards. This study focused on the unique challenges facing young people at different points during adolescent development, which spans from the onset of puberty until the mid-twenties. Although this is an immensely challenging time and there is a potential risk for long term trauma, adolescence can be a period of opportunity, where the teenagersâ€™ brain enjoys greater capacity for change. Hence, the focus on young people is key for designing age-specific interventions and public policies, which can offer new strategies for instilling resilience, emotional regulation, and self-control. In fact, adolescents might be assisted to not only cope, but excel, in spite of the challenges imposed by this pandemic. Our work will feed into the larger societal response that utilizes the discoveries about adolescence in the way we raise, teach, and treat young people during this time of crisis. Wave 1 data has already been collected from 2,002 young people aged 13-24, measuring their mental health (anxiety, depression, trauma), family functioning, social networks, and resilience, and social risk-taking at the time of the pandemic.

"Alarming levels of psychiatric symptoms and the role of loneliness during the COVID-19 epidemic: A case study of Hong Kong","Public health strategies to curb the spread of the coronavirus involve sheltering at home and social distancing have been effective in reducing the transmission rate, but the unintended consequences of prolonged social isolation on mental health has not been investigated. We conducted an online survey of residents in Hong Kong. We focused on Hong Kong for its very rapid and comprehensive response to the pandemic and strictly enacted social distancing protocols. Thus, Hong Kong is a model case for the population-wide practice of effective social distancing and provides an opportunity to examine the impact of loneliness on mental health during the COVID-19. The result of this online survey indicates a dire situation with respect to mental health. An astonishing 65.6% of the respondents reported clinical levels of depression, anxiety, and/or stress. Moreover, 22.5% of the respondents were showing signs of psychosis-risk. Loneliness, but not social network size, explained 12.0% to 29.2% of variance in these psychiatric symptoms. To mitigate the potential epidemic of mental illness in the near future, there is an urgent need to prepare clinicians, caregivers and stakeholders to focus on loneliness. Although the sociopolitical situation of Hong Kong prior to the pandemic was likely another exacerbating factor, given that sociopolitical unrest and violence are common, global problems that co-exist with the pandemic, the case of Hong Kong may prove to be prescient.","Ivy Tso et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D2-FC4-0B5","20200627","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Mental Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Psychotic Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Substance Abuse and Addiction; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; psychosis risk; psychiatry; stress; covid-19; loneliness; social isolation; mental health; anxiety; psychosis; depression","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2474,""

"Loneliness in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic: Cross-sectional results from The COVID-19 Psychological Wellbeing Study","Objectives: Loneliness is a significant public health issue. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in lockdown measures limiting social contact. The UK public are worried about the impact of these measures on mental health outcomes. Understanding the prevalence and predictors of loneliness at this time is a priority issue for research. Design: The study employed a cross-sectional online survey design. Method: Baseline data collected between March 23rd and April 24th 2020 from UK adults in the COVID-19 Psychological Wellbeing Study were analysed (N = 1963, 18-87 years, M = 37.11, SD = 12.86, 70% female). Logistic regression analysis was used to look at the influence of sociodemographic, social, health and COVID-19 specific factors on loneliness. Results: The prevalence of loneliness was 27% (530/1963). Risk factors for loneliness were younger age group (OR: 4.67 â€“ 5.31), being separated or divorced (OR: 2.29), meeting clinical criteria for major depression (OR: 1.74), greater emotion regulation difficulties (OR: 1.04), and poor quality sleep due to the COVID-19 crisis (OR: 1.30). Higher levels of social support (OR: 0.92), being married/co-habiting (OR: 0.35) and living with a great number of adults (OR: 0.87) were protective factors. Conclusions: Rates of loneliness during the initial phase of lockdown were high. Risk factors were not specific to the COVID-19 crisis.

"Depression, Environmental Reward, Coping Motives and Alcohol Consumption During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Increases in the incidence of psychological distress and alcohol use during the COVID-19 pandemic have been predicted. Environmental reward and self-medication theories suggest that increased distress and greater social/environmental constraints during COVID-19 could result in increases in depression and drinking to cope with negative affect. The current study had two goals: (1) to clarify the presence and direction of changes in alcohol use and related outcomes after the introduction of COVID-19 social distancing requirements, and; (2) to test hypothesized mediation models to explain individual differences in alcohol use during the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants (n = 1127) were U.S. residents recruited for participation in an online survey. The survey included questions assessing environmental reward, depression, COVID-19-related distress, drinking motives, and alcohol use outcomes (alcohol use; drinking motives; alcohol demand, and solitary drinking). Outcomes were assessed for two timeframes: the 30 days prior to state-mandated social distancing (â€˜pre-social-distancingâ€™), and the 30 days after the start of state-mandated social distancing (â€˜post-social-distancingâ€™). Depression severity, coping motives, and frequency of solitary drinking were significantly greater post-social-distancing relative to pre-social-distancing. Conversely, environmental reward and other drinking motives (social, enhancement, and conformity) were significantly lower post-social distancing compared to pre-social-distancing. Time spent drinking and frequency of binge drinking were greater post-social-distancing compared to pre-social-distancing, whereas typical alcohol quantity/frequency were not significantly different between timeframes. Indices of alcohol demand were variable with regard to change. Mediation analyses suggested a significant indirect effects of reduced environmental reward with drinking quantity/frequency via increased depressive symptoms and coping motives, and a significant indirect effect of COVID-related distress with alcohol quantity/frequency via coping motives for drinking. Results provide early evidence regarding the relation of psychological distress with alcohol consumption and coping motives during the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, results largely converged with predictions from self-medication and environmental reinforcement theories. Future research will be needed to study prospective associations among these outcomes.","Matthew Mcphee et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46035-C14-752","20200623","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Substance Abuse and Addiction; sars-cov-2; depression; covid-19; social distancing; alcohol; stress; mental health","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2478,""

When Personality Profiles Influence Psychological Adjustment and Creativity during the COVID-19 Outbreak","With the COVID-19 outbreak, the population was suddenly forced to â€œstay at homeâ€. Although research suggests that social isolation affects mental health, reactions may vary depending on individuals. This study aimed to identify personality profiles, and examine whether these profiles were associated with affective and cognitive outcomes. Participants filled in an online questionnaire during the lockdown in France (N = 430). Based on measures of individualsâ€™ preference for solitude, extraversion, emotional stability and openness, a latent profile analysis revealed three profiles: â€œAffiliationâ€, â€œEmotionally Stable Lonelyâ€ and â€œEmotionally Unstable Lonelyâ€. Results showed that individuals with an â€œEmotionally Unstable Lonelyâ€ profile expressed higher stress and anxiety, and performed better on a divergent creative thinking task. By contrast, those with an â€œEmotionally Stable Lonelyâ€ profile expressed a lower level of loneliness, and performed better on a convergent creative thinking task.

"Mental health outcomes of adults with comorbidity and chronic diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic: a matched case-control study","Background: Individuals with certain pre-existing chronic health conditions have been identified as a high-risk group for fatalities of COVID-19. Therefore, it is likely that individuals with chronic diseases may worry during this pandemic to the detriment of their mental health. This study compares the mental health of Bangladeshi adults affected by chronic disease to a healthy, matched control group during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: A matched caseâ€“control analysis was performed with data collected from 395 respondents with chronic diseases and 395 controls matched for age, gender and residence. Inclusion criteria for cases were respondents who self-reported having asthma, cardiovascular symptoms and/or diabetes. Respondents were recruited using an online survey, which included the DASS-21 measure to assess stress, anxiety, and depression. Chi-square tests, Fisherâ€™s exact tests and a conditional logistic regression were performed to examine associations among variables. Results: The prevalence estimates of stress, anxiety and depression were significantly higher among cases (73.7%; 59%; 71.6%, respectively) than among controls (43.3%; 25.6%; 31.1%). Chi-square tests showed significant associations between having chronic diseases and mental health outcomes. A conditional logistic regression showed that respondents with asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular symptoms, or any combination of these diseases had higher odds of feeling stress, anxiety, and depression than healthy individuals.

"Economic Evaluations of Mental Health Programs for Children and Adolescents in the United States: A Systematic Review","The United States spent 201 billion dollars on mental health related concerns in 2013, ranking mental illness as the leading cause of disability and the single largest source of economic burden worldwide. With mental health-related treatment costs and economic burden only projected to rise, there is an increasing need for cost-inclusive evaluations of mental health interventions specific to the United States as economic evaluations across countries are not easily comparable. Thus, this systematic, descriptive review characterized the types of interventions, target populations, and the quality of 9 economic evaluation studies (e.g., cost-effectiveness, cost-benefit) of youth mental health services conducted in the United States from 2003 to 2019. Existing evaluations suggest that certain mental health interventions for youth, among the few that have been formally evaluated, may be cost-effective and cost-beneficial. However, the small number and mixed quality of eligible studies highlights a dearth of rigorously conductedeconomic evaluations on this topic, variability in cost and outcome assessment approaches, as well as the homogenous characteristics of interventions evaluated. Greater standardization is needed to increase confidence in these conclusions and generate a body of meaningful, quality research that has the potential to shape evidence-based mental health policy.","Jenna Sung et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460B2-12B-801","20200618","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Clinical Child Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Intervention Research; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Psychotherapy","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2481,""

Methods: The current study used data from the first two waves of the United Kingdom (UK) survey of the COVID-19 Psychological Research Consortium (C19PRC) Study to compare frontline workers with the rest of the UK population on prevalence estimates of depression, anxiety, and PTSD during the first week of â€˜lockdownâ€™ (Wave 1) and one month later (Wave 2). Results: Compared to the rest of the population, frontline workers generally, and individual frontline worker groups, had significantly higher prevalence estimates of depression, anxiety, and PTSD during both wave 1 and wave 2. While prevalence estimates of depression significantly increased among Local & National Government Workers from Wave 1 (15.4%) to Wave 2 (38.5%), no significant improvement or deterioration in mental health status was recorded for any other frontline worker group. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis showed that, beyond other risk factors, food workers were nearly twice as likely as others to screen positive for anxiety, while all frontline worker groups, other than transport workers, were significantly more likely to screen positive for PTSD (Odds Ratios ranged from 1.74 â€“ 3.43). Finally, while frontline workers, generally, were significantly more likely than the general public to have received mental health advice during the pandemic (26.9% versus 20.3% respectively), this was largely reflective of health and social care workers (37.9%).

A decrease in satisfaction with their lives and an increase in the symptoms of stress is also observed. Negative emotions of anxiety, sadness, exhaustion and loneliness are also dominant among youth. The psychological resources were exploited to a relatively small extent. The adaptive reactions remain on a similar level. Among the respondents active combating of the threats and redirecting their attention as well as comforting oneself that it could have been worse are dominant. The respondents reveal the symptoms of burnout with remote education. Mental tiredness, decreased efficiency of actions and a decrease in motivation for learning are observed as well.","Piotr Dlugosz","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46066-E0E-2A3","20200617","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; fear; youth; covid-19; poland; stress","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2483,""
"Well-Being and COVID-19 Anxiety: A Three-Wave Longitudinal Study in China","Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic threatens human beingsâ€™ livelihoods and mental health, which lowers their well-being and gives rise to anxiety. This study examines whether there is a causal relationship between peopleâ€™s well-being and COVID-19 anxiety. Method: 222 participants (54.50% female, Mage = 31.53, SD = 8.17) from 26 provinces of China completed measures of well-being and COVID-19 anxiety at three key nodes of the development of COVID-19 in China. Results: The results showed that peopleâ€™s well-being and COVID-19 anxiety fluctuated with the peak, decline and trough stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, the cross-lagged analysis showed that the participantsâ€™ well-being at Time 1 significantly predicted their COVID-19 anxiety at Time 2. However, well-being at Time 2 was not associated with the COVID-19 anxiety at Time 3. Furthermore, COVID-19 anxiety could not predict subsequent well-being. Conclusions: Peopleâ€™s well-being and COVID-19 anxiety fluctuated with the development of the COVID-19 pandemic and peopleâ€™s well-being at the peak stage of the COVID-19 pandemic predicted their subsequent anxiety. The current findings contribute to clarifying the causal relationship between well-being and anxiety, as well as finding ways to alleviate peopleâ€™s COVID-19 anxiety.","Zhuojun Wang et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4612E-F41-854","20200615","PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; china; longitudinal design; well-being; cross-lagged analysis; covid-19 anxiety","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2484,""
"Drinking to cope during the COVID-19 pandemic: The role of external and internal stress-related factors in coping motive pathways to alcohol use, solitary drinking, and alcohol problems","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in massive disruptions to society, to the economy, and to daily life. Some people may turn to alcohol to cope with stress during the pandemic, which may put them at risk for heavy drinking and alcohol-related harms. Research is needed to identify the factors that are relevant for coping-motivated drinking during these extraordinary circumstances to inform interventions. This study provides an empirical examination of coping motive pathways to alcohol problems during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants (N = 320; 54.6% male; mean age 32 years old) were Canadian adult drinkers who completed an online survey assessing work- and home-related factors, psychological factors, and alcohol-related outcomes over the past 30 days, covering a time period soon after the initiation of the COVID-19 emergency response. The results of a theory-informed path model showed that living with children under 18, greater depression, and lower social connectedness each predicted unique variance in past 30-day coping motives, which in turn predicted increased past 30-day alcohol use (controlling for pre-COVID-19 alcohol use reported retrospectively). Income loss was associated with increased alcohol use and living alone was associated with increased solitary drinking (controlling for pre-COVID-19 levels), but these associations were not mediated by coping motives. Increased alcohol use, increased solitary drinking, and coping motives for drinking were all independently associated with past 30-day alcohol problems, and indirect paths to alcohol problems from living with children, depression, social connectedness, income loss, and living alone were all supported. Findings provide insight into coping-motivated drinking early in the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight the need for longitudinal research to establish longer-term outcomes of drinking to cope.","Jeffrey Wardell et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46220-A31-593","20200615","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Substance Abuse and Addiction; drinking motives; social distancing; coronavirus; parent; covid-19; drinking alone; stress; income; alcohol problems; alcohol; solitary drinking; coping; depression; social isolation","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2485,""
"Therapeutic alliance, social inclusion and infection control - Towards pandemic-adapted mental health care services in Switzerland","The Covid-19 pandemic has challenged the Swiss mental health care system. Many services were downsized or closed and admission to treatment and care institutions was restricted. While these measures were necessary according to the general containment and mitigation strategies of federal and cantonal authorities, this situation has had negative consequences for care and treatment of service users. This paper asks to re-think key aspects of the Swiss mental health care system that have demonstrated to be not adaptable to the pandemic. In particular, the paper suggests diversifying care and treatment settings and strengthening outpatient and outreach services. Finally, some proposals to foster social inclusion during and after the pandemic are outlined.","Dirk Richter et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46021-DE5-951","20200615","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; switzerland; mental health services; pandemic; covid-19","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2486,""
"Longitudinal evaluation of the psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis in Spain","The aim of this study was to assess the temporal evolution of the psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis and lockdown from two surveys carried out in Spain with a time difference of about one month. Symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress, and the psychological impact of the situation were longitudinally analyzed using the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and the Impact of Event Scale (IES) respectively. The Brief Resilient Coping Scale (BRCS) and the Mini-Social Phobia Inventory (Mini-SPIN) were also employed to evaluate resilience and social anxiety. There was a total of 4,724 responses from both surveys. Symptomatic scores of anxiety, depression and stress were exhibited by 37.22%, 46.42% and 49.66% of the second survey respondents, showing a significant increase compared to the first survey (32.45%, 44.11% and 37.01%, respectively). There was no significant longitudinal change of the IES scores, with 48.30% of the second survey participants showing moderate to severe impact of the confinement. Low resilience was shown by 40.5% of the respondents, and high social anxiety by 34.8%. Constant news consumption about COVID-19 was found to be positively associated with symptomatic scores in the different scales. On the other hand, daily physical activity was found to be negatively associated with DASS-21 scores. Results indicate that people with social anxiety might be especially vulnerable to the development of other mental disorders after the relaxation of the confinement measures.","Ãlvaro Planchuelo-GÃ³mez et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4623A-16D-42D","20200610","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; depression; covid-19; longitudinal; anxiety; posttraumatic stress disorder; stress","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2487,""
"Perceived Risk and Mental Health Problems Among Healthcare Professionals During COVID-19 Pandemic: Exploring the Mediating Effects of Resilience and Coronavirus Fear","During coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, healthcare professionals were particularly at high-risk of developing symptoms of mental health problems due to being on the frontline in the battle against COVID-19. This study examined the mediating roles of resilience and coronavirus fear in the relationship between perceived risk and mental health problems among healthcare professionals including doctors and nurses who were actively treating patients confirmed with COVID-19. We recruited 204 healthcare professionals (50% females) with a mean age of 32.92 years (SD=7.01). Results showed that perceived risk and coronavirus fear positively predicted depression, anxiety, and stress while resilience negatively predicted those mental health problems. Coronavirus fear mediated the relationship between perceived risk and resilience, depression, anxiety, and stress. Additionally, resilience mitigated the effect of coronavirus fear on depression, anxiety, and stress. This study is among the first indicating the importance of resilience and fear as critical mechanism that explain the relationship between perceived risk and mental health problems among health professionals directly caring for COVID-19 patients.","Murat Yildirim et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461A3-666-E0B","20200610","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; covid-19 perceived risk; covid-19; resilience; mental health problems; healthcare professionals; covid-19 fear","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2488,""
"Promoting Graduate Student Mental Health during COVID-19: Acceptability and Perceived Utility of an Online Single-Session Intervention","The COVID-19 outbreak has simultaneously increased the need for mental health services and decreased their availability. Brief online self-help interventions that can be completed in a single session could be especially helpful in improving access to care during the crisis. However, little is known about the uptake, acceptability, and perceived utility of these interventions outside of clinical trials in which participants are compensated. Here, we describe the development, deployment, acceptability ratings, and pre-post effects of a single-session intervention, the Common Elements Toolbox (COMET), adapted for the COVID-19 crisis to support graduate and professional students. Participants (n = 263), who were not compensated, were randomly assigned to two of three modules: behavioral activation, cognitive restructuring, and gratitude. Over one week, 263 individuals began and 189 individuals (72%) completed the intervention. Participants reported that the intervention modules were acceptable (93% endorsing), helpful (88%), engaging (86%), applicable to their lives (87%), and could help them manage COVID-related challenges (88%). Participants reported pre- to post-program improvements in secondary control (i.e., the belief that one can control their reactions to objective events; dav=0.36, dz=0.50, p<0.001) and in the perceived negative impact of the COVID-19 crisis on their quality of life (dav=0.22, dz=0.25, p<0.001). On average, differences in their perceived ability to handle lifestyle changes resulting from the pandemic were positive, but small and at the level of a nonsignificant trend (dav=0.13, dz=0.14, p=0.066).

"Longitudinal changes in mental health and the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from the UK Household Longitudinal Study","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has had a range of negative social and economic effects that may contribute to a rise in mental health problems. In this observational population-based study, we examined longitudinal changes in the prevalence of mental health problems from before to during the COVID-19 crisis and identified subgroups that are psychologically vulnerable during the pandemic. Methods Participants were drawn from the United Kingdom Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS or Understanding Society), a nationally representative sample of adults in the United Kingdom. Participants were 12,074 men and women with a mean age of 51.6 (range 18-95) who took part in the representative wave 9 (2017â€“2019) sample of the UKHLS and were followed-up between the 24â€“30th of April 2020. Mental health problems were assessed using the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12). Results The percentage of participants experiencing mental health problems (GHQ-12 score =3) increased from 23.4% in 2017â€“2019 to 37.1% in April, 2020. All population subgroups examined showed statistically significant increases in mental health problems. The increase was 9.8% (95% CI [5.4%â€“14.3%]) greater among those aged 18-34 compared to those aged 50â€“64, 7.4% (95% CI [4.9%â€“9.9%]) greater in females compared to males, and 3.6% (95% CI [1.1%â€“6.1%]) greater amongst those with a degree compared to others. Additional analyses showed that the substantial rise in mental health problems in April, 2020 was unlikely to be due to seasonality or year-to-year variation. Conclusions This study suggests that mental health problems may have risen substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Michael Daly et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4606A-538-ECB","20200610","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; psychological distress; mental health; representative study; coronavirus; covid-19; public health; longitudinal","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2490,""

This paper describes the the first two waves of the UK survey (the â€˜parentâ€™ strand of the Consortium) during March-April 2020. A longitudinal, internet panel survey assessed: (1) COVID-19 related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours; (2) the occurrence of common mental health disorders (e.g. anxiety, depression); as well as the role of (3) psychological factors (e.g. personality, locus of control, resilience) and (4) social and political attitudes (e.g. authoritarianism, social dominance), in influencing the publicâ€™s response to the pandemic. Quota sampling was used to recruit a nationally representative (in terms of age, sex, and household income) sample of adults (N=2025), 1406 of whom were followed-up one month later (69.4% retention rate). The baseline sample was representative of the UK population in terms of economic activity, ethnicity, and household composition. Attrition was predicted by key socio-demographic characteristics, and an inverse probability weighting procedure was employed to ensure the follow-up sample was representative of the baseline sample.

The current study utilizes longitudinal data to assess such an assertion. An international group of 218 participants completed measures of depression, anxiety, rumination and distress intoler-ance at two baselines six months apart as well as at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic ex-actly 12 months later. Contrary to expectations, depression, rumination, and distress intolerance were at equivalent levels during the pandemic as they were at baseline. Anxiety was reduced by a trivial degree (d = .10). Furthermore, a comparison of quantitative explanatory models indi-cated that symptom severity and pandemic-related environmental stressors predicted pandem-ic-related distress, but pandemic-related distress did not predict symptom severity. These find-ings underscore the necessity of longitudinal designs and diathesis-stress models in the study of mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Benjamin A Katz et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461DE-A9E-78B","20200611","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; depression; psychological stress; equivalence testing; anxiety; covid-19","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2492,""
"Loneliness and social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic: Risk factors and associations with psychopathology","Background: The mitigation strategies employed against the COVID-19 pandemic have severe mental health consequences. In particular, as a result of the social distancing protocols, loneliness is likely to increase. The aim of the present study was to investigate (a) the levels of loneliness in the Norwegian population during the strict social distancing non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) implemented against the pandemic, (b) the risk and resilience factors for loneliness and (c) the associations between loneliness and psychopathology symptoms. Methods: A survey was disseminated online to the adult Norwegian population when strict social distancing measures had been implemented for two weeks. The resulting sample of 10084 respondents was proportionally biased in terms of gender and educational level and sensitivity analyses were conducted. The levels of loneliness were compared to those found in other studies during non-pandemic circumstances, loneliness levels were compared across demographic sub-groups, and regression analyses were conducted to identify risk and resilience factors for loneliness and associations between loneliness and psychopathology symptoms. Results: Loneliness levels were higher than in comparable samples measured during non-pandemic circumstances. Among stable factors and as hypothesized, being single and having a psychiatric diagnosis were related to more loneliness with clinically significant effect sizes. Among state risk factors and as hypothesized, more rumination and worry in general was associated with stronger loneliness, showing a clinically significant effect size. Among the coping behaviors explored, doing new things at home not done otherwise was negatively related to loneliness, with a clinically significant effect size. Loneliness predicted both depression and anxiety with clinically significant effect sizes, when all potential confounders as well as psychiatric diagnosis were controlled. The relationship to depression was more marked. Conclusions: The findings support that loneliness is increased during implementation of social distancing measures to impede the coronavirus. Singles and those with a psychiatric diagnosis were most affected. The results support the link between loneliness and depression and anxiety. The results of the analysis of risk and resilience factors point to intervention targets for reducing loneliness during pandemic crises.","Asle Hoffart et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46199-EA9-277","20200610","PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; quarantine; physical distancing; isolation; loneliness; epidemiology; risk factors; sars-cov-2; depression; psychopathology; social distancing; covid-19; anxiety","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2493,""
"COVID Feel Good â€“ An Easy Self-Help Virtual Reality Protocol to Overcome the Psychological Burden of Coronavirus","Background: Living in the time of the COVID-19 means experiencing not only a global health emergency but also extreme psychological stress with potential emotional side effects such as sadness, grief, irritability and mood swings. Crucially, lockdown and confinement measures isolate people who become the first and the only ones in charge of their own mental health: people are left alone facing a novel and potentially lethal situation, and, at the same time, they need to develop adaptive strategies to face it, at home. In this view, easy-to-use, inexpensive, and scientifically validated self-help solutions aiming to reduce the psychological burden of coronavirus are extremely necessary. Aims: This pragmatic trial aims to provide the evidence that a weekly self-help virtual reality (VR) protocol can help overcome the psychological burden of the Coronavirus by relieving anxiety, improving well-being and reinforcing social connectedness. The protocol will be based on the â€œSecret Gardenâ€ 360 VR video online (www.covidfeelgood.com) which simulates a natural environment aiming to promote relaxation and self-reflexion. 360Â° or spherical videos allow the user to control the viewing direction. In this way, the user can explore the content from any angle like a panorama and experience presence and immersion. The â€œSecret Gardenâ€ video is combined with daily exercises that are designed to be experienced with another person (not necessarily physically together), to facilitate a process of critical examination and eventual revision of core assumptions and beliefs related to personal identity, relationships and goals. Methods: This is a multicentric, pragmatic pilot randomized controlled trial involving individuals who experienced the COVID-19 pandemic and underwent a lockdown and quarantine procedures. The trial is approved by the Ethics Committee of the Istituto Auxologico Italiano. Each research group in all the countries joining the pragmatic trial, aims at enrolling at least 30 individuals in the experimental group experiencing the self-help protocol, and 30 in the control group, over a period of 3 months to verify the feasibility of the intervention. Conclusion: The goal of this protocol is for VR to become the â€œsurgical maskâ€ of mental health treatment. Although surgical masks do not provide the wearer with a reliable level of protection against the coronavirus compared with FFP2 or FFP3 masks, surgical masks are very effective in protecting others from the wearerâ€™s respiratory emissions. The goal of the VR protocol is the same: not necessarily to solve complex mental health problems but rather to improve well-being and preserve social connectedness.","Giuseppe Riva et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460A9-9EA-8BE","20200610","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Social health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Treatment; psychological support; virtual reality; post-traumatic stress disorder; psychological distress; self-help; coronavirus; anxiety; positive technology; research protocol; covid-19","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2494,""

"Indirect consequences of COVID-19 on peopleâ€™s lives Findings from an on-line survey in France, Italy and Spain","The COVID-19 pandemic has limited individualsâ€™ possibility to meet and socialize with others due to the state of emergency restrictions to movements, events and relations imposed in different countries. Most shops and restaurants have been closed and some economic activities have been seriously damaged. This significant disruption may have contributed to a deterioration of peopleâ€™s mental health on top of other negative consequences of the pandemic. To better understand the indirect consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak on peopleâ€™s lives we have designed the intergen-COVID online survey (https://sites.google.com/unifi.it/intergen-covid), carried out in France, Italy and Spain between the 14th to the 24th of April 2020. Quota sampling on the population 18-plus and post-stratification weights were used to achieve the alignment between the sample (N = 9,056) and the total population on important socio-demographic characteristics. We collected information on four key domains of individualsâ€™ lives: intergenerational (and other type of) relationships (physical and non-physical; means of communication; frequency, etc.); living arrangements; mental health; events experienced during the lockdown (e.g., income loss, death of relative/friend due to COVID-19, worsened partner relationships, time spent with family); intentions for the future 3 years (e.g., fertility, living parental home, marriage, cohabitation, divorce/separation, retirement). In this paper we provide the main results from this survey, focusing on the first three domains abovementioned. The fourth domain consists of questions applicable to different sub-groups of the population and will be analyzed in separate papers. We show that, despite the general reduction of physical contacts, with low educated people reporting a lower reduction in all kinds of physical contacts, non-physical contacts have significantly increased, especially among women. About 50% of respondents felt sad or depressed more often than usual during the lockdown, but mental health deterioration was found to be heterogeneous and vary with respondentsâ€™ age, gender and country. Job and income loss, and worsening of relationships quality were other negative consequences often experienced during the lockdown, especially by younger individuals. Finally, although maintaining physical distance, during the lockdown people have experienced a high level of social connection, emotional support and practical help.","Bruno Arpino et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4603E-788-AD3","20200707","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning; physical distancing; consequences of covid-19; sars-cov-2; coronavirus; social relationships; mental health; covid-19","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2496,""
"Twitter under Storm: Social Media Response Sensitization in the Caribbean","Climate change has led to rising sea levels and warmer sea surface temperatures. These factors contribute greatly to the intensity of hurricanes and floods they provoke. Projections estimate there will be an increase of 45% to 87% in the frequency of Category >4 hurricanes originating in the Atlantic Basin, which typically impact the Caribbean and Continental United States of America. During the 2019 Hurricane Season, there were 20 depressions, 18 storms, 6 hurricanes and 3 major hurricanes. Through this work, we explored the response on Social Media to these natural phenomena as a function of their trajectory, intensity, and previous exposure of the population to intense natural disasters. Data was collected through the Twitter API. The influences of hurricane proximity and intensity on volume of Social Media production was explored. Hurricane Dorian, with its trajectory strongly threatening the previously exposed Puerto Rico, and eventually causing widespread damage in the Abaco Islands of the Bahamas, presented the strongest case for the evaluation of the dichotomy of responses between populations with differences in previous history of exposure. The landscape of historic hurricane exposure Caribbean has radically changed in recent years. Taking advantage of Big Data to help elucidate these dynamics could be instrumental in the tailoring of emergency preparedness plans and the effective design of mental health first aid strategies.","Danilo T Perez-Rivera et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46030-651-F28","20200630","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Quantitative Psychology; abaco islands; irma; twitter; dorian; karen; national hurricane center; bahamas; 2019; noaa; hurricane; 2017; tropical storm; maria; social media; caribbean; puerto rico","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2497,""

In this article, we examine the expectations of the economic outlook, fear of the future, and behavioural change during the lockdown, for three European countries (Spain, the United Kingdom, and Italy) that have been severely hit by Covid-19. We use a novel data source that we collected to monitor the three countries during the pandemic. As outcome variables, we use expectations (e.g., economic outlook, labour market situation, recovery), fear (e.g., scenario of new outburst, economic depression, restriction to individual rights and freedom), and behavioural change across the following dimensions: savings, cultural consumption, social capital, and risky behaviour. After providing descriptive evidence that is representative of the population of interest, using longitudinal data from the same survey on exposure to shocks and matching techniques, we estimate the impact of exposure to shock occurred during the crisis on the same outcome variables.","Cristiano Codagnone et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4617A-A2C-F06","20200621","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Cognitive Psychology; expectations; covid19; fear; behavioural change; negative economic shocks","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2499,""
"The importance of urban natural areas and urban ecosystem services during the COVID-19 pandemic","Urban, peri-urban forests and other natural areas provide a wide range of material and non-material benefits to people known as ecosystem services. Access to these areas has been linked to improvements in physical and mental health of local populations. In the Spring of 2020, the COVID-19 global pandemic forced many governments to impose a set of restrictions including the closure of businesses and cancelation of events, social distancing and limitation of gatherings, and movement limitations. During this period of restrictions, we conducted a study assessing the importance of urban and peri-urban forests and other natural areas to people living in and around the city of Burlington, Vermont, USA. We evaluated the use and value changes related to these natural areas before and during the period of restrictions. We received over 400 surveys from the local community. The results show that 69.0% of the respondents had increased or greatly increased their visitation rate to these areas, and 80.6% of respondents considered that the importance of these natural areas and access to them either increased or greatly increased. Moreover 25.8% of the sample had either never, or very rarely accessed their local natural areas before the pandemic, but 69.2% of the first time or infrequent visitors reported that having access to these areas during COVID-19 as â€˜very importantâ€™. People reported that these areas were important for a wide range of activities from exercise to birding, but also reported values related to reducing stress in a time of global chaos. Our results indicate the increasing demand and value of such areas in times of crisis such as COVID-19. Experts in zoonotic disease predict the potential for more frequent pandemic events, thus predicating the importance for continued funding for, maintenance of and improved access to natural areas to our largely urban civilization.","Brendan Fisher et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461A2-F81-886","20200612","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2500,""
"Political trust during the Covid-19 pandemic: Rally around the flag or lockdown effects?","How can we explain the rise in diffuse political support during the Covid-19 pandemic? Recent research has argued that the lockdown measures generated political support. In contrast, I argue that the intensity of the pandemic rallied people around political institutions. Collective angst in the face of exponentially rising Covid-19 cases depresses the usual cognitive evaluations of institutions, and leads citizens to rally around existing intuitions as a lifebuoy. Using a representative Dutch household survey conducted over March 2020, I compare the lockdown effect to the dynamic of the pandemic. I find that the lockdown effect is driven by pre-existing time trends. Accounting for nonlinearities in time makes the lockdown effect disappear. In contrast, more flexible modelling techniques reveal a robust effect of Covid-19 infections on political trust. Moreover, I find that standard determinants of political trust â€“ such as economic evaluations and social trust â€“ lose explanatory power as the pandemic spreads. This speaks to an emotionally driven rally effect that pushes cognitive evaluations to the background.","Dominik Schraff","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4621E-6CD-E2B","20200608","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science; corona; political support; netherlands; covid-19; political trust","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2501,""
"In Case You Haven't Heardâ€¦","Thirty-five percent of workers who telecommute said their mental health had deteriorated as a result of doing so amid the COVID-19 lockdown, according to a survey conducted by researchers at Keio University in Tokyo, among other institutions, Fox Business reported April 13. The survey was conducted online March 26â€“28, involving 8,475 employees â€” including nonregular workers â€” aged 20 to 64. Of the 21% of respondents who said they work from home, one-half of them did so in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Among the telecommuters, 50.7% said it had no impact on their mental health, and 14.3% said their mental health had improved. Of the respondents who said doing telework had worsened their mental state, 41.3% said it was difficult to separate their work and personal lives, followed by 39.9% who said they weren't able to exercise enough and 39.7% who said they had difficulty communicating with co-workers. Professor Isamu Yamamoto of the Keio University Faculty of Business and Commerce, who conducted the survey, said: â€œThere is a risk that working hours will get longer if the boundaries between work and personal life become blurred.

Originally, it was all going to go to small business, which ran out of its allotment from the $2 trillion in the first package in short order. Democrats added the hospitals and testing. None goes to states for public health or to substance use disorder treatment or prevention. Reporters covering the separate stories of the stimulus package and opioid overdoses never converged on coverage, and most of the opioid stories predicted that the pandemic would make the opioid crisis worse.

"Le confinement gÃ©nÃ©ralisÃ© pendant lâ€™Ã©pidÃ©mie de Coronavirus: ConsÃ©quences mÃ©dico-psychologiques en populations gÃ©nÃ©rales, soignantes, et de sujets souffrant antÃ©rieurement de troubles psychiques","Background. â€“ The situation we are currently experiencing is unprecedented. Declaring a state of health emergency in order to curb a frightening epidemic, the authorities have decreed the home confinement of the majority of the population of our country for several weeks. In a few days, innumerable questions arise for very diverse spaces: epidemiological, immunological, sociological, information scientists, medical, administrative, political, etc. Objective. â€“ We propose a reflection intended to describe the psychological risks, to clarify the disorders found and, to discuss the means to take care of them in the duration. Material and methods. â€“ We base our thinking on a review of the literature confronted with our current clinical experience, including concerning the possibilities of dematerialized medico-psychological monitoring. Results. â€“ We recall the collective repercussions of emerging lethal mass risks, and in particular viral infectious agents, before approaching the existing scientific models of collective confinement according to military operations in hostile zones, polar wintering missions and aerospace conquest. It appears that for the study of a global containment, somewhat studied during previous pandemics, the conceptions of stress reaction and psychodynamic adaptation prove to be relevant. We detail the psychological consequences of confinement on individual mental health and their countermeasures according to three population typologies: general population, population of caregivers on the front line against the epidemic, and population of subjects already suffering from mental illness or seeing their disorders reappear. We also refer to works in social cognitive psychology explaining how, in an anxiety-provoking situation, reasoning can be biased and lead to choices that ultimately prove to be not very rational, in the opinion of those who made them. The current situation in the health sector is favorable in this, as evidenced by the ""debate on chloroquine"" widely reported in the media and on social networks, opposing conclusions most often decided on the basis of beliefs on contrary to evidence based medicine. Discussion. â€“ The psychological repercussions of confinement appear conditioned by the multiple forms that it can take: voluntary or suffered, more or less prolonged, spent at home or in another place, lived in individual isolation or in a small community, associated other stressors and/or traumatic factors, etc. The home confinement of a population across a country has never been assessed. This experience seems to us to confront our society as a whole with the taboo of death which is imposed, death more and more evaded as the ""Western man"" tries to move away from his terrestrial origins. In this sense, psychotraumatic type repercussions are to be prevented. In order to face multiple challenges, the healthcare system has adapted with, in particular, the development of the use of the Internet for the provision of information intended to better experience confinement, or even the generalization of psychotherapy remotely asking as many questions as it provides answers. These intricacies of computer techniques in the area of psychotherapy, techniques with which we had some mistrust, became established as quickly as the virus: the task of clinicians and researchers to measure the issues and the consequences. Conclusion. â€“ Public health programs could emerge on the model of those already existing in order to manage well-known chronic endemic disorders: protection against the effects of an unbalanced diet associated with a sedentary lifestyle, fight against smoking and alcoholism, prevention of self-aggressive behavior, etc. We will also need to support the caregivers who have been on the front line and who will emerge tested from this pandemic: will depend on the sustainability of the action capacities of our healthcare system to return to its nominal state and also perhaps, so that it can face other crises, especially social ones.","AuxÃ©mÃ©ry, Yann; Tarquinio, Cyril","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2020.06.001","20200605","","PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2504,""

Science says yes, according to Valentina Stoycheva, Ph.D., founder of Stress & Trauma Evaluation and Psychological Services, in the May 24 issue of Psychology Today. â€œThe longer the current COVID-19 pandemic lasts and the higher its death toll, the more prominent the need for mental health services will become,â€ Stoycheva wrote. â€œIn turn, this may create a situation in which the demands on mental health professionals' time are at their peak, while their exposure to secondary traumatic stress is increased.â€ Stoycheva wrote that the American Foundation of Suicide Prevention warns that suicide risk for physicians (including psychiatrists) prior to COVID-19 was 1.5 to 2.25 times higher than the general population. â€œâ€¦ A combination of several factors, including exposure to traumatic stress, the mental health needs of society as a whole, and the unwritten code of ethics of healthcare workers, may compromise therapists' own mental health and ability to seek help.

"Structuring mental health support for frontline caregivers during COVID-19: lessons from organisational scholarship on unit-aligned support","BACKGROUND: Although the COVID-19 pandemic exposes frontline caregivers to severe prolonged stresses and trauma, there has been little clarity on how healthcare organisations can structure support to address these mental health needs. This article translates organisational scholarship on professionals working in organisations to elucidate why traditional approaches to supporting employee mental health, which often ask employees to seek assistance from centralised resources that separate mental health personnel from frontline units, may be insufficient under crisis conditions. We identify a critical but often overlooked aspect of employee mental health support: how frontline professionals respond to mental health services. In high-risk, high-pressure fields, frontline professionals may perceive mental health support as coming at the expense of urgent frontline work goals (ie, patient care) and as clashing with their central professional identities (ie, as expert, self-reliant ironmen/women). FINDINGS: To address these pervasive goal and identity conflicts in professional organisations, we translate the results of a multiyear research study examining the US Armyâ€™s efforts to transform its mental health support during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. We highlight parallels between providing support to frontline military units and frontline healthcare units during COVID-19 and surface implications for structuring mental health supports during a crisis. We describe how an intentional organisational design used by the US Army that assigned specific mental health personnel to frontline units helped to mitigate professional goal and identity conflicts by creating personalised relationships and contextualising mental health offerings. CONCLUSION: Addressing frontline caregiversâ€™ mental health needs is a vital part of health delivery organisationsâ€™ response to COVID-19, but without thoughtful organisational design, well-intentioned efforts may fall short. An approach that assigns individual mental health personnel to support specific frontline units may be particularly promising.","DiBenigno, Julia; Kerrissey, Michaela","https://doi.org/10.1136/leader-2020-000279","20200602","","PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2507,""
"Ontology-Based Inference for Supporting Clinical Decisions in Mental Health","According to the World Health Organization (WHO), mental and behavioral disorders are increasingly common and currently affect on average 1/4 of the worldâ€™s population at some point in their lives, economically impacting communities and generating a high social cost that involves human and technological resources. Among these problems, in Brazil, the lack of a transparent, formal and standardized mental health information model stands out, thus hindering the generation of knowledge, which directly influences the quality of the mental healthcare services provided to the population. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a computational ontology to serve as a common knowledge base among those involved in this domain, to make inferences about treatments, symptoms, diagnosis and prevention methods, helping health professionals in clinical decisions. To do this, we initially carried out a literature review involving scientific papers and the most current WHO guidelines on mental health, later we transferred this knowledge to a formal computational model, building the proposed ontology. Also, the Hermit Reasoner inference engine was used to deduce facts and legitimize the consistency of the logic rules assigned to the model. Hence, it was possible to develop a semantic computational artifact for storage and generate knowledge to assist mental health professionals in clinical decisions.","Yamada, Diego Bettiol; Bernardi, Filipe Andrade; Miyoshi, Newton Shydeo BrandÃ£o; de Lima, InÃ¡cia Bezerra; Vinci, AndrÃ© Luiz Teixeira; Yoshiura, Vinicius Tohoru; Alves, Domingos","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-50423-6_27","20200523","","PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2508,""
"Application of Healthcare â€˜Big Dataâ€™ in CNS Drug Research: The Example of the Neurological and mental health Global Epidemiology Network (NeuroGEN)","Neurological and psychiatric (mental health) disorders have a large impact on health burden globally. Cognitive disorders (including dementia) and stroke are leading causes of disability. Mental health disorders, including depression, contribute up to one-third of total years lived with disability. The Neurological and mental health Global Epidemiology Network (NeuroGEN) is an international multi-database network that harnesses administrative and electronic medical records from Australia, Asia, Europe and North America. Using these databases NeuroGEN will investigate medication use and health outcomes in neurological and mental health disorders. A key objective of NeuroGEN is to facilitate high-quality observational studies to address evidence-practice gaps where randomized controlled trials do not provide sufficient information on medication benefits and risks that is specific to vulnerable population groups. International multi-database research facilitates comparisons across geographical areas and jurisdictions, increases statistical power to investigate small subpopulations or rare outcomes, permits early post-approval assessment of safety and effectiveness, and increases generalisability of results. Through bringing together international researchers in pharmacoepidemiology, NeuroGEN has the potential to be paradigm-changing for observational research to inform evidence-based prescribing. The first focus of NeuroGEN will be to address evidence-gaps in the treatment of chronic comorbidities in people with dementia.","IlomÃ¤ki, Jenni; Bell, J. Simon; Chan, Adrienne Y.

"Improving the Intensive Care Patient Experience With Virtual Realityâ€”A Feasibility Study","OBJECTIVES: Patientsâ€™ stays in the ICU are often characterized by prolonged immobility, sedation, disrupted sleep, and extended periods of pain, which put ICU patients at greater risk for ICU-acquired weakness and delirium-related mortality. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of using meditative virtual reality to improve the hospital experience of ICU patients. DESIGN: Final report of prospective observational trial. SETTING: Surgical and trauma ICUs of the University of Florida Health, an academic hospital. PATIENTS: Fifty-nine nonintubated adult ICU patients without delirium at recruitment. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were exposed to sessions of commercially available meditative virtual reality applications focused on calmness and relaxation, performed once daily for up to 7 days. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Outcome measures included pain level, pain medication administration, anxiety, depression, sleep quality, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, delirium status, and patient ratings of the virtual reality system. Comparisons were made using paired t tests and mixed models. The virtual reality meditative intervention improved patientsâ€™ ICU experience with reduced levels of anxiety and depression; however, there was no evidence that virtual reality had significant effects on physiologic measures, pain, or sleep.

"The Efficacy of Albumin Dialysis in the Reversal of Refractory Vasoplegic Shock Due to Amlodipine Toxicity","OBJECTIVES: Calcium channel blockers are highly protein-bound medications frequently used in the management of hypertension. Overdose results in severe hypotension and is the fourth most common cause of toxicity-related deaths in the United States. Management is mostly supportive, with currently no standard role for targeted drug removal. The protein-bound nature of these medications presents the option of utilizing albumin dialysis for their removal and for the reversal of associated shock. DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: We present two cases of life-threatening intentional amlodipine overdoses successfully treated with albumin dialysis. Both patients experienced profound distributive shock in the setting of preserved cardiac contractility that was refractory to maximal vasoactive agent support. INTERVENTIONS AND RESULTS: After initiation of albumin dialysis, the patients showed rapid hemodynamic improvement and were able to be weaned off vasopressor support. CONCLUSIONS: These cases demonstrate the safety and efficacy of albumin dialysis in the management of near-fatal calcium channel blocker overdoses related to amlodipine and offer an additional therapeutic option apart from conventional supportive care. Importantly, these cases were not associated with impaired cardiac contractility, thereby making venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation a less preferable option. Furthermore, this therapeutic benefit of albumin dialysis can potentially be extended to the management of toxicity related to other highly protein-bound drugs and toxins.","Connor-Schuler, Randi L.; Carr, Jennifer M.; Reaven, Matthew S.; Bridgman, Bob T.; Patel, Deepa M.; Subramanian, Ram M.","https://doi.org/10.1097/cce.0000000000000120","20200605","","PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2513,""
"The impact of delayed time to first CT head in traumatic brain injury","PURPOSE: Trauma team activation (TTA) criteria trigger early mobilization of resources for the sickest trauma patients. Patients with moderately depressed GCS who do not trigger the highest level activation are at risk for adverse outcomes, potentially from delayed time to intervention. The study objective was to define the impact of time to first CT Head (CTH) on outcomes among blunt trauma patients with moderately depressed GCS. METHODS: Patients from the Trauma Quality Improvement Program (TQIP) databank (2013â€“2016) with first ED GCS 9â€“12 were included. Transfers, penetrating mechanisms, death < 24 h, AIS = 6 in any body region, and patients with severe associated injuries were excluded. Study groups were defined by time to first CTH after ED arrival: immediate (= 1 h) vs. delayed (1â€“6 h). Primary outcomes were time to neurosurgical intervention and time to ED discharge. RESULTS: After exclusions, 4997 patients were identified. Of these, 79% (n = 3,954) underwent immediate CTH and 21% (n = 1,043) had delayed CTH. Median GCS was 11 [10â€“12] in both groups and there was no difference in median Head AIS (4 [3â€“4] vs. 4 [3â€“4], p = 0.586). Time to craniotomy and ICP monitor insertion were longer in the delayed group (4.2 h [3.0â€“7.6] vs. 3.1 h [2.1â€“8.7], p = 0.001; and 5.7 h [3.8â€“13.0] vs. 4.4 h [2.6â€“12.0], p = 0.008), as was time in the ED (4.3 h [2.7â€“6.5] vs. 2.1 h [1.2â€“3.7], p < 0.001). There was no difference in need for craniotomy (11% vs. 10%, p = 0.287), need for ICP monitor (12% vs. 12%, p = 0.899), or mortality (11% vs. 9%, p = 0.160). On multivariate analysis, age > 65 (OR 2.813, p < 0.001), SBP < 90 mmHg (OR 2.934, p < 0.001), ED intubation (OR 1.486, p = 0.001), and Head AIS scores of 4 (OR 1.884, p < 0.001) and 5 (OR 6.729, p < 0.001) were independently associated with death. CONCLUSIONS: Immediate CTH for blunt trauma patients with moderately depressed GCS decreases time to intervention and reduces ED time. A protocol to shorten time to CTH may be beneficial for both patients and hospitals.","Schellenberg, Morgan; Benjamin, Elizabeth; Owattanapanich, Natthida; Inaba, Kenji; Demetriades, Demetrios","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00068-020-01421-1","20200625","","PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2514,""

"Specific cutting energy reduction of granite using plasma treatment: A feasibility study for future geothermal drilling","Abstract Geothermal Energy is one of the most consistent and viable sources of renewable energy. However, harnessing this energy has proved to be a challenge mainly due to the difficulty in drilling hard igneous rock formations that occur in and around geothermal wells. Therefore, an energy efficient method that can drill hard rocks needs to be developed. In this paper, the effect of micro-scale energy delivery, in the form of plasma, to weaken rock by inducing micro-cracks is studied. Two different types of granite (igneous rock) were sampled and used in this study, out of which the one control group was treated with five, 40kV, 80J pulses of plasma while the other was left uncracked. The effect of the cracks is quantified by conducting facing tests on the plasma cracked and uncracked samples and measuring a reduction in the specific cutting energy. Two different methods were used to estimate the specific cutting energy, where the first method considered the entire cutting process and the second method considered only the stable cutting region. The plasma treatment showed a maximum of 65% and a minimum of 15% reduction in specific cutting energy and was regarded as being dependent on mainly the hardness and size of the samples.

Especially, medical appliances, medical implants and surgical operation tools for brain and bone invariably need small diameter-deep hole drilling for hard-to-machine metals such as stainless steel and Ti6Al4V. The authors newly designed and manufactured a small diameter-deep hole drilling machine by applying technological developments which consist of a direct drive servo spindle motor controlled more precisely, removable steady rests to prevent for a slender fluted hollow shaft of gun drill to be deflected and a highly pressure circulation system of cutting fluid to prevent being clogged with chips. By using the small diameter-deep hole drilling machine and a special gun drill (specially made to order in BOTEK) a drilling of <U+03D5>1.0Ã—400 mm (L/D=400) for Ti6Al4V was carried out. As a result, it was ascertained that the drilled hole has high accuracy in the items of hole diameter, concentricity, roundness and inner surface roughness.","Inada, Hidenori; Inada, Hiroshi; Yagishita, H.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.066","20201231","","Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2517,""
"Direct Wire-Tension Measurement Based Bowing Correction in Hot Wire Cutting of Polystyrene","Abstract The accuracy of parts produced by hot wire cutting of expanded polystyrene (EPS) is severely affected by bowing of the wire. The degree of bowing depends on the current supplied and the feed rate of the hot wire. Bowing occurs when the current is insufficient to melt the foam ahead of the wire and the mechanical interaction between the foam and the wire increases. This causes an increase in the tension in the wire and this is directly measured using a load cell arrangement. Based on this direct wire tension measurement a real time closed-loop feedback mechanism is implemented which regulates the current to maintain a constant wire tension and eliminates the bowing of the hot wire during the cutting process. For a particular feed rate the feedback mechanism precisely fine tunes the current supplied to the wire such that there is no mechanical drag force between the foam and the wire. The sensitivity of the feedback mechanism is high and responds to very minute contact between the foam and the wire and nominally regulates the current variation in the hot wire, hence, maintaining a constant kerf width throughout the cut. This mechanism allows to significantly improve the accuracy of the EPS part even in complex 3D cutting paths.","Karmakar, Namrata; Chetikena, Harish; M, Venkateshwaran; Subbiah, Sathyan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.042","20201231","","Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2518,""
"Digital image processing with deep learning for automated cutting tool wear detection","Abstract Tool wear is a cost driver in the metal cutting industry. Besides costs for the cutting tools themselves, further costs appear - equipment downtime for tool changes, reworking of damaged surfaces, scrap parts or damages to the machine tool itself in the worst case. Consequently, tools need to be exchanged on a regular basis or at a defined tool wear state. In order to detect and monitor the tool wear state different approaches are possible. In this publication, a deep learning approach for image processing is investigated in order to quantify the tool wear state. In a first step, a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is trained for cutting tool type classification. This works well with an accuracy of 95.6% on the test dataset. Finally, a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) for semantic segmentation is trained on individual tool type datasets (ball end mill, end mill, drills and inserts) and a mixed dataset to detect worn areas on the microscopic tool images. The accuracy metric for this kind of task, Intersect over Union (IoU), is around 0.7 for all networks on the test dataset. This paper contributes to the perspective of a fully automated cutting tool wear analysis method using machine tool integrated microscopes in the scientific and industrial environment.","Bergs, Thomas; Holst, Carsten; Gupta, Pranjul; Augspurger, Thorsten","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.134","20201231","","Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2519,""
"Reduction of cutting forces by elliptical vibration in multi-pass ultraprecise single point axial cutting of V-grooves","Abstract Elliptical vibration cutting (EVC) is an advanced micromachining technology that has a wide range of applications in high-precision micro/nano manufacturing. This technology is primarily used in fabrication of micro/nano-scale functional surfaces, geometrical features, optical and holographic components that are cut in ferrous and difficult-to-cut tooling materials with high form accuracy and surface quality. The main objective of this study was to demonstrate the positive effect of EVC motions on cutting force reduction and stabilization. For this purpose, a series of cutting trials involving the fabrication of micro V-grooves by means of the ultraprecise single point cutting (USPC) were performed. To maintain a constant level of the cutting force, an axial multi-pass cutting strategy with constant cutting area was employed. The influence and advantages brought by EVC over the conventional â€˜no-EVCâ€™ USPC scenario were initially assessed by means of the theoretical considerations of the cutting force. Following that, experimental generation of V-grooves has demonstrated that the integration of EVC kinematics with USPC motions has the ability to reduce the â€˜no-EVCâ€™ cutting forces by more than 90%, to values around 0.1 N for the main axial component. The addition of EVC motions caused a minimal decrease in surface quality whose areal roughness increased from 14 nm in the â€˜no-EVCâ€™ case to 16 nm in the â€˜with-EVCâ€™ scenario. These observations are expected to open new opportunities in micromachining of micro/nano products, systems, sensors, functional surfaces, and lighting and holographic optics.","Farrus, Nikolai; Joao, Delfim; Milliken, Nicolas; Tutunea-Fatan, O.

"Weak chatter detection in milling based on sparse dictionary","Abstract As one of the most unfavorable factors in milling, chatter will lead to poor surface quality, low production efficiency and tool life reduction. Chatter detection, especially weak chatter detection, is an effective way to ensure stable cutting. In this work, the milling dynamic responses based weak chatter detection method is put forward using sparse dictionary. Based on the milling dynamic equations, chatter frequencies are calculated and verified, which are the bases for chatter detection. With the calculated chatter frequencies, the sparse dictionary matrix can be constructed and the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm is adopted for chatter frequencies reconstruction. The proposed method can extract weak chatter frequencies accurately. Experimental results shows that the proposed method can be successful in weak chatter identification.","Wang, Chenxi; Zhang, Xingwu; Chen, Xuefeng; Yan, Ruqiang; Wang, Peng","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.121","20201231","","Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2521,""
"Anomaly detection in milling tools using acoustic signals and generative adversarial networks","Abstract Acoustic monitoring presents itself as a flexible but under-reported method of tool condition monitoring in milling operations. This paper demonstrates the power of the monitoring paradigm by presenting a method of characterizing milling tool conditions by detecting anomalies in the time-frequency domain of the toolsâ€™ acoustic spectrum during cutting operations. This is done by training a generative adversarial neural network on only a single, readily obtained class of acoustic data and then inverting the generator to perform anomaly detection. Anomalous and non-anomalous data are shown to be nearly linearly separable using the proposed method, resulting in 90.56% tool condition classification accuracy and a 24.49% improvement over classification without the method.","Cooper, Clayton; Zhang, Jianjing; Gao, Robert X.; Wang, Peng; Ragai, Ihab","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.059","20201231","","Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2522,""
"Process Mechanics Based Uncertainty Modeling for Cutting Force Prediction in High Speed Micromilling of Ti6Al4V","Abstract High speed machining is essential to counter the low flexural rigidity of micro-end mill in micromilling process. High speed machining can excite the higher frequency modes and in addition, run-out is also amplified. These effects in high speed micromachining induces the uncertainty in cutting forces. The estimation of cutting coefficients without inclusion of uncertainty cannot give accurate values and hence, the predicted cutting force and machining stability using these cutting coefficient may not be accurate. In the present work, cutting coefficients have been determined using the Bayesian inference which includes the uncertainty in estimated cutting coefficients. Note that, estimated cutting coefficient independent of chip load and cutting velocity does not include the high speed micromachining mechanics like size effect. The cutting coefficients have been estimated as a function of cutting velocity and chip load in the present work. The segmented cutting coefficients for different ranges of cutting speed varying from 10000 rpm to 110000 rpm has been obtained as a non-liner function of chip load. Bayesian inference modelling for cutting coefficients has been carried out using the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. The convergence of prior and posterior distribution has been verified using correlation and trace of samples used for sampling. The posterior distribution shows that there is a good fitting, which accurately predicts the mean of the cutting coefficients. Finally, predicted cutting coefficients have been compared with cutting coefficients obtained from the deterministic approach using least square method. The experimentally estimated cutting coefficients are found to be lying within the upper and lower limit of predicted cutting coefficients with Bayesian inference approach. The predicted cutting coefficients using Bayesian inference shows the deviation of 0.89% and 8.4% at 40000 rpm from experimentally obtained cutting coefficients for tangential and radial cutting coefficients, respectively. The experimental cutting force is found to be lying within the upper and lower limit of predicted cutting force with Bayesian inference based cutting coefficients fitting at 105000 rpm.","Singh, Kundan K.; Singh, Ramesh","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.048","20201231","","Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2523,""

"A Machine Vision Based Monitoring System for the LCD Panel Cutting Wheel Degradation","Abstract In Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) panel cutting, in-line monitoring of tool wear is important to maintain the dimension precision of finished products and to avoid possible damages to the workpiece. However, limited by the space for camera installation and the miniature structure of the tool itself, monitoring the wear of LCD panel cutting wheel is not a simple task. In this research, we proposed a machine-vision based instrumentation system and a systematic methodology for cutting wheel degradation monitoring. The proposed method describes the degradation of cutting wheel by estimating the tooth height of the cutting wheel blade based on the partially observed random samples. A series of methods are proposed to improve the reliability of the results. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated based on the field data that is collected from three maintenance cycles. The validation results demonstrate consistent degradation trend of the cutting wheel over production cycles.","Wang, Yinglu; Jia, Xiaodong; Li, Xiang; Yang, Shaojie; Zhao, Haodong; Lee, Jay","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.019","20201231","","Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2526,""
"Mechanistic Cutting Force Model and Specific Cutting Energy Prediction for Modulation Assisted Machining","Abstract This paper presents a mechanistic model for analytical cutting force and specific energy prediction for modulation assisted turning. Kinematics of the process is used to analyze the cut surface topography and derive the uncut chip thickness variation for various modulation parameters. It is found that uncut chip thickness is governed by successive spindle rotations and can be represented in the form of trigonometric functions. The cut and no-cut phase durations are controlled by the modulation frequency and amplitude. Cutting (machining) forces are predicted based on the orthogonal cutting mechanics. The thin shear plane angle is predicted considering oscillations in the cutting velocity, resultant effective rake angle and by employing the well-known Minimum Energy Principle (MEP). In order to accurately predict the shear forces, length of the shear plane is estimated directly from the uncut and cut part surface geometries, which incorporates waviness of the surface. Analytical chip thickness predictions and proposed cutting force models are combined used to predict the specific cutting energy in MAM. Experimental results verify accuracy of developed force models in estimating cutting forces and energy in orthogonal modulated assisted turning of Al6061 T6511.","Eren, Bora; Sencer, Burak","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.071","20201231","","Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2527,""
"Clean manufacturing of Ti-6Al-4V under CO2-snow and hybrid nanofluids","Abstract During the machining of a+ÃŸ intermetallic stable titanium alloy, their poor thermal conductivity and resistance at elevated temperature accumulates most of the shearing and friction heat. The resulting heat damage the cutting tool, causes in high power consumption, shorter tool life and poor surface quality. Therefore, it is important to choose a latest cooling technique with excellent capacity to remove heat, chips and frictional effects from the cutting zone. Therefore, Carbon dioxide snow (CO2-snow) and hybrid copper oxide (CuO)-multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) nanofluids based minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) are compared to achieve clean cooling/lubrication technique to machine biomedical/aerospace material Ti-6Al-4V. Taguchi L9 orthogonal array was applied to design the experiments. Critical machining parameters are cutting speed (m/min), feed (mm/rev), and cooling mode. The output responses are surface quality Ra (Âµm), cutting power Pc (W), cutting temperature T (oC), and tool life TL (min) were evaluated under CO2-snow and MQL-hybrid nanofluids. Findings have revealed less surface roughness and longer tool life under hybrid nanofluids. While CO2-snow has justified less temperature and power consumption at high cutting conditions.","Jamil, Muhammad; He, Ning; Li, Liang; Khan, Aqib Mashood","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.029","20201231","","Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2528,""
"Deep Learning-Based Intelligent Defect Detection of Cutting Wheels with Industrial Images in Manufacturing","Abstract The cutting wheel is an important tool in the television liquid crystal display (LCD) panel manufacturing process. The degradation of the cutting wheel significantly affects the LCD panel quality. Currently, there is few effective approaches that can detect the degradation of the cutting wheel at the working station for health monitoring purpose, due to the small size of the component and the complex manufacturing operation. That leads to high economic costs in the production lines in the real industries. In order to address this issue, this paper presents a deep convolutional neural network-based method for defect detection of the cutting wheels using the industrial images. An end-to-end health monitoring system is built based on machine vision, which directly takes the raw images as inputs, and outputs the detection results. That facilitates the industrial applications since little prior knowledge on image processing and fault detection is required. The experiments on a real-world cutting wheel degradation dataset are carried out for validation. High fault diagnosis testing accuracies are obtained, that indicates the proposed method offers an effective and promising approach for the cutting wheel health monitoring problem.","Yang, Shaojie; Li, Xiang; Jia, Xiaodong; Wang, Yinglu; Zhao, Haodong; Lee, Jay","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.128","20201231","","Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2529,""
"COVID-19 related concerns of people with long-term respiratory conditions: A qualitative study","BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic is having profound psychological impacts on populations globally, with increasing levels of stress, anxiety, and depression being reported, especially in people with pre-existing medical conditions who appear to be particularly vulnerable. There are limited data on the specific concerns people have about COVID-19 and what these are based on. METHODS The aim of this study was to identify and explore the concerns of people with long-term respiratory conditions in the UK regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and how these concerns were affecting them. We conducted a thematic analysis of free text responses to the question 'What are your main concerns about getting coronavirus?', which was included in the British Lung Foundation/Asthma UK (BLF-AUK) partnership COVID-19 survey, conducted between the 1st and 8th of April. This was during the 3rd week of the UK's initial social distancing measures. RESULTS 7,039 responses were analysed, with respondents from a wide range of ages, gender, and all UK nations. Respondents reported having asthma (85%), COPD (9%), bronchiectasis (4%), interstitial lung disease (2%), or 'other' lung diseases (e.g. lung cancer) (1%). Four main themes were identified: 1) vulnerability to COVID-19; 2) anticipated experience of contracting COVID-19; 3) wide-reaching uncertainty; and 4) inadequate national response. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic is having profound psychological impacts. The concerns we identified largely reflect objective, as well as subjective, aspects of the current situation. Hence, key approaches to reducing these concerns require changes to the reality of their situation, and are likely to include i) helping people optimise their health, limit risk of infection, and access necessities; ii) minimising the negative experience of disease where possible, iii) providing up-to-date, accurate and consistent information, iv) improving the government and healthcare response.","Philip, K.

"Dimensions and modulators of behavioural and mental-health changes during the Covid-19 pandemic: an N=343,017 study","BACKGROUND The effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on mental health remain unclear. To mitigate the risks and capitalise on opportunities for positive change, we must understand how the impact has been mediated by sociodemographics, mental disorders, personality traits, life circumstances and the coping measures people choose to take. METHODS Data were collected from 376,987 members of the general public, predominantly in the UK, between late December 2019 and May 2020. Interaction models examined differences in sociodemographic distributions of mood and anxiety for 233,268 people in January vs. 109,749 in May. Factor analysis of a comprehensive instrument determined the dimensionality of self-perceived pandemic-driven change in wellbeing, outlook and behaviour for 74,830 participants in May. Linear modelling identified demographic, contextual, clinical, and trait predictors of pandemic impact. Topic modelling distilled prevalent advice from free-text responses. RESULTS Anxiety, depression and insomnia changed markedly in demographically-mediated ways. Untoward changes were larger for older adults. Benefits were greater for younger adults. Social connectedness was negatively affected across most mental and neurological conditions. There were disorder-specific changes in other domains, e.g., heightened conflict at home for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and heightened anxiety for obsessive-compulsive disorder. Psychiatric symptoms, personality traits, occupational variables and living conditions were amongst the strongest predictors of pandemic impact. Frontline health workers, carers of vulnerable older adults, and disabled or sheltered adults were disproportionately affected. Fifty advice topics were identified from free-text, the prevalence of which covaried with subpopulation, context and traits. CONCLUSIONS The general public report positive and negative consequences of the pandemic. Particular subsets of people have heightened risk of untoward effects whereas other groups appear resilient. To be valid and effective, studies seeking to quantify, predict or mitigate the impact of pandemics on mental health should apply holistic approaches, combining multiple psycho-socio-economic factors.","Hampshire, A.; Hellyer, P.; Soreq, E.; Trender, W.; Mehta, M.

"Cholinergic relay from punishment- to reward-encoding dopamine neurons signals punishment withdrawal as reward in Drosophila","Animals form and update learned associations between otherwise neutral cues and aversive outcomes to predict and avoid danger in changing environments. When a cue later occurs without punishment, this unexpected withdrawal of aversive outcome is encoded as reward, via activation of reward-encoding dopaminergic neurons. Using real-time in vivo functional imaging, optogenetics, behavioral analysis, and electron-microscopy, we identify the neural mechanism through which Drosophila reward-encoding dopaminergic neurons are activated when an olfactory cue is unexpectedly no longer paired with electric shock punishment. Reduced activation of punishment-encoding dopaminergic neurons relieves depression of synaptic inputs to cholinergic neurons, which in turn synaptically increase odor responses of reward-encoding dopaminergic neurons to decrease odor avoidance. These studies reveal for the first time how an indirect excitatory cholinergic synaptic relay from punishment- to reward-encoding dopaminergic neurons encodes the absence of a negative as a positive, revealing a general circuit motif for unlearning aversive memories that could be present in mammals.","McCurdy, Li Yan; Sareen, Preeti; Davoudian, Pasha A.; Nitabach, Michael N.","https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.22.165209","20200623","","BioRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2533,""
"Integrated Tool Condition Monitoring Systems and Their Applications: A Comprehensive Review","Abstract In conventional metal cutting, different tool wear modes, and their individual deterioration rates play vital roles in overall production performance. For a given tool (i.e., geometry or materials), many shop floors still follow a standard rule by pre-setting a tool life, which is conservative but not realistic. Premature failure of a tool can cause unexpected machine downtime and material losses, while another tool could serve beyond that pre-set life. As a result, optimized tool life and productivity cannot be achieved. Moreover, nowadays, there is an increased demand of process monitoring and optimization on the unmanned and the semi-automated shop floors. Tool condition monitoring (TCM) systems for process improvement and optimization have been in research for several decades. Both offline and online TCM systems are invented and discussed. A wide range of original publications are reported focusing on different sub-topics, e.g., specific machining process-based TCM methods, measurement or signal acquisition methods, processing methods, and classifiers. With the recent evolution of smart sensors in the era of Industry 4.0, development of online TCM systems received much attention to the researchers. Accordingly, research on some sub-topics also gets motivated into different directions, such as, feasibility of power or current sensors, machine vision technique, and combination of multi-sensors. Thus, from the industrial viewpoint, the current state of implementation of the proposed TCM systems for (near) real-time process monitoring and control needs to be clear. This paper presents the state-of-the-art of the TCM systems covering three major machining operations, discusses their application feasibility in industry environments, and states some current TCMS implementations. Challenges being faced by the industry are concluded, along with direction and suggestions for future researches.","Nath, Chandra","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.123","20201231","","Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2534,""
"Prediction of Stability Lobe Diagrams in High-Speed Milling by Operational Modal Analysis","Abstract Self-excited regenerative vibration or chatter limits the primary requirements like productivity, surface finish and dimensional accuracy of high-speed machining. It is the most critical factor that severely affects the tool-life and life of the machine tool. Out of several methods followed for suppressing and avoiding chatter, machining conditions chosen with stability lobe diagram is the most reliable way. Stability lobe diagrams are typically generated by knowing specific cutting force coefficients and tool point frequency response functions (FRFs). Inaccurate use of tool point FRFs significantly affects the stable regions of stability lobe diagrams. As tool-point FRFs are influenced by gyroscopic effect, centrifugal force, thermal change in bearing dynamics, etc. during machining, it is important to consider the effect of these factors on tool point FRFs in order to generate accurate stability lobe diagrams. The present work covers a new approach for estimating tool point FRFs during machining operations, employing cutting tool vibration signals. For measuring the vibration at the tip of end mill at different spindle speeds, a non-contact laser vibrometer is used. In order to remove the tooth pass frequency and its harmonics from the measured signals, a comb filter is employed. The filtered signal is subjected to Operational Modal Analysis (OMA) in order to derive tool point FRFs. With the estimated FRFs at different spindle speeds, the stability lobe diagrams are drawn for high-speed milling machine. Comparative study of stability lobe diagrams, drawn with static modal analysis and Operational Modal Analysis, have shown that the cutting conditions chosen from stability lobe diagram derived with OMA, are found to be more realistic for avoiding chatter during high-speed milling applications.","Paliwal, Vineet; Babu, N.

"Development of a Vise with built-in Piezoelectric and Strain Gauge Sensors for Clamping and Cutting Force Measurements","Abstract Accurate measurement of static and dynamic forces during machining operations is important in the process monitoring, optimization and prediction of machining quality. Cutting and clamping forces are typically measured separately, for example, through hydraulic clamping force devices and piezoelectric table dynamometers. Since cutting and clamping forces interact throughout machining, both forces need to be measured simultaneously to accurately predict machining quality. This paper proposes a novel force measuring device in the form of a vise with built-in piezoelectric sensors and strain gauges to measure multi-axial clamping and cutting forces simultaneously. A strain concentrating design based on a cross-shaped groove was utilized to attach three strain gauges to measure clamping forces. These locations were chosen for their ability to measure clamping forces in real-time and minimize cross-talks. Piezoelectric sensors were embedded between layers in the vise jaw to measure cutting forces. A prototype of the proposed apparatus was fabricated and used to experimentally investigate sensitivities, bandwidth, clamping forces and cutting forces. The results showed that the proposed device has good performance in measuring clamping and cutting forces in milling operations.","Rezvani, Sina; Nikolov, Nicholas; Kim, Chang-Ju; Park, Simon S.; Lee, Jihyun","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.143","20201231","","Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2536,""

"COVID-19 preventive behaviors among people with anxiety and depression: Findings from Japan","Little is known about COVID-19 preventive behaviors among individuals with mental health problems. This study used cross-sectional online survey data from 2000 Japanese adults collected in April and May, 2020, to examine the association between anxiety and depression and COVID-19 preventive behaviors. Results from logistic regression analyses showed that both anxiety and depression were associated with lower odds for engaging in preventive behaviors such as wearing a face mask and hand washing. Our results highlight the importance of facilitating the performance of preventive behaviors in individuals with mental health problems to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in this population.","Stickley, A.; Matsubayashi, T.; Sueki, H.; Ueda, M.","https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.19.20135293","20200620","","MedRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2539,""
"Experimental comparison of material removal rates in abrasive waterjet cutting and a novel droplet stream technique","Abstract The use of abrasive waterjets (AWJ) to machine metal surfaces is prevalent through-out industry. AWJ requires the purchase and disposal of costly abrasive particles which increases manufacturing costs and environmental-footprint. This motivates the exploration for low-cost, eco-friendly alternatives. A novel method which utilizes a stream of high-speed water droplets (WD) travelling through a sub-atmospheric pressure environment to remove material without using abrasive grit is presented. In this paper, the efficacy of this new process is investigated and compared to AWJ and pure water jet (WJ) (i.e., without abrasive particles) by measuring the material removal rates (MRR) of each process on a hard-to-machine steel, DP 1180, for equivalent water-flow conditions. Trench profiles are created by traversing each of the jets across a metal sample, from which the MRR and trench profiles are obtained. The MRR results reveal that WD is significantly faster than WJ, but is subordinate compared to AWJ for MRR efficiency. This identifies a trade-off between manufacturing cost and time.","Mitchell, Benjamin R.; Demian, Sohani A.R.; Korkolis, Yannis P.; Kinsey, Brad L.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.085","20201231","","Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2540,""
"Theoretical and applied study of the psychological and educational effects of lockdown in primary school students in Argentina","Abstract Emotions are complex states, which have a fundamental role for childrenâ€™s mental health and learning. The proper self-regulation of emotions allows to tolerate frustrations, improves social skills and healthy bonds with peers and adults in the environment (Bisquerra, 2003, p. 12). The lack of regulation causes discomfort that leads to a decrease in academic performance (Graziano, Reavis, Keanes & Calkins, 2006) and particularly in reading comprehension, because this competence requires motivation and cognitive processes that will allow to process the linguistic code, interpret it and represent it symbolically (Alonso-Tapia, 2005, p. 64). In this work, we show the essential relationship between emotional regulation and reading comprehension in primary school students. After that, we study the effect of lockdown on these two processes. The aim is to have preliminary information about the challenges and effects of the current situation. To do this, a semi-structured survey has been conducted of parents and teachers in order to assess the psychological and educational effects of the current health situation. The results of 40 semi-structured telephone surveys are analyzed, 20 of parents of children with learning disorders and 20 of their classroom teachers in Traslasierra, CÃ³rdoba-Argentina. The results inform that the students and their parents have difficulties to regulate their emotions and this emotional struggle has a negative impact on comprehension of texts. The problems that previously presented in these two areas have increased due to the lack of adaptation of activities by teachers, the lack of knowledge of their parents to help them and the difficulty in accessing digital technologies. Both parents and teachers express that lockdown affects learning processes, although parents are also concerned about the effects on social life.","Sevilla Vallejo, Santiago; Ceballos MarÃ³n, Natalia Andrea","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssaho.2020.100039","20201231","","Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2541,""

"Determination of Johnson-Cook material model parameters for AISI 1045 from orthogonal cutting tests using the Downhill-Simplex algorithm","Abstract Despite the increasing digitalization of manufacturing processes in the context of Industry 4.0, the process design and development of machining processes poses major challenges for todayâ€™s manufacturing technology. Compared to the conventional process design, which is influenced by an empirical ""trial-and-error"" principle, the simulative process design offers the possibility of reducing development time and costs while at the same time improving the process understanding. A possible simulation technique to achieve these goals is the Finite Element Method (FEM). The FEM enables the calculation of the thermo-mechanical load spectrum underlying the machining process. Therefore, different input models are required. One of the most critical input models is the material model, which describes the constitutive material behavior. To determine the material model parameters, either (conventional) material tests, which require an extrapolation into the regime of metal cutting, or inverse techniques are used, where the process itself is used as a material test. Using the inverse technique, the model parameters are modified iteratively until a predefined agreement between simulations and experiments is achieved. The evaluation of the agreement bases on integral process variables, such as the cutting force, and their simulative counterparts. However, the procedure of the inverse determination requires high computational efforts and is not robust. This paper presents a novel approach to enhance the robustness of the inverse material model parameter determination from the cutting process. Orthogonal cutting tests on AISI 1045 steel have been conducted on a broaching machine tool over a range of different cutting speeds and undeformed chip thicknesses to set an experimental database. Thereby, the workpiece material was investigated in the two different heat treatments: normalized and coarse-grain annealed. The machining experiments showed differences in terms of the integral process results when comparing the two heat treatments. These results motivated for the development of a methodology capable to determine material model parameters robust and inversely from the machining process, which can be used with lower computational effort. To simulate the machining process, a Coupled-Eulerian-Lagrangian (CEL) model of the orthogonal cutting process has been set up. The material model parameters have been inversely determined using the Downhill-Simplex-Algorithm, which has been modified for this case. By using the Downhill-Simplex-Algorithm, it was possible to determine material model parameters within 17 iterations and achieving an average deviation between the experiment and the simulations below 10 %. Thereby, different process observables such as temperature, forces, and chip form have been used for the evaluation. Through this method, it is possible to determine material model parameters, which enable a good match between experiments and simulations with a low computational effort.","Bergs, Thomas; Hardt, Marvin; Schraknepper, Daniel","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.081","20201231","","Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2543,""
"Healthcare workers experiences of working on the frontline and views about support during COVID-19 and comparable pandemics: A rapid review and meta-synthesis","Healthcare workers across the world have risen to the demands of treating COVID-19 patients, potentially at significant cost to their own health and wellbeing. There has been increasing recognition of the potential mental health impact of COVID-19 on frontline healthcare workers and growing calls to provide psychosocial support for them. However, little attention has so far been paid to understanding the impact of working on a pandemic from healthcare workers own perspectives or what their views are about support. This rapid review identified 40 qualitative studies which have explored healthcare workers experiences and views from previous pandemics, including and comparable to COVID-19. Meta-synthesis of this qualitative data using thematic analysis derived eight key themes which transcended pandemics, time, and geographical boundaries. This pandemic is not unprecedented; the themes that arose from previous pandemics were remarkably resonant with what we are hearing about the impact of COVID-19 globally today. We have an opportunity to learn from the lessons of these previous pandemics, mitigate the negative mental health impact of COVID-19 and support the longer-term wellbeing of the healthcare workforce worldwide.","Billings, J.; Ching, B.

"The immediate psychological response of the general population in Saudi Arabia during COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study","Background: The health and economic burden pandemic diseases significantly cause psychosocial problems. The outbreak of COVID-19 may differentially exacerbate anxiety and stress in people subjected to the real or perceived threat of the virus. Method: An online cross-sectional survey was carried out to assess the general population's immediate psychological response during the initial state of the outbreak in Saudi Arabia. The study used brief screening tools PHQ-4 for anxiety-depression symptoms and IES-6 for posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. Results: Among the 584 respondents, 19.8% and 22.0% reported moderate to severe anxiety and depression symptoms, respectively. According to the combined PHQ-4 score, 14.5% of participants showed moderate to severe anxiety or depression disorder. 64.8% met the level of clinical concern for posttraumatic stress disorder, and 51.3% met the level of probable posttraumatic stress disorder diagnosis. Multivariate analyses showed that females, non-Saudi nationalities, and those who had mental illness history were more vulnerable to anxiety and depression disorders than their counterparts, whereas a higher prevalence of distress symptoms was reported among those who prefer Arabic over English for communication. It was found that people whose colleagues or family infected with the disease were more likely to report moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety or depression and distress. The study further showed that the higher the perceived threat, the higher the chances of exhibiting anxiety-depressive disorder symptoms and distress symptoms. Conclusion: The findings are a matter for serious concern, and considerable attention is required from authorities and policymakers regarding early detection and treatment of these illnesses in order to reduce the burden of the pandemic related mental illness.","Joseph, R.; Alshayban, D.; Lucca, J.

"Anomaly detection methods in turning based on motor data analysis","Abstract A cutting anomaly can be detected by using machine learning and pattern recognition in addition to the conventional method of using cutting knowledge to determine the criteria of detection. However, it is difficult to guarantee that all cutting anomalies can be detected during mass production due to various events that can occur. Moreover, machine learning and pattern recognition are not systemized for use in mass production. In this work, we investigated the detection of turning anomalies during mass production under optimized cutting conditions. We applied a method that utilizes the motor current of each operating axis to monitor the machining state without affecting the machining process and determines the correlation between turning anomalies and motor data. Our target was the unsteady anomalies that appear in mass production, such as chip biting and tool vibration. On the basis of the obtained correlation, we developed a formalized anomaly detection method using traditional statistics and a systemized anomaly detection method using discretization and pattern recognition based on the Mahalanobis Taguchi method with auto parameter tuning to eliminate the need for detailed analysis based on knowledge of cutting phenomena. Both methods achieved a detection accuracy of over 98%.","Watanabe, Tsubasa; Kono, Ippei; Onozuka, Hideaki","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.126","20201231","","Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2546,""
"Chapter 1 Introduction: changing cultures of speed","Abstract This chapter outlines the widespread acceptance of speed as a positive aspect of urban transport during the 20th century, along with a growing recognition in recent decades that speed may not provide the advantages that have long been assumed. In 21st century urban planning, no longer are higher speeds always seen as the main objective. New goals are increasingly recognised as being more important: accessibility, liveability, economic vitality, child-friendliness, sustainability and health. The concept of â€˜healthâ€™ in this book applies to human health, as well as economic health and environmental health. We explain how all of these types of health can be enhanced using the simple strategy of slowing city transport. A brief history of increases in transport speed is followed by a discussion of the evolution of the culture of speed in modern societies, to a level that can be compared to an addiction. An important aspect of the culture of speed is the story of motordom, the grouping of automobile clubs, car dealers and car manufacturers that began in the United States in the 1920s. A concerted campaign by motordom comprehensively dismissed the publicâ€™s negative views on speed. We then outline how, from the 1980s onwards, new thinking began to emerge about motorised city transport, in which the value of slowing it down became more widely discussed. We provide examples of various slow movements that have emerged since the 1980s. While some citizens and policy-makers may question (or even ridicule) the idea of slow movements, we reflect on where the â€˜fast movementâ€™ has taken us over the last 100 years. This chapter concludes with a preview of the chapters and parts of the book.","Tranter, Paul; Tolley, Rodney","https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-815316-1.00001-0","20201231","","Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2547,""
"Machinability and Surface Integrity Characterization in Hard Turning of AISI 4320 Bearing Steel Using Different CBN Inserts","Abstract The thermomechanical interaction between the cutting tool and the workpiece in any material removal process is a key factor in defining the efficiency and productivity of the process. It is especially important in cutting hard-to-machine materials such as titanium- and nickel-based alloys or hardened steels. The productivity of the process can be defined in terms of machining time, intervals of tool change (due to tool wear) and surface integrity characteristics such as dimensional tolerances, surface roughness and the machining-affected zone. The objective of this work is to conduct a comprehensive study of the performance of three different industrial-grade CBN cutting inserts during hard turning of AISI 4320 case-carburized steel. The CBN inserts all had the same geometry but used different edge preparation and coating technologies. To quantify tool performance, the cutting forces and tool wear were measured at consistent intervals and the surface integrity of the workpiece was characterized in terms of surface roughness, white and dark layer depths, micro-hardness and residual stresses. Results show that the stability of the cutting edge on two of the tested inserts plays an important role in determining tool life (where 60% higher tool life was achieved compared to the other tested insert with unstable cutting edge), cutting force stability and the formation of compressive residual stresses on the surface of the turned workpiece","Niaki, Farbod Akhavan; Haines, Eric; Dreussi, Roman; Weyer, Gregory","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.087","20201231","","Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2548,""

The training/test data for building the ML models is generated from finite element (FE) simulations. The simulations are performed using the commercial FE package Abaqus/Explicit and validated using experimental results. The FE generated data consists of cutting speed, uncut chip thickness, and rake angle as the input parameters. The response variables are the cutting force and maximum tool temperature. The data is split into training and test sets using 80-20 split. The optimal SVR and GPR models are selected using grid search on the training data. The predictions on the test data sets show that both the models perform well with high accuracy in predicting cutting force and maximum tool temperature. Between the two models, the mean square errors (MSE) for SVR are less than those for GPR.","Hashemitaheri, Maryam; Mekarthy, Sai Manish Reddy; Cherukuri, Harish","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.139","20201231","","Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2549,""

These points are analyzed to extract the cutting edge radius and angle values, which are then incorporated in a time domain simulation that predicts cutting force and tool/workpiece deflection for user-selected operating parameters. Good agreement between predicted and measured cutting forces is first demonstrated. The process stability is then predicted using the validated force model and measured structural dynamics. Observations about the stability dependence on insert geometry are finally presented for a selected end mill.","Gomez, Michael; No, Timothy; Smith, Scott; Schmitz, Tony","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.067","20201231","","Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2550,""
"Dry Ultra-Precision Machining of Tungsten Carbide with Patterned nano PCD Tool","Abstract Texturing on the rake face of the tool without the metal working fluid is a potential method to reduce the friction coefficient in ultra-precision machining of tungsten carbide (WC) with a diamond tool. Low friction coefficient of the patterned tool would generate less heat in the tool-work interface and improve the tool life. This paper studies the effect of texturing on the cutting performance in ultra-precision machining of WC with a nano-polycrystalline diamond (PCD) tool. Orthogonal cutting experiments were conducted to verify the cutting performance of the textured diamond tool in machining of WC. The linear patterns parallel and perpendicular to the cutting direction were fabricated on the rake face of the nano-PCD tool by using the focused ion beam process. The experimental result showed that the friction coefficient of the perpendicular patterned tool decreased by 10%. WC surface machined with the patterned tool and non-patterned tool was also analyzed and compared. Material separation at grain boundary between tungsten grains and cobalt and full detachment of tungsten grains dominantly affected the surface quality of the machined WC surface.","Maeng, Sangjin; Min, Sangkee","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.068","20201231","","Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2551,""
"Distress among Brazilian university students due to the Covid-19 pandemic: survey results and reflections","The first case of infection with the new coronavirus was identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. In March, the World Health Organization (WHO) defined the disease epidemic as a pandemic. Thus, a quarantine was imposed by many governments. As a consequence, and given that epidemiological outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as Covid-19, are associated with psychological disorders and symptoms of mental illness, researchers at the Shanghai Mental Health Center have created the Covid-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI), in which the results are obtained: normal, mild/moderate distress and severe distress. The main objective of the study was based on the application of CPDI, in order to identify the health and well-being of Brazilian students from different undergraduate courses at the Pontifical Catholic University of Sao Paulo (PUC/SP) during the Covid-19 pandemic and to test the hypothesis that medical students suffer more than students from other courses. The research is based on a cross-sectional observational study, in which we applied, using Google FormsR, the questions contained in CPDI, among with demographic data: age, sex, educational institution, undergraduate course and school year. The Index was applied online for seven days in which a total of 654 valid responses were obtained: 501 (76.6%) female and 149 (22.8%) male. Regarding age, 333 students (50.91%) were 17-20 years old, 279 (42.66%) between 21-25, 30 (4.59%) between 26-30 and 12 (1.84%) between 31-50. The results indicate that the participants reported significant psychological distress, according to the CPDI score. Practically 90% (87.92%) of the students experienced suffering, while only 12.08% did not suffer. The study provides the first empirical evidence on the level of psychological distress in Brazilian university students during the Covid-19 pandemic. Also, it suggests support and monitoring of university students during and after the pandemic, with effective and efficient intervention in their mental health.","Hubner, C. v. K.; Bruscatto, M.

"Geometric simulation of power skiving of internal gear using solid model with triple-dexel representation","Abstract Gear manufacturing is a fundamental technology for machine production. Power skiving has rapidly become an efficient method for the manufacturing of internal high-precision gears. To analyze the cutting force during power skiving, a geometric simulation of the power skiving process, particularly a visualization of the resulting machining shape and a prediction of the chip geometry generated during the cutting process, is important. In this study, we propose a novel method for precisely simulating the power skiving process using solid modeling. The resulting shape of power skiving is computed by repeatedly subtracting the swept volume of the cutting edge from a solid model of the workpiece. To realize a robust computation in a subtraction operation, a solid model with triple-dexel representation is used to represent the workpiece shape. To accelerate the operations, the parallel processing function of a graphics processing unit (GPU) is used. An experimental simulation system is implemented, and some computational experiments are conducted.","Inui, Masatomo; Huang, Yu; Onozuka, Hideaki; Umezu, Nobuyuki","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.078","20201231","","Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2553,""
"On-machine measurement-based compensation for machining of thin web parts","Abstract Thin web parts are widely used in the aerospace industry; however, serious machining errors may happen due to their low rigidity. In this study, a highly automatic method that integrates machining status monitoring, on-machine measurement (OMM) inspection, machining error modeling and real time compensation is proposed and developed. The OMM inspection is firstly applied to measure the comprehensive machining errors, the Hampel filtering, the triangulation-based cubic interpolation and a machine learning algorithm are then used to train the machining error model. Finally, the real time compensation of high-density cutting points is realized by developing the compensation system based on External Machine Zero Point Shift (EMZPS) function of machine tool. The proposed method was validated through three sets of compensation experiment of a thin web part. The results revealed that 58.1%, 68.4% and 62.6% of the machining error ranges were decreased, respectively. This method demonstrates immense potential for further applications in efficiency and accuracy improvement of thin-walled freeform surface parts.","Ge, Guangyan; Du, Zhengchun; Yang, Jianguo","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.122","20201231","","Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2554,""
"Comparison of Flow Stress of Aluminum Alloy 6061-T6 Obtained From Chip Pulling Orthogonal Cutting and Kolsky Bar Testing","Abstract Machining can be used as a test for the flow stress of materials under conditions of high strain (e > 1) and strain rate (102/s to 106/s). Constitutive models of metallic materials are conventionally obtained by dynamic compression tests such as the Split-Hopkinson (Kolsky) bar test at lower strain (e < 0.3) and strain rate (103/s to 104/s). To compare the flow stress obtained from both tests under identical conditions, the strain in the primary shear zone (PSZ) in orthogonal cutting tests has been lowered using high rake angle (a = 45Â°) cutting tools to e Ëœ 0.8, and by adding chip pulling to e Ëœ 0.5. To our knowledge this is the first time that flow stress estimates are obtained from machining at such low strain values. With some modifications, the strain in Kolsky bar testing has been increased up to e = 0.8, and the stress-strain curve obtained is compared to flow stress estimates from orthogonal cutting tests under the same strain and similar strain rates. The results work, show for the first time, that the flow stress measured from cutting tests agree closely with those obtained from Kolsky bar testing.","Cui, Changlong; Bhavsar, Pavan; Lopez-Hawa, Homar; Madhavan, Vis; Moscoso-Kingsley, Wilfredo","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.161","20201231","","Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2555,""

We adopt a sentiment analysis approach to analyze the psychological state changes of 1,278 quarantined persons with 214,874 tweets over four weeks spanning the period before, during, and after quarantine. We formed a control group of 1,278 unquarantined persons with 250,198 tweets. The tweets of both groups are analyzed by matching with a lexicon to measure the anxious depression level changes over time. We discovered a clear pattern of psychological changes for quarantined persons. Anxious depression levels significantly increased as quarantine starts, but gradually diminished as it progresses. However, anxious depression levels resurged after a 14-day quarantine. It was found that quarantine has a negative impact on the mental health of quarantined and unquarantined people. Whilst quarantine is deemed necessary, proper interventions such as emotion management should be introduced to mitigate its adverse psychological impacts.","Lu, W.; Yuan, L.; Xu, J.; Xue, F.; Zhao, B.; Webster, C.","https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.25.20140426","20200626","","MedRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2556,""

"Influence of cutting fluid application frequency on the surface quality of micromilled slots on Inconel 718 alloy","Abstract Micromilling is a machining process defined by its low dimensions. In general, it is defined by the cutting tool diameter that must vary between 1 Âµm and 1000 Âµm. This process is used mostly in molds, medical applications and Micro-Electromechanical Systems (MEMS), where high quality parts are required in terms of geometry, which are absent of defects and possess smooth surfaces. However, there exist hurdles that need to be crossed in order to achieve these high-quality parts, most frequently surface roughness and the presence of burrs. For such phenomena, one common solution is the appliance of cutting fluids. To this end, some research studies have been developed, these have placed their focus upon the different composition of cutting fluid, which is applied with different pressures and at different rates. The application of cutting fluid can be made through pulses, as this is a common configuration for the MQL fluid supplier. The frequency of pulses defines the volume of cutting fluid applied and consequently affects the results. In this sense, this study aims to evaluate the influence of the frequency of cutting fluid application over the final part of the cutting process. The results demonstrated that for the difficult to cut Inconel 718, if a low frequency of fluid, delivered by MQL, is applied, the final piece will not be homogeneous, as well as leaving parts with a low surface quality and higher burr formation.","de Oliveira, DÃ©borah; Gomes, Milla Caroline; da Silva, MÃ¡rcio Bacci","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.082","20201231","","Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2558,""
"Effect of Workpiece Curvature on Axial Surface Error Profile in Flat End-Milling of Thin-walled Components","Abstract The advancements in the domain of CAD/CAM and CNC machine tools facilitated machining of complex geometric shapes to meet functional requirements and/or aesthetic appearances. These shapes combine several geometric features such as zero curvature (straight), constant curvature (circular) and variable curvature surfaces. The components often contain thin-walled sections having inherently lower stiffness that induces static deflections transforming into surface error and violation of error limits specified by the designer. This paper presents a comparison of deflection induced surface error profile generated during the end milling of zero and constant curvature thin-walled components. The proposed framework incorporates computational model to estimate cutting forces, Finite Element Analysis (FEA) model to compute workpiece deflections, and surface generation mechanism to derive error profile. The paper also investigates the effect of change in the radial engagement area due to workpiece curvature by introducing the concept of â€˜Equivalent Radial Depth of Cutâ€™. Further, the effect of change in workpiece curvature is investigated on the surface error profile in the paper. The proposed framework has been generalized to accommodate the variation of workpiece geometry, and the results are validated by conducting a set of end milling experiments.","Agarwal, Ankit; Desai, K.

"The Lifelines COVID-19 Cohort: a questionnaire-based study to investigate COVID-19 infection and its health and societal impacts in a Dutch population-based cohort","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected billions of people around the world not only through the infection itself but also through its wider impact on public health and daily life. To assess the effects of the pandemic, a team of researchers across a wide range of disciplines developed and implemented the Lifelines COVID-19 questionnaire, leading to the development of the Lifelines COVID-19 cohort. This cohort is recruited from participants of the Lifelines prospective population cohort and the Lifelines NEXT birth cohort, and participants were asked to fill out detailed questionnaires about their physical and mental health and experiences on a weekly basis starting in late March of 2020 and on a bi-weekly basis staring in June 2020. The Lifelines region covers the three Northern provinces of the Netherlands-Drenthe, Groningen and Friesland-which together account for about 10% of the Dutch population. To date, >70,000 people have responded to the questionnaires at least once, and the questionnaire program is still ongoing. Data collected by the questionnaires will be used to address four aspects of the outbreak: (1) how the COVID-19 pandemic developed in the three northern provinces of the Netherlands, (2) which environmental risk factors predict disease susceptibility and severity, (3) which genetic risk factors predict disease susceptibility and severity and (4) what are the psychological and societal impacts of the crisis.","Mc Intyre, K.; Lanting, P.; Deelen, P.; Wiersma, H.; Vonk, J.

"Analyzing COVID-19 on Online Social Media: Trends, Sentiments and Emotions","At the time of writing, the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused severe impacts on society, economy and people's daily lives. People constantly express their opinions on various aspects of the pandemic on social media, making user-generated content an important source for understanding public emotions and concerns. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis on the affective trajectories of the American people and the Chinese people based on Twitter and Weibo posts between January 20th, 2020 and May 11th 2020. Specifically, by identifying people's sentiments, emotions (i.e., anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise) and the emotional triggers (e.g., what a user is angry/sad about) we are able to depict the dynamics of public affect in the time of COVID-19. By contrasting two very different countries, China and the Unites States, we reveal sharp differences in people's views on COVID-19 in different cultures. Our study provides a computational approach to unveiling public emotions and concerns on the pandemic in real-time, which would potentially help policy-makers better understand people's need and thus make optimal policy.","Li, Xiaoya; Zhou, Mingxin; Wu, Jiawei; Yuan, Arianna; Wu, Fei; Li, Jiwei","https://doi.org/nan","20200529","","ArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2561,""
"Adoption of telemedicine services by substance abuse treatment facilities in the US","OBJECTIVE: To describe trends in licensed substance use treatment facilities' adoption of telemedicine and how adoption varies across local factors, including county-level drug overdose rates, urbanicity measures, and state policy laws. METHODS: We analyzed data (2016â€“2019) from the National Directory of Drug and Alcohol Abuse Treatment Facilities. Our main outcome was telemedicine use by a treatment facility. We also captured independent variables from other datasets, including estimated county-level drug poisoning deaths and state-level telemedicine policies. We estimated a multivariable logistic regression model to determine which facility characteristics were associated with offering telemedicine. RESULTS: From 2016 to 2019, an average of 12,334 treatment facilities were included. During this period, the unadjusted proportion of facilities offering telemedicine grew from 13.5% to 17.4% (p < 0.001). In adjusted models, rural location; offering multiple treatment settings; offering pharmacotherapy; and serving both adult and pediatric patients were associated with greater telemedicine adoption (p < 0.05 for all comparisons). DISCUSSION: Use of telemedicine is increasing steadily among substance use disorder (SUD) treatment facilities; however, uptake is uneven and relatively low. As such, telemedicine may be an underutilized tool to expand access to care for patients with SUDs.","Uscher-Pines, Lori; Cantor, Jonathan; Huskamp, Haiden A.; Mehrotra, Ateev; Busch, Alisa; Barnett, Michael","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108060","20200623","","Elsevier; PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2562,""
"Potential spreading risks and disinfection challenges of medical wastewater by the presence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral RNA in septic tanks of Fangcang Hospital","Abstract The outbreak of coronavirus infectious disease-2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia raises the concerns of effective deactivation of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in medical wastewater by disinfectants. In this study, we evaluated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in septic tanks of Wuchang Cabin Hospital and found a striking high level of (0.5â€“18.7) Ã— 103 copies/L after disinfection with sodium hypochlorite. Embedded viruses in stool particles might be released in septic tanks, behaving as a secondary source of SARS-CoV-2 and potentially contributing to its spread through drainage pipelines. Current recommended disinfection strategy (free chlorine =0.5 mg/L after at least 30 min suggested by World Health Organization; free chlorine above 6.5 mg/L after 1.5-h contact by China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) needs to be reevaluated to completely remove SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in non-centralized disinfection system and effectively deactivate SARS-CoV-2. The effluents showed negative results for SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA when overdosed with sodium hypochlorite but had high a level of disinfection by-product residuals, possessing significant ecological risks.","Zhang, Dayi; Ling, Haibo; Huang, Xia; Li, Jing; Li, Weiwei; Yi, Chuan; Zhang, Ting; Jiang, Yongzhong; He, Yuning; Deng, Songqiang; Zhang, Xian; Wang, Xinzi; Liu, Yi; Li, Guanghe; Qu, Jiuhui","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140445","20200623","","Elsevier; PMC; WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2563,""

"Enfermement carcÃ©ral, confinement socio-sanitaire et moyens dâ€™Ã©vasionDanser sa peine et au-delÃ â€¦","Abstract Jail incarceration and social confinement due to a sanitary stay-at-home law against the ongoing covid-19 pandemic are compared through the introduction of dance workshops for imprisoned women charged with long sentences, then followed by an outside performance Soul Kitchen. The whole experience, organized by a famous contemporary choreographer Angelin Preljocaj, is filmed by ValÃ©rie MÃ¼ller, producing Danser sa peine (To dance her sentence / her sorrow), nominated for an award. The sessions are planned: two hours and a half, 2 times a week, for four months, no technique required. A group of five women starts with ordinary easy functional movements, gaining in innovative and expressive qualities, spatial perceptions, feelings and interpersonal interactions, leaded by A. Preljocaj in a helpful and empathic mood. At the same time, he discovers the cooking authorization in their jail cell. The relevant results shift into a dynamic successful piece Soul Kitchen (2019) performed in town (Dance Festival in Montpellier, south of France) with dancing and cooking occurrences on stage. It makes sense, specially about self-esteem, body image and positive opinion from the audience. The womenâ€™s physical and psychological states linked with a long lack of space and sensitivityâ€¦ move to a better self-balance and feelings of well-being. In a similar state of mind, the French confined population â€“ youth to elderlyâ€“try to find different and imaginative strategies at home as moving in a restrictive area, enjoying family cookingâ€¦ through trainings provided by Internet, looking for reducing anxiety, depressive disorders and other social problems. A panel of situations goes from deleterious conflictual relationships, dramatic isolation, to funny and positive ones using creativeness to escape, facing the disruption of daily life.","Vaysse, Jocelyne; Poli, Antonella","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2020.05.002","20200519","","Elsevier; PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2566,""
"Pandemic brings accessible mental health care to rural Texas","The COVID-19 pandemic has created widespread fear and economic anxiety across Texas, and mental health experts and advocates say rural areas â€” which already had fewer providers and higher rates of suicide and drug overdoses â€” could see more severe mental health impacts than the state's urban areas. They are predicting a lingering wave of trauma and depression even after the pandemic's immediate effects recede and lockdowns lift, the Fort Worth Business Press reported June 9. â€œThere's a lot of bad things happening right now because of COVID-19,â€ said Andy Keller, president and CEO of the Texas-based Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute. â€œBut in some ways, people in rural Texas have better access to health care than they'd ever had before. All the barriers to them accessing physicians across the state have been lifted.â€ In April, Gov. Greg Abbott temporarily waived restrictions on telehealth, allowing mental health care providers and local mental health authorities to broadly expand services and collect reimbursement for online appointments more easily. The state also implemented a mental health hotline in March that offers free over-the-phone support and provides resources and information to callers who need help.","","https://doi.org/10.1002/mhw.32409","20200612","","PMC; WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2567,""
"Death anxiety in the time of COVID-19: theoretical explanations and clinical implications","The recent COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a surge in anxiety across the globe. Much of the publicâ€™s behavioural and emotional response to the virus can be understood through the framework of terror management theory, which proposes that fear of death drives much of human behaviour. In the context of the current pandemic, death anxiety, a recently proposed transdiagnostic construct, appears especially relevant. Fear of death has recently been shown to predict not only anxiety related to COVID-19, but also to play a causal role in various mental health conditions. Given this, it is argued that treatment programmes in mental health may need to broaden their focus to directly target the dread of death. Notably, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has been shown to produce significant reductions in death anxiety. As such, it is possible that complementing current treatments with specific CBT techniques addressing fears of death may ensure enhanced long-term symptom reduction. Further research is essential in order to examine whether treating death anxiety will indeed improve long-term outcomes, and prevent the emergence of future disorders in vulnerable populations. KEY LEARNING AIMS: (1).. To understand terror management theory and its theoretical explanation of death anxiety in the context of COVID-19. (2).. To understand the transdiagnostic role of death anxiety in mental health disorders. (3).. To understand current treatment approaches for directly targeting death anxiety, and the importance of doing so to improve long-term treatment outcomes.","Menzies, Rachel E.; Menzies, Ross G.","https://doi.org/10.1017/s1754470x20000215","20200611","","PMC; WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2568,""
"Psychometric Properties of a Spanish Version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale in General Population of Lima, Peru","The current pandemic of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 has increased the anxiety and fear experienced by many. The main objective of this study was to analyze the psychometric properties of the Spanish-translated version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) using a sample of population in Peru. This is a cross-sectional instrumental study. Data were collected by a convenience sampling method, resulting in a total of 832 participants, and the collection took place over 1 week, April 17â€“23, 2020. The original version of the FCV-19S was translated from English into Spanish. The results support a bifactor model consisting of one general factor and two specific factorsâ€”one of emotional fear reactions and another of somatic expressions of fear of COVID-19 (CFI = 0.988, RMSEA = 0.075). Invariance between healthcare workers and age groups was reached (<U+0394>CFI < 0.01), but the invariance between men and women was not met (<U+0394>CFI = 0.02). Convergent validity was found with depressive, anxious, and posttraumatic stress symptoms. The general factor of the fear of COVID-19 and two specific factors had an optimal level of internal consistency (<U+03C9> > 0.89 and a > 0.83). The study found the Spanish-translated version of the FCV-19S has good psychometric properties and presents evidence of validity and reliability.

"Socioeconomic marginalization and opioid-related overdose: A systematic review","BACKGROUND: Socioeconomic marginalization (SEM) is an important but under-explored determinant of opioid overdose with important implications for health equity and associated public policy initiatives. This systematic review synthesizes evidence on the role of SEM in both fatal and non-fatal overdose among people who use opioids. METHODS: Studies published between January 1, 2000 and March 31, 2018 were identified through searching electronic databases, citations, and by contacting experts. The titles, abstracts, citation information, and descriptor terms of citations were screened by two team members. Data were synthesized using the lumping technique. RESULTS: A total of 37 studies met inclusion criteria and were included in the review, with 34 of 37 finding a significant association between at least one socioeconomic factor and overdose. The included studies contained variables related to eight socioeconomic factors: criminal justice system involvement, income, employment, social support, health insurance, housing/homelessness, education, and composite measures of socio-economic status. Most studies found associations in the hypothesized direction, whereby increased SEM was associated with a higher rate or increased likelihood of the overdose outcome measured. The review revealed an underdeveloped evidence base. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly all reviewed studies found a connection between a socioeconomic variable and overdose, but more research is needed with an explicit focus on SEM, using robust and nuanced measures that capture multiple dimensions of disadvantage, and collect data over time to better inform decision making around opioid overdose.","van Draanen, Jenna; Tsang, Christie; Mitra, Sanjana; Karamouzian, Mohammad; Richardson, Lindsey","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108127","20200620","","Elsevier; PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-08","",2571,""
