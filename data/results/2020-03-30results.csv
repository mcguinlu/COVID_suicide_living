"High occurrence of transportation and logistics occupations among vascular dementia patients an observational study","BackgroundGrowing evidence suggests a role of occupation in the emergence and manifestation of dementia. Occupations are often defined by complexity level, although working environments and activities differ in several other important ways. We aimed to capture the multi-faceted nature of occupation through its measurement as a qualitative instead of a quantitative variable and explored its relationship with different types of dementia.MethodsWe collected occupational information of 2121 dementia patients with various suspected etiologies from the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort age M67, SD8 57 male MMSE M21, SD5. Our final sample included individuals with Alzheimers disease AD dementia n1467, frontotemporal dementia n281, vascular dementia n98, Lewy body disease n174, and progressive supranuclear palsy/corticobasal degeneration n101. Within the AD group, we used neuropsychological data to further characterize patients by clinical phenotypes. All participants were categorized into 1 of 11 occupational classes, across which we evaluated the distribution of dementia subtypes with Chi2 analyses. We gained further insight into occupation-dementia relationships through post hoc logistic regressions that included various demographic and health characteristics as explanatory variables.ResultsThere were significant differences in the distribution of dementia types across occupation groups Chi285.87, p.001. Vascular dementia was relatively common in the Transportation/Logistics sector, and higher vascular risk factors partly explained this relationship. AD occurred less in Transportation/Logistics and more in Health Care/Welfare occupations, which related to a higher/lower percentage of males. We found no relationships between occupational classes and clinical phenotypes of AD Chi253.65, n.s..ConclusionsRelationships between occupation and dementia seem to exist beyond the complexity level, which offers new opportunities for disease prevention and improvement of occupational health policy.","/content/10.1101/19005512v2","/content/10.1101/19005512v2.full.pdf",20200108,"Occupational and Environmental Health","van Loenhoud","/highwire/citation/71061/bibtext",1,"090120-1","09/01/2020",71061

"A Computational Approach for Exploring Herbal Inhibitors of Acetylcholinesterase in Alzheimers Disease","Alzheimers disease AD is the most common type of age related dementia. Many hypotheses shed light on several reasons that lead to AD development. The cholinergic hypothesis describes that destruction of an essential neurotransmitter, acetylcholine by acetylcholinesterase AChE enzyme, leads to the AD onset. The hydrolysis of acetylcholine by excess amount of AChE decreases the amount of acetylcholine in the brain, thus interfering with the normal brain functions. Many anti- AChE agents can be used to treat AD by targeting AChE. In our stud,y 14 anti- AChE agents from plants 1,8-cineol, berberine, carvacrol, cheilanthifoline, coptisine, estragole, harmaline, harmine, liriodenine, myrtenal, naringenin, protopine, scoulerine, stylopine were tested against AChE and compared with two controls donepezil and galantamine, using different techniques of molecular docking. Molecular docking study was conducted for all the 14 selected ligands against AChE to identify the best three ligands among them. To determine the safety and efficacy of the three best ligands, a set of tests the druglikeness property test, ADME/T test, PASS & P450 site of metabolism prediction, pharmacophore mapping and modelling and DFT calculations were performed. In our experiment, berberine, coptisine and naringenin were determined as the three ligands from the docking study. Further analysis of these 3 ligands showed coptisine as the most potent anti-AChE agent. The molecular dynamics simulation study showed quite results for the coptisine- AChE docked comple.x Administration of berberine, coptisine and naringenin could be potential treatments for AD.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.04.20016535v1","/content/10.1101/2020.01.04.20016535v1.full.pdf",20200110,"Pharmacology and Therapeutics","Sarkar","/highwire/citation/71085/bibtext",23,"110120-23","11/01/2020",71085
"Psychiatric symptoms and syndromes transcending diagnostic boundaries in Indian multiplex families The cohort of the Accelerator program for Discovery in Brain disorders using Stem cells ADBS","Accelerator program for discovery in brain disorders using stem cells ADBS is an ongoing longitudinal study investigating the neurobiological aspects of five psychiatric disorders Alzheimers dementia, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, substance use disorder or schizophrenia in India. The study uses several techniques brain-imaging, psychophysics, neuropsycholog,y next-generation sequencing, cellular models, and in-depth clinical assessments in a longitudinal cohort from multiple-affected families. This article explores the frequency of manifestations of different psychiatric symptoms and syndromes in the participants and their relatives from the first wave of this study August 2016 to October 2019. We screened 3,583 families and enrolled 481 families 1406 participants 773 affected with any of the 5 disorders, and 633 relatives. The participants had a high familial prevalence with nearly a third of FDRs affected. Though similar disorders aggregated, the majority 61 of the families had dissimilar diagnoses among members. Moreover, 15 of affected participants had two or more co-occurring syndromes. Diverse cross-cutting symptoms, unrestricted to the index syndrome, were observed in participants across diagnostic categories. The pattern and extent of co-occurrence validate the need for a transdiagnostic approach.

"Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio across psychiatric diagnoses An electronic health record investigation","Objectives The main objective of this study was to compare neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, a marker of systemic inflammation, between patients diagnosed with ICD-10 psychiatric disorders and control participants.Design A cross-sectional methodology was employed to retrospectively analyse electronic health records and records derived from a national health survey. Setting A secondary mental health care service consisting of four boroughs in South London.Participants A diverse sample of 13,888 psychiatric patients extracted from South London and Maudsley electronic health records database and 3,920 control participants extracted from National Health and Nutrition Survey 2015-2016 were included in the study.Primary and secondary outcome measures Primary NLR levels in patients with mental health diagnoses, NLR between patients with different mental health diagnoses. Secondary Relationship of NLR to length of hospitalisation and to mortality.Results NLR was elevated compared to controls in patients with diagnoses including dementia, alcohol dependence, schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, depression, non-phobic anxiety disorders, and mild mental retardation p  0.05. NLR also correlated with age, antipsychotic use and hypnotic use. NLR was found to be higher in individuals of White ethnicity and lower in individuals of Black ethnicity. Elevated NLR was associated with increased mortality   0.103, p  2.9e-08 but not with hospital admissions or face-to-face contacts.Conclusions Elevated NLR may reflect a transdiagnostic pathological process occurring in a subpopulation of psychiatric patients. NLR may be useful to identify and stratify patients who could benefit from adjunctive anti-inflammatory treatment.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.07.20016790v1","/content/10.1101/2020.01.07.20016790v1.full.pdf",20200110,"Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology","Brinn","/highwire/citation/71111/bibtext",8,"110120-8","11/01/2020",71111
"A blood miRNA signature associates with sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease diagnosis and rate of progression","Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease sCJD presents as a rapidly progressive dementia which is usually fatal within six months. No blood tests are currently available for diagnosis or disease monitoring. Here, we profile blood microRNA miRNA expression in sCJD. Small RNA-sequencing of 57 sCJD patients and 50 healthy controls reveals differential expression of hsa-let-7i-5p, hsa-miR-16-5p, hsa-miR-93-5p, hsa-miR-106b-3p and hsa-let-7d-3p. Downregulation of hsa-let-7i-5p, hsa-miR-16-5p and hsa-miR-93-5p in sCJD replicates in an independent cohort using quantitative PCR, with concomitant upregulation of four of their mRNA targets. This miRNA signature discriminates patients with sCJD from Alzheimers disease patients. Finall,y longitudinal monitoring of 15 sCJD patients shows that the rate of decline in miRNA expression significantly correlates with rate of disease progression. These findings highlight novel molecular alterations in human prion disease outside the central nervous system which can provide information about diagnosis, disease progression, and improve mechanistic understanding of sCJD.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.08.19015214v1","/content/10.1101/2020.01.08.19015214v1.full.pdf",20200110,"Neurology","Norsworthy","/highwire/citation/71077/bibtext",28,"110120-28","11/01/2020",71077
"Cerebrospinal fluid p-tau217 performs better than p-tau181 as a biomarker of Alzheimerrs disease","Cerebrospinal fluid CSF p-tau181 tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 is an established biomarker of Alzheimerrs disease AD reflecting abnormal tau metabolism in the brain. Tau can be phosphorylated at multiple other sites including threonine 217, and here we investigated the performance of CSF p-tau217 as a biomarker of AD in comparison to p-tau181. In the Swedish BioFINDER cohort n194, p-tau217 had stronger correlations with the tau PET tracer 18Fflortaucipir, and more accurately identified individuals with abnormally increased 18Fflortaucipir retention. Furthermore, longitudinal increases in p-tau217 were higher compared to p-tau181 and better correlated with 18Fflortaucipir retention. P-tau217 correlated better than p-tau181 with PET measures of neocortical amyloid- burden and more accurately distinguished AD dementia from non-AD neurodegenerative disorders. Higher correlations between p-tau217 and 18Fflortaucipir were corroborated in an independent EXPEDITION3 trial cohort n32. These findings suggest that p-tau217 might be more useful than p-tau181 in the diagnostic work up of AD.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.15.20017236v1","/content/10.1101/2020.01.15.20017236v1.full.pdf",20200116,"Neurology","Janelidze","/highwire/citation/71240/bibtext",12,"170120-12","17/01/2020",71240
"Classification and prediction of frontotemporal dementia based on plasma microRNAs","Frontotemporal dementia FTD is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder characterized by frontal and temporal lobe atroph,y typically manifesting with behavioural or language impairment. Because of its heterogeneity and lack of available diagnostic laboratory tests there can be a substantial delay in diagnosis. Cell-free, circulating, microRNAs are increasingly investigated as biomarkers for neurodegeneration, but their value in FTD is not yet established.  In this stud,y we investigate microRNAs as biomarkers for FTD diagnosis. We performed next generation small RNA sequencing on cell-free plasma from 52 FTD cases and 21 controls.  The analysis revealed the diagnostic importance of 20 circulating endogenous miRNAs in distinguishing FTD cases from controls. The study was repeated in an independent second cohort of 117 FTD cases and 35 controls. The combinatorial microRNA signature from the first cohort, precisely diagnosed FTD samples in a second cohort. To further increase the generalizability of the prediction, we implemented machine learning techniques in a merged dataset of the two cohorts, which resulted in a comparable or improved classification precision with a smaller panel of miRNA classifiers. In addition, there are intriguing molecular commonalities with cell free miRNA signature in ALS, a motor neuron disease that resides on a pathological continuum with FTD. However, the signature that describes the ALS-FTD spectrum is not shared with blood miRNA profiles of patients with multiple sclerosis. Thus, microRNAs are promising FTD biomarkers that might enable earlier detection of FTD and improve accurate identification of patients for clinical trials","/content/10.1101/2020.01.22.20018408v2","/content/10.1101/2020.01.22.20018408v2.full.pdf",20200128,"Neurology","Magen","/highwire/citation/71563/bibtext",1,"290120-1","29/01/2020",71563
"Non-pharmacological management of Alzheimers disease, a qualitative study in Mauritius","IntroductionThe major form of dementia is Alzheimer disease AD. In Mauritius it was estimated in 2015 that around 10,000 persons had Alzheimer disease from Alzheimer disease International report . This represent 16 percent of the total population and it is expected to rise.  Therefore, apart from pharmacological therapies, non pharmacological treatment NPT which can improve cognitive performance such as cognitive training, occupational therap,y reminiscence therap,y are being highly investigated. Aim and objectiveTo determine the outcomes and to highlight the effective strategies in the management of Alzheimer Disease in Mauritius using NPT. Information obtained from this research will add to the current knowledge and expansion.Materials and methods The only NGO in Mauritius is Alzheimer Association, from where the persons with AD were recruited.  Non-interventional methods of qualitative study involving interviews of person with AD, lasting 30 to 45 minutes audio recorded were audio-recorded. An informed consent from the carer or patient relative prior to starting was ensured.  Both semi-structured interviews and open-ended questions were used, relating to NPT.  Thematic analysis in qualitative research, followed by coding and decoding raw data. Similar categories of data were grouped and themes emerged.ResultsIn-depth responses of the person with AD related with their experiences, perceptions, opinions, feelings, and knowledge. Qualitative study n20 emerged with 6 main themes.  Among these, dependency on family identified as an important theme.  It has also been associated as an important form of cognitive and functional engagement for person with AD.DiscussionNon-pharmacological interventions has an important role to prolong the active age of older individuals, as well as to maintain quality of life.Conclusion There is still a greater demand on the market for non pharmacological interventions and Mauritius should plan and devise national guidelines to deal with this unmet proportion of elderly so as to curb for future health equality and stability.Keywords Alzheimer disease, Non-pharmacological Treatment, Cognitive training, Occupational therap,y Elderly people","/content/10.1101/2020.01.25.20018747v1","/content/10.1101/2020.01.25.20018747v1.full.pdf",20200128,"Geriatric Medicine","Goorah","/highwire/citation/71520/bibtext",17,"290120-17","29/01/2020",71520
"Preservation of cognition in hypertension-treated South Indian rural population","Change in diet life style and increased life expectancy has led to the dramatic escalation in old age related complication like cognitive decline leading to dementia. Cardiovascular diseases CVD are huge risk factors for dementia, including Alzheimer disease AD. Hypertension is very well known to cause cognitive impairment.  Control of CVD could provide protection against dementia. Earlier in the mouse model of AD, reserpine, an antihypertensive and antipsychotic drug could elicit improvement in the working memory in AD model mice and enhance the same in normal mice. Hence, Cognitive protection in the patients on chronic antihypertensive drug which contains reserpine was evaluated. Cognition in a cohort in the South Indian rural population of hypertensive patients majority age group 50 to 70 years who have been chronically treated with a combinatorial drugadelphane/adelphane esidrexsodl by Novaritis Switzerland consisting of reserpine and hydrazine for years was compared with controls without hypertension. The cohorts were age sex socio-economic education background matched. Cognition was scored using the Tamil version of Addenbrooke Cognitive Examination-III ACEIII Tamil and Montreal Cognitive Assessment Tamil scales.  The composite ACEIII Tamil score of control and treated groups were 53.6 and   53.2 respectively. MoCAtamil scores Control 15.1 and Treated 14.7 did not show much alteration. Further the mean scores of the control and treated groups individual components of cognition in ACE, namely Attention Memory Fluency Language and visuospatial cognitive skills also did not reveal significant difference. Thus controlling blood pressure or hypertension with chronic antihypertensive medication like adelphane/adelphane esirdex reserpine containing drugs has retained normal cognition in both genders.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.28.20019125v1","/content/10.1101/2020.01.28.20019125v1.full.pdf",20200129,"Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology","Subramaniam","/highwire/citation/71597/bibtext",7,"300120-7","30/01/2020",71597
"Amyloid-beta CSF/PET discordance vs tau load 5 years later It takes two to tangle","OBJECTIVE To investigate the association between discordant amyloid-A PET and CSF biomarkers at baseline and the emergence of tau pathology 5 years later. METHODS We included 730 ADNI participants without dementia 282 cognitively normal, 448 mild cognitive impairment with baseline 18FFlorbetapir PET and CSF A42 available. Amyloid- CSF/PET status was determined at baseline using established cut-offs. Longitudinal data was available for 18Fflorbetapir A PET baseline to 4.31.9 years, CSF ptau baseline to 2.00.1 years, cognition baseline to 4.32.0 years, and 18Fflortaucipir tau PET measured 5.21.2 years after baseline to 1.60.7 years later. We used linear mixed modelling to study the association between amyloid- CSF/PET status and tau pathology measured in CSF or using PET. Additionall,y we calculated the proportion of CSF/PET- participants who during follow-up i progressed to amyloid- CSF/PET, and/or ii became tau-positive based on 18Fflortaucipir PET. RESULTS Amyloid- CSF/PET N318 participants had elevated CSF ptau levels and worse cognitive performance at baseline, while CSF/PET- N80 participants were overall similar to the CSF-/PET- N306 group. Five years after baseline, 18Fflortaucipir PET uptake in the CSF/PET- group 1.200.13 did not differ from CSF-/PET- 1.180.08, p0.69, but was substantially lower than CSF/PET 1.480.44, p0.001. Of the CSF/PET- subjects, 21/64 33 progressed to amyloid- CSF/PET, whereas only one 3, difference p0.05 became tau-positive based on 18Fflortaucipir PET. CONCLUSIONS Sufficient amyloid- load detectable by both CSF and PET is required before substantial tau deposition emerges.

"Association of the use of hearing aids with the incidence and progression of dementia A longitudinal retrospective study","Background Hearing aid usage has been linked to improvements in cognition, communication, and socialization, but the extent to which it can affect the onset and progression of dementia is unknown. This study leveraged the National Alzheimers Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set to longitudinally examine the association between the use of hearing aids and risk of progression from Mild Cognitive Impairment MCI to dementia as well as progression of dementia in hearing-impaired adults.MethodsThe sample included 977 participants aged 50 with MCI or all-cause dementia enrolled between 2005 and 2018. Participants were classified into four groups according to the definition of the duration of disease stage Group 1, 450 participants with MCI at baseline that developed dementia during follow up Group 2, 314 participants diagnosed with dementia at baseline and subsequently died during follow-up Group 3, 126 healthy participants who were later diagnosed with MCI and then dementia at follow-up Group 4, 87 participants with MCI at baseline who later converted to dementia and subsequently died during follow-up. Groups 3 and 4 were used to better capture the duration of MCI-to-dementia and dementia-to-death periods. Kaplan-Meier survival functions and survival analyses using Cox proportional hazards regression models were performed to assess the effect of hearing aid use on risk of MCI-to-dementia conversion and mortality risk in dementia participants. Sensitivity analyses were performed to control for confounding.ResultsHearing aid users with MCI showed a reduced risk of developing dementia both in Group 1 hazard ratio HR 0.56, 95CI, 0.45-0.69 false discovery rate FDR p .0001 and Group 3 HR,0.42 95CI, 0.27-0.66 FDR p .001. The mean progression rate in CDRSB was significantly higher for those who did not use hearing aids p .04. Hearing aid usage was also found to influence the progression of dementia. Hearing-aid users with dementia had a lower risk of death, both in Group 2 HR,0.75 95CI, 0.60-0.95 FDR pU2009.038 and Group 4 HR,0.53 95CI, 0.33-0.89 FDR pU2009.04.

"Exploring the potential for collaborative use of an app-based platform for n-of-1 trials among healthcare professionals that treat patients with insomnia","Background N-of-1 trials are single patient, multiple crossover, comparative effectiveness experiments. Despite their rating as level 1 evidence, they are not routinely used in clinical medicine to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments.Objective We explored the potential for implementing a mobile app-based n-of-1 trial platform for collaborative use by clinicians and patients to support data-driven decisions around the treatment of insomnia. Methods A survey assessing awareness and utilization of n-of-1 trials was administered to healthcare professionals that frequently treat patients with insomnia at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. 1M electronic health records were analyzed to evaluate evidence for a comorbid relationship between insomnia and dementia or Alzheimers disease among a patient population that may benefit from n-of-1 trials for the selection of optimal sleep treatments.  Results A total of 45 healthcare professionals completed the survey and were included in the analysis. We found that 64 of healthcare professionals surveyed had not heard of n-of-1 trials. After a brief description of these methods, 75 of healthcare professionals reported that they are likely or highly likely to use an app-based n-of-1 trial at least once in the next year if the service were free and easy to offer to their patients.  Conclusions An app-based n-of-1 trials platform might be a valuable tool for clinicians and patients to identify the best treatments for insomnia. Educational interventions that raise awareness and provide training are also likely necessary. The electronic health record EHR may help identify eligible patients.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.31.20019927v1","/content/10.1101/2020.01.31.20019927v1.full.pdf",20200203,"Health Informatics","Bobe","/highwire/citation/71739/bibtext",9,"040220-9","04/02/2020",71739

"Cognitive impairments in sporadic cerebral small vessel disease SVD a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohorts with stroke, dementia and non-clinical presentations of SVD","Background Cognitive impairment is a key clinical feature of cerebral small vessel disease SVD, but the full range of SVD-related cognitive impairments is unclear, and little is known about how they might vary across clinical and non-clinical manifestations of SVD.Methods In systematic searches of OVID MEDLINE, Embase, and PsychINFO from 1st January 1985 to 6th October 2019, we identified studies reporting cognitive test results for study participants with SVD and control participants without SVD. Using standardised group-level cognitive test data, we performed random effects meta-analyses in seven cognitive domains to test whether cognitive test scores differed between SVD and control groups. We conducted meta-regression analyses to test whether differences in age, education, or vascular risk factors between SVD and control groups, or whether different clinical manifestations of SVD e.g. stroke, cognitive impairment, or non-clinical presentations accounted for cognitive effect sizes.Findings Of 8562 studies identified, we included 69 studies from six continents, published in four languages. These studies included 3229 participants with SVD and 3679 controls. Meta-analyses demonstrated that on average, control groups outperformed SVD cohorts on cognitive tests in all cognitive domains examined executive function estimate -0.928 95CI -1.08, -0.78 processing speed -0.885 -1.17, -0.60 delayed memory -0.898 -1.10, -0.69 language -0.808 -1.01, -0.60 visuospatial ability -0.720 -0.96, -0.48 reasoning -0.634 -0.93, -0.34 and attention -0.622 -0.94, -0.31 all p0.001. Meta-regression analyses suggested that differences in years of education between SVD and control groups may account for a proportion of the differences in performance on tests of executive function, visuospatial ability and language, and that cohorts with cognitive impairments performed more poorly on tests of executive function, delayed memory and visuospatial ability than cohorts with stroke or non-clinical presentations of SVD.Interpretation Participants with SVD demonstrated poorer cognitive performance relative to control groups in all cognitive domains we examined. This effect was present for all presentations of SVD, reinforcing the need to test a range of cognitive domains in both clinical and research settings. Lower levels of education in SVD versus control participants may contribute to these effects, highlighting the need to account for educational level in the assessment of SVD-related cognitive impairment.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20020628v1","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20020628v1.full.pdf",20200211,"Neurology","Hamilton","/highwire/citation/71963/bibtext",8,"170220-8","17/02/2020",71963
"A non-APOE polygenic score for Alzheimers disease and APOE-e4 have independent associations with dementia in the Health and Retirement Study","INTRODUCTION. Alzheimers disease AD is a common and costly neurodegenerative disorder. A large proportion of risk is heritable and many genetic risk factors for AD have been identified. The cumulative genetic risk of known markers has not been benchmarked for dementia in a population-based sample.METHODS. In the United States population-based Health and Retirement Study HRS waves 1995-2014, we evaluated the role of cumulative genetic risk for AD, with and without the APOE-e4 alleles, on dementia status dementia, cognitive impairment without dementia, borderline cognitive impairment without dementia, cognitively normal. We used logistic regression, accounting for demographic covariates and genetic principal components, and analyses were stratified by European and African genetic ancestry.RESULTS. In the European ancestry sample n8399, both AD polygenic score excluding the APOE genetic region odds ratio OR1.10 95 confidence interval CI 1.00, 1.20 and the presence of any APOE-e4 alleles OR2.42 95 CI 1.99, 2.95 were associated with the odds of dementia relative to normal cognition in a mutually-adjusted model. In the African ancestry sample n1605, the presence of any APOE-e4 alleles was associated with 1.77 95 CI 1.20, 2.61 times higher odds of dementia, while the AD polygenic score excluding the APOE genetic region was not significantly associated with the odds of dementia relative to normal cognition 1.06 95 CI 0.97, 1.30.DISCUSSION. Cumulative genetic risk for AD and APOE-e4 are both independent predictors of dementia. This study provides important insight into the polygenic nature of dementia and demonstrates the utility of polygenic scores in dementia research.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021667v2","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021667v2.full.pdf",20200211,"Epidemiology","Bakulski","/highwire/citation/72013/bibtext",35,"170220-35","17/02/2020",72013
"Metabolomic changes associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration syndromes","Objective Widespread metabolic changes are seen in neurodegenerative disease and could be used as biomarkers for diagnosis and disease monitoring. They may also reveal disease mechanisms that could be a target for therapy. In this study we looked for blood-based biomarkers in syndromes associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Methods Plasma metabolomic profiles were measured from 134 patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia n30, non fluent variant primary progressive aphasia n26, progressive supranuclear palsy n45, corticobasal syndrome n33 and 32 healthy controls.Results Forty-nine of 842 metabolites were significantly altered in frontotemporal lobar degeneration after false-discovery rate correction for multiple comparisons. These were distributed across a wide range of metabolic pathways including amino acids, energy and carbohydrate, cofactor and vitamin, lipid and nucleotide pathways. The metabolomic profile supported classification between frontotemporal lobar degeneration and controls with high accuracy 88.1-96.6 while classification accuracy was lower between the frontotemporal lobar degeneration syndromes 72.1-83.3. One metabolic profile, comprising a range of different pathways, was consistently identified as a feature of each disease versus controls the degree to which a patient expressed this metabolomic profile was associated with their subsequent survival hazard ratio 0.74 0.59-0.93, p0.0018. Conclusions The metabolic changes in FTLD are promising diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Further work is required to replicate these findings, examine longitudinal change, and test their utility in differentiating between FTLD syndromes that are pathologically distinct but phenotypically similar.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021758v1","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021758v1.full.pdf",20200212,"Neurology","Murley","/highwire/citation/72030/bibtext",46,"170220-46","17/02/2020",72030
"Predicting loss of independence and mortality in frontotemporal lobar degeneration syndromes","ObjectiveTo test the hypothesis that in syndromes associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration, behavioural impairment predicts loss of functional independence and motor clinical features predict mortalit,y irrespective of syndrome subtype. MethodWe used a transdiagnostic approach to survival in an epidemiological cohort, testing the association between clinical features, independence and survival in patients with clinical diagnoses of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia n64, non-fluent variant primary progressive aphasia n36, semantic variant primary progressive aphasia n25, progressive supranuclear palsy n101 and corticobasal syndrome n68. A principal components analysis identified six dimensions of clinical features. Using Cox proportional hazards and logistic regression we identified the association between each of these dimensions and functionally independent survival time from clinical assessment to care home admission, and absolute survival time to death. Analyses adjusted for the covariates of age, gender and diagnostic group. Secondary analysis excluded specific diagnostic groups.ResultsBehavioural disturbance, including impulsivity and apath,y was associated with reduced functionally independent survival OR 2.46, p0.001, even if patients with bvFTD were removed from the analysis. Motor impairments were associated with reduced absolute survival, even if patients with PSP and CBS were removed from the analysis.ConclusionOur results may help individualised prognostication and planning of disease-modifying trials and support a transdiagnostic approach to symptomatic treatment trials in patients with clinical syndromes associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20022061v1","/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20022061v1.full.pdf",20200212,"Neurology","Murley","/highwire/citation/72045/bibtext",56,"170220-56","17/02/2020",72045
"Alzheimers disease susceptibility gene apolipoprotein e APOE and blood biomarkers in UK Biobank N395,769.","Background and objective Alzheimers disease AD is a neurodegenerative condition where the underlying aetiology is still unclear. Investigating the potential influence of apolipoprotein APOE, a major genetic risk factor, on common blood biomarkers could provide a greater understanding of the mechanisms of AD and dementia risk. Our objective was to conduct the largest to date single-protocol investigation of blood biomarkers in the context of APOE genotype, in UK Biobank.Methods After quality control and exclusions, data on 395,769 participants of White European ancestry were available for analysis. Linear regressions were used to test potential associations between APOE genotypes and biomarkers.Results Several biomarkers significantly associated with APOE e4 risk and e2 protective genotypes vs. neutral e3/e3. Most associations supported previous data for example, e4 genotype was associated with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol LDL standardized beta b  0.150 standard deviations SDs per allele, p0.001 and e2 with lower LDL b  -0.456 SDs, p0.001. There were however instances of associations found in unexpected directions e.g. e4 and increased insulin-like growth factor IGF-1 standardized beta  0.017, p0.001 where lower levels have been previously suggested as an AD risk factor. Conclusions These findings highlight biomarker differences in non-demented people at genetic risk for dementia. The evidence here in supports previous hypotheses of involvement from cardiometabolic and neuroinflammatory pathways.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20021998v1","/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20021998v1.full.pdf",20200213,"Genetic and Genomic Medicine","Ferguson","/highwire/citation/72080/bibtext",74,"170220-74","17/02/2020",72080
"SMPD1 variants do not have a major role in REM sleep behavior disorder","Mutations in the sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 1 SMPD1 gene were reported to be associated with Parkinson disease PD and dementia with Lewy bodies DLB. The majority of patients with isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder iRBD develop PD or DLB later in life, suggesting that iRBD is a prodromal phase of these two conditions. In the current study we aimed to evaluate the role of SMPD1 variants in iRBD. SMPD1 and its untranslated regions were sequenced using targeted next-generation sequencing in 959 iRBD patients and 1,287 controls from European descent. Logistic regression adjusted for sex and age showed no significant associations with two common variants and iRBD rs1050239 and rs8164. The frequency of all rare nonsynonymous SMPD1 variants minor allele frequency 1 was found to be twice as high in cases than in controls 1.46 vs. 0.70, Fishers exact test p0.09 but there was no statistically significant burden p0.64. Our study reports no statistically significant association of SMPD1 variants and iRBD.

"Is glycaemia associated with poorer brain health and risk of dementia? Cross sectional and follow-up analysis of the UK Biobank","Objective To understand the relationship across the glycaemic spectrum with incident dementia, brain structure, and cognitive decline.Research Design and Methods UK Biobank participants, aged 40-69 at recruitment. HbA1c and diabetes diagnosis define baseline glycaemic categories. Outcomes included incident vascular dementia VD, Alzheimers dementia AD, hippocampal volume HV, white matter hyperintensity WMH volume, cognitive function and decline. All results are in reference to normoglycaemic individuals HbA1c 35-42 mmol/mol. Results 210433 47, 15246 3, 3280 0.7, 20793 5 individuals had low HbA1c, pre-diabetes, undiagnosed diabetes, and known diabetes, respectively.  Pre- and known diabetes markedly increased incident VD, hazard ratios HR 1.51, 95CI1.012.25 and 1.96, 95CI1.492.58, respectivel,y less so AD 1.18, 0.921.52 and 1.13 0.95,1.33, adjusting for demographic and socioeconomic variables. For VD, multivariate adjustment, driven by antihypertensives, attenuated associations, HR 1.27, 0.841.91 and 1.45,1.071.97. Pre- and known diabetes conferred elevated risks of cognitive decline odds ratio OR 1.53, 1.022.29 and 1.49, 1.022.18, respectively. People with pre-diabetes, undiagnosed and known diabetes had higher WMH volumes 4, 30, 3, respectivel,y and lower HV 34.51 mm3, 11.73 mm3 and 61.13 mm3 respectively. People with low-normal HbA1c 35 mmol/mol had 5 lower WMH volume and 13.6 mm3 greater HV than normoglycaemic individuals.  Conclusions Pre and known diabetes increase VD risks, less so AD.  Excess VD risks were largely accounted for by treated hypertension. Hyperglycaemic states were associated with adverse, whereas low normal HbA1c was associated with favourable brain structure compared to normoglycaemic individuals. Our findings have implications for cardiovascular medication in hyperglycaemia for brain health.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024471v2","/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.20024471v2.full.pdf",20200221,"Epidemiology","Garfield","/highwire/citation/72362/bibtext",7,"230220-7","23/02/2020",72362

"Development and Evaluation of an Android-based Platform for Early MCI Detection in an Elderly Population","Background Mild cognitive impairment MCI is an intermediate stage of cognitive decline fitting in-between normal cognition and dementia. With the growing aging population, this study aimed to develop and psychometrically validate an android-based application for early MCI detection in elderly subjects.Method This study was conducted in two phases, including 1- Initial design and prototyping of the application named M-Check, 2- psychometric evaluation. After the design and development of the M-Check app, it was evaluated by experts and elderly subjects. Face validity was determined by two checklists provided to the expert panel and the elderly subjects. Convergent validity of the M-Check app was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment MoCA battery through Pearson correlation. Test-retest and internal consistency and reliability were evaluated using Intra-Class Correlation ICC and Kuder-Richardson coefficients, respectively. In addition, the usability was assessed by a System Usability Scale SUS questionnaire. SPSS 16.0 was employed to analyze the data.Result The apps usability assessment by elderlies and experts scored 77.11 and 82.5, respectively. Also, the correlation showed that the M-Check app was negatively correlated with the MoCA test r  -0.71, p 0.005, and the ICC was more than 0.7. Moreover, the Richardsons Coder coefficient was 0.82, corresponding to an acceptable reliability. Conclusion In this stud,y we validated the M-Check app for the detection of MCI based on the growing need for cognitive assessment tools that can identify early decline. Such screeners are expected to take much shorter time than typical neuropsychological batteries do. Additional work are yet to be underway to ensure that M-Check is ready to launch and used without the presence of a trained person.","/content/10.1101/2020.03.16.20037028v1","/content/10.1101/2020.03.16.20037028v1.full.pdf",20200320,"Health Informatics","Roozrokh Arshadi Montazer","/highwire/citation/73870/bibtext",31,"250320-31","25-03-2020",73870
"Differential transcript usage unravels transcriptional alterations in Alzheimers disease human brains","Alzheimers disease AD is the leading cause of dementia in aging individuals. However pathophysiological processes involved in the brain are still poorly understood. Among numerous strategies, a comprehensive overview of gene expression alterations in the diseased brain has been proposed to help for a better knowledge of the disease processes. In this work, we compared the differential expression of genes in different regions temporal and frontal lobes of the brain of healthy and AD adult subjects using data from three large studies MAYO Clinic Mount Sinai Brain Bank MSBB and ROSMAP. We show that gene expression is dramatically altered in the temporal lobe TL, but not in the frontal lobe FL, suggesting regional specificities in transcriptional alterations. Moreover, we show that a large set of genes undetected in the classical differential expression DEG analysis show alterations in the transcript usage ratio in AD, i.e. differential isoform fractions. Interestingl,y the number of genes with differential transcript usage gDTUs is highest at advanced Braak stages and correlates with altered expression of genes associated with the splicing machinery. Using single-cell RNA sequencing scRNAseq data, we further assigned DEGs and gDTUs to individual cell types of the adult brain and observed similar signatures per cell type as to other two scRNAseq studies in AD. Lastl,y we show that 52 out of 116 genes located in the loci associated with AD risk and expressed in the adult human brain present DEG and/or gDTUs in the TL, whereas only 13 are altered in the FL of AD patients. Among those altered genes, we detect an increased expression of APP isoforms containing the Kunitz protease inhibitor KPI domain, which is associated with plaque deposition. Altogether, our work proposes a novel integrative strategy to analyze transcriptional data in AD based on both gene/transcript expression and cell-type specificities.","/content/10.1101/2020.03.19.20038703v1","/content/10.1101/2020.03.19.20038703v1.full.pdf",20200324,"Neurology","Coelho","/highwire/citation/74204/bibtext",199,"250320-199","25-03-2020",74204
"High occurrence of transportation and logistics occupations among vascular dementia patients an observational study","BackgroundGrowing evidence suggests a role of occupation in the emergence and manifestation of dementia. Occupations are often defined by complexity level, although working environments and activities differ in several other important ways. We aimed to capture the multi-faceted nature of occupation through its measurement as a qualitative instead of a quantitative variable and explored its relationship with different types of dementia.MethodsWe collected occupational information of 2121 dementia patients with various suspected etiologies from the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort age M67, SD8 57 male MMSE M21, SD5. Our final sample included individuals with Alzheimers disease AD dementia n1467, frontotemporal dementia n281, vascular dementia n98, Lewy body disease n174, and progressive supranuclear palsy/corticobasal degeneration n101. Within the AD group, we used neuropsychological data to further characterize patients by clinical phenotypes. All participants were categorized into 1 of 11 occupational classes, across which we evaluated the distribution of dementia subtypes with Chi2 analyses. We gained further insight into occupation-dementia relationships through post hoc logistic regressions that included various demographic and health characteristics as explanatory variables.ResultsThere were significant differences in the distribution of dementia types across occupation groups Chi285.87, p.001. Vascular dementia was relatively common in the Transportation/Logistics sector, and higher vascular risk factors partly explained this relationship. AD occurred less in Transportation/Logistics and more in Health Care/Welfare occupations, which related to a higher/lower percentage of males. We found no relationships between occupational classes and clinical phenotypes of AD Chi253.65, n.s..ConclusionsRelationships between occupation and dementia seem to exist beyond the complexity level, which offers new opportunities for disease prevention and improvement of occupational health policy.","/content/10.1101/19005512v2","/content/10.1101/19005512v2.full.pdf",20200108,"Occupational and Environmental Health","van Loenhoud","/highwire/citation/71061/bibtext",1,"090120-1","09/01/2020",71061

"A Computational Approach for Exploring Herbal Inhibitors of Acetylcholinesterase in Alzheimers Disease","Alzheimers disease AD is the most common type of age related dementia. Many hypotheses shed light on several reasons that lead to AD development. The cholinergic hypothesis describes that destruction of an essential neurotransmitter, acetylcholine by acetylcholinesterase AChE enzyme, leads to the AD onset. The hydrolysis of acetylcholine by excess amount of AChE decreases the amount of acetylcholine in the brain, thus interfering with the normal brain functions. Many anti- AChE agents can be used to treat AD by targeting AChE. In our stud,y 14 anti- AChE agents from plants 1,8-cineol, berberine, carvacrol, cheilanthifoline, coptisine, estragole, harmaline, harmine, liriodenine, myrtenal, naringenin, protopine, scoulerine, stylopine were tested against AChE and compared with two controls donepezil and galantamine, using different techniques of molecular docking. Molecular docking study was conducted for all the 14 selected ligands against AChE to identify the best three ligands among them. To determine the safety and efficacy of the three best ligands, a set of tests the druglikeness property test, ADME/T test, PASS & P450 site of metabolism prediction, pharmacophore mapping and modelling and DFT calculations were performed. In our experiment, berberine, coptisine and naringenin were determined as the three ligands from the docking study. Further analysis of these 3 ligands showed coptisine as the most potent anti-AChE agent. The molecular dynamics simulation study showed quite results for the coptisine- AChE docked comple.x Administration of berberine, coptisine and naringenin could be potential treatments for AD.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.04.20016535v1","/content/10.1101/2020.01.04.20016535v1.full.pdf",20200110,"Pharmacology and Therapeutics","Sarkar","/highwire/citation/71085/bibtext",23,"110120-23","11/01/2020",71085

Secondary Relationship of NLR to length of hospitalisation and to mortality.Results NLR was elevated compared to controls in patients with diagnoses including dementia, alcohol dependence, schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, depression, non-phobic anxiety disorders, and mild mental retardation p  0.05. NLR also correlated with age, antipsychotic use and hypnotic use. NLR was found to be higher in individuals of White ethnicity and lower in individuals of Black ethnicity. Elevated NLR was associated with increased mortality   0.103, p  2.9e-08 but not with hospital admissions or face-to-face contacts.Conclusions Elevated NLR may reflect a transdiagnostic pathological process occurring in a subpopulation of psychiatric patients.

"A blood miRNA signature associates with sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease diagnosis and rate of progression","Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease sCJD presents as a rapidly progressive dementia which is usually fatal within six months. No blood tests are currently available for diagnosis or disease monitoring. Here, we profile blood microRNA miRNA expression in sCJD. Small RNA-sequencing of 57 sCJD patients and 50 healthy controls reveals differential expression of hsa-let-7i-5p, hsa-miR-16-5p, hsa-miR-93-5p, hsa-miR-106b-3p and hsa-let-7d-3p. Downregulation of hsa-let-7i-5p, hsa-miR-16-5p and hsa-miR-93-5p in sCJD replicates in an independent cohort using quantitative PCR, with concomitant upregulation of four of their mRNA targets. This miRNA signature discriminates patients with sCJD from Alzheimers disease patients. Finall,y longitudinal monitoring of 15 sCJD patients shows that the rate of decline in miRNA expression significantly correlates with rate of disease progression.

Tau can be phosphorylated at multiple other sites including threonine 217, and here we investigated the performance of CSF p-tau217 as a biomarker of AD in comparison to p-tau181. In the Swedish BioFINDER cohort n194, p-tau217 had stronger correlations with the tau PET tracer 18Fflortaucipir, and more accurately identified individuals with abnormally increased 18Fflortaucipir retention. Furthermore, longitudinal increases in p-tau217 were higher compared to p-tau181 and better correlated with 18Fflortaucipir retention. P-tau217 correlated better than p-tau181 with PET measures of neocortical amyloid- burden and more accurately distinguished AD dementia from non-AD neurodegenerative disorders. Higher correlations between p-tau217 and 18Fflortaucipir were corroborated in an independent EXPEDITION3 trial cohort n32.

"Classification and prediction of frontotemporal dementia based on plasma microRNAs","Frontotemporal dementia FTD is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder characterized by frontal and temporal lobe atroph,y typically manifesting with behavioural or language impairment. Because of its heterogeneity and lack of available diagnostic laboratory tests there can be a substantial delay in diagnosis. Cell-free, circulating, microRNAs are increasingly investigated as biomarkers for neurodegeneration, but their value in FTD is not yet established.  In this stud,y we investigate microRNAs as biomarkers for FTD diagnosis. We performed next generation small RNA sequencing on cell-free plasma from 52 FTD cases and 21 controls.  The analysis revealed the diagnostic importance of 20 circulating endogenous miRNAs in distinguishing FTD cases from controls. The study was repeated in an independent second cohort of 117 FTD cases and 35 controls. The combinatorial microRNA signature from the first cohort, precisely diagnosed FTD samples in a second cohort. To further increase the generalizability of the prediction, we implemented machine learning techniques in a merged dataset of the two cohorts, which resulted in a comparable or improved classification precision with a smaller panel of miRNA classifiers. In addition, there are intriguing molecular commonalities with cell free miRNA signature in ALS, a motor neuron disease that resides on a pathological continuum with FTD. However, the signature that describes the ALS-FTD spectrum is not shared with blood miRNA profiles of patients with multiple sclerosis. Thus, microRNAs are promising FTD biomarkers that might enable earlier detection of FTD and improve accurate identification of patients for clinical trials","/content/10.1101/2020.01.22.20018408v2","/content/10.1101/2020.01.22.20018408v2.full.pdf",20200128,"Neurology","Magen","/highwire/citation/71563/bibtext",1,"290120-1","29/01/2020",71563

Aim and objectiveTo determine the outcomes and to highlight the effective strategies in the management of Alzheimer Disease in Mauritius using NPT. Information obtained from this research will add to the current knowledge and expansion.Materials and methods The only NGO in Mauritius is Alzheimer Association, from where the persons with AD were recruited.  Non-interventional methods of qualitative study involving interviews of person with AD, lasting 30 to 45 minutes audio recorded were audio-recorded. An informed consent from the carer or patient relative prior to starting was ensured.  Both semi-structured interviews and open-ended questions were used, relating to NPT.  Thematic analysis in qualitative research, followed by coding and decoding raw data. Similar categories of data were grouped and themes emerged.ResultsIn-depth responses of the person with AD related with their experiences, perceptions, opinions, feelings, and knowledge. Qualitative study n20 emerged with 6 main themes.  Among these, dependency on family identified as an important theme.  It has also been associated as an important form of cognitive and functional engagement for person with AD.DiscussionNon-pharmacological interventions has an important role to prolong the active age of older individuals, as well as to maintain quality of life.Conclusion There is still a greater demand on the market for non pharmacological interventions and Mauritius should plan and devise national guidelines to deal with this unmet proportion of elderly so as to curb for future health equality and stability.Keywords Alzheimer disease, Non-pharmacological Treatment, Cognitive training, Occupational therap,y Elderly people","/content/10.1101/2020.01.25.20018747v1","/content/10.1101/2020.01.25.20018747v1.full.pdf",20200128,"Geriatric Medicine","Goorah","/highwire/citation/71520/bibtext",17,"290120-17","29/01/2020",71520
"Preservation of cognition in hypertension-treated South Indian rural population","Change in diet life style and increased life expectancy has led to the dramatic escalation in old age related complication like cognitive decline leading to dementia. Cardiovascular diseases CVD are huge risk factors for dementia, including Alzheimer disease AD. Hypertension is very well known to cause cognitive impairment.  Control of CVD could provide protection against dementia. Earlier in the mouse model of AD, reserpine, an antihypertensive and antipsychotic drug could elicit improvement in the working memory in AD model mice and enhance the same in normal mice. Hence, Cognitive protection in the patients on chronic antihypertensive drug which contains reserpine was evaluated. Cognition in a cohort in the South Indian rural population of hypertensive patients majority age group 50 to 70 years who have been chronically treated with a combinatorial drugadelphane/adelphane esidrexsodl by Novaritis Switzerland consisting of reserpine and hydrazine for years was compared with controls without hypertension. The cohorts were age sex socio-economic education background matched. Cognition was scored using the Tamil version of Addenbrooke Cognitive Examination-III ACEIII Tamil and Montreal Cognitive Assessment Tamil scales.  The composite ACEIII Tamil score of control and treated groups were 53.6 and   53.2 respectively. MoCAtamil scores Control 15.1 and Treated 14.7 did not show much alteration. Further the mean scores of the control and treated groups individual components of cognition in ACE, namely Attention Memory Fluency Language and visuospatial cognitive skills also did not reveal significant difference. Thus controlling blood pressure or hypertension with chronic antihypertensive medication like adelphane/adelphane esirdex reserpine containing drugs has retained normal cognition in both genders.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.28.20019125v1","/content/10.1101/2020.01.28.20019125v1.full.pdf",20200129,"Psychiatry and Clinical Psychology","Subramaniam","/highwire/citation/71597/bibtext",7,"300120-7","30/01/2020",71597
"Amyloid-beta CSF/PET discordance vs tau load 5 years later It takes two to tangle","OBJECTIVE To investigate the association between discordant amyloid-A PET and CSF biomarkers at baseline and the emergence of tau pathology 5 years later. METHODS We included 730 ADNI participants without dementia 282 cognitively normal, 448 mild cognitive impairment with baseline 18FFlorbetapir PET and CSF A42 available. Amyloid- CSF/PET status was determined at baseline using established cut-offs. Longitudinal data was available for 18Fflorbetapir A PET baseline to 4.31.9 years, CSF ptau baseline to 2.00.1 years, cognition baseline to 4.32.0 years, and 18Fflortaucipir tau PET measured 5.21.2 years after baseline to 1.60.7 years later. We used linear mixed modelling to study the association between amyloid- CSF/PET status and tau pathology measured in CSF or using PET. Additionall,y we calculated the proportion of CSF/PET- participants who during follow-up i progressed to amyloid- CSF/PET, and/or ii became tau-positive based on 18Fflortaucipir PET. RESULTS Amyloid- CSF/PET N318 participants had elevated CSF ptau levels and worse cognitive performance at baseline, while CSF/PET- N80 participants were overall similar to the CSF-/PET- N306 group. Five years after baseline, 18Fflortaucipir PET uptake in the CSF/PET- group 1.200.13 did not differ from CSF-/PET- 1.180.08, p0.69, but was substantially lower than CSF/PET 1.480.44, p0.001. Of the CSF/PET- subjects, 21/64 33 progressed to amyloid- CSF/PET, whereas only one 3, difference p0.05 became tau-positive based on 18Fflortaucipir PET. CONCLUSIONS Sufficient amyloid- load detectable by both CSF and PET is required before substantial tau deposition emerges. Compared to participants with abnormal amyloid- levels on PET and CSF, the CSF/PET- group has a distinctly better prognosis.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.29.20019539v1","/content/10.1101/2020.01.29.20019539v1.full.pdf",20200203,"Neurology","Reimand","/highwire/citation/71681/bibtext",26,"040220-26","04/02/2020",71681
"Association of the use of hearing aids with the incidence and progression of dementia A longitudinal retrospective study","Background Hearing aid usage has been linked to improvements in cognition, communication, and socialization, but the extent to which it can affect the onset and progression of dementia is unknown. This study leveraged the National Alzheimers Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set to longitudinally examine the association between the use of hearing aids and risk of progression from Mild Cognitive Impairment MCI to dementia as well as progression of dementia in hearing-impaired adults.MethodsThe sample included 977 participants aged 50 with MCI or all-cause dementia enrolled between 2005 and 2018. Participants were classified into four groups according to the definition of the duration of disease stage Group 1, 450 participants with MCI at baseline that developed dementia during follow up Group 2, 314 participants diagnosed with dementia at baseline and subsequently died during follow-up Group 3, 126 healthy participants who were later diagnosed with MCI and then dementia at follow-up Group 4, 87 participants with MCI at baseline who later converted to dementia and subsequently died during follow-up. Groups 3 and 4 were used to better capture the duration of MCI-to-dementia and dementia-to-death periods. Kaplan-Meier survival functions and survival analyses using Cox proportional hazards regression models were performed to assess the effect of hearing aid use on risk of MCI-to-dementia conversion and mortality risk in dementia participants. Sensitivity analyses were performed to control for confounding.ResultsHearing aid users with MCI showed a reduced risk of developing dementia both in Group 1 hazard ratio HR 0.56, 95CI, 0.45-0.69 false discovery rate FDR p .0001 and Group 3 HR,0.42 95CI, 0.27-0.66 FDR p .001. The mean progression rate in CDRSB was significantly higher for those who did not use hearing aids p .04. Hearing aid usage was also found to influence the progression of dementia. Hearing-aid users with dementia had a lower risk of death, both in Group 2 HR,0.75 95CI, 0.60-0.95 FDR pU2009.038 and Group 4 HR,0.53 95CI, 0.33-0.89 FDR pU2009.04.

"Exploring the potential for collaborative use of an app-based platform for n-of-1 trials among healthcare professionals that treat patients with insomnia","Background N-of-1 trials are single patient, multiple crossover, comparative effectiveness experiments. Despite their rating as level 1 evidence, they are not routinely used in clinical medicine to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments.Objective We explored the potential for implementing a mobile app-based n-of-1 trial platform for collaborative use by clinicians and patients to support data-driven decisions around the treatment of insomnia. Methods A survey assessing awareness and utilization of n-of-1 trials was administered to healthcare professionals that frequently treat patients with insomnia at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. 1M electronic health records were analyzed to evaluate evidence for a comorbid relationship between insomnia and dementia or Alzheimers disease among a patient population that may benefit from n-of-1 trials for the selection of optimal sleep treatments.  Results A total of 45 healthcare professionals completed the survey and were included in the analysis. We found that 64 of healthcare professionals surveyed had not heard of n-of-1 trials. After a brief description of these methods, 75 of healthcare professionals reported that they are likely or highly likely to use an app-based n-of-1 trial at least once in the next year if the service were free and easy to offer to their patients.  Conclusions An app-based n-of-1 trials platform might be a valuable tool for clinicians and patients to identify the best treatments for insomnia. Educational interventions that raise awareness and provide training are also likely necessary. The electronic health record EHR may help identify eligible patients.","/content/10.1101/2020.01.31.20019927v1","/content/10.1101/2020.01.31.20019927v1.full.pdf",20200203,"Health Informatics","Bobe","/highwire/citation/71739/bibtext",9,"040220-9","04/02/2020",71739
"The Cognitive-Functional Composite is sensitive to clinical progression in early dementia longitudinal findings from the Catch-Cog study cohort","Introduction In an attempt to capture clinically meaningful cognitive decline in early dementia, we developed the Cognitive-Functional Composite CFC. We investigated the CFCs sensitivity to decline in comparison to traditional clinical endpoints.Methods This longitudinal construct validation study included 148 participants with subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia. The CFC and traditional tests were administered at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months. Sensitivity to change was investigated using linear mixed models and R2 effect-sizes. Results CFC scores declined over time -.16,pt.001, with steepest decline observed in mild Alzheimers dementia -.25,pt.001. The CFC showed medium-to-large effect-sizes at succeeding follow-up points R2.08-.42, exhibiting greater change than the Clinical Dementia Rating scale R2.02-.12.

"Cognitive impairments in sporadic cerebral small vessel disease SVD a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohorts with stroke, dementia and non-clinical presentations of SVD","Background Cognitive impairment is a key clinical feature of cerebral small vessel disease SVD, but the full range of SVD-related cognitive impairments is unclear, and little is known about how they might vary across clinical and non-clinical manifestations of SVD.Methods In systematic searches of OVID MEDLINE, Embase, and PsychINFO from 1st January 1985 to 6th October 2019, we identified studies reporting cognitive test results for study participants with SVD and control participants without SVD. Using standardised group-level cognitive test data, we performed random effects meta-analyses in seven cognitive domains to test whether cognitive test scores differed between SVD and control groups. We conducted meta-regression analyses to test whether differences in age, education, or vascular risk factors between SVD and control groups, or whether different clinical manifestations of SVD e.g. stroke, cognitive impairment, or non-clinical presentations accounted for cognitive effect sizes.Findings Of 8562 studies identified, we included 69 studies from six continents, published in four languages. These studies included 3229 participants with SVD and 3679 controls. Meta-analyses demonstrated that on average, control groups outperformed SVD cohorts on cognitive tests in all cognitive domains examined executive function estimate -0.928 95CI -1.08, -0.78 processing speed -0.885 -1.17, -0.60 delayed memory -0.898 -1.10, -0.69 language -0.808 -1.01, -0.60 visuospatial ability -0.720 -0.96, -0.48 reasoning -0.634 -0.93, -0.34 and attention -0.622 -0.94, -0.31 all p0.001. Meta-regression analyses suggested that differences in years of education between SVD and control groups may account for a proportion of the differences in performance on tests of executive function, visuospatial ability and language, and that cohorts with cognitive impairments performed more poorly on tests of executive function, delayed memory and visuospatial ability than cohorts with stroke or non-clinical presentations of SVD.Interpretation Participants with SVD demonstrated poorer cognitive performance relative to control groups in all cognitive domains we examined. This effect was present for all presentations of SVD, reinforcing the need to test a range of cognitive domains in both clinical and research settings. Lower levels of education in SVD versus control participants may contribute to these effects, highlighting the need to account for educational level in the assessment of SVD-related cognitive impairment.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20020628v1","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20020628v1.full.pdf",20200211,"Neurology","Hamilton","/highwire/citation/71963/bibtext",8,"170220-8","17/02/2020",71963
"A non-APOE polygenic score for Alzheimers disease and APOE-e4 have independent associations with dementia in the Health and Retirement Study","INTRODUCTION. Alzheimers disease AD is a common and costly neurodegenerative disorder. A large proportion of risk is heritable and many genetic risk factors for AD have been identified. The cumulative genetic risk of known markers has not been benchmarked for dementia in a population-based sample.METHODS. In the United States population-based Health and Retirement Study HRS waves 1995-2014, we evaluated the role of cumulative genetic risk for AD, with and without the APOE-e4 alleles, on dementia status dementia, cognitive impairment without dementia, borderline cognitive impairment without dementia, cognitively normal. We used logistic regression, accounting for demographic covariates and genetic principal components, and analyses were stratified by European and African genetic ancestry.RESULTS. In the European ancestry sample n8399, both AD polygenic score excluding the APOE genetic region odds ratio OR1.10 95 confidence interval CI 1.00, 1.20 and the presence of any APOE-e4 alleles OR2.42 95 CI 1.99, 2.95 were associated with the odds of dementia relative to normal cognition in a mutually-adjusted model. In the African ancestry sample n1605, the presence of any APOE-e4 alleles was associated with 1.77 95 CI 1.20, 2.61 times higher odds of dementia, while the AD polygenic score excluding the APOE genetic region was not significantly associated with the odds of dementia relative to normal cognition 1.06 95 CI 0.97, 1.30.DISCUSSION. Cumulative genetic risk for AD and APOE-e4 are both independent predictors of dementia. This study provides important insight into the polygenic nature of dementia and demonstrates the utility of polygenic scores in dementia research.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021667v2","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021667v2.full.pdf",20200211,"Epidemiology","Bakulski","/highwire/citation/72013/bibtext",35,"170220-35","17/02/2020",72013
"Metabolomic changes associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration syndromes","Objective Widespread metabolic changes are seen in neurodegenerative disease and could be used as biomarkers for diagnosis and disease monitoring. They may also reveal disease mechanisms that could be a target for therapy. In this study we looked for blood-based biomarkers in syndromes associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Methods Plasma metabolomic profiles were measured from 134 patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia n30, non fluent variant primary progressive aphasia n26, progressive supranuclear palsy n45, corticobasal syndrome n33 and 32 healthy controls.Results Forty-nine of 842 metabolites were significantly altered in frontotemporal lobar degeneration after false-discovery rate correction for multiple comparisons. These were distributed across a wide range of metabolic pathways including amino acids, energy and carbohydrate, cofactor and vitamin, lipid and nucleotide pathways. The metabolomic profile supported classification between frontotemporal lobar degeneration and controls with high accuracy 88.1-96.6 while classification accuracy was lower between the frontotemporal lobar degeneration syndromes 72.1-83.3. One metabolic profile, comprising a range of different pathways, was consistently identified as a feature of each disease versus controls the degree to which a patient expressed this metabolomic profile was associated with their subsequent survival hazard ratio 0.74 0.59-0.93, p0.0018. Conclusions The metabolic changes in FTLD are promising diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Further work is required to replicate these findings, examine longitudinal change, and test their utility in differentiating between FTLD syndromes that are pathologically distinct but phenotypically similar.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021758v1","/content/10.1101/2020.02.10.20021758v1.full.pdf",20200212,"Neurology","Murley","/highwire/citation/72030/bibtext",46,"170220-46","17/02/2020",72030
"Predicting loss of independence and mortality in frontotemporal lobar degeneration syndromes","ObjectiveTo test the hypothesis that in syndromes associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration, behavioural impairment predicts loss of functional independence and motor clinical features predict mortalit,y irrespective of syndrome subtype. MethodWe used a transdiagnostic approach to survival in an epidemiological cohort, testing the association between clinical features, independence and survival in patients with clinical diagnoses of behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia n64, non-fluent variant primary progressive aphasia n36, semantic variant primary progressive aphasia n25, progressive supranuclear palsy n101 and corticobasal syndrome n68. A principal components analysis identified six dimensions of clinical features. Using Cox proportional hazards and logistic regression we identified the association between each of these dimensions and functionally independent survival time from clinical assessment to care home admission, and absolute survival time to death. Analyses adjusted for the covariates of age, gender and diagnostic group. Secondary analysis excluded specific diagnostic groups.ResultsBehavioural disturbance, including impulsivity and apath,y was associated with reduced functionally independent survival OR 2.46, p0.001, even if patients with bvFTD were removed from the analysis. Motor impairments were associated with reduced absolute survival, even if patients with PSP and CBS were removed from the analysis.ConclusionOur results may help individualised prognostication and planning of disease-modifying trials and support a transdiagnostic approach to symptomatic treatment trials in patients with clinical syndromes associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20022061v1","/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20022061v1.full.pdf",20200212,"Neurology","Murley","/highwire/citation/72045/bibtext",56,"170220-56","17/02/2020",72045
"Alzheimers disease susceptibility gene apolipoprotein e APOE and blood biomarkers in UK Biobank N395,769.","Background and objective Alzheimers disease AD is a neurodegenerative condition where the underlying aetiology is still unclear. Investigating the potential influence of apolipoprotein APOE, a major genetic risk factor, on common blood biomarkers could provide a greater understanding of the mechanisms of AD and dementia risk. Our objective was to conduct the largest to date single-protocol investigation of blood biomarkers in the context of APOE genotype, in UK Biobank.Methods After quality control and exclusions, data on 395,769 participants of White European ancestry were available for analysis. Linear regressions were used to test potential associations between APOE genotypes and biomarkers.Results Several biomarkers significantly associated with APOE e4 risk and e2 protective genotypes vs. neutral e3/e3. Most associations supported previous data for example, e4 genotype was associated with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol LDL standardized beta b  0.150 standard deviations SDs per allele, p0.001 and e2 with lower LDL b  -0.456 SDs, p0.001. There were however instances of associations found in unexpected directions e.g. e4 and increased insulin-like growth factor IGF-1 standardized beta  0.017, p0.001 where lower levels have been previously suggested as an AD risk factor. Conclusions These findings highlight biomarker differences in non-demented people at genetic risk for dementia. The evidence here in supports previous hypotheses of involvement from cardiometabolic and neuroinflammatory pathways.","/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20021998v1","/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.20021998v1.full.pdf",20200213,"Genetic and Genomic Medicine","Ferguson","/highwire/citation/72080/bibtext",74,"170220-74","17/02/2020",72080
"SMPD1 variants do not have a major role in REM sleep behavior disorder","Mutations in the sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 1 SMPD1 gene were reported to be associated with Parkinson disease PD and dementia with Lewy bodies DLB. The majority of patients with isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder iRBD develop PD or DLB later in life, suggesting that iRBD is a prodromal phase of these two conditions. In the current study we aimed to evaluate the role of SMPD1 variants in iRBD. SMPD1 and its untranslated regions were sequenced using targeted next-generation sequencing in 959 iRBD patients and 1,287 controls from European descent. Logistic regression adjusted for sex and age showed no significant associations with two common variants and iRBD rs1050239 and rs8164.

"Is glycaemia associated with poorer brain health and risk of dementia? Cross sectional and follow-up analysis of the UK Biobank","Objective To understand the relationship across the glycaemic spectrum with incident dementia, brain structure, and cognitive decline.Research Design and Methods UK Biobank participants, aged 40-69 at recruitment. HbA1c and diabetes diagnosis define baseline glycaemic categories. Outcomes included incident vascular dementia VD, Alzheimers dementia AD, hippocampal volume HV, white matter hyperintensity WMH volume, cognitive function and decline. All results are in reference to normoglycaemic individuals HbA1c 35-42 mmol/mol. Results 210433 47, 15246 3, 3280 0.7, 20793 5 individuals had low HbA1c, pre-diabetes, undiagnosed diabetes, and known diabetes, respectively.

"Development and Evaluation of an Android-based Platform for Early MCI Detection in an Elderly Population","Background Mild cognitive impairment MCI is an intermediate stage of cognitive decline fitting in-between normal cognition and dementia. With the growing aging population, this study aimed to develop and psychometrically validate an android-based application for early MCI detection in elderly subjects.Method This study was conducted in two phases, including 1- Initial design and prototyping of the application named M-Check, 2- psychometric evaluation. After the design and development of the M-Check app, it was evaluated by experts and elderly subjects. Face validity was determined by two checklists provided to the expert panel and the elderly subjects. Convergent validity of the M-Check app was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment MoCA battery through Pearson correlation. Test-retest and internal consistency and reliability were evaluated using Intra-Class Correlation ICC and Kuder-Richardson coefficients, respectively. In addition, the usability was assessed by a System Usability Scale SUS questionnaire. SPSS 16.0 was employed to analyze the data.Result The apps usability assessment by elderlies and experts scored 77.11 and 82.5, respectively. Also, the correlation showed that the M-Check app was negatively correlated with the MoCA test r  -0.71, p 0.005, and the ICC was more than 0.7. Moreover, the Richardsons Coder coefficient was 0.82, corresponding to an acceptable reliability. Conclusion In this stud,y we validated the M-Check app for the detection of MCI based on the growing need for cognitive assessment tools that can identify early decline. Such screeners are expected to take much shorter time than typical neuropsychological batteries do. Additional work are yet to be underway to ensure that M-Check is ready to launch and used without the presence of a trained person.","/content/10.1101/2020.03.16.20037028v1","/content/10.1101/2020.03.16.20037028v1.full.pdf",20200320,"Health Informatics","Roozrokh Arshadi Montazer","/highwire/citation/73870/bibtext",31,"250320-31","25-03-2020",73870
"Differential transcript usage unravels transcriptional alterations in Alzheimers disease human brains","Alzheimers disease AD is the leading cause of dementia in aging individuals. However pathophysiological processes involved in the brain are still poorly understood. Among numerous strategies, a comprehensive overview of gene expression alterations in the diseased brain has been proposed to help for a better knowledge of the disease processes. In this work, we compared the differential expression of genes in different regions temporal and frontal lobes of the brain of healthy and AD adult subjects using data from three large studies MAYO Clinic Mount Sinai Brain Bank MSBB and ROSMAP. We show that gene expression is dramatically altered in the temporal lobe TL, but not in the frontal lobe FL, suggesting regional specificities in transcriptional alterations. Moreover, we show that a large set of genes undetected in the classical differential expression DEG analysis show alterations in the transcript usage ratio in AD, i.e. differential isoform fractions. Interestingl,y the number of genes with differential transcript usage gDTUs is highest at advanced Braak stages and correlates with altered expression of genes associated with the splicing machinery. Using single-cell RNA sequencing scRNAseq data, we further assigned DEGs and gDTUs to individual cell types of the adult brain and observed similar signatures per cell type as to other two scRNAseq studies in AD. Lastl,y we show that 52 out of 116 genes located in the loci associated with AD risk and expressed in the adult human brain present DEG and/or gDTUs in the TL, whereas only 13 are altered in the FL of AD patients. Among those altered genes, we detect an increased expression of APP isoforms containing the Kunitz protease inhibitor KPI domain, which is associated with plaque deposition. Altogether, our work proposes a novel integrative strategy to analyze transcriptional data in AD based on both gene/transcript expression and cell-type specificities.","/content/10.1101/2020.03.19.20038703v1","/content/10.1101/2020.03.19.20038703v1.full.pdf",20200324,"Neurology","Coelho","/highwire/citation/74204/bibtext",199,"250320-199","25-03-2020",74204
