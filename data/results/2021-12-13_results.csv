"Impact of Perceived Stress and Immune Status on Decision-Making Abilities during COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown","The ability to make risky decisions in stressful contexts has been largely investigated in experimental settings. We examined this ability during the first months of COVID-19 pandemic, when in Italy people were exposed to a prolonged stress condition, mainly caused by a rigid lockdown. Participants among the general population completed two cognitive tasks, an Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), which measures individual risk/reward decision-making tendencies, and a Go/No-Go task (GNG), to test impulsivity, together with two questionnaires, the Perceived Stress Scale and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales. The Immune Status Questionnaire was additionally administered to explore the impact of the individual health status on decision making. The effect of the questionnaires scores on task performance was examined. The results showed that higher levels of perceived stress and a more self-reported vulnerable immune status were associated, separately, with less risky/more advantageous choices in the IGT in young male participants but with more risky/less advantageous choices in older male participants. These effects were not found in female participants. Impulsivity errors in the GNG were associated with more anxiety symptoms. These findings bring attention to the necessity of taking into account decision-making processes during stressful conditions, especially in the older and more physically vulnerable male population.","Tarantino, Vincenza, Tasca, Ilaria, Giannetto, Nicoletta, Mangano, Giuseppa Renata, Turriziani, Patrizia, Oliveri, Massimiliano","https://doi.org/10.3390/bs11120167","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Behavioral Sciences; 11(12):167, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23532,""
"Achievements and Challenges for Higher Education during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Rapid Review of Media in Africa","The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic struck globally and has affected higher education institutions (HEIs) and their operations, indirectly impacting the progress of the Sustainable Development Goal 4 achieved thus far. This article addresses HEIs achievements and challenges experienced in the wake of the pandemic. Online news media reports played a facilitative role in providing information to the HEI communities. A rapid review exploring online news media messages relating to higher education at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa was utilised. Narrative synthesis was used to analyse the data. The results highlight HEIs achievements, which aim to ensure that all students receive the same level of education and provision in terms of devices and mental health support. However, challenges were also experienced at HEIs and include students feeling uncertainty and fear regarding completing their education. Furthermore, the results also show that not all students received the same level of education due to contextual factors, thus deepening the existing social disparities in Africa. The pandemic provides an opportunity for HEIs to embed the components of global citizenship education into the curriculum and to work in an innovative way to promote Sustainable Development Goal 4.","Sonn, Inge K.; Du Plessis, Marieta, Jansen Van Vuuren, Carel D.; Marais, Janene, Wagener, Emma, Roman, Nicolette V.","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182412888","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(24):12888, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23533,""
"Factors Associated with Psychological Distress in French Medical Students during the COVID-19 Health Crisis: A Cross-sectional Study","Background: The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of psychological distress in medical students during the COVID-19 health crisis and to identify factors associated with psychological distress. Methods: A cross-sectional observational study was presented to 1814 medical students (from first to sixth year) in a French university hospital center. Sociodemographic, occupational and medical information (psychological distress measured on the French GHQ12 scale) were collected via an online anonymous self-administered questionnaire. Variables associated with psychological distress were investigated using univariate analysis and multivariate analysis (modified Poisson regression). Results: In total, 832 medical students responded (46%) and 699 completed the questionnaire in full (39%);625 (75%) showed signs of psychological distress and 109 (15%) reported suicidal ideation. Female gender, psychological trauma during the COVID-19 health crisis, change in alcohol consumption, and difficulties with online learning emerged as risk factors for psychological distress, whereas a paid activity, a feeling of mutual aid and cooperation within the studies framework, and recognition of work appeared to be protective factors. Conclusions: Mental health care or suicide prevention should be provided to students at risk in the aftermath of the pandemic. Knowing the educational and medical factors associated with psychological distress enables areas for prevention to be identified.","Pelissier, Carole, Viale, Manon, Berthelot, Philippe, Poizat, Brigitte, Massoubre, Catherine, Tiffet, Theophile, Fontana, Luc","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182412951","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(24):12951, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23534,""
"Does the Progression of the COVID-19 Pandemic Have an Influence on the Mental Health and Well-Being of Young People? A Cross-Sectional Multicenter Study","The COVID-19 pandemic has been shown to have impaired the mental health and well-being of young people. This study, for the first time, explores these aspects in young people with and without a migratory background during the extended course of the pandemic and restrictive measures, comparing two countries with a high COVID-19 prevalence: Austria and Turkey. Methods: The authors used the &ldquo;Psychological General Well-being&rdquo;index as part of an anonymous online survey with 3665 participants (ages 15&ndash;25), recruited from both countries during the first and the second waves of the pandemic, collecting data on individual experiences and problems encountered during the pandemic. Results: Mental health (b = 0.06, p &lt; 0.023) and general psychological well-being worsened with the progression of the pandemic. Participants with financial problems had the most severe negative effect on mental health (b = 0.12, p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, females living in Turkey, both natives (b = &minus;0.21, p &lt; 0.001) and migrants (b = 0.25, p &lt; 0.001), reported a more deteriorated mental health status over time. Conclusions: The extended pandemic duration and resultant &ldquo;lockdown&rdquo;restrictions have negatively affected the mental health of young people to varying degrees, depending on country of residence and migration background. A strong &ldquo;recovery plan&rdquo;that considers group-specific needs and vulnerabilities is urgently needed.","Ã–zlÃ¼-Erkilic, Zeliha, Kothgassner, Oswald D.; Wenzel, Thomas, Goreis, Andreas, Chen, Anthony, Ceri, Veysi, Fakhr Mousawi, Aylin, Akkaya-Kalayci, TÃ¼rkan","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182312795","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(23):12795, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23535,""
"Perceived Stress Levels among Ukrainian Migrant and LGBT+ Minorities in Poland during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, immigrant status and being a member of the LGBT+ community are all independent factors associated with increased stress levels. Few studies provide more complex analysis on this issue, and there has been no research on the cumulative burden of perceived stress that people belonging to both minorities experience in the current epidemiological situation. The aim of this study was to assess the ability to deal with an external situation during the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland in the following groups with different stress levels (total sample n = 370): Polish heterosexual men (n = 202), heterosexual men from Ukraine (n = 131) and homo- and bisexual men (men who have sex with men&mdash;MSM) from Ukraine (n = 37). A Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) was used. The analysis of the survey did not show statistically significant differences between the three study groups in the general level of perceived stress (24.71, 24.77 and 26.49 points, respectively, p = 0.551), but it revealed numerous differences in coping with various aspects of everyday functioning between these groups. Negative assessment of one&rsquo;s own health proved to be the main factor negatively affecting the level of perceived stress, however specific health risks, medical history or the participants&rsquo;previous experience have not been taken into account in the study. Our research shows differences in the needs, resources and methods of coping with stress between men who are Polish citizens and migrants from Ukraine, both heterosexual and belonging to the MSM group. Proper identification and addressing of these needs, taking into account different availability of health services, could be the responsibility of NGOs or insurance providers. This should result in the reduction of mental health burdens and the risk of developing serious mental disorders, and consequently in better functioning of persons belonging to minorities and in a reduced burden on the health care system.","Michalski, Tomasz, Brosz, Maciej, Stepien, Joanna, Biernacka, Karolina, Blaszczyk, Michal, Grabowski, Jakub","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182312838","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(23):12838, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23536,""
"The Psychological Impact of COVID-19 on Front Line Nurses: A Synthesis of Qualitative Evidence","Caring for people with COVID-19 on the front line has psychological impacts for healthcare professionals. Despite the important psychological impacts of the pandemic on nurses, the qualitative evidence on this topic has not been synthesized. Our objective: To analyze and synthesize qualitative studies that investigate the perceptions of nurses about the psychological impacts of treating hospitalized people with COVID-19 on the front line. A systematic review of qualitative studies published in English or Spanish up to March 2021 was carried out in the following databases: The Cochrane Library, Medline (Pubmed), PsycINFO, Web of Science (WOS), Scopus, and CINHAL. The PRISMA statement and the Cochrane recommendations for qualitative evidence synthesis were followed. Results: The main psychological impacts of caring for people with COVID-19 perceived by nurses working on the front line were fear, anxiety, stress, social isolation, depressive symptoms, uncertainty, and frustration. The fear of infecting family members or being infected was the main repercussion perceived by the nurses. Other negative impacts that this review added and that nurses suffer as the COVID-19 pandemic progress were anger, obsessive thoughts, compulsivity, introversion, apprehension, impotence, alteration of space-time perception, somatization, and feeling of betrayal. Resilience was a coping tool used by nurses. Conclusions: Front line care for people with COVID-19 causes fear, anxiety, stress, social isolation, depressive symptoms, uncertainty, frustration, anger, obsessive thoughts, compulsivity, introversion, apprehension, impotence, alteration of space-time perception, somatization, and feeling of betrayal in nurses. It is necessary to provide front line nurses with the necessary support to reduce the psychological impact derived from caring for people with COVID-19, improve training programs for future pandemics, and analyze the long-term impacts.","Huerta-GonzÃ¡lez, Sara, Selva-Medrano, Dolores, LÃ³pez-Espuela, Fidel, Caro-Alonso, Pedro Ãngel, Novo, Andre, RodrÃ­guez-MartÃ­n, Beatriz","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182412975","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(24):12975, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23537,""

"Come for Information, Stay for Support: Harnessing the Power of Online Health Communities for Social Connectedness during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic created a globally shared stressor that saw a rise in the emphasis on mental and emotional wellbeing. However, historically, these topics were not openly discussed, leaving those struggling without professional support. One powerful tool to bridge the gap and facilitate connectedness during times of isolation is online health communities (OHCs). This study surveyed Health Union OHC members during the pandemic to determine the degree of COVID-19 concern, social isolation, and mental health distress they are facing, as well as to assess where they are receiving information about COVID-19 and what sources of support they desire. The survey was completed in six independent waves between March 2020 and April 2021, and garnered 10,177 total responses. In the United States, OHCs were utilized significantly more during peak lockdown times, and the desire for emotional and/or mental health support increased over time. Open-ended responses demonstrated a strong desire for connection and validation, which are quintessential characteristics of OHCs. Through active moderation utilizing trained moderators, OHCs can provide a powerful, intermediate and safe space where conversations about mental and emotional wellbeing can be normalized and those in need are encouraged to seek additional assistance from healthcare professionals if warranted.","Green, Brian M.; Hribar, Casey A.; Hayes, Sara, Bhowmick, Amrita, Herbert, Leslie Beth","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182312743","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(23):12743, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23539,""
"Psychological Autopsy and Forensic Considerations in Completed Suicide of the SARS-CoV-2 Infected Patients A Case Series and Literature Review","Our paper aims to present three cases of committed suicide in SARS-CoV-2 infection during the quarantine period. We investigated if there is a role for the infection itself in triggering the suicidal act or if it is augmented by other risk factors such as fear, psychosocial stress, lifestyle changes, and social isolation. To this goal, we analyzed the clinical, paraclinical, histopathological, toxicological records, mental health conditions, psychological, social, cultural, and economic aspects in detail. One patient committed suicide at home, by hanging, while the other two during hospitalization in the red zone, within the Sibiu County Emergency Clinical Hospital, hanging and falling from a height, respectively. The autopsy was carried out within the restricted area for COVID-19 in Sibiu County Forensic Medicine Service. Patients&rsquo;medical histories were analyzed based on the available medical reports. Additionally, we interviewed a family member, applying the so-called psychological autopsy method, based on open-ended questions and standardized instruments (questionnaire) to point out the motives and behavioral changes that might explain the committed suicide. With this data, we could fulfill a design to elucidate and outline the reasons for the suicidal act. Our findings showed that the mental state deteriorated progressively, both in preexisting depressive and non-depressive backgrounds. Furthermore, we highlight the COVID-19 psychological impact in the suicidal acts. Further on, we reviewed the risk factors presented in the literature that are associated with mental health problems and behavioral changes such as stress, anxiety, depressions, sleep disorders, impulsivity, loneliness.","Crisan, Roxana-Mihaela, Bacila, Ciprian Ionut, Neamtu, Bogdan, Cristian, Adrian Nicolae, TopÃ®rcean, Elena, Popescu, Adriana, Morar, Silviu","https://doi.org/10.3390/app112311547","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Applied Sciences; 11(23):11547, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23540,""
"New Insights on the Mediating Role of Emotional Intelligence and Social Support on University Students&rsquo;Mental Health during COVID-19 Pandemic: Gender Matters","Due to the demanding changes caused in the population by the COVID-19 pandemic, including a persisting experience of fear and social isolation, multiple studies have focused on the protective role of several psychological characteristics on mental health. Emotional intelligence and social support are commonly linked to mental health and well-being. The present study aims to analyze the mediator role of emotional intelligence and social support on university students&rsquo;mental health, taking into consideration the role of gender differences. An online questionnaire was administered to a sample of 923 university students during the COVID-19 lockdown in Portugal. Significant gender differences were found on mental health symptoms, emotional intelligence, and social support. A double mediation model was computed to verify if gender influences on mental health were mediated by emotional intelligence and social support. The results show indirect effects of gender on mental health. However, as both mediators mediate in the opposite direction, the total indirect effects become null. Thus, a strong direct effect of gender on mental health remains. The results of the present study have theoretical implications on protective factors of mental health by gender and practical implications for psychological intervention in university counselling services.","Barros, Carla, Sacau-Fontenla, Ana","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182412935","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(24):12935, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23541,""
"Forest Recreational Services in the Face of COVID-19 Pandemic Stress","Forest ecosystems provide numerous services and benefits to both humans and biodiversity. Similarly, urban forests services play a vital role by providing urban dwellers with recreational and leisure space, mental health relief, and meditation. In the wake of the COVID-19 epidemic, many people living in the urban areas could benefit from the forest and park recreational services to relieve psychological stress due to lockdown rules. The study examined existing literature simultaneously;however, very few studies have presented the relationships between forest services&rsquo;role on COVID-19 stress relief. Furthermore, we examined forest visitors&rsquo;frequency at the Training Forest Enterprise (TFE) Masaryk Forest K&#345;tiny in the outskirts of Brno City in the Czech Republic. The study collected data using a TRAFx infrared trail counter before the pandemic (2015&ndash;2018) and during the COVID-19 period (2021). As in other studies of the subject, we observed an increasing trend in forest visits during the COVID-19 lockdown in 2021, compared to the same months before the pandemic in 2016 and 2017. We recommend further research to focus on scientific analysis of the relationship between forest ecosystem services and COVID-19 stress and mental health. Moreover, given the spike in visitors during the COVID-19 lockdown in 2021 in March and April, our data provide evidence regarding the role of nature for relieving stress and supporting mental and physical health. Policy, decision-makers and medical advisors could use such data and study to guide future lockdowns and pandemic situations regarding nature and forest recreational use and importance.","Bamwesigye, Dastan, FialovÃ¡, Jitka, Kupec, Petr, Lukaszkiewicz, Jan, Fortuna-Antoszkiewicz, Beata","https://doi.org/10.3390/land10121347","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Land; 10(12):1347, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23542,""
"Influence of Attachment Anxiety on the Relationship between Loneliness and Depression among Long-Term Care Residents","Background: Attachment styles influence an individual&rsquo;s ability to maintain relationships throughout their lifespan. Insecure attachment has been associated with many aspects of mental health. The study aimed to explore the influence of attachment on loneliness and depression among old-age residents in long-term care facilities. Methods: A survey was conducted among residents from long term care facilities (LTC) in Thailand during the COVID-19 pandemic;221 older people participated in the study. The mean aged was 73.60 &plusmn;7.45 years old, and 57.5% female. All participants completed the Geriatric Depression Scale, the six-item revised version of the University of California Los Angeles Loneliness Scale, and the Revised Experience of Close Relationships questionnaire to measure depressive symptoms, loneliness, and attachment style. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis was performed to find the predictors for depressive symptoms. Results: In all, 40.7% of residents in LTC facilities experienced depression. Male sex, education, loneliness, and attachment anxiety predicted the increased level of depressive symptoms. Conclusion: Loneliness was confirmed to be significantly associated with depressive symptoms, and attachment anxiety was found to be a strong predicting factor of depressive symptoms. Intervention and research regarding reducing loneliness and attachment anxiety should be promoted in LTC settings.","Arunrasameesopa, Suthikarn, Wongpakaran, Nahathai, Wongpakaran, Tinakon","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9121675","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Healthcare; 9(12):1675, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23543,""

Anxiety and depression symptoms, that are common results of severe diseases, used to make recovery more difficult. Purpose: To study the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, signs of anxiety, depression, stress, and their relationship in patients with proven COVID-19 pneumonia 3 months after discharge depending of gender. Methods: The study was carried out within â€œOne-year Cardiac Follow-up of COVID-19 Pneumoniaâ€. 103 patients (mean age 46.6Â±15.8 years) were divided into 2 groups: 52 men (50.9%) and 51 women. Anxiety and depression symptoms were measured by GAD-7 and PHQ-9, respectively. PSS-10 was used to measure stress symptoms. The minimum value of anxiety and depression was a total value of 5 points. Results: 48.5% of patients had cardiovascular diseases, out of which arterial hypertension (AH) was the most common (44.7%). Less common was coronary artery disease (CAD) (16.5%), which in 14.6% of patients was accompanied by AH. Chronic heart failure (CHF) NYHA class I-II was found in 19.4% of patients, and severe CHF (NYHA class III-IV) - in 4.9%. Arrhythmia was detected in 11.7% of patients. According to the clinical characteristics, no significant differences were found between the groups of men and women. AH affected 21.4% of men and 23.3% of women, CAD -10.7% and 5.8%, respectively. NYHA class I-II CHF were found in 8.7% of men and 10.7% of women, and severe CHF (NYHA class III-IV) - in 2 men and 3 women. Arrhythmia had a prevalence of less than 6% among both men and women. Anxiety or depression symptoms were reported in 29.1% and 27.2%, respectively. Combination of anxiety and depression symptoms was determined in 18.4%, symptoms of stress in 8.7% of patients. Symptoms of depression were found in women more often (p=0.023). The value of the median scores of the PHQ-9 questionnaire in the group of women was significantly higher than in the group of men (3.00 [1.00;8.00] and 1.00 [0;3.75], p=0.006). Depression symptoms were associated with female gender (OR 2.83;CI 95% 1.35-7.08). Despite the absence of gender differences in the prevalence of anxiety (18.4% and 10.7%, p=0.072), when comparing the values of the median scores of the GAD-7 questionnaire in the groups of men and women, the difference was statistically significant (1.00 [0;4.00] and 3.00 [2.00;7.00], p=0.001, respectively). Signs of stress among married people were less common in comparison with unmarried (2.9% vs 5.8%, p=0.037). Conclusion: Three months after discharge, no significant differences in clinical characteristics between men and women were found. Signs of anxiety or depression were detected in more than a quarter of patients with proven COVID-19-associated pneumonia. Women experienced symptoms of depression 3 times more often than men. Unmarried patients tended to experience stress more often.","Yaroslavskaya, E.; Guskova, O.; Prilenskii, B.; Petelina, T.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab724.2667","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: European Heart Journal; 42(SUPPL 1):2667, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23544,""

Aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of a holistic hospital intensive rehabilitation program, based on CR, on C-19 patients (P), after acute care, to improve their fitness, in order to return to their life in the best conditions. Methods: In the period april-august 2020, 30 P (mean age 73 years, 60% male) were admitted to the rehabilitation centre at a mean distance of 31Â±11 days from the onset of C-19;34% of them had undergone prolonged invasive ventilation, 34% non invasive ventilation and 32% required high flow oxygen. Comorbidities were: hypertension (77%), diabetes (13%) and chronic coronary syndrome (10%);18 P were unable to stand, and 12 showed impaired trunk control. No P had impaired LVEF or significant valvular disease. Initially, the program focused on training for trunk and sitting control;then on exercises for straightening the upper and lower limbs. From the second week, started a CR training on the cycle ergometer 10- 20 minutes a day for 6 days a week, similar protocol to that used in P with heart failure. The aerobic training was of moderate intensity, not exceeding 40-60% of the maximum heart rate, Borg scale 10-12, starting with zero load, gradually increasing by 10-15 watts and up to a minimum target of 25-30 watts. The impact of the protocol on motor functions [MRC Muscle Strenght Scale, Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)] on functional capacity [6 Minutes Walking Test (6MWT)] on anxiety (A) and depression (D) [Hamilton Anxiety Rating scale (HAMA) and Hamilton Depression Rating scale (HAMD)] and on basic activities of daily life [Barthel Index (BI)] were evaluated. The assessment was done on the admission (T0), at the discharge (T1, on average after 31 days) and after a follow-up of 55 days (T3). Results: The results are shown in the table below. Only 4 P were able to perform the 6MWT at T0. The motor function improves rapidly and then reaches a plateau and its trend is reflected in the BI. Functional capacity, on the other hand, improves significantly even at a distance. A and D decreased rapidly but increased over time. Conclusions: A rehabilitation protocol, centered on CR, induces a rapid increase in motor capacity, even in severely compromised subjects such as C-19. The improvement in fitness over time, as demonstrated by the 6MWT, probably is due to the severe muscle deconditioning, for the long stay in acute care. The long-term worsening of A and D may depend on various causes: no longer living in a â€œprotected and safeâ€ place, the fear of relapse, returning home and discovering new deaths and mournings. A program, CR-like, can counteract many of the negative consequences of C-19;however these P deserve an outpatient rehabilitation to maintain and consolidate the positive results over time.

Acupuncture could be a useful tool in this context. Objective: To describe the experience of using acupuncture in an integrative initiative at the University Hospital of the Federal University of Santa Catarina (HU-UFSC) to provide care to HCWs with medical disorders that have emerged or aggravated during the pandemic. Methods: HU-UFSC has implemented a contingency plan to cope with the new demands that emerged as a result of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Within this contingency plan, a support team to HU-UFSC's HCWs was established. The initiative offered a comprehensive integrative approach that included acupuncture, psychiatry, psychology and homeopathy. HCWs sought support as they presented evolving symptoms or worsening of chronic conditions. Results: From April 2020 to July 2020, the acupuncture team completed a total of 340 appointments. Most patients were treated with acupuncture once a week for approximately 4 weeks. A survey of chief complaints showed that 83% of patients had mental health complaints. Among those, 56% had concurrent pain disorders;10% sought care for pain conditions exclusively and 7% reported other complaints. Mental health-related complaints were mostly associated with worsening of preexisting conditions, mainly anxiety, followed by irritability and sleep disorders. We observed a large number of patients with acute chronic pain associated with mental health complaints (56%). The three acupuncture medical professionals and two acupuncture residents involved in this project observed a significant improvement in symptoms among HCWs treated with acupuncture. In addition, the integrative approach facilitated the process of coping with suffering triggered by the pandemic. Conclusion:The present experience of using acupuncture for workers in a Brazilian university hospital setting suggests that acupuncture may help individuals suffering from mental health issues triggered by the pandemic.","Trasel, A.

In Germany, more than 2.5 million cases are confirmed so far, with more than 70,000 deaths. An increased fatality rate was seen among patients with preexisting comorbid conditions, especially with cardiovascular diseases, representing this group at particular risk. Purpose: Risk perceptions of public health crises like the COVID-19 pandemic can affect people's mental health, reveal gaps in support, and influences the adherence to regulatory requirements. The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in health perception among patients with aortic diseases during the first and second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. Methods: Patients (n=262) diagnosed with aortic disease participated in telephone interviews during the first (w1, April 6-April 29, 2020) and second wave (w2, January 11-January 29, 2021) of the pandemic in Germany. The perception of COVID-19 as a threat was examined using relevant items of the Brief Illness Perception (BIP) questionnaire to address four dimensions (consequences, control, personal control, and understanding). Relevant data focusing on different aortic diseases and cardiovascular risk factors were taken from patient records. Results: Aortic diseases included mainly aortic aneurysm of the ascending (n=164, 62.6%) and the descending aorta (n=37, 14.1%). Patients with acute or chronic aortic dissection made up a third (n=41, 15.6%, and n=48, 18.3%, respectively). At baseline (w1), none of the participants had neither been quarantined nor were taken ill with COVID-19. At the second survey (w2), 24 participants (n=252, 9.5%) had already been quarantined and five (n=252, 2%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. The BIP score increased 9.18 (SD=7.132) to 14.58 (SD = 6.956) between w1 and w2 (p&lt;.001). At the level of dimensions, that meant a significant difference between w1 and w2 regarding consequences (M=-2.821, SD=3.049, 95% CI [-3.200, -2.443], t(251)=-14.691, p&lt;.001, d=0.92), control (M=0.908, SD=2.492, 95% CI [0.589, 1.218], t(249)=5.760, p&lt;.001, d=0.36), and concern (M=-1.669, SD=3.349, 95% CI [-2.086, -1.253], t(250)=-7.898, p&lt;0.001, d=0.50). Only understanding showed no significant difference (M=-0.032, SD=1.520, 95% CI [-0.220, 0.157], t(251)=-0.332, p=0.740). Conclusion: Although patients with aortic diseases are highly at risk of having worse outcomes from COVID-19, their overall perception of COVID- 19 as a threat was low in the beginning, but rising during the second wave. The main reasons were the increased effects on personal life and elevated concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic, but concerns did not include the educational aspect of COVID-19. Tailored risk communication strengthens the mental health of people in a public health crisis and ensures the success of governmental guidelines and policies.","Parys, A.; Klinge, S.; Doenmez, A.; Rammos, C.; Rassaf, T.; Janosi, A.; Lortz, J.","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehab724.1986","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: European Heart Journal; 42(SUPPL 1):1986, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23547,""

We investigated the prevalence and relative risk (RR) of gastrointestinal and somatoform symptoms five months after SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with a control cohort. Materials and methods: 378 subjects, age range 18-60 years, were stu-died. 177 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients and 201 controls responded to an online questionnaire about symptoms and signs during the acute phase of the infection and after 4.8Â±0.3 months. 13 and 18 patients were respectively excluded because of a previous gastrointestinal dise-ase. Presence and severity of gastrointestinal symptoms, somatization, anxiety and depression were recorded with a structured standardized questionnaire, including the Structured Assessment of Gastrointestinal Symptoms (SAGIS) questionnaire, the Symptom Check List (SCL)-12 for somatization and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Stool form through Bristol Stool scale and a yes/no question summari-zing the Rome IV criteria for Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) were also recorded. Any association between exposure to infection and symp-toms was evaluated by calculating crude and adjusted RR values and score differences with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: Fever, dyspnea, loss of smell/taste/weight, diarrhea, myal-gia, arthralgia and asthenia were reported by more than 40% of patients during the acute phase. Abdominal pain/discomfort, diar-rhea/incontinence and gastroesophageal reflux disease/regurgita-tion symptoms persisted after SARS-CoV-2 infection, but with very low severity;the relative increase on the mean score of each domain was minimal (score difference up to +0.16). Compared with con-trols, adjusted RRs for loose stools, chronic fatigue and somatization were increased after infection: 1.88 (95% CI 0.99â€“3.54), 2.24 (95% CI 1.48â€“3.37), 3.62 (95% CI 1.01â€“6.23) respectively. The prevalence of IBS and HADS scores tended to be greater in patients than in con-trols. Gastrointestinal sequelae were greater in patients with diar-rhea during the acute phase. Conclusions: Mild gastroenterological symptoms persist five months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, in particular in patients report-ing diarrhea in the acute phase.

Nowadays telerehabilitation is the best method due to close-out and readjustment of clinics. There is a need to search and develop alternative rehabilitation models in the conditions of COVID-19 pandemic. Aim: Developing and introducing an alternative rehabilitation model for the patients after acute coronary syndrome in the conditions of COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: An alternative rehabilitation model was developed for the patients after acute coronary syndrome in the condition of COVID-19 pandemic. 70 patients after the acute coronary syndrome who were hospitalized into the cardiology center went thought our rehabilitation model. The 1st stage of the rehabilitation is conducted during in-patient treatment. Before the discharge from the hospital, the patient gets evaluated his/her clinical state, physical activity level, evaluation of his/her psychological state, risk stratification with noting in a developed by us patient's individual self-check diary. The individual diary includes: ID data, pharmaceutical treatment, recommendations on physical activity with a possibility to note daily data on angina and dyspnea attacks, their number, need in medications, heart rate, blood pressure, distance walked during a day, evaluation in points according to the Borg scale, HADS and SAQ questionnaires. The 2nd stage is conducted using telerehabilitation methods: phone call, group training on the ZOOM platform, and individual consulting. At this stage we used the components of rehabilitation: - group training in breathing exercises and using relaxation techniques, are conducted 2 times/week during 3 months after discharge, then 1 time/week up to 6th month or on patient's request individually - group training using an author's method of psychological rehabilitation while optimizing internal health picture, is conducted 2 times/week during 3 months after discharge, then 1 time/week up to 6th month or on patient's request individually Control of the patient's state and indices (according to data from the patient's individual diary) is conducted after 1, 6 months, and a year. Results: We established that our alternative rehabilitation method contributed to the improvement of clinical and functional capabilities of the patients, decrease of depression and anxiety, improved quality of life, attitude towards the disease and health. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic changed our life and health care for the patients. But a time-lag in conducting and using rehabilitation in patients with cardiovascular diseases causes complications and progression of the disease. Using alternative rehabilitation methods will grant providing timely and complex medical care, improving clinical, physical, and psychological indices that will contribute to increased adherence to rehabilitation and treatment in conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The curtailed access to family, friends, and other social support systems caused loneliness and mental issues such as anxiety and depression. Aim and Objectives: The present study was taken to find the impact of social lockdown on the psychological and mental health of the participants and to find out the differences between different sex, age groups, and occupations. Materials and Methods: An online cross-sectional study was administered to 1047 participants in the age group of 16â€“70 years through Google forms to assess the psychological and mental status of the residents of Delhi-NCR, India. The psychological status was judged by IES(R), while mental health status was checked by Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). Results: The mean age of the participants was 48.29 Â± 26.16 years. About 75.4% of participants had a moderate psychological impact of the lockdown as calculated by the IES(R) scale. DASS-21 scale revealed that the participants suffered from mild to moderate depression, anxiety and stress. Females had higher IES(R) but males scored higher DASS-21 scores.

We assess whether HAL influenced medical decision-making (MDM) of Non-COVID patients. Method: We prospectively recruited patients with cardiovascular complaints during February and September 2020. We assessed anxiety levels using the GAD-7, Beck Inventory, the cardiac anxiety questionnaires, and a newly designed MDM questionnaire. Results: We recruit 287 patients. The mean age was 52.6Â±14.9 (females represent 36.2%). HAL was reported in 261 (90.3) patients and was more prevalent in old (p&lt;0.001 for all questionnaires), married, and unemployed patients (significant p-value for all). Cardiovascular comorbidities and a history of anxiety, depression, and psychiatric disorder were independent factors for HAL (p&lt;0.001 for all). Coronary catheterization was performed more in HAL (p&lt;0.001 for all), yet the rate of significant coronary artery disease was lower than in patients with low anxiety level (LAL) (p&lt;0.001 for all). 161 (56.9) patients reported that their MDM was affected (&lt;0.001), and 149 (76.8) patients indicated that they would have gone earlier to the hospital if not the pandemic (p=0.03 for high DM-19 score). Patients with HAL seek medical care longer than LAL patients (p=0.02). Correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between MDM and HAL (p&lt;0.001 for all).

As some cases of young athletes with serious complications like myocarditis or thromboembolism and even sudden death were reported, strict recommendations for return to sport were published. However, we have less data about athletes who have already returned to high-intensity trainings after a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Athletes underwent cardiology screening (personal history, physical examination, 12-lead resting ECG, laboratory tests with necroenzyme levels and echocardiography) 2 to 3 weeks after suffering a SARS-CoV-2 infection. In case of negative results, they were advised to start low intensity trainings and increase training intensity regularly until achieving maximal intensity a minimum of 3 weeks later. A second step of cardiology screening was also carried out after returning to maximal intensity trainings. The above mentioned screening protocol was repeated and was completed with vita maxima cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) on running treadmill. If the previous examinations indicated, 24h Holter ECG recording, 24h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring or cardiac MR imaging were also carried out. Data are presented as meanÂ±SD. Two-step screening after SARS-CoV-2 infection was carried out in 111 athletes (male:74, age:22.4Â±7.4y, elite athlete:90%, training hours:14.8Â±5.8 h/w, ice hockey players:31.5%, water polo players:22.5%, wrestlers:18.9%, basketball players:18.0%). Second screenings were carried out 94.5Â±31.5 days after the first symptoms of the infection. A 5% of the athletes was still complaining of tiredness and decreased exercise capacity. Resting heart rate was 70.3Â±13.0 b.p.m., During CPET examinations, athletes achieved a maximal heart rate of 187.3Â±11.6 b.p.m., maximal relative aerobic capacity of 49.2Â±5.5 ml/kg/min, and maximal ventilation of 138.6Â±31.2 l/min. The athletes reached their anaerobic threshold at 87.8Â±6.3% of their maximal aerobic capacity, with a heart rate of 93.3Â±3.7% of their maximal values. Heart rate recovery was 29.9Â±9.2/min. During the CPET examinations, short supraventricular runs, repetititve ventricular premature beats + ventricular quadrigeminy and inferior ST depression were found in 1-1 cases. Slightly higher pulmonary pressure was measured on the echocardiography in 4 cases. Hypertension requiring drug treatment was found in 5.4% of the cases. Laboratory examinations revealed decreased vitamin D3 levels in 26 cases, decreased iron storage levels in 18 athletes. No SARS-CoV-2 infection related CMR changes were revealed in our athlete population. Three months after SARS-CoV-2 infection, most of the athletes examined had satisfactory fitness levels. However, some cases of decreased exercise capacity, decreased vitamin D3 or iron storage levels, arrhythmias, hypertension and elevated pulmonary pressure requiring further examinations, treatment or follow-up were revealed.","Kiss, O.; Babity, M.; Konig, A.; Zamodics, M.; Gregor, Z.

Methodology: Ninety six patients were included, age over 23 years and had a confirmed COVID-19 on PCR. At the time of admission and on discharge, in-hospital data were recorded. The demographic information, symptoms, complete blood count, inflammatory markers, and chest X-ray noted. Results: Diabetes (50%) and Ischemic heart disease (50%) were the most frequent comorbidities. The majority of patients (75%) improved their X-ray findings after being discharged from the hospital. At the time of discharge, 75% of the patients expressed fatigue;none of the patients developed a fever. There was a substantial significant difference in tiredness reported at discharge and in the fourth week. Significant variations in shortness of breath and oxygen consumption were also found between tiredness indicated at discharge and the fourth week. The majority of lab values were within normal limits. Conclusion: Most patients gradually improved after receiving appropriate treatment and supportive care in the hospital and later at home. The most prevalent and prolonged symptom reported by most patients was fatigue. By the fourth week, most symptoms had ameliorated significantly.","Ishaque, S.; Syed, B.; Akhter, S.; Talhasafeer, Yousramansoor, Khawaja, S.; Kashif, M.; Durrani, N.","https://doi.org/10.53350/pjmhs2115102611","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Pakistan Journal of Medical and Health Sciences; 15(10):2611-2613, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23554,""

Cardiac enzyme (e.g. troponin or creatinine kinase (CK)) elevations are a frequently reported finding, indicating myocardial damage and arrhythmias are the cause for ICU transfer in up to 12% of patients. However, the mechanistic role of COVID19 associated cytokine-storm for the concomitant cardiac dysfunction and associated arrhythmias is unclear. In addition, the role of anti-inflammatory therapy approaches to mitigate this cardiac dysfunction remains elusive. Methods: We investigated the effects of COVID19-associated inflammatory response on cardiac cellular function as well as its cardiac arrhythmogenic potential in rat and induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (iPSc-CM). Moreover, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of the IL1-beta antagonist Canakinumab using state of the art in-vitro confocal and ratiometric high-throughput microscopy. Results: Isolated rat ventricular cardiomyocytes were exposed to control or COVID19 plasma from intensive care unit patients with severe ARDS and impaired cardiac function (LVEF 41Â±5%;1/3 of patients on veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation;CK 154Â±43 U/l). Cardiomyocytes showed decreased Ca2+ transient amplitudes and altered baseline Ca2+ concentrations leading to impaired cellular contractile function upon electrical field-stimulation and exposure to patient plasma (n=276 control and 359 COVID19 cells;Fura). In addition, we used iPSc-CM to explore the long-term effect of patient plasma on cardiac electrical and mechanical function in a translational setting (24h incubation;Fluo). In iPSc, spontaneous Ca2+ release events (i.e. Ca2+ waves and Ca2+ sparks) were more likely to occur upon incubation with COVID19 plasma and nuclear as well as cytosolic Ca2+ release were altered. Co-incubation with Canakinumab had no effect on pro-arrhythmogenic Ca2+ release or Ca2+ signaling during excitation-contraction coupling but influenced cellular automaticity upon prolonged electrical stimulation. Conclusion: Plasma derived from COVID19 patients exerts acute cardiodepressant and chronic pro-arrhythmogenic effects in rat and iPS-derived cardiomyocytes. Chronic co-incubation with Canakinumab had no beneficial effect on cellular Ca2+ signaling during excitation-contraction coupling.","Dimai, S.; Semmler, L.; Stachelscheid, H.; Pieske, B.

Purpose: To determine the features of the structure and predictors of repolarization disorders in the patients with severe COVID-infection. Methods: 133 patients with severe COVID-19 infection were examined, who were in the intensive care unit of the clinical hospital No. 1 in our city in the period from April to December 2020 and as a result of treatment with improved health were discharged from the hospital. Among them there were 65 (48.9%) men and 68 (51.1%) women (X2=0.068, p=0.79). The age of patients ranged from 24 to 90 years, averaging 61.38Â±12.96 years. Middle-aged and elderly patients were dominated at age structure (p=0.001). The total duration of staying in the hospital was 18.9Â±9.12 days. The duration of staying in the intensive care unit was 8.32Â±6.91 days. Statistical processing of the obtained data was performed using the statistical software package SPSS 12.0 for Windows. Results: ECG analysis showed that most of the patients had various ischemic changes and/or myocardial repolarization disorders - in 119 (89.5%) patients. Thus, inversion of the T wave was registered - in 91 (68.4%), signs of early ventricular repolarization - in 14 (10.5%), elevation of ST segment - in 6 (4.5%), depression of ST segment - in 54 (40.6%), pathological Q wave - in 9 (6.8%). In turn, signs of an overload of a left ventricle (LV) - in 27 (20,3%), signs of an overload of a right ventricle (RV) - in 8 (6,0%), a sign of SIQIIITIII - in 7 (5,3%), prolongation of QT interval - in 6 (4.5%) patients, respectively. Also signs of LV hypertrophy - in 45 (33.8%), signs of RV hypertrophy - in 12 (9.0%), the presence of p-pulmonale - in 6 (4.5%), p-mitrale - in 7 (5.3%) patients, respectively. Predictors of ischemic changes and/or repolarization disorders in the patients with severe COVID infection are: a decrease of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt;60 ml/min/1.73 m2 - r=0.580, p=0.006;time of hospitalization r=-0,204, p=0,02;elderly patients - r=0,184;p=0.02. Conclusions: The prevalence of ischemic changes and/or myocardial repolarization disorders according to ECG data is 89.5%. Presence of inversion of T wave (68.4%) and depression of ST segment (40.6%) were dominated in the structure of ischemic changes and/or myocardial repolarization disorders.

During covid the majority of face-to-face programmes were suspended but these services have never been more crucial as control of cardiovascular risk factors can mitigate the morbidity/mortality risk from covid. Programmes must now however be delivered in a way that reduces patient exposure. Here we describe how we rapidly transitioned our previously fully face to face cardiovascular prevention/programme to a completely virtual platform adopting Fitbit as wearable technology. Methods: The previously face-to-face initial assessment (IA) conducted by the multidisciplinary team (MDT) - nurse, dietician and physiotherapist is now delivered via video/phone as per patient preference. Patients are provided with equipment kits (tape measures, blood pressure monitors (BP), Fitbit smartwatches and Fibricheck app as required. The virtual IA includes assessment of: Smoking habit, blood pressure (BP), heart rate, lipid profile and HbA1c (taken in community phlebotomy hub), cardioprotective medications, weight, BMI, waist circumference, Mediterranean Diet Score, functional capacity via the Duke Activity Status Index, habitual activity levels, risk stratification for exercise, hospital anxiety and depression scores (HADS) and quality of life (QOL). Patients receive education and tailored advice with SMART goals as well as a written care plan. The subsequent 12 programme is comprised of â€¢ Weekly virtual meeting with cardiologist to optimise BP/lipids and medications â€¢ Alternate weekly virtual coaching consultation by MDT for monitoring/ goal resetting â€¢ Alternate weekly video group education sessions on key cardiovascular health topics â€¢ Online educational videos filmed by the MDT Monitoring of physical activity (step count, active minutes) in real time via Fibit dashboard with personalised messages sent to patients via the Fitbit app â€¢ Provision of Fibricheck app via Fibit for rhythm assessment â€¢ End of programme (EOP) assessments are then also conducted virtually Results: Between April and November 2020 n=262 had a virtual IA (94% of those offered and n=114 (95% of those offered) attended an end of programme assessment. 64% were male and the mean age was 64.1 years. Acceptance of the Fitbit device was 72% of those offered. Table 1 below shows the main clinical and patient-reported outcomes in those attending both an IA and EOP with the data for the same 6 months the year prior (face to face programme) also for comparison. Programme satisfaction ratings were high with 85% rating the programme as excellent or very good. Conclusions: Transitioning a previously fully face to face cardiac rehabilitation programme to a wholly virtual platform was feasible and acceptable to patients. Early data analysis would suggest that the virtual programme achieves similar clinical and patient reported outcomes. (Figure Presented).","Connolly, S. B.; Jones, J.

Healther workers have been one of the population groups mainly affected during the pandemic. Chronic involvement by COVID-19 infection, such as dyspnea, is frequent, and so far, of unknown mechanism. CardioPulmonary Exercise Test (CPET) is currently the gold standard technique in the differential diagnosis of dyspnea. Therefore, CPET could be useful in the evaluation of patients after infection by the SARS-COV2 virus;a role still unknown in this context. Objective: Evaluate the parameters obtained in CPET in patients who had suffered from COVID-19 disease and who presented persistent dyspnea. Methods: We conducted a single-center and prospective study that included healthcare workers who suffered from COVID-19 disease with mildmoderate intensity symptoms, without the need for hospitalization, between March-December 2020 and who presented dyspnea on exertion at least 3 months after infection, in the absence of structural heart disease. An echo was performed, and a baseline spirometry followed by a CPET. Some of the variables collected such as VO2, OUES and PulseO2 have been quantified as a percentage (%) of the predicted according to predicted equations. Results: 64 healthy patients with an active baseline life (without exertional dyspnea prior to infection) were included. 7 patients were excluded for presenting previously unknown structural heart disease. Of the 57 patients (Figure 1), more than half had a functional capacity lower than predicted (50th percentile), highlighting, among the cardiovascular response variables, a peak VO2 of 79% (SD: 14.0%) of the predicted, denoting slightly depressed functional capacity. In addition, in this subgroup, a VO2 at the level of the first ventilatory threshold (VT1) of 51.1% (SD: 4.2%) is observed over the predicted value -value that is considered in the lower limits of normality-;and a PulseO2 (systolic volume reflex) and an OUES in normal ranges with respect to those predicted. In the total of the 57 patients, no alterations were observed in the ventilatory efficiency parameters with effort, nor in the baseline spirometry, nor in the breathing reserve (BR), nor in final oxygen saturation (SatO2). Conclusion: CPET has made it possible to identify that more than half of the patients show a deterioration -at least slight- in functional capacity (the majority of which are women) reaffirming the value of this test. The combination of this pattern that we observed in our serie is usually seen in patients with physical deconditioning and/or obesity, and is secondary to alterations in the peripheral use of oxygen, mainly at the muscular level. Based on this, a direct or indirect potential myopathic effect of the virus cannot be ruled out as responsible for the deterioration of the functional class of patients after COVID-19 disease.

Nevertheless, patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) treated with intravenous (i.v.) biologics had to move to hospital for drug infusion, in contrast to patients treated with subcutaneous (s.c.) therapies who could remain at home, monitored through telemedicine. We investigated whether patients hospitalized or treated at home showed similar COVID-19 risk, as well as the levels of anxiety in both groups Materials and methods: We conducted a survey including consecutive IBD patients in clinical and biochemical remission treated with biologics referring to the lockdown period. Patients underwent the normally scheduled clinical visits, performed at home by means of telemedicine for patients treated with s.c. drugs and only in specific cases for patients treated with i.v. therapies. We administered to all patients the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire and other 12 questions, specifically related to COVID and its implications. Group differences in continuous and nominal variables were tested by Kruskalâ€“Wallis test and Fisher exact test, respectively Results: A total of 189 IBD patients were recruited, 112 (59.3%) treated with i.v. drugs and 77 (40.7%) with s.c. ones. No augmented risk of COVID infection were recorded in both groups (hospitalized vs. non-hospitalized, p=ns). The two groups of patients had similar scores in the 14 single items of the HADS questionnaire (p&gt;0.10 for all). The total HADS score obtained by the sum of all items was also almost identical between groups (37.1Â±2.8 vs 37.2Â±2.8;p=0.98). In patients treated with i.v. drugs receiving a televisit (n=17), the rates of satisfaction about telemedicine (58.8%) and the lack of in-person care (33.3%) were significantly lower compared with those treated with s.c. drugs (94.8% and 92.2%, respectively;both p&lt;0.0005). Conclusions: Our results suggest that there is no need to convert patients from i.v. to s.c. therapy during COVID-19 outbreaks, since the risk of infection and its transmission is not increased. Moreover, anxiety levels are similar in both groups, emphasizing that hospitalization seems not affecting the psychological status of the patients and therefore not increasing the relapse rate.","Bertani, L.; Barberio, B.; TricÃ², D.; Zanzi, F.; Maniero, D.; Ceccarelli, L.; Marsilio, I.; Minciotti, M.; Coppini, F.; Lorenzon, G.; Mumolo, M.

The enforced condition of isolation due to the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic led to radical changes in lifestyle, probably affecting quality of life (QoL) and mental health. Our aim was to investigate the influence of COVID-19 lockdown in a well-studied cohort of IBS patients. Materials and methods: 41 IBS patients (28F, age range 18-65 ys) from the outpatientsâ€™ clinic of the University Federico II of Naples were invited to join an online survey during the first and second lockdown (April - October 2020). The survey consisted of 5 sections assessing: i) anthropometric data, ii) IBS symptoms (IBS symptom severity scale, IBS-SSS and Bristol Stool Form Scale, BSFS), iii) life-style changes, iv) psychological data (Visceral Sensitivity Index, VSI, and Patient Health Questionnaire-15, PH15), v) QoL (Short Form 12, SF-12, including the physical and mental component summary;PCS and MCS, respectively). Data from the first (T1) and second (T2) lockdown were compared with those collected in person before the pandemic (T0). Results: All subjects completed the study. Compared to baseline, at T1 there was a significant improvement in IBS symptoms (257Â±69 vs 222Â±105), loose stools frequency (4Â±1 vs 2Â±2) and PCS (46Â± 7 vs 51Â±7;all p&lt;0,05), whilst MCS remained unchanged (40Â±10 vs 41Â±10). These findings were associated with a radical change in lifestyle with 81% of the subjects working remotely from home. At T2, both BSFS and PCS (4Â±1 vs 2Â±2 and 46Â±6 vs 50Â±8;all p&lt;0,05) remained steadily improved;however, IBS-SSS scores returned to baseline (257Â±69 vs 245Â±93). This effect was not associated with a worsened mental status since the MCS (40Â±10 vs 41Â±10), VSI (55Â±20 vs 56Â± 19) and PH15 scores (8Â± 4 vs 8Â±4;all p=ns) were unchanged between T1 and T2. On the contrary, at T2 most patients resumed their routinely work (57% vs 19%, p&lt;0.05). Conclusions: Our survey showed an unforeseen improvement of IBS symptoms during the first Italian lockdown without a nega-tive impact on patientsâ€™ QoL. However, during the second COVID-19 wave, we observed an inverted trend with a new clinical worsen-ing associated with the return to patientsâ€™ pre-pandemic routine. Symptoms improvement during the first lockdown is likely the result of the forced slow-down of patientsâ€™ hectic lifestyle, underly-ing the importance of the routinely job-related stress on symptoms severity","Andreozzi, M.; Polese, B.; Mancino, N.; Vaino, V.; di Giorgio, G.; Rurgo, S.; Sarnelli, G.; Pesce, M.","https://doi.org/10.1016/S1590-8658(21)00641-1","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Digestive and Liver Disease; 53:S172-S173, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23561,""

"COVID-19|education|impact|mental, health|social, life|Research, &, Experimental, Medicine; Covid-19 and its impact on education, social life, and mental health among medical students in Saudi Arabia","Background: As COVID-19 pandemic reached Saudi Arabia, emergency disaster protocols were implemented to control the spread of the virus, which resulted in limitations on all public movements, including the dosure of educational institutes. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on education, social life, and mental health among medical students during COVID-19 restrictions. Methods: A cross-sectional study with a sample size of 1253 medical students from various universities in different regions in Saudi Arabia was conducted. Survey data were obtained from social media platforms using web-based self-administered questionnaires. Results: This study revealed large acceptance of online classes (64.1% of students), however, students reported less opportunities to both collaborate with colleagues, and ask questions during online dasses. Improved student's education skills including time management, self-monitoring for academic progress, access and using different types of information sources, and multitasking was demonstrated. Regarding effect of COVID-19 on students' social and habitual life, 52.9% reported satisfaction with utilization of their time, however, 52% stated socially not well connected, 36.3% never engage in physical activity, 42.4% reported increased body weight, and only 25% were able to sleep as usual. Social media platforms were at the fore front in using to overcome loneliness feeling and communicate with others. Conclusions: Positive impact of COVID-19 on education was demonstrated in terms of the large acceptance of online dasses and improvement of education skills. However, negative impact on social life was established including poor social communication, disturbed sleep habits and poor engagement in physical activity.","Shatla, M. M.; Alotaibi, N.

Dentists are at the high risk as they are directly exposed to aerosol produced and salivary droplets. Isolation and its financial impact have created physical and psychological pressure, depression, anxiety and other mental health concerns. Materials and methods: An online structured cross-sectional survey was conducted during September and October 2020. 25 item surveys were developed and was randomly circulated and distributed among the 620 Dental professionals of Ahmednagar district through link using email and messages. Psychological impact of COVID-19 was assesses using GAD -7 scale (Generalised Anxiety Disorder), which measures the presence and severity of anxiety symptoms. Descriptive statistics was applied to represent participants characteristics and Chi-Square test was applied to evaluate the level of association among variables with a significance level of p&lt;0.01. Results: Among 600 participants from the study 37% (222) displayed mild signs of anxiety, about 40% (240) displayed moderate anxiety while 23% (138) displayed severe signs of anxiety as assessed using GAD -7 scale (Generalised Anxiety Disorder). Conclusion: Dental professionals all over the world felt a moral duty to reduce routine care for fear of spreading COVID-19 among their patients and beyond, but they are understandably concerned about the financial consequences.

Internet addiction in adolescents could be a serious crisis comparable to drug addiction in terms of personal life, family relationships, social behavior, and academic standing. According to scientific evidence, people with higher emotional intelligence are less addicted to the internet. However, the type and strength of this relationship are still up for debate. Our study aims to understand the level of emotional intelligence and online game use among adolescents and emotional intelligence based on gender with the level of gaming addiction. Materials and methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 417 adolescent children of age 10-19 in the schools of Dharmapuri district from March 2021 to April 2021. Simple Random Sampling techquine is used to select the schools and students. Game Addiction Scale for Adolescent (Jeroen S. Lemmens et al) and 30 Item Emotional Intelligence Scale (TEIQue-SF) was used as a standard tool. Results: A total of 471 children between the ages of 10 and 19 were included in the study. Game addiction received the lowest possible score of 21 and the best possible score of 105. The lowest possible score for emotional intelligence was 30, and the best possible score was 150. Males and girls had no statistically significant differences in gaming addiction and emotional intelligence at (p&gt;0.05). There was a statistically significant correlation (p &lt; 0.05) between tolerance and sociability, mood modification and self-control, relapse, and sociability. Conclusion: Excessive time spent in front of a computer and web overuse may be harmful to various aspects of their lives, including social, functional, physical, and psychological aspects, and may cause them to neglect other important priorities, putting them at risk for a variety of morbidities and, in the worst-case scenario, mortality.

"Epidemics, Lockdown Measures and Vulnerable Populations: A Mixed-Methods Systematic Review of the Evidence of Impacts on Mother and Child Health in Low-and Lower-Middle-Income Countries","The aim of this research was to synthetise the existing evidence on the impact of epidemic-related lockdown measures on women and children's health in low- and lower-middle-income countries (LLMICs). A mixed-methods systematic review was conducted of qualitative, quantitative and mixed-methods evidence. Between 1st and 10th of November 2021, seven scientific databases were searched. The inclusion criteria were that the paper provided evidence on the impact of lockdown and related measures, focused on LLMICs, addressed impacts on women and child's health, addressed epidemics from 2000-2020, was peer-reviewed, provided original evidence, and was published in English. The Joanne Briggs Institute's critical appraisal tools were used to assess the quality of the studies, and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for reporting. The evidence from the papers was grouped by type of lockdown measure and categories of impact, using a narrative data-based convergent synthesis design. The review process identified 46 papers meeting the inclusion criteria from 17 countries that focussed on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and Ebola epidemics. The evidence on the decrease of utilisation of health services showed plummeting immunisation rates and faltering use of maternal and perinatal services, which was linked to a growth of premature deaths. Impacts on the mental health of children and women were convincingly established, with lockdowns associated with surges in depression, anxiety and low life satisfaction. Vulnerability may be compounded by lockdowns, as livelihoods were disrupted, and poverty levels increased. Limitations included that searches were conducted in late-2020 as new research was being published, and that some evidence not published in English may have been excluded. Epidemic-related lockdown measures carry consequences for the health of women and children in lower-income settings. Governments will need to weigh the trade-offs of introducing such measures and consider policies to mitigate their impacts on the most vulnerable.","Russo, Jesus, Deane, Osman, McCoy","https://doi.org/10.34172/ijhpm.2021.155","20211212","COVID-19; Epidemics in LMICs; Lockdown Measures; Mother and Child Health; Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions; Public Health and Quarantine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23568,""
"Does working at home compromise mental health? A study on European mature adults in COVID times","The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed working at home (WAH) into the exclusive mode of working for many European workers. Although WAH will likely remain after COVID-19, its consequences on workers' health are unclear. This study examines the association of WAH and the change of four mental health (MH) domains. We used data from the last wave of the Survey on Health, Aging, and Retirement in Europe, collected in June and July 2020 on European people aged 50 and older. We restricted our analysis to people aged 50-65 who were working before COVID-19 (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 7065). We modeled the risk of worsening of depression and anxiety feelings, sleeping trouble, and feelings of loneliness as a function of the working situation (usual setting, at home and usual setting, at home only), using logistic regressions. A first model adjusted for sociodemographic variables, a second one adding country fixed effects, and the last one adding the stringency of COVID-19-related restrictions. WAH was significantly associated with a worsening of all MH symptoms. Nevertheless, when the stringency index was factored in, no significant association of WAH was found with any of the health outcomes except for anxiety feelings (+4.3% points). However, the increased anxiety feelings among people in WAH were not greater than the one observed among nonworkers. Our findings show that WAH was not a major cause of mental health deterioration among European mature adults during the first month of the pandemic. Further evidence is needed on WAH under post-COVID-19 ""normal"" circumstances.","Perelman, Serranheira, Pita Barros, Laires","https://doi.org/10.1002/1348-9585.12299","20211211","COVID-19; Europe; mental health; teleworking; working at home","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23569,""
"Severity of COVID-19 and adverse long-term outcomes: a retrospective cohort study based on a US electronic health record database","To identify potential risk factors for adverse long-term outcomes (LTOs) associated with COVID-19, using a large electronic health record (EHR) database. Retrospective cohort study. Patients with COVID-19 were assigned into subcohorts according to most intensive treatment setting experienced. Newly diagnosed conditions were classified as respiratory, cardiovascular or mental health LTOs at &gt;30-Ã¢â€°Â¤90Ã¢â‚¬â€°or &gt;90-Ã¢â€°Â¤180 days after COVID-19 diagnosis or hospital discharge. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to identify any association of treatment setting (as a proxy for disease severity) with LTO incidence. Optum deidentified COVID-19 EHR dataset drawn from hospitals and clinics across the USA. Individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 (N=57Ã¢â‚¬â€°748) from 20 February to 4 July 2020. Incidence of new clinical conditions after COVID-19 diagnosis or hospital discharge and the association of treatment setting (as a proxy for disease severity) with their risk of occurrence. Patients were assigned into one of six subcohorts: outpatient (n=22Ã¢â‚¬â€°788), emergency room (ER) with same-day COVID-19 diagnosis (n=11Ã¢â‚¬â€°633), ER with COVID-19 diagnosisÃ¢â€°Â¤21 days before ER visit (n=2877), hospitalisation without intensive care unit (ICU; n=16Ã¢â‚¬â€°653), ICU without ventilation (n=1837) and ICU with ventilation (n=1960). Respiratory LTOs were more common than cardiovascular or mental health LTOs across subcohorts and LTO incidence was higher in hospitalised versus non-hospitalised subcohorts. Patients with the most severe disease were at increased risk of respiratory (risk ratio (RR) 1.86, 95% CI 1.56 to 2.21), cardiovascular (RR 2.65, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.49 to 4.43) and mental health outcomes (RR 1.52, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.20 to 1.91) up to 6Ã¢â‚¬â€°months after hospital discharge compared with outpatients. Patients with severe COVID-19 had increased risk of new clinical conditions up to 6Ã¢â‚¬â€°months after hospital discharge.

Longitudinal models and regression analysis was assessed using data from a longitudinal study of college students (NÃ‚Â = 1,004) spanning (T1; Fall 2019) and amidst COVID-19 (T2; Spring 2020). Despite reporting high levels of belonging pre- and post-COVID, consistent with past research, underrepresented racial/ethnic minority/first-generation students reported relatively lower sense of belonging compared to peers. Feelings of belonging buffered depressive symptoms and to a lesser extent anxiety amidst COVID among all students. College students' sense of belonging continues to be an important predictor of mental health even amidst the pandemic, conveying the importance of an inclusive climate.","Gopalan, Linden-Carmichael, Lanza","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2021.10.010","20211211","Belonging; COVID-19; College students; First-generation students; Mental health; Underrepresented racial-ethnic minority students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23571,""
"Self-care behaviors, drinking, and smoking to cope with psychological distress during COVID-19 among Chinese college students: the role of resilience","College students are vulnerable to psychological distress during COVID-19 due to pandemic-related stressors. In response to psychological distress, college students engage in various coping behaviors, such as self-care behaviors and substance use. The transactional model of stress and coping depicts a cognitive appraisal process in the stress-coping association. Psychological resilience is an essential factor for the cognitive appraisal. This study aimed to investigate the mediation effects of resilience on psycho-behavioral health in response to COVID-19 stressors. Longitudinal data were collected from 1,225 Chinese college students via web-based anonymous surveys at wave 1 (T1, between Jan 31 and Feb 11, 2020) and wave 2 (T2, between Mar 20 and Apr 3, 2020). Participants reported their COVID-19 stressors (T1), resilience (T1), psychological distress (depression and anxiety; T2), and coping behaviors (self-care behaviors, drinking, and smoking; T2). Path analysis was used for data analyses. Resilience mediated the association between COVID-19 stressors and psychological distress. Resilience together with psychological distress mediated the association of COVID-19 stressors with self-care behaviors or drinking. Resilience appears to offer protection that promotes psycho-behavioral health in college students in the face of COVID-19 stressors. Interventions for college students should attend to resilience.","Tam, Ye, Wang, Li, Lin","https://doi.org/10.1080/08870446.2021.2007913","20211211","COVID-19; anxiety; college students; depression; resilience; self-care behaviors; substance use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23572,""
"Non-contact Measurement of Pulse Rate Variability Using a Webcam and Application to Mental Illness Screening System","The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis. Mental health is critical in such uncertain situations, particularly when people are required to significantly restrict their movements and change their lifestyles. Under these conditions, many countries have turned to telemedicine to strengthen and expand mental health services. Our research group previously developed a mental illness screening system based on heart rate variability (HRV) analysis, enabling an objective and easy mental health self-check. This screening system cannot be used for telemedicine because it uses electrocardiography (ECG) and contact photoplethysmography (PPG), that are not widely available outside of a clinical setting. The purpose of this study is to enable the extension of the aforementioned system to telemedicine by the application of non-contact PPG using an RGB webcam, also called imaging- photoplethysmography (iPPG). The iPPG measurement errors occur due to changes in the relative position between the camera and the target, and due to changes in light. Conventionally, in image processing, the pixel value of the entire face region is used. We propose skin pixel extraction to eliminate blinks, eye movements, and changes in light and shadow. In signal processing, the green channel signal is conventionally used as a pulse wave owing to the absorption characteristics of blood flow. Taking advantage of the fact that the red and blue channels contain noise, we propose a signal reconstruction method for removing noise and strengthening the signal in the pulse rate variability (PRV) frequency band by weighting the three signals of the RGB camera. We conducted an experiment with 13 healthy subjects, and showed that the PRV index and pulse rate (PR) errors estimated by the proposed method were smaller than those of the conventional method. The correlation coefficients between estimated values by the proposed method and reference values of LF, HF, and PR were 0.86, 0.69, and 0.96, respectively.","Nishikawa, Unursaikhan, Hashimoto, Kurosawa, Kirimoto, Shinba, Matsui, Sun","https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9630038","20211211","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23573,""

Respiratory pandemics have negative impacts on nurses' wellbeing. While literature is replete with hospital nurses' experiences, there is less exploration of COVID-19 impacts on primary healthcare nurses. Given the importance of primary healthcare nurses in the health system, understanding their experiences is vital. A cross-sectional survey of 359 primary healthcare nurses. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) was used to measure emotional state. Data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. DASS-21 scores indicated that 39.6% of participants were experiencing depressive, anxiety or stress symptoms. Of those, 41.8% were experiencing symptoms on one scale, 26.9% were experiencing symptoms on two scales and 31.2% were experiencing symptoms across all three scales. Most participants identified that their feelings were related to COVID-19. COVID-19 is having a significant impact on primary healthcare nurses' mental health.

"Fatigue during the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence of social distancing adherence from a panel study of young adults in Switzerland","In this paper we analyze panel data (N = 400) to investigate the change in attitudes towards the Covid-19 measures and the change in compliance behavior between the first and second lockdowns in a sample of young adults from the University of Bern, Switzerland. We find considerable fatigue. While respondents expressed high acceptance of and compliance with the Covid-19 measures during the first lockdown, both acceptance and compliance behavior decreased substantially during the second lockdown. Moreover, we show via a structural equation model that respondents' compliance behavior is largely driven by the perception of how others behave and by the acceptance of the Covid-19 measures. All other effects scrutinized e.g., individual and social risk perception, trust in politics, and pro-social orientations affect compliance behavior via the acceptance of Covid-19 measures. We also conduct two tests of causality of the estimated relation between attitudes towards the measures and social distancing behavior. The first test incorporates the effect of compliance behavior reported during the first lockdown on attitudes during the second lockdown. The second test involves estimating a first difference panel regression model of attitudes on compliance behavior. The results of both tests suggest that the effect of Covid-19 attitudes on social distancing behavior can be interpreted causally.","Franzen, WÃƒÂ¶hner","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0261276","20211210","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23576,""
"COVID-19 vaccine uptake and hesitancy among HIV-infected men who have sex with men in mainland China: a cross-sectional survey","Men who have sex with men (MSM), a population bearing the greatest HIV burden in many countries, may also be vulnerable to COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccines are essential to containing the pandemic. However, vaccine hesitancy may compromise vaccine coverage. We aimed to understand the uptake of COVID-19 vaccine and factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among HIV-infected MSM in mainland China. A cross-sectional online survey among HIV-infected MSM was conducted between 13 and 21 February 2021 in mainland China. Variables including demographics, mental health status, HIV characteristics, and knowledge of and attitudes toward COVID-19 pandemic and COVID-19 vaccine were collected. Chi-square tests and multivariable logistic regression were used to analyze factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. A total of 1295 participants were included. The median age was 29.3Ã‚Â years (interquartile range [IQR] 25.2-34.0Ã‚Â years). The uptake of COVID-19 vaccine was 8.7%. Two main reasons for receiving vaccines were ""regarded vaccination as self-health protection"" (67.3%) and ""trust in domestic medical technology"" (67.3%). Among participants who did not initiate vaccination, concern about side effects (46.4%) and disclosure of HIV infection (38.6%) were top two reasons, and 47.2% had higher vaccine hesitancy. Men who had with high antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.53, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.35-0.80), often (0.26, 0.17-0.40) or sometimes (0.46, 0.31-0.67) paid attention to information about the COVID-19 vaccine, preferred domestic vaccines (0.37, 0.24-0.59), thought the pandemic had moderate (0.58, 0.38-0.90) and moderately severe or severe impact (0.54, 0.38-0.78) on immunity, who were waiting for vaccination programs organized at workplace (0.60, 0.44-0.81) and who were unaware of where to get COVID-19 vaccine (0.61, 0.45-0.82) had lower degree of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Men who were concerned about the efficacy (1.72, 1.16-2.54) and side effects (2.44, 1.78-3.35) had higher degree of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy.

"Provider and staff crisis well-being associated with trust in leadership and baseline burnout","The impact of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the emotional health of health care workers continues to be an area of active research. However, few studies have focused on those working in pediatrics and its subspecialties, as well as ancillary and non-patient-facing staff. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and associated predictors of burnout and emotional well-being of providers and staff. An anonymous electronic survey was developed evaluating demographics, pandemic experiences, possible predictor variables, and three main outcomes of burnout, psychological distress, and perceived stress. Pediatric hematology oncology (PHO) chiefs and program directors across the country were invited to participate and disseminate the survey to their programs. A total of 682/1950 (35% of invited) individuals responded to all predictor and outcome variables. Over half reported high levels of burnout and some reported moderate/high levels of distress. Prepandemic burnout and decreased trust in leadership were associated with all three outcomes. Additional predictors included having a child Ã¢â€°Â¤18Ã‚Â years at home, hospital role, and worrying about patient care or relationship with their patients. The majority (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 444/682, 65.5%) reported that their institution had made COVID-19-related mental health resources available. However, only 6.5% (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 44/682) reported utilizing these resources. While the majority of PHO providers and staff were resilient during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, many reported high levels of burnout, yet few are utilizing institutional resources. This study has highlighted several actionable areas to help identify and address factors that are wearing down the emotional well-being of providers and staff.","Moerdler, Steinberg, Jin, Cole, Kesselheim, Levy, Roth, Rosenthal","https://doi.org/10.1002/pbc.29497","20211210","burnout; leadership; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23578,""
"Services for homeless people in Germany during the COVID-19-pandemic: A descriptive study","A cross-sectional study was conducted in December 2020/January 2021 in the five significant cities of Germany. 135 of 244 identified service institutions took part in the evaluation. This evaluation included changes in institutions' operating hours as well as capacity for homeless people. Service institutions described changes in guests' characteristics, moods, and mental burden. Finally, equipment including face masks, coveralls, and gloves was investigated. In addition, the study examined how the cooperation with the health authorities works. Institutions reduced their operating hours and capacity for guests (62.4%). Increased costs, which they had to cover themselves, were reported by 70.9% of institutions. Institutions reported, that guests showed more symptoms of aggression (15%), anxiety (25%), and desperation (32%) and fewer signs of being relaxed (75%). The institutions reported room for improvement in PPE supplies and collaboration with health authorities. Services are limited for a vulnerable population, which shows changes in moods and mental health. Health authorities are not sufficiently engaged to take over the role of institutions in caring for homeless people. In the future, in-depth investigation to improve this is necessary.","GrÃƒÂ¤ske, Koppe, Neumann, Forbrig","https://doi.org/10.1111/phn.13027","20211210","COVID-19; homeless person; roofless person; service institutions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23579,""

"Protecting vulnerable communities and health professionals from COVID-19 associated mental health distress: a comprehensive approach led by a public-civil partnership in rural Chiapas, Mexico","The COVID-19 pandemic has stricken mental health worldwide. Marginalized populations in low- and middle-income countries have been the most affected, as they were already experiencing barriers to accessing mental health care prior to the pandemic and are unequally exposed to the stressors associated with the health emergency, such as economic ravages or increased risk of complicated disease outcomes. The aim of this paper is to describe a comprehensive initiative resulting from a public-civil partnership to address the increased burden of mental health illness associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in rural Chiapas, Mexico. To address the emerging health needs of the general population and health professionals resulting from the pandemic, CompaÃƒÂ±eros En Salud (CES), a non-profit civil society organization based in Chiapas, implemented a comprehensive strategy to compensate for the shortage of mental health services in the region in collaboration with the Chiapas Ministry of Health. The strategy included three components: capacity building in mental health care delivery, psychosocial support to the general population, and provision of mental health care to CES collaborating staff. In this capacity building article, implementers from CES and the government share descriptive information on the specific interventions carried out and their beneficiaries, as well as a critical discussion of the strategy followed. Through this strategy, we have been successful in filling the gaps in the public health system to ensure that CES-served populations and CES-collaborating health professionals have access to mental health care. However, further studies to quantify the impact of this intervention in alleviating the burden of mental health illnesses associated with the pandemic are needed. The current situation represents an opportunity to reimagine global mental health. Only through the promotion of community-based initiatives and the development of integrated approaches will we ensure the well-being of marginalized populations.","Ortega, Valtierra, RodrÃƒÂ­guez-Cuevas, Aranda, Preciado, Mohar","https://doi.org/10.1080/16549716.2021.1997410","20211210","Psychosocial support; capacity building; community mental health; low- and middle-income countries; task-sharing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23581,""

Cross-sectional study during August-September 2020, using an anonymous, online, self-administered survey. E-mail invitations with a survey link were sent to 2,907 students enrolled in the Bachelor of Nursing suite of courses, offered across four campuses of a single university in Victoria, Australia. Depression, anxiety and stress were assessed using the DASS-21. Data on socio-demographic and educational characteristics, self-rated physical health and exposure to COVID-19 were also collected. DASS-21 subscale scores were compared with existing data for various pre-pandemic and COVID-19 samples. Multiple regression was used to investigate factors associated with higher scores on depression, anxiety and stress subscales. The response rate was 22% (n=638). Mean scores on all DASS-21 subscales were significantly higher (p&lt;0.001) than means from all comparative sample data. The proportions of students reporting moderate to severe symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress were 48.5%, 37.2% and 40.2% respectively. Being a woman, being younger, having completed more years of study and having poorer self-rated general health were all significantly associated (p&lt;0.05) with higher scores on at least one DASS-21 subscale. Almost half of participants reported at least moderate symptoms of depression; more than a third reported at least moderate symptoms of anxiety or stress. Poor psychological wellbeing can impact students' successful completion of their studies and therefore, has implications for nursing and midwifery workforce recruitment and retention.

"Healthcare utilisation and physical activities for older adults with comorbidities in the UK during COVID-19","A major concern with COVID-19 was the impact it would have on individual health, the routine use of healthcare services, and physical activities, especially for older adults with comorbidities. To address this, we studied the association between these variables for older adults during the pandemic. To explore what policy instruments might be effective in mitigating the negative impacts, we investigated the effects of a shielding notice for those identified as vulnerable by the government and social media given it has been an important source for disseminating information of COVID-19. We employed a UK sample with 3,807 participants aged Ã¢â€°Â¥50 from an online survey administered during May and June 2020. Based on numbers of comorbidities, we separated the sample into a higher comorbidity group with those in the upper quartile of the sample (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 829) and a lower comorbidity group with the remainder (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2,978). Statistical methods include chi-squared analyses and cross-sectional regressions. We found that individuals with higher comorbidities were more likely to have poorer self-reported health and mental health and to receive a shielding notice from the government compared to those without (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.05). Decreases in physical activities were associated with poorer self-reported health and the increases were associated with better self-reported health; on the other hand, the decreases were associated with poorer mental health, but the increases did not link to better mental health. Examination of the effects of policy instruments shows that a shielding notice was positively associated with primary care use. The notice generated greater reliance on telephone/video consultations compared to in-person consultations, but the impacts were less strong for people with higher comorbidities. Frequent use of social media raised the probability of increasing physical activities and reduced that of decreasing physical activities, implying social media being an effective tool in promoting physical activities during the lockdown and subsequent restrictions.","Wang, Spencer, Hulme, Corbett, Khan, Vasconcelos Da Silva, O'Dwyer, Wright, Testad, Ballard, Creese, Smith","https://doi.org/10.1111/hsc.13675","20211210","COVID-19; comorbidity; healthcare utilisation; older adults; physical activity; shielding; social media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23590,""
"Loneliness and mental health at the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic in England","The current researchers carried out a large online survey on 18 March 2020 and unintentionally provided a 'snap shot' of how the British population was responding in the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic. This paper aims to investigate the relationship between loneliness and mental health at the early stages of the global crisis. This cross-sectional study was carried out using Prolific, an online participant recruitment platform that allowed 1608 responses in just 2Ã‚Â hr. Participants completed measures of Personal Well-being, Psychological Distress, Flourishing and Loneliness. Numerous associations between loneliness and mental health were found. A multiple regression found that 43% of the variance in loneliness can be accounted for by age, psychological distress and flourishing. Responses were also categorised into three groups: the non-lonely (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 311), averagely lonely (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1054) and the severely lonely (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 243), with analysis indicating that poorer well-being was associated with increased loneliness. Due to the cross sectional nature of this research, determining the direction of causality is not possible. It remains uncertain whether increased loneliness negatively impacted on mental health, whether poor mental health lead to increased loneliness, or both in fact. Current findings suggest that severely lonely individuals may be particularly vulnerable to psychological distress and that individuals with poor mental health may be especially prone to loneliness. Individuals experiencing loneliness and/or poor mental health will almost certainly need additional support during and beyond the pandemic.","Allen, Prescott, McHugh, Carson","https://doi.org/10.1111/hsc.13676","20211210","Covid-19; flourishing; loneliness; mental health; psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23591,""
"Exploring Post COVID-19 Outbreak Intradaily Mobility Pattern Change in College Students: A GPS-Focused Smartphone Sensing Study","With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, most colleges and universities move to restrict campus activities, reduce indoor gatherings and move instruction online. These changes required that students adapt and alter their daily routines accordingly. To investigate patterns associated with these behavioral changes, we collected smartphone sensing data using the Beiwe platform from two groups of undergraduate students at a major North American university, one from January to March of 2020 (74 participants), the other from May to August (52 participants), to observe the differences in students' daily life patterns before and after the start of the pandemic. In this paper, we focus on the mobility patterns evidenced by GPS signal tracking from the students' smartphones and report findings using several analytical methods including principal component analysis, circadian rhythm analysis, and predictive modeling of perceived sadness levels using mobility-based digital metrics. Our findings suggest that compared to the pre-COVID group, students in the mid-COVID group generally 1) registered a greater amount of midday movement than movement in the morning (8-10 a.m.) and in the evening (7-9 p.m.), as opposed to the other way around; 2) exhibited significantly less intradaily variability in their daily movement; 3) visited less places and stayed at home more everyday, and; 4) had a significant lower correlation between their mobility patterns and negative mood.","Wu, Fritz, Miller, Craddock, Kinney, Castelli, Schnyer","https://doi.org/10.3389/fdgth.2021.765972","20211211","COVID-19; GPS; circadian rhythm; college students; digital health phenotyping; mobility pattern; principal component analysis; smartphone sensing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23592,""
"Pregnant during the COVID-19 pandemic: Knowledge, concerns, attitudes and practices of Pakistani women","Data regarding pregnancy and related outcomes with COVID-19 are inconsistent, which leads to difficulties in counselling pregnant women. This brings uncertainty to pregnant women regarding mode of birth, transmission and issues that may occur in case they contract the disease. We conducted this study to assess the knowledge about COVID-19 risk during pregnancy and childbirth and to assess the concerns, attitudes, and practices of pregnant women during the pandemic. A cross-sectional survey was carried out among 376 consenting pregnant women attending antenatal clinics in Karachi, Pakistan, between 1 July and 16 July 2020, using pretested questionnaires. A total of 376 pregnant women participated in the survey. Participants had inadequate knowledge about COVID-19 risk during pregnancy, including potential vertical transmission (58.5%), preferred route of delivery (52%), safety of breastfeeding (50%), birth defects (44.7%), rooming in and skin-to-skin contact (58.5%).

"Identifying positive change within the NHS as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic","We aimed to identify positive change within the NHS as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic by assessing staff views on re-deployment, wellbeing and workplace satisfaction. An anonymous questionnaire was sent out to medical staff working across four major NHS trusts using SurveyMonkey. We surveyed staff working in NHS trusts across London and the surrounding areas. We used a randomly selected range of medical, nursing and dental staff across multiple specialties, including those who were redeployed and those who were not. We reviewed positive and negative responses to binary questions.Staff surveyed felt a greater sense of workplace camaraderie and fellowship, and generally more appreciated as NHS caregivers than they had prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is clear that the pandemic has been a catalyst for reflection, as a majority of staff (71.43%) felt there was more mental health and wellbeing support accessible in their workplace now than there was a year ago, and 75.63% felt that COVID-19 had influenced their perspective on work-life balance. The first wave of the pandemic engendered positive change, and positive staff attitudes persisted in the face of a second wave due to ascribed support, appreciation, and co-worker camaraderie and fellowship.","Barr-Keenan, Fay, Radulovic, Shetty","https://doi.org/10.7861/fhj.2021-0079","20211211","COVID-19 pandemic; attitudes of healthcare personnel; mental health; work performance; workÃ¢â‚¬â€œlife balance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23594,""
"Children and Adolescents' Psychological Well-Being Became Worse in Heavily Hit Chinese Provinces during the COVID-19 Epidemic","In light of the novel coronavirus's (COVID-19's) threat to public health worldwide, we sought to elucidate COVID-19's impacts on the mental health of children and adolescents in China. Through online self-report questionnaires, we aimed to discover the psychological effects of the pandemic and its associated risk factors for developing mental health symptoms in young people. We disseminated a mental health survey through online social media, WeChat, and QQ in the five Chinese provinces with the most confirmed cases of COVID-19 during the late stage of the country-wide lockdown. We used a self-made questionnaire that queried children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 on demographic information, psychological status, and other lifestyle and COVID-related variables. A total of 17,740 children and adolescents with valid survey data participated in the study. 10,022 (56.5%), 11,611 (65.5%), 10,697 (60.3%), 6868 (38.7%), and 6225 (35.1%) participants presented, respectively, more depressive, anxious, compulsive, inattentive, and sleep-related problems compared to before the outbreak of COVID-19. High school students reported a greater change in depression and anxiety than did middle school and primary school students. Despite the fact that very few children (0.1%) or their family members (0.1%) contracted the virus in this study, the psychological impact of the pandemic was clearly profound. Fathers' anxiety appeared to have the strongest influence on a children's psychological symptoms, explaining about 33% of variation in the child's overall symptoms. Other factors only explained less than 2% of the variance in symptoms once parents' anxiety was accounted for. The spread of COVID-19 significantly influenced the psychological state of children and adolescents in participants' view. It is clear that children and adolescents, particularly older adolescents, need mental health support during the pandemic. The risk factors we uncovered suggest that reducing fathers' anxiety is particularly critical to addressing young people's mental health disorders in this time.","Ma, Ding, Hu, Wang, Xiao, Luo, Yu, Liu, Xu, Liu, Wang, Guo, Yang, Song, Geng, Jin, Chen, Liu","https://doi.org/10.20900/jpbs.20210020","20211211","anxious symptoms; child and adolescent; compulsive symptoms; depressive symptoms; novel coronavirus; psychological state","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23595,""
"Assessment of Sequelae of COVID-19 Nearly 1 Year After Diagnosis","<b>Background:</b> A previous study has shown that 81% of the COVID-19 patients had mild or moderate symptoms. However, most studies on the sequelae in COVID-19 patients focused on severe cases and the long-term follow-up studies on the health consequences in non-severe cases are limited. The current study aimed to assess the sequelae of COVID-19 in patients nearly 1 year after diagnosis with a particular focus on the recovery of patients with non-severe COVID-19. <b>Methods:</b> We enrolled 120 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 discharged from Wuhan Union hospital west district (designated hospital for COVID-19) and Fangcang shelter hospitals between January 29, 2020 and April 1, 2020. All participants were asked to complete a series of questionnaires to assess their symptoms and quality of life and for psychological evaluation. Also, pulmonary function test, chest CT, 6-min walking test (6MWT), routine blood test, liver and kidney function tests, fasting blood glucose test, lipid test, and immunoglobulin G antibody test were performed to evaluate their health. <b>Results:</b> The mean age of the study population was 51.6 Ã‚Â± 10.8 years. Of the 120 patients, 104 (86.7%) were cases of non-severe COVID-19. The follow-up study was performed between November 23, 2020 and January 11, 2021, and the median time between the diagnosis and the follow-up was 314.5 (IQR, 296-338) days. Sleep difficulties, shortness of breath, fatigue, and joint pain were common symptoms observed during follow-up and nearly one-third of the non-severe cases had these symptoms. A total of 50 (41.7%) and 45 (37.5%) patients reported anxiety and depression, respectively. And 18.3% of the patients showed negative results in the IgG test at the follow-up, which correlated with the severity of the infection (<i>R</i> = 0.203, <i>p</i> = 0.026), and the proportion of IgG negative cases in non-severe COVID-19 patients was higher than that in the severe cases (20.2 vs. 6.3%). Pulmonary diffusion impairment was reported in 30 (26.1%) out of 115 patients, and 24 (24.2%) out of the 99 non-severe cases. The values of forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), FVC/FEV1, vital capacity (VC), total lung capacity (TLC), and residual volume (RV) were less than the normal range in 1.7, 8.6, 0.9, 11.2, 7.0, and 0.9% of the patients, respectively. A total of 55 (56.7%) out of the 97 patients showed abnormal CT findings, including ground-glass opacities (GGO), bronchiectasis, nodules, lines and bands, and fibrosis. Furthermore, there was a correlation between all the SF-36-domain scores and the duration of hospitalization, pulmonary function, and a 6MWT. <b>Conclusions:</b> At the nearly 1-year follow-up, COVID-19 survivors still had multi-system issues, including those in the respiratory functioning, radiography, quality of life, and anxiety and depression. Moreover, non-severe cases also showed some sequelae and the proportion of IgG negative cases in the non-severe patients was higher than that in severe cases. Therefore, conducting follow-ups and preventing the reinfection of SARS-CoV-2 in this group is necessary.","Zhou, Tao, Shang, Liu, Pan, Jin, Wang, Hu, Li, Zhang, Fu, Yang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.717194","20211211","SARS-CoV-2; follow-up; long-term COVID-19; multi-system assessment; sequelae","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23596,""
"Aging Immune System and Its Correlation With Liability to Severe Lung Complications","Aging is considered to be a decline in physical and physiological events that extensively affect the body's immunity, and is linked with deterioration in both innate and adaptive immune responses. The immune system exhibits profound age-associated variations, known as immunosenescence, comprising a significantly low production of B and T lymphocytes in bone marrow and thymus, a decreased function of mature lymphocytes in secondary lymphoid tissues, a decrease in the synthesis of fresh naÃƒÂ¯ve T cells, and reduced activation of T cells. Elderly individuals face a greater risk for many diseases particularly respiratory diseases due to their poor response to immune challenges as vigorously as the young. The current review explored the aging immune system, highlight the mortality rates of severe lung complications, such as pneumonia, COVID-19, asthma, COPD, lung cancer, IPF, and acute lung injury, and their correlation with aging immunity.

"Mental Health Problems Due to Social Isolation During the COVID-19 Pandemic in a Mexican Population","<b>Introduction:</b> Social isolation due to the COVID-19 pandemic has been identified as a risk factor of several mental disorders. Therefore, the present work aimed to evaluate the effect of social isolation experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of a Mexican population. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in individuals of 18 years of age and over. The questioner was structured to identify onset or worsening of psychiatric symptoms due to social isolation by COVID-19. The survey included changes in eating habits, changes in personal hygiene habits, the starting the use or increased the use of psychoactive substances, symptoms of depression or post-traumatic stress. <b>Results:</b> A total of 1,011 individuals were included in the analysis. The majority were women (68.84%). Changes in eating habits were reported in 38.51% of the participants, 67.80% reported having their physical self-perception distorted or having started a low-calorie diet. Regarding symptoms of depression, 46.10% participants indicated to have at least one depressive symptom, and 4.46% reported suicidal ideation during social isolation. Interestingly, 6.09% of individuals reported that they used to have depressive symptoms prior the COVID-19 pandemic and those symptoms decreased due to social isolation. Additionally, 2.27% of individuals presented symptoms of post-traumatic stress due to the possibility of getting COVID-19. <b>Conclusions:</b> In this work we identified how social isolation has impacted the mental health of the Mexican population. We observed that practically all the symptoms evaluated were affected during isolation, such as personal hygiene and eating habits. Depression and suicidal ideation were the ones that increased the most in the general population, while in individuals who had symptoms of depression before isolation, these symptoms decreased during social isolation.","Genis-Mendoza, MartÃƒÂ­nez-MagaÃƒÂ±a, LÃƒÂ³pez-NarvÃƒÂ¡ez, GonzÃƒÂ¡lez-Castro, JuÃƒÂ¡rez-Rojop, Nicolini, Tovilla-ZÃƒÂ¡rate, Castillo-Avila","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.703450","20211211","COVID-19; Mexican population; mental health; pandemic; social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23598,""
"Psychiatric hospitalization during the two SARS-CoV-2 pandemic waves: New warnings for acute psychotic episodes and suicidal behaviors","The subsequent waves of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic have represented a dramatic health emergency characterized by significant consequences on mental health. Diachronic variations in the incidence rates of acute relapse of psychiatric disorders may represent significant ""sentinel events"" for assessing the mental health response to an unprecedented stressful event. To investigate the variation in psychiatric hospitalization rates and differences in sociodemographic and clinical-psychopathological peculiarities at Bologna ""Maggiore"" General Hospital Psychiatric Ward (GHPW) between the first two waves SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the same periods of the previous 3 years. The secondary purpose of the study was to suggest a diachronic response pathway to stress by reporting additional literature data on coping strategies. This observational and retrospective study collected information on admission to the GHPW at the ""Maggiore"" Hospital in Bologna in the index periods defined as follows: the first period between February 24, 2020 and April 30, 2020 (first epidemic wave) and the second period between October 8, 2020, and January 7, 2021 (second pandemic wave). Absolute numbers and proportion of admitted patients, their sociodemographic and clinical-psychopathological characteristics were compared with the same parameters recorded in the two same periods of the previous 3 years. No strict inclusion or exclusion criteria were provided in the data collection to collect information on all patients requiring acute psychiatric hospitalization. During the first wave, there was a significant reduction in hospitalization rates, although there was a simultaneous increase in compulsory hospitalizations and the acute relapse of schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders. During the second wave, hospitalization rates reached those recorded during the same period of the previous 3 years, mainly due to the rise of bipolar and related disorders, depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, trauma- and stressor-related disorders and suicidal behaviors. The coping strategies adopted during the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic protected the vulnerable population from the general risk of clinical-psychopathological acute relapse, even if they increased the susceptibility to run into schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder relapses. In the medium-long term (as in the second pandemic wave), the same strategies do not play protective roles against the stress associated with the pandemic and social restriction measures. Indeed, during the second wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, an increase in total hospitalization rate, suicidal behaviors and the incidence rate of bipolar and related disorders, depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, trauma- and stressor-related disorders was observed.","Panariello, Longobardi, Cellini, De Ronchi, Atti","https://doi.org/10.5498/wjp.v11.i11.1095","20211211","Anxiety disorders, trauma- and stressor-related disorders; Bipolar and related disorders; Coping strategies; Depressive disorders; SARS-CoV-2; Schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders; Suicide behavior","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23599,""
"Healthy diet, depression and quality of life: A narrative review of biological mechanisms and primary prevention opportunities","Unipolar depressive disorder (UDD) affects more than 264 million people worldwide and was projected well before the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic to be the leading cause of disability-adjusted life years lost in 2030. It is imperative for leading economies to implement preventive strategies targeted towards UDD, given consistent policies are currently lacking. Recently established similarities between the aetiological hypotheses of depression and cardiometabolic diseases are shifting paradigms within this field. It is believed that dietary practices could potentially reduce the incidence of depression; similar to their effects on metabolism. Thus, the aim of this review was to compile current evidence on healthy dietary patterns as suitable contributors towards primary prevention strategies against UDD. Most of the well-known biological mechanisms behind depression have been positively associated with healthful diets and dietary patterns to varying degrees. Interestingly, a common factor of UDD is the production and overall effects of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-ÃŽÂ±, and C-reactive protein. These compounds have been associated with depressive symptoms, disturbances in neuroendocrine function, leaky gut, monoamine activity and brain function, while also being key factors in the development of cardiometabolic diseases. The Mediterranean diet (MD) in particular, is well supported by first-level evidence regarding its preventive qualities against metabolic and cardiovascular diseases and thus considered a model for healthy eating by various organizations. In one of the few clinical trials investigating these associations, the PREDIMED trial, individuals with diabetes assigned to a MD supplemented with mixed tree nuts experienced a 41% relative risk reduction for developing depression. Lastly, there is a need to include health related quality of life as an indicator of physical and mental well-being, considering its putative associations with depression and suicide risk. Going forward, focusing on clinical trials, using precise nutritional assessments, and identifying nutritional biomarkers which may be related to depression are needed to fully support the implementation of dietary recommendations in the field of psychiatry.","Pano, MartÃƒÂ­nez-Lapiscina, SayÃƒÂ³n-Orea, Martinez-Gonzalez, Martinez, Sanchez-Villegas","https://doi.org/10.5498/wjp.v11.i11.997","20211211","Depression; Epidemiology; Mediterranean; Nutrition; Primary prevention; Quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23600,""
"Invisible Spread and Perceived Stress Amidst COVID-19","There are limited reports on the mental health toll associated with the fear of spreading coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated stay-at-home orders. The goal of the present study was to characterize the self-reported stress of participants from the Kansas City Metropolitan Area (KCMA) and to examine the relation between potential for asymptomatic spread and perceived stress. This prospective convenience sample study enrolled 461 participants from May 4 to May 22, 2020. Participants were consented and surveyed prior to free SARS-CoV-2 testing. Measures employed included the Perceived Stress Scale-10 and a comprehensive COVID-19 questionnaire. During the study period, testing resources were limited. In the community, only symptomatic individuals or close contacts of known positives could be tested. Our program aimed to reach those who were unable to access testing resources due to their asymptomatic status or other barriers to care. Worry about asymptomatic spread was associated significantly with greater perceived stress (p &lt; 0.001). Higher stress was reported among women (p &lt; 0.001), Hispanic/Latinx (p = 0.001), non-Black/ African American individuals (p &lt; 0.001), and those reporting the presence of COVID-19 symptoms (p = 0.001). The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant economic, social, and health disruptions around the world. Distress is significantly related to concern over unintentionally contributing to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 through asymptomatic transmission. In addition to examining outcomes like distress, future research should characterize the modifiable psychotherapeutic processes that might be targeted through intervention among those experiencing distress.","Thomas, Hamilton, Francis, Sykes","https://doi.org/10.17161/kjm.vol14.15612","20211211","COVID-19; asymptomatic viral shedding; pandemics; psychological distress; public health practice","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23601,""
"A Family-Focused Intervention for Parental Mental Illness: A Practitioner Perspective","<b>Background:</b> Parental mental illness (PMI) is common and can lead to children developing mental disorders. Family Talk (FT) is a well-known and widely implemented intervention designed to reduce the risk of transgenerational psychopathology. However, given the research to practise ""gap,"" very little qualitative research, to date, has investigated practitioner experiences in implementing FT. This study aimed to explore the practitioner-perceived barriers and facilitators to the implementation and sustainability of FT within mainstream mental health settings. <b>Methods:</b> This qualitative study was nested within a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of Family Talk [<i>N</i> = 86 families (139 parents, 221 children)] within 15 adult (AMHS), child (CAMHS), primary care mental health, and child protection sites in Ireland. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups were undertaken with a purposive sample of clinicians (<i>n</i> = 31) and managers (<i>n</i> = 10), based on their experiences of implementing FT. Interview data were transcribed verbatim, analysed using constructivist grounded theory, and informed by Fixsen's implementation science framework. <b>Results:</b> Service providers highlighted a number of benefits for approximately two thirds of families across different diagnoses and mental health settings (AMHS/CAMHS/primary care). Sites varied in their capacity to embed FT, with key enablers identified as acquiring managerial and organisational support, building clinician skill, and establishing interagency collaboration. Implementation challenges included: recruitment difficulties, stresses in working with multiply-disadvantaged families, disruption in delivery due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, and sustainability concerns (e.g., perceived fit of FT with organisational remit/capacity, systemic and cultural barriers to change). <b>Conclusion:</b> This study is only the second qualitative study ever conducted to explore practitioner experiences in implementing FT, and the first conducted within the context of an RCT and national research programme to introduce family-focused practise (FFP) for families living with PMI. The findings illuminate the successes and complexities of implementing FFP in a country without a ""think family"" infrastructure, whilst highlighting a number of important generalisable lessons for the implementation of FT, and other similar interventions, elsewhere.","Furlong, Mulligan, McGarr, O'Connor, McGilloway","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.783161","20211211","COPMI; children; family talk; implementation; mental disorder; mental illness; parents; qualitative","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23602,""
"The Influence of Telemedicine and Compassionate Care on the Quality of Life and Mental Health of Patients with Epilepsy in Northeastern China During the COVID-19 Crisis","To understand the influence of telemedicine and compassionate care on the quality of life and mental health of patients with epilepsy (PWE) in northeastern China during the COVID-19 crisis. Physicians in the epilepsy department conducted a questionnaire survey on PWE on February 2020. The Quality Of Life In Epilepsy-31 (QOLIE-31), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) were used. The intervention (IG) group received compassionate care and follow-up through telemedicine equipment every week, while the nonintervention (NIG) group did not receive. The questionnaire survey was conducted again three month later. Ninety patients were recruited: mean age 39.91Ã‚Â±15.57 in the IG, 37.39Ã‚Â±11.69 in the NIG, 46 (51.1%) were men. Twenty patients had difficulty in purchasing antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Seven patients reported seizure in the last 1 month. Only 1 patient (2.2%) consulted the emergency department. Up to 84 patients' lives were affected. Fifteen (33.3%) of the IG and 20 (44.4%) of the NIG patients stated that their family income had decreased, and among them, 13 (28.9%) in the IG group and 10 (22.2%) in the NIG group stated that they were unemployed. 3 months later, the interaction between groups and time of QOLIE-31 was significant, F (1, 88) = 16.996, p&lt;0.001; the interaction between group and time on the PHQ-9 was significant, F (1, 88)= 14.992, p&lt;0.001; the interaction between group and time on the QAD-7 was significant, F (1, 88)= 6.026, p&lt;0.001. Our study found that during the COVID-19 outbreak, when patients were in a lockdown, telemedicine and compassionate care were effective and successful in managing PWE in northeastern China.

"A randomized trial of online single-session interventions for adolescent depression during COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic has potentially increased the risk for adolescent depression. Even pre-pandemic, &lt;50% of youth with depression accessed care, highlighting needs for accessible interventions. Accordingly, this randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04634903 ) tested online single-session interventions (SSIs) during COVID-19 in adolescents with elevated depression symptoms (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2,452, ages 13-16). Adolescents from all 50 US states, recruited via social media, were randomized to one of three SSIs: a behavioural activation SSI, an SSI teaching that traits are malleable and a supportive control. We tested each SSI's effects on post-intervention outcomes (hopelessness and agency) and three-month outcomes (depression, hopelessness, agency, generalized anxiety, COVID-19-related trauma and restrictive eating). Compared with the control, both active SSIs reduced three-month depressive symptoms (Cohen's dÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.18), decreased post-intervention and three-month hopelessness (dÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.16-0.28), increased post-intervention agency (dÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.15-0.31) and reduced three-month restrictive eating (dÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.12-17).

"Psychological state of a sample of patients with mood disorders during the first French COVID-19 lockdown","Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, evidence shows the negative psychological impact of lockdown measures in the general population. It is also important to identify predictors of psychological distress in vulnerable people, particularly patients with history of depressive episodes (the most prevalent psychiatric disorder), in order to adapt mental health strategies for future lockdown measures. This study aim was to (1) compare in 69 healthy controls (HC) and 346 patients with a major depressive episode in the two previous years (PP) self-reported psychological symptoms (depression, anxiety, insomnia, suicidal ideation, traumatic stress, anger) and living conditions during the first national French lockdown, and (2) identify predictors of significant psychological distress in PP. The levels of psychological symptoms were very low in HC compared with PP, independently of the living conditions. Half of PP had no psychiatric contact during the lockdown. Loneliness and boredom were independent predictors of depression, anxiety and insomnia, whereas daily physical activity was a protective factor. Virtual contacts protected against suicidal ideation. Our results highlight the need of specific strategies to target loneliness and boredom and to improve care access, including telepsychiatry.

"Systemic inflammation and emotional responses during the COVID-19 pandemic","The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on population mental health is of global concern. Inflammatory processes are thought to contribute to mental ill-health, but their role in experiences of psychological distress during the pandemic has not been investigated. We tested the hypothesis that elevated inflammatory biomarkers (high-sensitivity plasma C-reactive protein [CRP] and plasma fibrinogen) measured pre-pandemic would be positively predictive of increased depressive symptoms experienced during the pandemic. Data were analysed from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), with 3574 individuals aged &gt;50 for CRP and 3314 for fibrinogen measured in waves 8 (2016/17) or 9 (2018/19). Depressive symptoms were measured with a short version of the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) pre-pandemic (2016-2019) and during the pandemic (June/July 2020). Participants with higher baseline CRP concentrations had 40% higher odds of developing depressive symptoms during the pandemic (OR<sub>adjusted</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.40, 95% CI 1.12-1.73, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.003) after full adjustment. Fibrinogen concentrations were also associated with depressive symptoms during the pandemic (OR<sub>adjusted</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.23, 95% CI 1.04-1.46, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.019), but this association was no longer significant after controlling for lifestyle factors (smoking status, alcohol consumption and physical activity). In this large population study, systemic inflammation measured 1-3 years pre-pandemic was associated with greater depressed mood during the early months of the pandemic. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that higher levels of inflammation increase the vulnerability of older people to impaired mental health in the presence of the widespread stress of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hamilton, Cadar, Steptoe","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-021-01753-5","20211210","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23606,""

"Long-term outcomes following severe COVID-19 infection: a propensity matched cohort study","There are limited data describing the long-term outcomes of severe COVID-19. We aimed to evaluate the long-term psychosocial and physical consequences of severe COVID-19 for patients. We conducted a multicentre observational cohort study; between 3 and 7 months posthospital discharge, patients who had been admitted to critical care due to severe COVID-19 were invited to an established recovery service. Standardised questionnaires concerning emotional, physical and social recovery, including information on employment, were completed by patients. Using propensity score matching, we explored outcomes between patients admitted to critical care with and without COVID-19, using data from the same recovery programme. Between July 2020 and December 2020, 93 patients who had been admitted to critical with COVID-19 participated. Emotional dysfunction was common: 46.2% of patients had symptoms of anxiety and 34.4% symptoms of depression. At follow-up 53.7% of previously employed patients had returned to employment; there was a significant difference in return to employment across the socio-economic gradient, with lower numbers of patients from the most deprived areas returning to employment (p=0.03). 91 (97.8%) COVID-19 patients were matched with 91 non-COVID-19 patients. There were no significant differences in any measured outcomes between the two cohorts. Emotional and social problems are common in survivors of severe COVID-19 infection. Coordinated rehabilitation is required to ensure patients make an optimal recovery.","McPeake, Shaw, MacTavish, Blyth, Devine, Fleming, Griffin, Gemmell, Grose, Henderson, Henderson, Hogg, King, McInnes, O'Brien, Puxty, Rainey, Sharma, Sim, Strachan, Siebert, Quasim","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjresp-2021-001080","20211210","ARDS; COVID-19","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23608,""
"Mental health and conspirasism in health care professionals during the spring 2020 COVID-19 lockdown in Greece","The aim of the study was to investigate mental health and conspiracy theory beliefs concerning COVID-19 among Health Care Professionals (HCPs). During lockdown, an online questionnaire gathered data from 507 HCPs (432 females aged 33.86Ã‚Â±8.63 and 75 males aged 39.09Ã‚Â±9.54). A post-stratification method to transform the study sample was used; descriptive statistics were calculated. Anxiety and probable depression were increased 1.5-2-fold and were higher in females and nurses. Previous history of depression was the main risk factor. The rates of the believing in conspiracy theories concerning the COVID-19 were alarming with the majority of individuals (especially females) following some theory to at least some extend. The current paper reports high rates of depression, distress and suicidal thoughts in the HCPs during the lockdown, with a high prevalence of beliefs in conspiracy theories. Female gender and previous history of depression acted as risk factors while the belief in conspiracy theories might act as a protective factor.

"Mental health condition of physicians working frontline with COVID-19 patients in Bangladesh","The impact of the unpredictable COVID-19 pandemic had triggered new challenges for mental health. This quick survey aimed to identify the mental health status of physicians who served the people during COVID-19 in Bangladesh. The cross sectional survey was conducted adopting a quantitative approach and using an online questionnaire through Facebook Platform Group. Data was collected from August-October, 2020, on socio-demographic status, information on COVID-19 and questionnaires about Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21). A total of 395 participants were enrolled from all eight administrative divisions of Bangladesh. Our study reported a higher prevalence of depression (55.3%), anxiety (35.2%), and stress (48.4%) among 347 participants. Female physicians were found to have more stress (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.16, 95% CI: 1.09 - 4.30) compared to the male. Physicians who were previously diagnosed as mentally ill were found to be significantly more depressed (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.45, 95% CI: 1.07 - 11.10) and stressed (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.22, 95% CI: 1.48 - 12.02) compared to them who did not. Along with that, having a chronic disease, working in non-government and COVID hospitals significantly contributed to poor mental health outcomes. The study findings denoted that, the mental health of physicians was deeply affected by the pandemic situation.

Secondly, we aimed to investigate the associations between the perceived changes in leisure time use, the leisure activities adolescents engaged in, and the associations with well-being during the Spring 2020 lockdown in Czechia. Data from 3438 participants were included in this study (54.2% girls; mean age = 13.45, SD = 1.62). First, the initial number of items measuring leisure, electronic media use, and sports was reduced through Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Multivariate linear regression models tested the associations between leisure domains and mental well-being Results: The amount of leisure time, together with socially active leisure and sports and physical activity, formed the strongest positive predictors of mental well-being, whereas idle activities and time spent on electronic media acted as negative predictors. The amount of time spent doing schoolwork was unrelated to mental well-being. Overall, our results support the idea that leisure as a promoting factor for well-being is not just a matter of its amount but rather of engagement in meaningful and fulfilling activities.","Cosma, Pavelka, Badura","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182312812","20211211","COVID-19; active leisure; adolescents; free time; leisure; mental health; physical activity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23612,""
"Earth Dreams: Reimagining ARPA for Health of People, Places and Planet","Bold new approaches are urgently needed to overcome global health challenges. The proposed Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H) is intended to provide rapid health breakthroughs. While new technologies for earlier disease detection and more effective treatment are critical, we urge equal attention be given to the wider (physical, emotional, social, political, and economic) environmental ecosystems driving the non-communicable disease (NCD) crisis in the first place. This requires an integrated, cross-sectoral vision that spans the interwoven connections affecting health across the scales of people, places, and planet. This wider ""exposome"" perspective considers biopsychosocial factors that promote resilience and reduce vulnerabilities of individuals and communities over time-the many variables driving health disparities. Since life course health is strongly determined by early life environments, early interventions should be prioritized as a matter of effectiveness and social justice. Here, we explore the origins of the Advanced Research Project Agency and point to its potential to build integrated solutions, with wisdom and ethical value systems as a compass. Since the planned ARPA-H is anticipated to spawn international collaborations, the imagined concept is of relevance to a broad audience of researchers. With appropriate input, the quest for health equity through personalized, precision medicine while deconstructing unacceptable structural inequities may be accelerated.","Logan, Berman, Prescott","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182312788","20211212","ARPA-H; COVID-19; biodiversity losses; climate change; developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD); environmental degradation; health inequities; mental health crisis; non-communicable diseases (NCDs); planetary health; social and economic determinants of health; social justice; the exposome; value systems","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23613,""
"The Correlation between Nurses' COVID-19 Infections and Their Emotional State and Work Conditions during the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has significantly influenced the functioning of Polish hospitals, and thus, the working conditions of nurses. Research on the presence of specific negative emotions in nurses may help identify deficits in the future, as well as directing preventive actions. The present research was performed among nurses (<i>n</i> = 158) working in Polish healthcare facilities during the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, where Group A (<i>n</i> = 79) consisted of nurses diagnosed with COVID-19, and Group B (<i>n</i> = 79) nurses who have never been infected with COVID-19. To perform the research, the Courtauld Emotional Control Scale (CECS), Trait Anxiety Scale (Polish: SL-C) and the authors' survey questionnaire were used. A positive test result was generally determined more often among nurses who indicated a noninfectious ward as their main workplace, compared to nurses employed in infectious wards (64.55% positive vs 33.45% negative). Over a half of the subjects identified moderate levels of emotion suppression as the method to regulate strong emotions, while one-quarter cited high levels of suppression. Anxiety was suppressed at high and moderate levels by 97% of the subjects, depression by 86.71%, and anger by 79.48%. Infection with COVID-19 results in a higher level of anxiety and depression, as well as a feeling of increased work load.","Malinowska-LipieÃ…â€ž, Suder, Wadas, GabryÃ…â€º, KÃƒÂ³zka, Gniadek, Brzostek","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182312715","20211211","COVID-19; emotions; nurses; workload; workplace","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23614,""

The baseline survey was conducted in January 2020 (T1). The respondents in T1 were invited to participate in March (T2) and November 2020 (T3). Psychological distress was assessed by the Kessler 6 Scale. Participants were divided into two categories: a group with and a group without PFA experience. Participants were further divided between physicians and healthcare professionals other than physicians, because physicians are more likely to experience morally injurious events. A mixed-model repeated-measures ANOVA was conducted as an indicator of the group differences. In T1, 398 healthcare professionals participated. The longitudinal analysis of healthcare professionals other than physicians showed that psychological distress was significantly greater in the group without PFA experience than in the group with PFA experience (T1 vs. T3). This study showed psychological distress among healthcare professionals other than physicians was significantly greater in the group without PFA experience than in the group with PFA experience during the COVID-19 pandemic, but the results were not consistent among physicians.","Asaoka, Koido, Kawashima, Ikeda, Miyamoto, Nishi","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182312474","20211211","COVID-19; PFA; depression; healthcare professionals; pandemic; psychological distress; psychological first aid","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23615,""

"Impact of COVID-19 on dental education in Europe: the students' perspective","COVID-19 pandemic impacted dental students and postgraduate residents world-wide, forcing them to rapidly adapt to new forms of teaching and learning. Dental school leaderships needed to ensure the academic continuity, therefore the majority of the in-person actives were transitioned into a virtual setting. The aim of this study was to identify students' perception regarding the measures taken to adapt during the pandemic by different dental schools in the European Region. This cross-sectional study utilised a validated 37-questions survey. Ethical approval was obtained from the Trinity College Dublin, Ireland. Using this instrument, the perceptions of the European dental students regarding the impact of COVID-19 on their education and mental health were identified. The questions were divided into categories: standard demographic information; models of education during the COVID-19 pandemic (types of teaching, examination and other educational activities) and support received. The survey was administered through electronic online tools, and all responses remained confidential. The data was processed through quantitative and qualitative analysis. A total of 879 student responses to the survey from 34 countries in the European Region were included in this study. When asked about the time spent on their education, 50% of the participants (n=435) reported spending less time on their education and 30% (n=265) reported spending more time. The types of teaching included showed a heterogenous approach, varying from online simulations to problem-solving for the didactic setting, or a hybrid model with group activities for the clinical setting. There were broad splits in satisfaction with the education delivered, with 44% (n=382) being either satisfied or very satisfied and 31% (n=279) being either unsatisfied or very unsatisfied. Students were most concerned with their clinical experience and skills. The qualitative and quantitative data compiled in this cross-sectional study enables a direct comparison between different approaches to adapt dental education during the COVID-19 in the European Region. Future studies are recommended that will include compiling perceptions from the staff, faculty and administrators on the transition as well.","Coughlan, TimuÃ…Å¸, Crnic, SrdoÃ„Â, Halton, Dragan","https://doi.org/10.1111/eje.12736","20211209","COVID-19; dental education; dental student; perception","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23617,""
"Mental capacity legislation and communication disability: A cross-sectional survey exploring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the provision of specialist decision-making support by UK SLTs","Mental capacity legislation in the UK is designed to safeguard the rights of people who may need support, or may be unable, to make autonomous decisions. Very limited evidence has been published about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the application of mental capacity legislation and, to our knowledge, none on the ability of speech and language therapists (SLTs) to support people with communication disabilities to engage in decision-making. To describe how UK SLTs supported people with communication disabilities to make decisions and participate in mental capacity assessments, best interests decision-making and advance care planning during the COVID-19 pandemic. This descriptive, cross-sectional study used an online survey to collect quantitative and qualitative data about SLTs' practice experiences between August and November 2020. SLTs working with a range of adult clinical populations in different care settings were sampled purposively from all UK jurisdictions. Participants were recruited through professional networks and social media. Quantitative data were summarized using descriptive statistics. Qualitative data were analysed thematically. Data were collected from 107 SLTs working in a range of settings across all four UK nations. The sample included SLTs working with people with neurological conditions, learning disabilities, mental health conditions and acute confusion. The need for SLT support appeared to increase during the pandemic. Most respondents were still able to offer support; however, the amount and nature of support varied. Quality of support was impacted by adjustments associated with social distancing and infection control restrictions. Personal protective equipment (PPE) was identified as a barrier to communication. Indirect working methods (e.g., telehealth) were inaccessible to some people with communication disabilities. Most respondents felt confident that legal requirements were upheld, but suggested this group was less able to engage in decision-making and had reduced access to support to manage their own health conditions. Some SLT services were limited in their ability to meet the decision-making support needs of people with communication disabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic due to structural and systemic barriers. This suggests that existing inequities in the provision of care for people with communication disabilities in the UK were amplified during the pandemic. What is already known on the subject People with communication disabilities may require support from healthcare professionals, including SLTs, to make decisions and communicate their wishes and preferences about their care, in line with mental capacity legislation. There is a lack of published evidence relating to how changes in staff deployment and resource during the COVID-19 pandemic may have impacted on the ability of SLTs to provide this support. What this paper adds to existing knowledge This study provides novel evidence about the ways in which UK SLTs supported people with communication disabilities to engage in mental capacity assessments, best interests decision-making and advance care planning during the COVID-19 pandemic. In some cases, the amount and quality of decision-making support available was affected negatively due to changes in healthcare delivery and resource management and SLT working practices. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? This study suggests that some people with communication disabilities experienced greater barriers to receiving professional support to maximize their autonomy and manage their health conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Speech and language therapy services and healthcare commissioners should consider how best to ensure equitable service delivery to this population in resource-limited situations.","Jayes, Borrett, Bose","https://doi.org/10.1111/1460-6984.12685","20211209","COVID-19, decision-making, disability, mental capacity, speech and language therapists; adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23618,""
"Patterns and predictors of sick leave among Swedish non-hospitalized healthcare and residential care workers with Covid-19 during the early phase of the pandemic","Healthcare and residential care workers represent two occupational groups that have, in particular, been at risk of Covid-19, its long-term consequences, and related sick leave. In this study, we investigated the predictors of prolonged sick leave among healthcare and residential workers due to non-hospitalized Covid-19 in the early period of the pandemic. This study is based on a patient register (n = 3209) and included non-hospitalized healthcare or residential care service workers with a positive RT- PCR for SARS-CoV-2 (n = 433) between March and August 2020. Data such as socio-demographics, clinical characteristics, and the length of sick leave because of Covid-19 and prior to the pandemic were extracted from the patient's electronic health records. Prolonged sick leave was defined as sick leave Ã¢â€°Â¥ 3 weeks, based on the Swedish pandemic policy. A generalized linear model was used with a binary distribution, adjusted for age, gender, and comorbidity in order to predict prolonged sick leave. Of 433 (77% women) healthcare and residential care workers included in this study, 14.8% needed longer sick leave (&gt; 3 weeks) due to Covid-19. Only 1.4% of the subjects were on sick leave because of long Covid. The risk of sick leave was increased two-fold among residential care workers (adjusted RR 2.14 [95% CI 1.31-3.51]). Depression/anxiety (adjusted RR 2.09 [95% CI 1.31-3.34]), obesity (adjusted RR 1.96 [95% CI 1.01-3.81]) and dyspnea at symptom onset (adjusted RR 2.47 [95% CI 1.55-3.92]), sick leave prior to the pandemic (3-12 weeks) (adjusted RR 2.23 [95% CI 1.21-4.10]) were associated with longer sick leave. From a public health perspective, considering occupational category, comorbidity, symptoms at onset, and sick leave prior to the pandemic as potential predictors of sick leave in healthcare may help prevent staff shortage.","Kisiel, Nordqvist, Westman, Svartengren, Malinovschi, Janols","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0260652","20211212","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23619,""
"Perception of the threat, mental health burden, and healthcare-seeking behavior change among psoriasis patients during the COVID-19 pandemic","This study aimed to investigate the perceived threat, mental health outcomes, behavior changes, and associated predictors among psoriasis patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 has been known to increase the health risks of patients with psoriasis owing to patients' immune dysregulation, comorbidities, and immunosuppressive drug use. A total of 423 psoriasis patients not infected with COVID-19 was recruited from the Department of Dermatology, National Taiwan University Hospital Hsin-Chu Branch, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, and China Medical University Hospital from May 2020 to July 2020. A self-administered questionnaire was used to evaluate the perceived threat, mental health, and psychological impact on psoriasis patients using the Perceived COVID-19-Related Risk Scale score for Psoriasis (PCRSP), depression, anxiety, insomnia, and stress-associated symptoms (DAISS) scales, and Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), respectively. Over 94% of 423 patients with psoriasis perceived threat to be Ã¢â€°Â¥ 1 due to COVID-19; 18% of the patients experienced psychological symptoms more frequently Ã¢â€°Â¥ 1, and 22% perceived psychological impact during the pandemic to be Ã¢â€°Â¥ 1. Multivariable linear regression showed that the higher psoriasis severity and comorbidities were significantly associated with higher PCRSP, DAISS, and IES-R scores. The requirement for a prolonged prescription and canceling or deferring clinic visits for psoriasis treatment among patients are the two most common healthcare-seeking behavior changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Psoriasis patients who perceived a higher COVID-19 threat were more likely to require a prolonged prescription and have their clinic visits canceled or deferred. Surveillance of the psychological consequences in psoriasis patients due to COVID-19 must be implemented to avoid psychological consequences and inappropriate treatment delays or withdrawal.","Chiu, Chang Liao, Lin, Huang","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0259852","20211212","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23620,""

There were no statistically significant differences in symptoms of depression, anxiety, or the quality of social relationships between women seeking treatment for PPD before or during the pandemic. However, mothers reported poorer relationships with their infants, and there was evidence of more negative emotionality in their infants during COVID-19. The pandemic may not have worsened depression, anxiety, relationships with partners, or social support in mothers seeking treatment for PPD, but appears to have contributed to poorer mother-infant interactions and maternal reports of more negative emotionality in their infants. These findings highlight the importance of identifying women with possible PPD, supporting mother-infant interactions, and monitoring their infants during COVID-19 and beyond.","Chang, Layton, Amani, Merza, Owais, Van Lieshout","https://doi.org/10.1080/14767058.2021.2014810","20211209","COVID-19; Postpartum depression; anxiety; social support; temperament","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23622,""
"Sharing positive behavior change made during COVID-19 lockdown: A mixed-methods coproduction study","The negative consequences of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) national lockdowns have been well documented, including the worsening of mental health for many and the amplification of preexisting inequalities. As a counterpoint, the current study uses a mixed-methods coproduction approach to share psychosocial insights into the adoption of positive changes made during national lockdown in Scotland. This study examines the psychosocial patterning of positive behavior changes and the psychosocial processes by which positive change was realized and shared these insights with partner organizations. A sequential mixed-methods design included an online survey (N = 2,445) assessing positive changes in sleep and physical activity patterns and the role of sociodemographics, mood, social support, coping, and resilience using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Interviews were performed with a purposive diverse subsample of people self-reporting high levels of positive change (n = 48) and used thematic analysis. The survey identified that positive behavior change was significantly patterned by age, gender, and vulnerability to COVID-19. Higher levels of positive reframing and active coping in relation to stress were associated with higher levels of positive behavior change. Higher symptoms of depression, planning, and self-distraction were associated with less positive behavior change. Thematic analysis showed the centrality of perceptions of time, opportunities to self-reflect and engage with the natural world, access support in diverse ways, actively build routine, and purposefully build self-efficacy and a sense of control were key to initiating positive change. The current study yields insights into achieving positive behavior change at a time of international crisis.

"Zoom-in to zone-out: Therapists report less therapeutic skill in telepsychology versus face-to-face therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in a rapid transition from in-person therapy to teletherapy. This study examined mental health providers' perceptions of the differences between in-person therapy and teletherapy in common therapeutic attributes and identified therapist characteristics that predicted differences. A sample of 440 therapists and trainees completed an online survey that assessed their provision of clinical services since the outbreak of COVID-19. Therapists provided ratings for having used 28 therapeutic attributes (e.g., empathy, emotional expression) and skills for in-person therapy and teletherapy. Those attributes were clustered into three factors via exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA): common therapeutic skills (e.g., warmth), extra-therapeutic influence (e.g., providing resources), and perceived outcome (e.g., symptom reductions). Therapists perceived poorer common therapeutic skills, decreased outcomes, and reduced extra-therapeutic influence when conducting teletherapy compared to in-person therapy. Therapists who reported poorer common therapeutic skills in teletherapy tended to be male, younger, utilize experience-based and relational therapies, have smaller caseloads, and had little training and no prior experience in teletherapy. Additionally, being male, utilizing experience-based and relational therapies, and having no training in teletherapy were associated with therapists' perception of reduced outcome in teletherapy. More intensive training and support in these attributes/skills are needed to improve therapists' confidence and ability to use therapeutic skills during teletherapy and ultimately improve the quality of psychological services in the era of teletherapy.

"Preparing for the COVID-19 paediatric mental health crisis: A focus on youth reactions to caretaker death","To promote clinician preparedness for working with children and adolescents who lost or will lose a parent or caretaker to COVID-19, findings from a review of the literature concerning youth reactions to parent and caretaker death and incapacitation were integrated with recent and emergent data concerning the COVID-19 pandemic. Children and adolescents who lose a parent or caretaker are at an increased risk of anxiety and depressive reactions and disorders, externalizing and health-risk behaviours, and substance use disorders. Particular aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic may influence these presentations and the risk of complicated grief. Youth with prior histories of adverse childhood experiences as well as boys and young men may require special considerations in formulation and planning. Tailored paediatric care based on the evidence advances accurate formulations and effective interventions for children and adolescents who suffer such a loss.","Liang, Becker, Rice","https://doi.org/10.1177/13591045211061802","20211209","COVID-19; bereavement; menÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mental health; parental death; youth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23625,""
"The association between fear of COVID-19 and mental health: The mediating roles of burnout and job stress among emergency nursing staff","This current study examined the mediation roles of burnout and job stress in the association between fear of COVID-19 and mental health among emergency nurses. Cross-sectional survey. A total of 516 emergency nurses with a mean age of 41.18 (SDÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 8.24), mostly females (76.16%) and married (78.9%) responded to measures on fear of COVID-19, burnout, job stress and mental health between 15 September and 7 November 2020. There was a significantly direct effect between (a) fear of COVID-19 and mental health, (b) fear of COVID-19 and mediators (burnout and job stress) and (c) mediators (burnout and job stress) and mental health. Also, there was a significantly indirect effect between fear of COVID-19 and mental health through job stress, burnout or both. Fear of COVID-19 directly and indirectly influenced the mental health of emergency nurses. Therefore, hospital authorities should provide sufficient resources to allay the fears of nurses during this COVID-19 pandemic period.","Ahorsu, Lin, Marznaki, H Pakpour","https://doi.org/10.1002/nop2.1154","20211209","burnout; fear of COVID-19; job stress; mediation; mental health; nurse","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23626,""
"A survey on the psychological impact and access to health care of thyroid patients during the first SARS-COV-2 lockdown","Information on the impact of SARS-COV-2 on the daily life of thyroid patients during lockdown is sparse. The main objective was explorative, focusing on how SARS-COV-2 affected thyroid patients. Cross-sectional, questionnaire-based, using an online platform. Patients &gt;18 years with a history of thyroid disease. Demographic data, psychological impact of SARS-COV-2, medical care during the pandemic. Valid responses were received from 609 responders. The median age was 50 years, 94% were female and 98.5% were UK residents. The commonest diagnosis was primary hypothyroidism (52.2%). Negative psychological effects following the lockdown were reported by 45.6%-58.7%. Cancellations of appointments with thyroid specialists were reported by 43.8%, although cancellations of thyroid investigations and treatments were relatively infrequent (12.9%-14.1%). Overall satisfaction rates for thyroid services were low (satisfaction score 40.1-42.8 out of 100), but nearly 80% were satisfied with remote consultations. Responder ratings of online information sources about SARS-COV-2 and thyroid diseases were lowest for government sites. Unmet needs during lockdown were: more remote access to thyroid specialists, more online information in 'plain English', and psychological support. In multivariate analyses, younger age, female gender, history of depression, hyperthyroidism, not having contracted SARS-COV-2Ã‚Â and multiple comorbidities were risk factors for a negative psychological impact of lockdown. This survey identified a significant negative impact of SARS-COV-2 and lockdown on psychological wellbeing, particularly in some groups of patients defined by demographic factors, history of hyperthyroidism and comorbidities. Low satisfaction with healthcare services among thyroid patients was noted, but remote consultations were rated favourably.","Pavlatou, Ã…Â½arkoviÃ„â€¡, HegedÃƒÂ¼s, Priestley, McMullan, Perros","https://doi.org/10.1111/cen.14649","20211209","SARS-COV-2; Thyroid disease; quality of life; questionnaire; survey","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23627,""
"Mediating mechanisms for maternal mental health from pre- to during the COVID-19 pandemic: Mediators of maternal mental illness during COVID-19","Mothers have experienced a near doubling of depression and anxiety symptoms pre- to during the COVID-19 pandemic. The identification of mechanisms that account for this increase can help inform specific targets for mental health recovery efforts. The current study examined whether women with higher levels of depression and anxiety symptoms pre-pandemic, reported higher levels of depression and anxiety symptoms during the pandemic, and whether these increases were mediated by perceived stress, strained relationships, coping attitudes, participation in activities, alcohol use, and financial impact. Mothers (<i>n</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 1,333) from an ongoing longitudinal cohort (All Our Families; AOF) from Calgary, Alberta, Canada, completed online questionnaires prior to (2017-2019) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (May-July 2020). Mothers reported on depressive and anxiety symptoms pre- and during the pandemic, as well as perceived stress, engagement in physical and leisure activities, coping, alcohol use, and financial impact of the pandemic. In unadjusted analyses, maternal depression and anxiety symptoms pre-pandemic were strongly associated with COVID-19 depressive (<i>r</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.57, <i>p</i>&lt;.01) and anxiety symptoms (<i>r</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.49, <i>p</i>&lt;.01).

"Persistence of Symptoms After Discharge of Patients Hospitalized Due to COVID-19","Many patients who had coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had at least one symptom that persisted after recovery from the acute phase. Our purpose was to review the empirical evidence on symptom prevalence, complications, and management of patients with long COVID. We systematically reviewed the literature on the clinical manifestations of long COVID-19, defined by the persistence of symptoms beyond the acute phase of infection. Bibliographic searches in PubMed and Google Scholar were conducted to retrieve relevant studies on confirmed patients with long COVID that were published prior to August 30, 2021. The most common persistent symptoms were fatigue, cough, dyspnea, chest pains, chest tightness, joint pain, muscle pain, loss of taste or smell, hair loss, sleep difficulties, anxiety, and depression. Some of the less common persistent symptoms were skin rash, decreased appetite, sweating, inability to concentrate, and memory lapses. In addition to these general symptoms, some patients experienced dysfunctions of specific organs, mainly the lungs, heart, kidneys, and nervous system. A comprehensive understanding of the persistent clinical manifestations of COVID-19 can improve and facilitate patient management and referrals. Prompt rehabilitative care and targeted interventions of these patients may improve their recovery from physical, immune, and mental health symptoms.","Wu, Wu, Xiong, Mei, You","https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.761314","20211211","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; long-term effect; patient discharge; review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23629,""
"Investigating Poor Sleep Quality and Associated Factors During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Population-Based Survey in Bangladesh","<b>Background:</b> The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has adversely affected the sleep quality of individuals, and is a poorly investigated area. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence estimate of poor sleep quality and its associated factors among Bangladeshi residents during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> An online cross-sectional survey was carried out from July 20 to August 5, 2020, involving 975 Bangladeshi residents (male: 54.2%; mean age: 26.7 Ã‚Â± 9.4 years; age range: 18-75 years). A self-reported questionnaire was answered by the respondents, covering information on demographic characteristics, perceived physical health status, COVID-19-related factors, COVID-19-induced anxiety assessment, and sleep quality. To assess sleep quality, the Bangla version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was used. Logistic regression models were performed to analyze the factors associated with sleep quality. <b>Results:</b> The prevalence estimate of poor sleep quality was 55.1% among the Bangladeshi people during the COVID-19 pandemic. As per the multiple regression analysis, poor sleep quality was significantly higher among respondents who reported female gender, moderate/poor health status, indirect contact with COVID-19 infected patients, decreased household income due to the COVID-19 pandemic, fear of infection, and COVID-19-induced anxiety. <b>Conclusion:</b> Poor sleep quality was slightly prevalent among general people in Bangladesh during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"In Case of an Emergency: The Development and Effects of a Digital Intervention for Coping With Distress in Norway During the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Background:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences has been found to negatively affect the general population's psychological well-being. <b>Objective:</b> The objectives of this paper are to report on the development and clinical effects of a self-guided Internet-delivered intervention for adults in Norway who suffer from mild to moderate psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> The participants, recruited between April and December 2020, were randomized to receive a new treatment module either every third or every fifth day. The clinical outcomes were self-reported depressive and anxiety symptoms and change in positive and negative emotions. <b>Results:</b> A total of 1256 individuals accessed the pre-screening survey, 407 were eligible and 92 provided contact information, where 82 were included in the study, <i>n</i> = 44 in the 3-day group and <i>n</i> = 38 in the 5-day group. Overall, the statistical analyses showed a significant decrease in depressive and anxiety symptoms and an increase in positive emotions, with small and moderate within group effect sizes.

"Prevalence and Correlates of Alexithymia and Its Relationship With Life Events in Chinese Adolescents With Depression During the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Objectives:</b> The incidence of psychological and behavioral problems and depression among adolescents is increasing year by year, which has become an important public health problem. Alexithymia, as an important susceptible factor of adolescent depression, may continue to develop and strengthen under the stimulation of COVID-19-related stressors. However, no studies have focused on alexithymia in adolescent depression during the pandemic in China. This study aims to investigate the incidence and related factors of alexithymia in adolescent depression during the pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> Three hundred adolescent patients were enrolled from October 2020 to May 2021. The general demographic information of all participants was collected, and the clinical characteristics were assessed by the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), the Adolescent Self-Rating Life Events Check (ASLEC) List, the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), and the Positive and Negative Suicide Ideation (PANSI) Inventory. <b>Results:</b> The incidence of alexithymia was significantly higher among adolescents with depression (76.45%) during the pandemic. There were significant differences in school bullying, disease severity, ASLEC score, CTQ score and PANSI score between adolescents with and without alexithymia. In addition, learning stress, health and adaptation problems during the pandemic may be influential factors in alexithymia of adolescent depression (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). <b>Conclusions:</b> According to the results, we found a high incidence of alexithymia in adolescent depression during the pandemic.

"Can Viewing Nature Through Windows Improve Isolated Living? A Pathway Analysis on Chinese Male Prisoners During the COVID-19 Epidemic","Nature exposure is known to promote life satisfaction and well-being, and indirect exposure through windows is likely to benefit isolated populations. However, whether such type of exposure can benefit prisoners, the extremely isolated population, is unknown. In the current study, we investigated 326 male prisoners from three prisons in southwest China. Psychological variables including depression, anxiety, loneliness, distress tolerance, life satisfaction, and well-being were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), short-form UCLA Loneliness Scale (ULS-6), Distress Tolerance Scale (DTS), Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), and 5-item World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5), respectively. Structural equation modeling was employed to identify the pathways from the visibility of nature through windows to prisoners' life satisfaction and well-being. Our results demonstrated that visibility of nature promoted the frequency and duration of viewing nature through windows. The frequency directly affected well-being, but the duration did not effectively affect any measured variables. The visibility of nature enhanced life satisfaction mainly <i>via</i> direct effects but enhanced well-being mainly <i>via</i> indirect effects. Regarding the indirect pathways, the visibility of nature increased distress tolerance and thus reduced loneliness and mental health problems. The reduced mental health problem, in turn, promoted life satisfaction and well-being. Our findings suggest that nature exposure through windows is effective in enhancing prisoners' life satisfaction and well-being. The policymaker may need to consider nature-based solutions such as indirect nature exposure in prions to benefit isolated populations.","Li, Zhang, You, Chen, Cao, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.720722","20211211","isolated; life satisfaction; nature exposure; prison; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23635,""

"The effect of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors on organ-specific ace2 expression in zebrafish and its implications for COVID-19","Among cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections that result in serious conditions or death, many have pre-existing conditions such as hypertension and are on renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors. The angiotensin-converting-enzyme-2 (ACE2), a key protein of the RAAS pathway, also mediates cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2. RAAS inhibitors might affect the expression levels of ace2, which could impact patient susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. However, multi-organ-specific information is currently lacking and no species other than rodents have been examined. To address this knowledge gap, we treated adult zebrafish with the RAAS inhibitors aliskiren, olmesartan, and captopril for 7 consecutive days and performed qRT-PCR analysis of major RAAS pathway genes in the brain, gill, heart, intestine, kidney, and liver. Both olmesartan and captopril significantly increased ace2 expression in the heart, gill, and kidney. Olmesartan also increased ace2 expression in the intestine. Conversely, aliskiren significantly decreased ace2 expression in the heart. Discontinuation of compound treatments for 7Ã‚Â days did not return ace2 expression to baseline levels. While potential risks or benefits of antihypertensive RAAS inhibitors to SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans remain uncertain, this study provides new insights regarding the impact of RAAS inhibitors on organ-specific ace2 expression in another vertebrate model, thereby providing comparative data and laying scientific groundwork for future clinical decisions of RAAS inhibitor use in the context of COVID-19.","Kim, Melgoza, Jiang, Guo","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-03244-5","20211212","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23637,""
"Remote, proactive, telephone based management of toxicity in outpatients during adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy for early stage breast cancer: pragmatic, cluster randomised trial","To evaluate the effectiveness of remote proactive management of toxicities during chemotherapy for early stage breast cancer. Pragmatic, cluster randomised trial. 20 cancer centres in Ontario, Canada, allocated by covariate constrained randomisation to remote management of toxicities or routine care. All patients starting adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy for early stage breast cancer at each centre. 25 patients from each centre completed patient reported outcome questionnaires. Proactive, standardised, nurse led telephone management of common toxicities at two time points after each chemotherapy cycle. The primary outcome, cluster level mean number of visits to the emergency department or admissions to hospital per patient during the whole course of chemotherapy treatment, was evaluated with routinely available administrative healthcare data. Secondary patient reported outcomes included toxicity, self-efficacy, and quality of life. Baseline characteristics of participants were similar in the intervention (n=944) and control arms (n=1214); 22% were older than 65 years. Penetration (that is, the percentage of patients who received the intervention at each centre) was 50-86%. Mean number of visits to the emergency department or admissions to hospital per patient was 0.91 (standard deviation 0.28) in the intervention arm and 0.94 (0.40) in the control arm (P=0.94); 47% (1014 of 2158 patients) had at least one visit to the emergency department or a hospital admission during chemotherapy. Among 580 participants who completed the patient reported outcome questionnaires, at least one grade 3 toxicity was reported by 48% (134 of 278 patients) in the intervention arm and by 58% (163 of 283) in the control arm. No differences in self-efficacy, anxiety, or depression were found. Compared with baseline, the functional assessment of cancer therapy trial outcome index decreased by 6.1 and 9.0 points in the intervention and control participants, respectively. Proactive, telephone based management of toxicities during chemotherapy did not result in fewer visits to the emergency department or hospital admissions. With the rapid rise in remote care because of the covid-19 pandemic, identifying scalable strategies for remote management of patients during cancer treatment is particularly relevant.

"Exploring healthcare providers' perceptions of mental health amid COVID-19 pandemic in obstetrics and gynaecology department of a tertiary care public sector hospital of Karachi, Pakistan: an exploratory qualitative study protocol","In the wake of the unprecedented public health challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is highly significant to recognise the mental health impact of this mounting threat on healthcare providers (HCPs) working in the obstetrics and gynaecology department. Experience from epidemics and emerging literature around COVID-19 show that the unparalleled amount of stress that HCPs are dealing with is linked with the increased burden of mental health conditions. We aim to conduct an exploratory qualitative descriptive study to assess HCPs' perceptions of mental health amid the COVID-19 pandemic in the obstetrics and gynaecology department of a public sector tertiary care hospital of Karachi, Pakistan. This study will use a qualitative descriptive approach where approximately 20-25 HCPs from the obstetrics and gynaecology department will be recruited using a purposive sampling approach. Data will be collected through semistructured interviews and it will be analysed thematically using NVivo V.12 Plus software. Ethical approval for this study has been obtained from the Institutional Review Board Committee of Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Center hospital. The study results will be disseminated to the scientific community and the HCPs participating in the study. The findings will help us to explore the doctor's perceptions of mental health during the current pandemic of COVID-19 and its impact on their daily lives and mental well-being.","Yasmin, Sadia, Qamar, Shahil Feroz","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-054010","20211212","gynaecology; mental health; psychiatry; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23639,""
"The global impact on mental health almost 2 years into the COVID-19 pandemic","Approaching 2 years into a global pandemic, it is timely to reflect on how COVID-19 has impacted the mental health of the global population. With research continuing apace, a clearer picture should crystallise in time. COVID-19 has undoubtedly had some impact on population mental health, although the severity and duration of this impact remain less clear. The exceptional period of COVID-19 has provided a unique prism through which we can observe and consider societal mental health. This is a momentous time to be involved in mental health research as we strive to understand the mental health needs of the population and advocate for adequate resourcing to deliver quality mental healthcare in the post-pandemic period.","Gavin, Lyne, McNicholas","https://doi.org/10.1017/ipm.2021.75","20211209","COVID-19; global mental health; mental health; mental illness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23640,""
"COVID-19 and medical education in Africa: a cross sectional analysis of the impact on medical students","The African continent currently experiences 25% of the global burden of disease with only 1.3% of the world's healthcare workers. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented disruption to medical education systems, increasing the strain on already-vulnerable regions. Our study examines the impact of COVID-19 on medical students across 33 countries in the African continent. A 39-item anonymous electronic survey was developed and distributed to medical students across Africa through social networks to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical education. The survey assessed the domains of: class structure changes and timing, patient interactions, exam administration, learning environment satisfaction, mental health impacts, and volunteer opportunities/engagement. 694 students across 33 countries participated. 80% of respondents had their classes suspended for varied lengths of time during the pandemic, and from these students 59% of them resumed their classes. 83% of students felt they were in a supportive learning environment before the pandemic, which dropped to 32% since the start. The proportion of students taking exams online increased (6-26%, p&lt;0.001) and there was a decrease in the proportion of students seeing patients as a part of their education (72-19%, p&lt;0.001). COVID-19 is harming medical students in Africa and is likely to worsen the shortage of the future's healthcare workforce in the region. Pandemic-related impacts have led to a degradation of the learning environment of medical students. Medical schools have shifted online to differing degrees and direct patient-care in training of students has decreased. This study highlights the urgent need for flexible and innovative approaches to medical education in Africa.","Bernard, Indig, Byl, Abdu, Mengesha, Admasu, Holman","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-021-03038-3","20211212","Africa; COVID-19; Health disparities; Medical education; Medical students; Pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23641,""
"COVID-19 lockdown in Spain: Psychological impact is greatest on younger and vulnerable children","In 2020, quarantine home confinement measures were implemented in Spain to control a pandemic for the first time. The objective of this study is to assess both the psychological and social impact of that 'lockdown' on different age groups of children and adolescents and also the different strategies adopted by families in that situation. We collected data via an online questionnaire answered by 850 participants, parents of young people aged between 4 and 18, between 24th April and 8th May 2020. Our results show that living in a home smaller than 80Ã‚Â m<sup>2</sup> is associated with an increased risk of presenting clinical symptoms of emotional or behavioural distress, with an odds ratio of 2.54 (95% CI: 1.07-6.02), <i>p</i> = 0.034; while increased age is a predictor of better psychological functioning during lockdown: coefficient of 0.25 (95% CI: 0.07-0.41), <i>p</i> = 0.004. Moreover, age is also a marker of higher scores on the scale of psychological symptoms, with a coefficient of 0.02 (95% CI: 0.01-0.04), <i>p</i> = .005. To conclude, younger children present poorer behavioural and emotional functioning and more symptoms of emotional distress than adolescents during lockdown. Living in a small home is a risk factor for presenting clinical symptoms. These findings should be taken into consideration when planning for future home confinement episodes and when considering preventative strategies in the realm of mental health care.","MatalÃƒÂ­-Costa, Camprodon-Rosanas","https://doi.org/10.1177/13591045211055066","20211209","COVID-19; adolescents; children; mental health; pandemic; psychological impact; psychosocial; quarantine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23642,""
"A qualitative study to explore primary health care practitioners' perceptions and understanding regarding the COVID-19 pandemic in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel virus that has rapidly spread across countries globally, and has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). In South Africa, more that 1 million cases have been confirmed since case zero was detected in March 2020. South Africa is currently leading in the sub-Saharan African region in terms of COVID-19-related mortality and morbidity rates. The aim of this study was to explore primary health care practitioners' perceptions and understanding regarding the COVID-19 pandemic in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The study was conducted at two selected primary health care facilities (a community health centre and satellite clinic) within a low-income rural context in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. A qualitative study was conducted to explore and describe perceptions and understanding of primary health care practitioners regarding the COVID-19 pandemic in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa. Data were collected from a purposive sample of 15 participants at two different clinics situated in rural KZN, South Africa. Participants comprised of nurses, physiotherapists, pharmacists, community care givers, social workers and clinical associates. The participants were both men and women who were all above the age of 20. Data were collected through individual, in-depth face-to-face interviews using a semi-structured interview guide. An audiotape was used to collect data, which were transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed manually by thematic analysis following Tech's steps of data analysis. Participants reported pre-pandemic and pandemic perceptions of fear, denial, expectancy and a perceived poor preparation for the COVID-19 outbreak. The findings also revealed participants' misperceptions regarding the nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and unrealistic expectations of occupational compensations for working during the outbreak. The findings of this study suggest that primary health care practitioners generally have negative perceptions and understanding regarding the pandemic because of misinformation obtained from social media. Interventions to support health care practitioners are necessary to mitigate the potentially negative implications of health practitioners' misconceptions on service delivery and their mental health.","Nxumalo, Mchunu","https://doi.org/10.4102/phcfm.v13i1.3084","20211212","COVID-19; coronavirus; coronavirus pandemic; perceptions; understanding","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23643,""
"Nursing Perspectives on the Impacts of COVID-19: Social Media Content Analysis","Nurses are at the forefront of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, nurses have faced an elevated risk of exposure and have experienced the hazards related to a novel virus. While being heralded as lifesaving heroes on the front lines of the pandemic, nurses have experienced more physical, mental, and psychosocial problems as a consequence of the COVID-19 outbreak. Social media discussions by nursing professionals participating in publicly formed Facebook groups constitute a valuable resource that offers longitudinal insights. This study aimed to explore how COVID-19 impacted nurses through capturing public sentiments expressed by nurses on a social media discussion platform and how these sentiments changed over time. We collected over 110,993 Facebook discussion posts and comments in an open COVID-19 group for nurses from March 2020 until the end of November 2020. Scraping of deidentified offline HTML tags on social media posts and comments was performed. Using subject-matter expert opinions and social media analytics (ie, topic modeling, information retrieval, and sentiment analysis), we performed a human-in-a-loop analysis of nursing professionals' key perspectives to identify trends of the COVID-19 impact among at-risk nursing communities. We further investigated the key insights of the trends of the nursing professionals' perspectives by detecting temporal changes of comments related to emotional effects, feelings of frustration, impacts of isolation, shortage of safety equipment, and frequency of safety equipment uses. Anonymous quotes were highlighted to add context to the data. We determined that COVID-19 impacted nurses' physical, mental, and psychosocial health as expressed in the form of emotional distress, anger, anxiety, frustration, loneliness, and isolation. Major topics discussed by nurses were related to work during a pandemic, misinformation spread by the media, improper personal protective equipment (PPE), PPE side effects, the effects of testing positive for COVID-19, and lost days of work related to illness. Public Facebook nursing groups are venues for nurses to express their experiences, opinions, and concerns and can offer researchers an important insight into understanding the COVID-19 impact on health care workers.","Koren, Alam, Koneru, DeVito, Abdallah, Liu","https://doi.org/10.2196/31358","20211210","COVID-19; coronavirus; health care workers; impact; information retrieval; mental health; nurses; nursing; pandemic; social media analytics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-13","",23644,""
