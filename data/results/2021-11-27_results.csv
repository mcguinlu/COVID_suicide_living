"Changes in antidepressant use in Australia: A nationwide analysis prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic (2015-2021)","Background: Depression and anxiety affect 4% to 14% of Australians every year; symptoms may have been exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. We examined recent patterns of antidepressant use in Australia in the period 2015 to 2021, which includes the first year of the pandemic. Methods: We used national dispensing claims for people aged [&ge;]10 years to investigate annual trends in prevalent and new antidepressant use (no antidepressants dispensed in the year prior). We conducted stratified analyses by sex, age group and antidepressant class. We report outcomes from 2015 to 2019 and used time series analysis to quantify changes during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020 to February 2021). Results: In 2019 the annual prevalence of antidepressant use was 170.4 per 1,000 women and 101.8 per 1,000 men, an increase of 7.0% and 9.2% from 2015, respectively. New antidepressant use also increased for both sexes (3.0% for women and 4.9% for men) and across most age groups, particularly among adolescents (aged 10-17 years; 46%-57%). During the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, we observed higher than expected prevalent use (+2.2%, 95%CI 0.3%, 4.2%) among females, corresponding to a predicted excess of 45,217 (95%CI 5,819, 84,614) females dispensed antidepressants. The largest increases during the first year of the pandemic occurred among female adolescents for both prevalent (+11.7%, 95%CI 4.1%, 20.5%) and new antidepressant use (+15.6%, 95%CI 8.5%, 23.7%). Conclusion: Antidepressant use continues to increase in Australia overall and especially among young people. We found a differential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in treated depression and anxiety, greater among females than males, and greater among young females than other age groups, suggesting an increased mental health burden in populations already on a trajectory of increased use of antidepressants prior to the pandemic. Reasons for these differences require further investigation.","Juliana de Oliveira Costa; Malcolm B.

"Population-level changes in the mental health of UK workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: A longitudinal study using Understanding Society","Objectives The COVID-19 pandemic has substantially affected workers mental health. We investigated changes in UK workers mental health by industry, social class, and occupation and differential effects by UK country of residence, gender and age. Methods We used representative Understanding Society data from 6,474 adults (41,207 observations) in paid employment who participated in pre-pandemic (2017-2020) and at least one COVID-19 survey. The outcome was psychological distress (General Health Questionnaire-12; score[&ge;]4). Exposures were industry, social class and occupation and are examined separately. Mixed-effects logistic regression was used to estimate relative (OR) and absolute (%) increases in distress before and during pandemic. Differential effects were investigated for UK countries of residence (Non-England/England), gender (Male/female), and age (Younger/Older) using 3-way interaction effects. Results Psychological distress increased in relative terms most for professional, scientific and technical (OR:3.15, 95% CI 2.17-4.59) industry in the pandemic versus pre-pandemic period. Absolute risk increased most in hospitality (+11.4%). For social class, small employers/self-employed were most affected in relative and absolute terms (OR:3.24, 95% CI 2.28- 4.63; +10.3%). Across occupations Sales and customer service (OR:3.01, 95% CI 1.61- 5.62; +10.7%) had the greatest increase. Analysis with 3-way interactions showed considerable gender differences, while for UK country of residence and age results are mixed. Conclusions Psychological distress increases during the COVID-19 pandemic were concentrated among professional and technical and hospitality industries, small employers/self-employed and sales and customers service workers. Female workers often exhibited greater differences in risk by industry and occupation. Policies supporting these industries and groups are needed.","Theocharis Kromydas; Michael J Green; Peter Craig; Srinivasa Vittal Katikireddi; Alastair H Leyland; Claire L Niedzwiedz; Anna Pearce; Rachel M Thomson; Evangelia L Demou","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.11.25.21266866","20211126","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-27","",22833,""
"Social and Behavioral Impacts of COVID-19 on People Living with HIV: Review of the First Year of Research","The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic brought unprecedented social change with the most severe impacts on the most vulnerable populations, including people living with HIV (PLWH). This review examined findings from empirical studies of social and behavioral impacts of COVID-19 on PLWH in the first year of the pandemic. Impacts of COVID-19 on PLWH fit within an HIV syndemics framework, with overlapping COVID-19 and HIV comorbid conditions concerning mental health and structural inequality. Early impacts of COVID-19 on social isolation, emotional distress, stigma, and substance use varied across studies with few consistent patterns.

"Increase in depression and anxiety disorder diagnoses during the COVID-19 pandemic in children and adolescents followed in pediatric practices in Germany","The coronavirus pandemic and related restrictions impacted the daily lives of children and youth, partly due to the closure of schools and the absence of outdoor activities. The aim of this study was to investigate, quantify, and critically discuss the effect of the pandemic and related restrictions on consultations pertaining to depression and anxiety disorders in children and adolescents. This retrospective cross-sectional study was based on medical record data from the Disease Analyzer database (IQVIA) and included all children and adolescents aged 2-17Ã‚Â years with at least one visit to one of 168 German pediatric practices between April 2019 and December 2019 (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°454,741) or between April 2020 and December 2020 (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°417,979). The number of children and adolescents with depression and anxiety disorder diagnoses per practice and the prevalence of these diagnoses were compared for April 2020-December 2020 versus April 2019-December 2019. The number of children and adolescents with depression and anxiety diagnoses per practice increased in April 2020-December 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 (anxiety:Ã¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°9%, depression:Ã¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°12%). The increase was much greater in girls than in boys (anxiety:Ã¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°13% vs.Ã¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°5%; depressionÃ¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°19% vs.Ã¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°1%). The prevalence of anxiety disorder increased from 0.31 to 0.59% (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), and that of depression from 0.23 to 0.47% (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). The biggest increases were observed for girls (anxiety from 0.35 to 0.72% (+Ã¢â‚¬â€°106%, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), depression from 0.28 to 0.72% (+Ã¢â‚¬â€°132%, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001).

"[Burden in parents of school-aged children during different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany: an analysis within the COVID-19 snapshot monitoring (COSMO) study]","Parents face aÃ‚Â variety of personal challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, while simultaneously being confronted with additional, school-related pandemic containment measures. To investigate burden in parents of school-aged children across different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany and to identify particularly affected subgroups. The COSMO project is aÃ‚Â repetitive cross-sectional survey monitoring the psychosocial situation of the population in Germany during the pandemic with aÃ‚Â sample size of approximately nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1000 respondents per survey wave. AÃ‚Â quantitative analysis of COSMO data was conducted using closed survey questions on the item ""burden"" as the main outcome, and, if applicable, on parenthood-associated burden from March 2020 until January 2021. During the first COVID-19 wave, parents of school-aged children were significantly more burdened compared to the general study population. However, burden decreased significantly from March/April to June 2020. During the second COVID-19 wave in January 2021, burden was homogeneously high across all groups. Single parenthood, a low household income, having a chronic health condition, a COVID-19 infection and a migration background were associated with higher burden, although none of these factors was consistently significant across the survey waves. Mothers reported to be more affected by parenthood-related burden than fathers. School measures for infection control have to be weighed carefully against the psychological impact on parental burden with subsequent negative impact on the family system.

"People living with mental disorder in Nigeria amidst COVID-19: Challenges, implications, and recommendations","COVID-19 has become a global public health obstacle. This disease has caused negligence on mental health institutions, decreased trust in the healthcare system and traditional and religious beliefs, and has created a widespread stigma on people living with mental health illness, specifically in Nigeria. The increase of COVID-19 cases that have exhausted the healthcare system in Nigeria have brought further negligence to people living with mental disorder, thus increasing the burden of the disease on these patients. Overall, this article considerably highlighted the need for equal accessibility to healthcare resources, as well as the requirement of proper attention and care for mental health patients in Nigeria.

"Medium-term and peri-lockdown course of psychosocial burden during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic: a longitudinal study on patients with pre-existing mental disorders","While the COVID-19 pandemic continues, patients with pre-existing mental disorders are increasingly recognized as a risk group for adverse outcomes. However, data are conflicting and cover only short time spans so far. Here, we investigate the medium-term and peri-lockdown-related changes of mental health outcomes in such patients in a longitudinal study. A cohort of 159 patients comprising all major mental disorders (ICD-10 F0-F9) were interviewed twice with the Goettingen psychosocial Burden and Symptom Inventory (Goe-BSI) to evaluate psychosocial burden, psychiatric symptoms and resilience at the end of the first (April/May 2020) and the second lockdown in Germany (November/December 2020). For the primary outcome ""psychosocial burden"" ratings also comprised retrospective pre-pandemic (early 2020) and very early states during the pandemic (March 2020). For all diagnostic groups, psychosocial burden varied significantly over time (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) with an increase from the pre-pandemic to the initial phase (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), followed by a steady decrease across both lockdowns, normalizing in November/December 2020. Female gender, high adjustment disorder symptom load at baseline and psychiatric comorbidities were risk factors for higher levels and an unfavorable course of psychosocial burden. Most psychiatric symptoms changed minimally, while resilience decreased over time (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.044 and pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.037). The longitudinal course of psychosocial burden indicates an initial stress response, followed by a return to pre-pandemic levels even under recurrent lockdown conditions, mimicking symptoms of an adjustment disorder. Strategies for proactive, specific and continuous treatment have to address resilience capacities before their depletion in the pandemic aftermath, especially for patients with additional risk factors.","Bartels, Hessmann, Schmidt, Vogelgsang, Ruhleder, Kratzenberg, Treptow, Reh-Bergen, Abdel-Hamid, HeÃƒÅ¸, Meiser, Signerski-Krieger, Radenbach, Trost, Schott, Wiltfang, Wolff-Menzler, Belz","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00406-021-01351-y","20211126","Adjustment disorder; Coronavirus; Mental health; Psychosocial stress; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-27","",22839,""
"The Early Changes in Emergency General Surgery Following Implementation of UK COVID-19 Policy: A Retrospective Cohort Study","Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread worldwide. On 23rd March 2020, the UK introduced measures in an effort to curb the disease spread. The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of government and Royal College measures on the general surgical take. Materials and methods A retrospective analysis of patients referred to the acute general surgical take between 2nd March 2020 and 5th April 2020, including acuity at the time of referral, management, and patient outcomes, was undertaken. Data fit into a 'pre-COVID measures' cohort (prior to 23rd March 2020) and a 'post-COVID measures' cohort (on or after 23rd March 2020). Results A total of 465 patient referrals were included. There was a decrease in admissions rate in the post-COVID measures' cohort (p=0.001), but with an increase in patient acuity with white cell count (WCC) (p=0.024) and C-reactive protein (CRP) (p=0.036). Laparoscopic surgery decreased (p=0.004); however, the proportion of patients having an operation remained constant. There was no increase in short-term morbidity and mortality or length of stay (LOS). Discussion The data suggests that UK lockdown introduction influenced people's behaviour. Fewer patients presented to the surgical take; however, these patients were of higher acuity. Despite changes in royal college guidelines, there was no decrease in the proportion of patients undergoing operations; however, a higher proportion were open procedures. The change in national and college guidelines did not affect short-term morbidity, mortality or LOS.","Hanger, Bush, Lunt, Adams, Keatley, Munro, Jaralla, Christopoulos","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.19832","20211126","covid-19; general surgery; operative; public health; surgical procedures; united kingdom government","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-27","",22840,""
"Mental Health Inequalities During COVID-19 Outbreak: The Role of Financial Insecurity and Attentional Control","The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns negatively impacted the mental health of populations. This impact is not equally distributed and increases existing mental health inequalities. Indeed, government restrictions and the economic consequences of the pandemic affect more the less educated and less wealthy people. However, psychological processes implicated in this increase of mental health inequalities during the COVID-19 pandemic remain unexplored. The present study (N=591) tested the role of financial insecurity and attentional control in the relation between socioeconomic status and mental health, along with the influence of trait anxiety. Based on Structural Equation Modelling, findings showed a mediation effect of financial insecurity, but not of attentional control, in the relationship between socioeconomic status and mental health. In addition, exploratory analyses suggested that financial insecurity also mediated the effect of attentional control on mental health. Results of the present research point at the importance of understanding psychological processes implicated in the effect of economic crises on mental health inequalities.","Claes, Smeding, CarrÃƒÂ©","https://doi.org/10.5334/pb.1064","20211126","COVID-19; Socioeconomic status; attentional control; financial insecurity; lockdown; mental health inequalities","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-27","",22841,""

"Differences in beliefs about COVID-19 by gun ownership: a cross-sectional survey of Texas adults","We investigated the association between gun ownership and perceptions about COVID-19 among Texas adults as the pandemic emerged. We considered perceived likelihood that the pandemic would lead to civil unrest, perceived importance of taking precautions to prevent transmission and perceptions that the threat of COVID-19 has been exaggerated. Data were collected from 5 to 12 April 2020, shortly after Texas' stay-at-home declaration. We generated a sample using random digit dial methods for a telephone survey (n=77, response rate=8%) and by randomly selecting adults from an ongoing panel to complete the survey online (n=1120, non-probability sample). We conducted a logistic regression to estimate differences in perceptions by gun ownership. To account for bias associated with use of a non-probability sample, we used Bayesian data integration and ran linear regression models to produce more accurate measures of association. Among the 60% of Texas adults who reported gun ownership, estimates of past 7-day gun purchases, ammunition purchases and gun carrying were 15% (n<i>=</i>78), 20% (n=100) and 24% (n=130), respectively. We found no evidence of an association between gun ownership with perceived importance of taking precautions to prevent transmission or with perceived likelihood of civil unrest. Results from the logistic regression (OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.63) and the linear regression (ÃŽÂ²=0.18, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.29) suggest that gun owners may be more likely to believe the threat of COVID-19 was exaggerated.

"Telehealth for opioid use disorder treatment in low-barrier clinic settings: an exploration of clinician and staff perspectives","The majority of individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) face access barriers to evidence-based treatment, and the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the United States (US) opioid overdose crisis. However, the pandemic has also ushered in rapid transitions to telehealth in the USA, including for substance use disorder treatment with buprenorphine. These changes have the potential to mitigate barriers to care or to exacerbate pre-existing treatment inequities. The objective of this study was to qualitatively explore Philadelphia-based low-barrier, harm-reduction oriented, opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment provider perspectives about and experiences with telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to assess their desire to offer telehealth to patients at their programs in the future. We interviewed 22 OUD treatment prescribers and staff working outpatient programs offering OUD treatment with buprenorphine in Philadelphia during July and August 2020. All participants worked at low-barrier treatment programs that provide buprenorphine using a harm reduction-oriented approach and without mandating counseling or other requirements as a condition of treatment. We analyzed the data using thematic content analysis. Our analysis yielded three themes: 1/ Easier access for some: telehealth facilitates care for many patients who have difficulty attending in-person appointments due to logistical and psychological barriers; 2/ A layered digital divide: engagement with telehealth can be seriously limited by patients' access to and comfort with technology; and 3/ Clinician control: despite some clinic staff beliefs that patients should have the freedom to choose their treatment modality, patients' access to treatment via telehealth may hinge on clinician perceptions of patient ""stability"" rather than patient preferences. Telehealth may address many access issues, however, barriers to implementation remain, including patient ability and desire to attend healthcare appointments virtually. In addition, the potential for telehealth models to extend OUD care to patients currently underserved by in-person models may partially depend on clinician comfort treating patients deemed ""unstable"" via this modality. The ability of telehealth to expand access to OUD care for individuals who have previously struggled to engage with in-person care will likely be limited if these patients are not given the opportunity to receive treatment via telehealth.","Aronowitz, Engel-Rebitzer, Dolan, Oyekanmi, Mandell, Meisel, South, Lowenstein","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12954-021-00572-7","20211126","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-27","",22844,""
"Understanding health anxiety in the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic continues to be one of the greatest public health challenges faced by the UK. Reported rates of psychiatric difficulties have increased and the mechanisms by which the pandemic has affected mental health requires investigation. The aim of the study was to understand the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on health anxiety in the general population, with a focus on Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust, which provides specialist mental health care within Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire. We invited participants aged 18+ across Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire to complete an online questionnaire consisting of standardised questionnaires measuring psychological wellbeing, non-standardised questions to provide demographic information, and information about social circumstances and behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were then invited via email to complete a 3-month follow-up questionnaire. About 324 participants completed the baseline survey while 199 completed the follow-up. Our analysis demonstrated that higher scores on a health anxiety inventory were related to reports of depression, anxiety, loneliness, poor quality of life and obsessive-compulsive symptoms and panic. We also identified several predictors of health anxiety such as being female, having a pre-existing physical or mental health condition, and poor tolerance of uncertainty. Lifestyle and demographic factors such as changes in financial situation, changes in employment status, having a close relative or friend with COVID-19, being able to do grocery shopping, being a key worker, and ethnicity were not found to predict health anxiety. Awareness of the impact of health anxiety on people needs to be consistently high among healthcare professionals, especially in the continuing fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. The relationship between health anxiety and fatigue, sleep quality, gender and co-morbid mental and physical health difficulties needs to be investigated further to determine areas of intervention.","Heinen, Varghese, Krayem, Molodynski","https://doi.org/10.1177/00207640211057794","20211126","COVID-19; NHS; United Kingdom; health anxiety; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-27","",22845,""
"An Analysis of Admissions to a Refugee Child Mental Health Unit in the Context of the COVID-19 Pandemic","To examine the admissions to a refugee child outpatient mental health unit in the COVID-19 pandemic and to compare them with the pre-pandemic period. This retrospective observational study, planned through the hospital information system and patient files, included the 1-year number of outpatient unit admissions, sociodemographic, and clinical data. Before the COVID-19 pandemic (March 2019-February 2020), a total of 2322 patients (local and refugee) applied to the same unit, and 236 (10.1%) of these patients were refugees. Since the commencement of the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey (March 2020-February 2021), 1209 patients applied, and 10.4% (<i>n</i> = 126) of them were refugees. While 19.66 Ã‚Â± 6.31 refugees applied per month in the pre-pandemic period, this number decreased to 10.50 Ã‚Â± 5.31 during the pandemic period (<i>p</i> = 0.01). During the pandemic period, there was a significant decrease in the number of female refugee patient admissions. In addition, while admissions for external disorders increased significantly during the pandemic period (<i>x</i><sup><i>2</i></sup> = 13.99, <i>p</i> = 0.001), admissions for internal disorders decreased significantly (<i>x</i><sup><i>2</i></sup> = 4.54, <i>p</i> = 0.03). The decrease in the mental health unit demands with the pandemic may lead to negative consequences in the long term. To determine mental health and psychological needs of patients during the outbreak will greatly contribute to the pandemic management process.","ÃƒÅ“nver, PerdahlÃ„Â± FiÃ…Å¸","https://doi.org/10.1177/13591045211058337","20211126","ADHD; COVID-19; anxiety; child; mental health; pandemic; refugee","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-27","",22846,""
