"Mental health in relation to changes in sleep, exercise, alcohol and diet during the COVID-19 pandemic: examination of five UK cohort studies","Background: Responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have included lockdowns and social distancing with considerable disruptions to the lives of people. These changes may have particularly impacted on those with mental health problems, leading to a worsening of inequalities in the behaviours which influence health. Methods: We used data from four national longitudinal British cohort studies (N=10,666). Respondents reported mental health (psychological distress and anxiety/depression symptoms) and health behaviours (alcohol, diet, physical activity, and sleep) before and during the pandemic. Associations between pre-pandemic mental ill-health and pandemic mental ill-health and health behaviours were examined using logistic regression; pooled effects were estimated using meta-analysis. Results: Worse mental health was related to adverse health behaviours; effect sizes were largest for sleep, exercise and diet, and weaker for alcohol. The associations between poor mental health and adverse health behaviours were larger during the May lockdown than pre-pandemic. In September, when restrictions had eased, inequalities had largely reverted to pre-pandemic levels. A notable exception was for sleep, where differences by mental health status remained high. Risk differences for adverse sleep for those with the highest level of prior mental ill-health compared to those with the lowest, were 21.2% (95% CI: 16.2, 26.2) before lockdown, 25.5% (20.0, 30.3) in May, and 28.2% (21.2, 35.2) in September. Conclusions: Taken together, our findings suggest that mental health is an increasingly important factor in health behaviour inequality in the COVID era. The promotion of mental health may thus be an important component of improving post-COVID population health.","Aase Villadsen; Praveetha Patalay; David Bann","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.26.21254424","20210328","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-28","",12433,""
"Prevalence and associated factors with mental health outcomes among interns and residents physicians during COVID-19 epidemic in Panama: a cross-sectional study","Background. A new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was associated with a newly identified respiratory syndrome, COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, in early December 2019. SARS-CoV-2 rapidly spread across the globe resulting in 117 million cases and 2.59 million deaths by March 2021. Rapidly increased numbers of COVID-19 cases overwhelmed public health systems across the world, imposing increased working hours and workloads for health care workers. Here, we have evaluated the prevalence of health outcomes and associated factors of interns and resident physicians in Panama. Methods. A cross-sectional study was undertaken during July 23, 2020, to August 13, 2020, to evaluate the prevalence of health outcomes and associated factors in interns and residents across Panama. Snowball sampling was used to recruit participants. Then an electronic questionnaire with scales to evaluate anxiety disorders (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9) and post-traumatic stress (IES-R) was evaluated. In addition, socio-demographic variables, clinical history of mental disorders and COVID-19 exposure were evaluated. Independent analyses for each mental health outcome were undertaken using a logistic regression analysis. Results. A total of 517/1205 (42.9%) interns and residents were nationwide recruited. Of these 274 (53.0%) were interns and 243 (47.0%) residents. The overall prevalence of depression symptoms was 25.3%, 13.7% anxiety and 12.2% post-traumatic stress. At least, 9.3% participants reported having suicidal ideation. The most parsimonious model showed females had a higher prevalence of mental health disorders, in all results and the married participants were more likely to present depression (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.03-2.91; P = 0.039) or at least one alteration to mental health (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.03-2.68; P = 0.039). Resident physicians in surgical specialties were less likely to have post-traumatic stress (OR, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.06-0.63; P = 0.006) or at least one mental health disturbance (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.26-0.83; P = 0.010). A history of psychological trauma and psychiatric pathology were risk factors for most of the disorders investigated. Conclusions. A high prevalence of mental health disorders was found, showing the need to mitigate this emotional burden among healthcare workers in the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Edward A.

"Quality of life and safety impact of COVID-19 associated smell and taste disturbances","The association between COVID-19 and chemosensory loss has garnered substantial attention, however to date little is known about the real-life consequences of impairment in this unique patient population. The aim of this study is to evaluate the quality of life (QOL) and personal safety deficits experienced by patients with COVID-19 infection. Prospective, longitudinal questionnaires. National survey. A longitudinal web-based nationwide survey of adults with COVID-19 and/or a sudden change in smell and taste was launched April 10, 2020. Previously published questions on chemosensory-related QOL and safety events were asked at the 6-month follow-up survey. As of February 10, 2021, 480 eligible respondents took the 6-month questionnaire, of whom 322 were COVID-19 positive. Impact on QOL was substantial with 96% of subjects reporting at least one of the defined deficits, and over 75% reporting at least 3 of these. &quot;Reduced enjoyment of food&quot; was the most common complaint (87%), while 43% of subjects self-reported depression. The prevalence of safety-related issues was common in this population, with over 57% reporting at least one, and 36% reporting 2 or more events. Of the events asked, the inability to smell smoke that others could perceive was the most common at 45%. COVID-19 associated chemosensory losses have a real and substantial impact on both quality of life and safety, beyond mere inconvenience. The high prevalence of these issues despite a relatively short period of olfactory deficit should alert clinicians to the serious risks to an already vulnerable patient population.","Coelho, Reiter, Budd, Shin, Kons, Costanzo","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjoto.2021.103001","20210327","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Epidemiology; Quality of life, safety; Smell; Taste","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-28","",12435,""
"Maternal depressive and anxiety symptoms before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada: a longitudinal analysis","Parents have faced substantial social and economic challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. Preliminary cross-sectional research has demonstrated increases in mental health problems in mothers during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with pre-pandemic estimates. We aimed to study an existing longitudinal cohort of mothers to assess changes in the prevalence of maternal depression and anxiety symptoms as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic over time and at the individual level. In this longitudinal observational study, women who took part in the All Our Families pregnancy cohort in Canada were invited to complete a COVID-19 impact survey between May 20 and July 15, 2020. Women who had not agreed to additional research, had discontinued, were lost to follow-up, or who were not contactable via email were excluded. Maternal depression and anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic were compared with three previous estimates collected at 3, 5, and 8-year timepoints (between April, 2012, and October, 2019). Depression symptoms were assessed using the 10-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the short form of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Repeated cross-sectional analyses were done to assess temporal trends and fixed-effects regression models were fitted to assess within-person change over time. Of the 3387 women included in the All Our Families study, 2445 women were eligible and were invited to participate in the COVID-19 impact study, of whom 1333 consented to participate, and 1301 were included in the longitudinal analysis. At the COVID-19 impact survey timepoint, a higher proportion of mothers had clinically significant depression (35Ã‚Â·21%, 95% CI 32Ã‚Â·48-38Ã‚Â·04) and anxiety symptoms (31Ã‚Â·39%, 28Ã‚Â·76-34Ã‚Â·15) than at all previous data collection timepoints. The mean depression score (8Ã‚Â·31, 95% CI 7Ã‚Â·97-8Ã‚Â·65) and anxiety score (11Ã‚Â·90, 11Ã‚Â·66-12Ã‚Â·13) at the COVID-19 pandemic timepoint were higher than previous data collection waves at the 3-year timepoint (mean depression score 5Ã‚Â·05, 4Ã‚Â·85-5Ã‚Â·25; mean anxiety score 9Ã‚Â·51, 9Ã‚Â·35-9Ã‚Â·66), 5-year timepoint (mean depression score 5Ã‚Â·43, 5Ã‚Â·20-5Ã‚Â·66; mean anxiety score 9Ã‚Â·49, 9Ã‚Â·33-9Ã‚Â·65), and 8-year timepoint (mean depression score 5Ã‚Â·79, 5Ã‚Â·55-6Ã‚Â·02; mean anxiety score 10Ã‚Â·26, 10Ã‚Â·10-10Ã‚Â·42). For the within-person comparisons, depression scores were a mean of 2Ã‚Â·30 points (95% CI 1Ã‚Â·95-2Ã‚Â·65) higher and anxiety scores were a mean of 1Ã‚Â·04 points (0Ã‚Â·65-1Ã‚Â·43) higher at the COVID-19 pandemic timepoint, after controlling for time trends. Larger increases in depression and anxiety symptoms were observed for women who had income disruptions, difficulty balancing home schooling with work responsibilities, and those with difficulty obtaining childcare. White mothers had greater increases in anxiety scores than non-white mothers and health-care workers had smaller increases in depressive symptoms than non-health-care workers. Compared with previous estimates, the prevalence of maternal depression and anxiety among mothers in a Canadian cohort increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Financial support, childcare provision, and avoiding the closure of schools, might be key priorities for preventing future increases in maternal psychological distress.

"Supporting parents as essential care partners in neonatal units during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic","To review the evidence on safety of maintaining family integrated care practices and the effects of restricting parental participation in neonatal care during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL databases were searched from inception to the 14th of October 2020. Records were included if they reported scientific, empirical research (qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods) on the effects of restricting or promoting family integrated care practices for parents of hospitalized neonates during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Two authors independently screened abstracts, appraised study quality and extracted study and outcome data. We retrieved 803 publications and assessed 75 full-text articles. Seven studies were included, reporting data on 854 healthcare professionals, 442 parents, 364 neonates and 26 other family members, within 286 neonatal units globally. The pandemic response resulted in significant changes in neonatal unit policies and restricting parents' access and participation in neonatal care. Breastfeeding, parental bonding, participation in caregiving, parental mental health and staff stress were negatively impacted. This review highlights that SARS-CoV-2 pandemic-related hospital restrictions had adverse effects on care delivery and outcomes for neonates, families and staff. Recommendations for restoring essential family integrated care practices are discussed.","van Veenendaal, Deierl, Bacchini, O'Brien, Franck","https://doi.org/10.1111/apa.15857","20210327","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; family integrated care; family-centred care; neonatal; parent","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-28","",12437,""
"Factors associated with antenatal depression during the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV2) pandemic: A cross-sectional study in a cohort of Turkish pregnant women","To determine the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on antenatal depression in Turkish pregnant women. In this cross-sectional study, data were collected from 497 pregnant women between May and July 2020 using the Edinburgh Depression Scale (EDS) to determine the effect of obstetrics history, fear of hospitalization, concerns about the pandemic, birth, and the health of both mother and infant, on antenatal depression during the COVID-19 outbreak in Turkey. The general EDS mean score of the total group was determined as mean 13.70Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°6.22, which was higher than the critical cutoff point of 13. According to the multiple linear regression model applied in the study, the best predictive variables for the mean EDS score were determined to be concerned about completing a healthy pregnancy (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.45), social media and news programs related to COVID-19 increasing levels of concern (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.31), fear of hospitalization as the birth approaches (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.45), having bad dreams during the COVID-19 pandemic (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.41), the request for an elective cesarean delivery because of fear of catching COVID-19 (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.40), fear of breastfeeding the infant (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.45), and concerns that their own health would be negatively affected because of the pandemic (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°- 0.39), and these variables affected the mean EDS score negatively (total variance 40.5%, RÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.642).

"Psychological Distress Among a Tunisian Community Sample During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Correlations with Religious Coping","DespiteÃ‚Â advances in medicineÃ‚Â andÃ‚Â technology, when facing epidemics people continue to turn to religion to deal with such unpredictable life-threatening events. We aimed to assess psychological distress in the general population of Tunisia during the COVID-19 pandemic and to examine the contribution of religious coping (RC) in the reports of anxiety and depression at the time of the survey. We carried out and online cross-sectional study usingÃ‚Â a non-probability snowball sampling technique. A total of 603 responses were recorded. The &quot;Depression Anxiety Stress Scales,&quot; the &quot;Brief religious coping scale&quot; and the &quot;Arabic religiosity scale&quot; were used. We found that 28.3%, 24.4% and 19.4% of the participants reported severe or extremely severe levels of depression, anxiety and stress, respectively. The mean score for positive RC was 22.8Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.3, while that for negative RC was 14Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.8. After controlling for confounders, multivariate analysis showed that negative RC significantly and positively contributed to depression and anxiety scores in our respondents, indicating that greater use of negative RC was associated with higher levels of psychological distress. No significant relationship was found between overall religiosity or positive religious coping and either depression or anxiety symptoms. Religious beliefs may have an impact on how people cope with emerging infectious disease outbreaks. Religion should be considered by professionals as an important variable to consider in therapy for individuals who engage in RC or perceive religious needs.","Fekih-Romdhane, Cheour","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10943-021-01230-9","20210327","Anxiety; COVID-19; Coronavirus; Depression; Psychological distress; Religiosity; Religious coping","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-28","",12439,""
"Epilepsy during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown: a US population survey","This study sought to understand issues facing people with epilepsy (PWE) during the lockdown period of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. We conducted a cross-sectional study using a 20-question survey that used SeziureTracker.com, sent to eligible PWE and their caregivers on May 6th, 2020. Questions about demographics and medical history were used to calculate COVID mortality risk odds ratios (OR) compared to a low baseline risk group. In total, 505 responses were collected. Of these, 71% reported no change in seizure rates and 25% reported an increase in seizures, which they attributed primarily to disrupted sleep (63%) and decreased exercise (42%). Mortality risks from COVID-19 had median OR of 1.67, ranging 1.00-906.98. Fear about hospitalization (53%) and concern for loved ones (52%) were prominent concerns. Of the respondents, 5% reported stopping or reducing anti-seizure medications due to problems communicating with doctors, access or cost. Lower-risk COVID patients reported more fear of hospitalization (55% versus 38%, p&lt;0.001) and anxiety about medication access (43% versus 28%, p=0.03) compared with higher-risk COVID patients. Increased anxiety was reported in 47%, and increased depression in 28%. Ten percent without generalized convulsions and 8% with did not know anything about epilepsy devices (VNS, RNS, DBS). The COVID-19 pandemic presents unique challenges to PWE, including increased seizure rates, problems with access and cost of life-saving medications. Those with lower COVID-19 risk may have been marginalized more than those with higher risk. Efforts to protect PWE during major public health emergencies should take these findings into account.","Casassa, Moss, Goldenholz","https://doi.org/10.1684/epd.2021.1259","20210327","SARS-CoV-2; antiseizure medication; epidemiology; epilepsy/seizures; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-28","",12440,""
"Urgent Psychiatric Consultations at Mental Health Center during COVID-19 Pandemic: Retrospective Observational Study","The coronavirus pandemic and related social distancing measures have brought about dramatic changes in people's lives. In particular, health workers have been forced to change their activities both for the different needs of patients and for preventive measures against the spread of the virus. This study is aimed at comparing the urgent psychiatric consultations (UPC) performed at the outpatient Mental Health Center (MHC) of Modena during the coronavirus outbreak period, from 1 March to 31 August 2020, with the same period in 2019. We retrospectively collected in a database the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients who required UPC in the MHC during the 6-month observation periods in both 2019 and 2020. Data were statistically analyzed. We analyzed 656 urgent psychiatric consultations in 2019 and 811 in 2020, requested by 425 patients in 2019 and 488 in 2020, respectively. In the pandemic period, we observed an increase in the total and daily number of UPC which were more frequently required by patients in care at local outpatient services in comparison with the previous period. During 2020, an increased number of UPC was carried out remotely and the outcome was more frequently represented by discharge at home, avoiding hospitalization as much as possible. In the course of the coronavirus pandemic, MHC had to face an increased demand for clinical activity especially from the most clinically and socially vulnerable patients, who more frequently required UPC in outpatient psychiatric services.","Di Lorenzo, Fiore, Bruno, Pinelli, Bertani, Falcone, Marrama, Starace, Ferri","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11126-021-09907-w","20210327","COVID-19; Coronavirus pandemic; Mental Health Center; Urgent psychiatric consultations","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-28","",12441,""
"The impact of lockdown policy on depressive symptoms among pregnant women in China: mediating effects of internet use and family support","Although more and more attention has been paid to the psychological consequences of the lockdown policy amongst pregnant women, the underlying mechanism linking the lockdown policy to maternal depression has not been studied in the context of China. This study aimed to explore the association between the lockdown policy and maternal depressive symptoms, and whether such association was mediated by internet use and/or family support. ThisÃ‚Â cross-sectional study used multi-stage sampling techniques inÃ‚Â central and western China. Data were collected from 1266 pregnant women using a structtured questionnaire that measured internet use, family support, and depressive symptoms.Ã‚Â The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) was used to measure depressive symptoms. Internet use was measured by length of usage and varierity of purpose for internet use.Ã‚Â Family support was measureed by spousal support and parental support.Ã‚Â The structural equation modelling was employed to conduct mediation analysis to test the specificity of the hypothetical paths. Overall, 527Ã‚Â respondents (41.63%)Ã‚Â presented depressive symptoms. The lockdown policy was negativelyÃ‚Â associated with depressive symptoms in pregnant women (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.925, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-1.510, -Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.360). The impact of the lockdown policy on depressive symptoms was partially mediated by internet use (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.589, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.730, 2.807) and family support (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.162, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°- 0.341, -Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.017), accounting for 42.67% of the total effect. The lockdown policy was generally associated with fewerÃ‚Â depressive symptoms in pregnant women. The lockdown policy increased maternal depressive symptoms through increased internet use, but decreased maternal depressive symptoms through enhanced family support.

"Comparison of psychological symptoms between infected and non-infected COVID-19 health care workers","Studies have shown that health care workers (HCWs), as front liners of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, are at high risk for psychological symptoms, but few studies have compared these symptoms in infected and non-infected HCWs. This study compares psychological symptoms among these two groups. In this cross-sectional study, 938 HCWs from various medical fields working in the leading general hospitals of Alborz province, Iran, were selected using a multistage sampling method. The participants had contact with COVID-19 patients. Post-traumatic stress disorder-8 (PTSD-8) is a validated questionnaire that we used to evaluate PTSD symptoms along with its subscales, including intrusion, avoidance, and hypervigilance. Also, the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 questionnaire was used to assess the severity of the aforementioned conditions in HCWs. Multivariate logistic regression was used to compare psychological symptoms in infected and non-infected HCWs. Among 938 included HCWs, 55 had a history of confirmed COVID-19 infection. Prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression, intrusion, hypervigilance, and avoidance among infected HCWs were significantly higher in comparison to non-infected HCWs. In the multivariate logistic model, history of COVID-19 infection among HCWs was associated with a significantly increased risk of anxiety, depression, stress, intrusion, hyper-vigilance, and avoidance. The present study showed that the HCWs with COVID-19 infection were at a high risk of displaying psychological symptoms. Therefore, it is also necessary to develop psychological support and interventions for HCWs, especially those who got infected with the virus.","Mohammadian Khonsari, Shafiee, Zandifar, Mohammad Poornami, Ejtahed, Asayesh, Qorbani","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03173-7","20210327","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Health care workers; PTSD; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-28","",12443,""
