"Telehealth Access and Use by the US Medicare Population during the Pandemic","Objectives: Telehealth access and reimbursement varied by payer and regionally prior to COVID-19. and its limited availability expanded in response to the pandemic. The health behavioral response by older adults to COVID-19 has varied over time with the geographic spread of the pandemic and affected access and utilization of medical services. The purpose of this paper is to examine changes in access to telemedicine in 2020 in response to the pandemic for the U.S. Medicare population. Methods: The first two waves in June and October 2020 of the rapid response survey fielded by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to track and monitor the effects of the pandemic within the U.S. Medicare population. With a panel sample size of 9686 Medicare beneficiaries, the calculated statistics use replicate weights to adjust for the complex survey sample design and balanced repeated replication using Fayâ€™s adjustment of 0.3 for variance estimation. Results: Nearly 45 percent of the Medicare population reported use of a telehealth appointment between June and October of 2020. The likelihood of using telemedicine increased for those with chronic conditions, such as depression, and for those with higher incomes and education. Medical practices were more likely to encourage telehealth visits for Medicare patients between March and June with 57 percent of the Medicare population reporting that their usual provider offered a telemedicine appointment to replace a regular office visit during the spring and 48% reporting the suggested telemedicine replacement from July through October 2020. Overall access to telehealth increased from 60% to 64% but varied by race/ethnicity, gender, Census regions, and rural status. Conclusions: Access to telemedicine services expanded for the U.S. Medicare population during the pandemic but usage varied by chronic disease status, socioeconomic and demographic factors, and geography.","Swenson, T.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2021.11.023","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Value in Health; 25(1):S6, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-02","",26329,""

"Short report: COVID-19-related anxiety is associated with mental health problems among adults with rare disorders","Background For adults with rare disorders, COVID-19 can be more severe and deadlier. This may lead to anxiety about COVID-19 among adults with rare disorders, including worries about being infected. COVID-19 anxiety is linked with mental health problems in the general population. Aims To examine the levels of mental health problems and COVID-19 anxiety, and their association, among adults with rare disorders. Methods and procedures Adults with rare disorders (N = 58, Mage = 45.2 years, SD = 12.7, 69.0% females, 31.0% males) answered standardized mental health and COVID-19 anxiety questionnaires online. Their scores were compared with samples without rare disorders. Outcomes and results Mental health problems were higher than in a sample without rare disorders (effect size d = 1.14), as was COVID-19 anxiety (effect size d = 0.53). COVID-19 anxiety correlated significantly with mental health problems (r = .46). Controlling for age, gender, and work status, COVID-19 anxiety explained 16.1% of the variance in mental health problems (<U+0394>R2 = .161, p = .001). Conclusions and implications COVID-19 anxiety is higher than norms and associated with mental health problems for adults with rare disorders. During the pandemic, clinicians are recommended to assess COVID-19 anxiety for patients with rare disorders.","Fjermestad, Krister W.; Orm, Stian, Silverman, Wendy K.; Cogo-Moreira, Hugo","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ridd.2022.104181","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Research in Developmental Disabilities;: 104181, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-02","",26331,""
"The Serbian COVID-19 Stress Scale (Serbian-CSS) and vaccine acceptance: Is there a place for COVID-19-related distress in explaining attitudes towards vaccination?","Objectives Previous research has shown that the COVID-19 Stress Scale (CSS), a measure assessing various dimensions of distress related to the COVID-19 pandemic, is associated with self-protective behaviours;however, it remains unknown whether this distress can be used to predict attitudes towards vaccination. The purpose of this study was to validate the Serbian CSS (Serbian-CSS) and to explore its predictive power over and above certain sociodemographic characteristics, individual difference variables (attitudes and personality) and general distress in relation to COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Study design An online cross-sectional study was conducted that targeted users of different social network groups at the beginning of the public COVID-19 vaccination programme in Serbia. Methods A large, online study sample (N = 3129) provided self-reported data on COVID-19 related distress, health and sociodemographic indicators, individual difference variables and attitudes towards vaccination. Results The Serbian-CSS is a valid and reliable instrument that assesses six dimensions of COVID-19 distress. The strongest predictors of vaccine acceptance were attitudes towards immigrants (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.36, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.31, 0.41), followed by education (AOR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.27, 1.88) and pre-pandemic mental health issues (AOR = 1.61, 95% CI 1.30, 2.01). Conclusions The level of distress measured by the CSS had a non-substantial contribution to vaccine acceptance, which is probably due to the mild level of distress that was observed at the time of assessment. Public health messaging that relies on the distribution of information is not sufficient to address strongly held beliefs against vaccination. The study provides a benchmark for future cross-cultural research regarding negative affective states associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.","Mihic, Ljiljana, Terzic-Å upic, Zorica, Todorovic, Jovana, Maric, Nadja P.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2022.01.015","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Public Health;2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-02","",26332,""
"Risk-Perception Change Associated with COVID-19 Vaccine&rsquo;s Side Effects: The Role of Individual Differences","The COVID-19 vaccine appears to be a crucial requirement to fight the pandemic. However, a part of the population possesses negative attitudes towards the vaccine. The spread of conspiracy theories and contradictory information about the pandemic have altered the population&rsquo;s perception of risk. The risk-perception of the vaccine&rsquo;s side effects may be affected by individual differences. The complex relationship between risk-perception and individual differences is relevant when people have to make decisions based on ambiguous and constantly changing information, as in the early phases of the Italian vaccination campaign. The present study aimed at measuring the effect of individual differences in risk-perception associated with the COVID-19 vaccine&rsquo;s side effects in a context characterized by information ambiguity. An online survey was conducted to classify a sample of Italian pro-vaccine people into cognitive/behavioral style groups. Furthermore, changes in vaccine risk-perception after inconsistent communications regarding the vaccine&rsquo;s side effects were compared between groups. The results showed that &ldquo;analytical&rdquo;individuals did not change their perception regarding the probability of vaccine side effects but changed their perception regarding the severity of side effects;&ldquo;open&rdquo;and &ldquo;polarized&rdquo;individuals neither changed their perception regarding the probability nor of the severity of side effects, showing a different kind of information processing, which could interfere with an informed decision-making process.","Colautti, Laura, Cancer, Alice, Magenes, Sara, Antonietti, Alessandro, Iannello, Paola","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19031189","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(3):1189, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-02","",26333,""
"Retentissement psychologique de la crise sanitaire du COVID-19 sur les salariÃ©s","SUMMARY Purpose of the study: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the changes in working conditions, the fear of being contaminated at the work place and job insecurity can have a significant impact on the mental health of employees. The objective of this study was to measure the impact of the pandemic on the mental health of employees under follow-up in an occupational health service and to identify the factors associated with stress and fear at work. Method: An anonymous and confidential questionnaire was offered to employees coming to occupational health visit in early October and November 2020. Results: 1797 employees responded. Nearly 40% had manifestations of anxiety disorders and 20% had depressive signs. From the beginning of the crisis, almost a third of employees were more stressed than before and 21% happened to be afraid at work. Being more stressed at work was associated with gender, number of employees, seniority, working in the health sector, feeling affected by SARS-COV2, being at risk of severe covid-19, feeling exposed to SARS-COV2 at work, feeling insecure at work and having difficulties to apply barrier measures. The multivariate model analysis looking at factors associated to fear at work had similar findings. Conclusion: This study confirms and quantifies the importance of stress, feelings of insecurity and tensions at work. These results emphasized the role of an occupational health service in the face of a health crisis to best support employees and employers. RESUME Objectif: Dans le contexte de crise sanitaire, le bouleversement des habitudes de travail, la crainte dâ€™Ãªtre contaminÃ©s sur leur lieu dâ€™exercice, ou la fermeture de certains Ã©tablissements font prÃ©sager un impact important sur la santÃ© mentale des salariÃ©s. Lâ€™objectif de cette Ã©tude Ã©tait de mesurer lâ€™impact de la crise sanitaire sur la santÃ© mentale des salariÃ©s suivis par un service de santÃ© au travail et dâ€™identifier les facteurs associÃ©s au stress et Ã  la peur au travail. MÃ©thode: Un questionnaire anonyme et confidentiel Ã©tait proposÃ© aux salariÃ©s se rendant en visite mÃ©dicale dÃ©but octobre et novembre 2020. RÃ©sultats: 1797 salariÃ©s ont participÃ©. PrÃ¨s de 40% prÃ©sentaient des manifestations dâ€™anxiÃ©tÃ© et 20% des signes dÃ©pressifs (score HAD &gt;=8). PrÃ¨s dâ€™un tiers des salariÃ©s dÃ©clarait Ãªtre plus stressÃ©s au travail depuis le dÃ©but de la crise. 21% dÃ©clarait quâ€™il leur arrive dâ€™avoir peur au travail depuis le dÃ©but de la crise sanitaire. Le fait dâ€™Ãªtre plus stressÃ© Ã©tait associÃ© au genre, Ã  la taille de lâ€™entreprise, Ã  lâ€™anciennetÃ©, au secteur sanitaire et social, au fait de sâ€™Ãªtre senti affectÃ©, au fait dâ€™Ãªtre Ã  risque de forme grave de COVID-19, au sentiment dâ€™Ãªtre exposÃ© au SARS-COV2 dans le cadre de son travail, au sentiment dâ€™insÃ©curitÃ© au travail et au fait dâ€™avoir des difficultÃ©s dans lâ€™application des mesures barriÃ¨res.

"Reducing Inequities During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Rapid Review and Synthesis of Public Health Recommendations","Objectives: Efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic should take into account worsening health inequities. While many public health experts have commented on inequities, no analysis has yet synthesized recommendations into a guideline for practitioners. The objective of this rapid review was to identify the areas of greatest concern and synthesize recommendations. Methods: We conducted a rapid systematic review (PROSPERO: CRD42020178131). We searched Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases from December 1, 2019 to April 27, 2020. We included English language peer-reviewed commentaries, editorials, and opinion pieces that addressed the social determinants of health in the context of COVID-19. Results: 338 articles met our criteria. Authors represented 81 countries. Income, housing, mental health, age and occupation were the most discussed social determinants of health. We categorized recommendations into primordial, primary, secondary and tertiary prevention that spoke to the social determinants of COVID-19 and equity. Conclusion: These recommendations can assist efforts to contain COVID-19 and reduce health inequities during the pandemic. Using these recommendations, public health practitioners could support a more equitable pandemic response. Systematic Review Registration: PROSPERO, CRD42020178131.

"Psychological impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on individuals living with multiple sclerosis: a rapid systematic review","Introduction : The global spread of COVID-19 has raised concerns about its possible impact on mental health. People living with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) are considered potentially vulnerable to the mental health effects of the pandemic, as they may be subject to increased social isolation. Aim : To systematically review the current evidence on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health outcomes among PwMS. Method : We searched four major databases (Medline, EMBASE, PsychInfo and Scopus) and the WHO Global Health COVID-19 research database. We included peer-reviewed primary research studies using validated health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and psychometric screening tools to evaluate mental health outcomes among PwMS during the COVID-19 pandemic. Studies reporting data on the prevalence of mental health disorders, severity of psychological symptoms and contributing demographic and clinical factors for PwMS during the COVID-19 pandemic were included. Results : Our initial search yielded 268 records;19 studies (13 cross-sectional, 6 longitudinal) were included. Most were conducted during a peak in the pandemic in the host country via an online platform. The main mental health outcomes were depression, anxiety, stress, sleep quality and HRQOL. The included studies used a variety of outcome assessment tools and study designs. The prevalence of mental health issues such as depression, anxiety and stress were high among PwMS during the pandemic. In addition, compared to control populations, PwMS experienced more severe symptoms of depression and stress during the COVID-19 outbreak. However, results from longitudinal studies demonstrate that the severity of mental health symptoms among PwMS during the pandemic were not significantly different compared with the pre-pandemic period. Conclusion : Although mental health issues such as anxiety and depression were common among PwMS during the pandemic, current evidence suggests that mental health among PwMS has not been significantly affected by pandemic-related restrictive measures. Instead, the observed differences may be the result of pre-pandemic differences in prevalence and severity. Where possible, future studies should seek to address the methodological issues identified in the included studies to ensure that data collected during the pandemic can be synthesized into recommendations for policy and practice.","Zarghami, Amin, Hussain, Mohammad A.; Campbell, Julie A.; Ezegbe, Chigozie, van der Mei, Ingrid, Taylor, Bruce V.; Claflin, Suzi B.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2022.103562","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders;: 103562, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-02","",26337,""
"Post-Traumatic Growth during COVID-19: The Role of Perceived Social Support, Personality, and Coping Strategies","Although many studies on mental health have been conducted among various populations during the COVID-19 pandemic, few studies have focused on post-traumatic growth (PTG) in the general population. The current study aimed to explore whether perceived social support, personality, and coping strategies are associated with PTG in the COVID-19 pandemic period. The study also investigated whether coping strategies mediate the relations between perceived social support, personality, and PTG. A total of 181 participants (Mage = 24) completed the self-report questionnaire online, which was distributed via various online channels, mainly in China and Sweden. The relations between the study variables were examined with correlation analyses and a multiple mediation analysis. Results showed that more than half of the participants (60.8%) reported experiences of PTG during the pandemic. Additionally, perceived social support, personality traits (extraversion, emotional stability, agreeableness, and conscientiousness) and coping strategies (problem-focused coping, emotion-focused coping, and social support coping) were positively correlated with PTG. In addition, coping strategies (problem-focused coping, emotion-focused coping, and avoidance coping) mediated the relations between perceived social support, personality traits and PTG. Theoretical and practical implications of this study are discussed, concluding that the findings of this study have the potential to guide intervention efforts to promote positive change during the pandemic.","Xie, Chu-Si, Kim, Yunhwan","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10020224","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Healthcare; 10(2):224, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-02","",26338,""

"Post-COVID-19 Syndrome: Involvement and Interactions between Respiratory, Cardiovascular and Nervous Systems","Though the acute effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been extensively reported, the long-term effects are less well described. Specifically, while clinicians endure to battle COVID-19, we also need to develop broad strategies to manage post-COVID-19 symptoms and encourage those affected to seek suitable care. This review addresses the possible involvement of the lung, heart and brain in post-viral syndromes and describes suggested management of post-COVID-19 syndrome. Post-COVID-19 respiratory manifestations comprise coughing and shortness of breath. Furthermore, arrhythmias, palpitations, hypotension, increased heart rate, venous thromboembolic diseases, myocarditis and acute heart failure are usual cardiovascular events. Among neurological manifestations, headache, peripheral neuropathy symptoms, memory issues, lack of concentration and sleep disorders are most commonly observed with varying frequencies.

"POSC374 Association of COVID-19 on Adherence to Oral Specialty Pharmacy Oncology Medications and Quality of Life of Multiple Myeloma Patients","Objectives: In winter of 2019-2021 SARS-CoV-2 became pandemic (CoVID-19 or P). During P, treating patients with chronic disease burden, i.e., cancer (O), with multiple myeloma (MM) oncologics and achieving high medication adherence was reported to be challenging, e.g., delayed/missed provider visits, prescriptions, lab tests, and P-related financial difficulties and feelings of depression or anxiety. There are two Objectives: that characterize how the P may be associated with changes in: 1. adherence to specialty pharmacy MM medications (O-SP-D) and 2. MM patient-reported quality of life (QoL). Methods: A retrospective, observational, pre-/post- design study of 199 USA MM patientsâ€™ adherence to MM-SP-D and their reported QoL was conducted Pre-P (1/1-12/31/2019) and Post-P (3/1-8/31/2020). Patient assessments(PA), including medication therapy management (SPMTM) and the EQ-5D-5L QoL instrument, occurred at start-of-care (SOC) and 7-10 days before refills (F-U). Descriptive statics were used to calculate Pre-P Dimensional means before and after starting O-SP-D with SPMTM and again at F-U Post-P. The means of QoL measures in the Pre-P and Post-P periods were compared for differences, representing improved or diminished QoL associated with P. The mean medication possession ratio (MPR or adherence) was calculated, using the F-U from Pre-P and Post-P. Results: MPR was 1.0 Pre-P and 0.999 during Post-P (0.1% decrease). Differences between QoL means Pre-P vs Post-P were: Mobility +0.657 (65.7%), Self-Care +0.538 (53.8%), Usual Activities +0.642 (64.2%), Pain/Discomfort+0.884 (88.4%), Anxiety/Depression +0.641 (64.1%), Overall Health State +16.0 (16%).

"POSC74 Considerations for Mental Health Effects in Health Economic Analyses","Background: COVID-19 illuminated the fragility and importance of mental wellbeing. While health economic analyses often exclusively focus on direct health impacts and costs specific to the disease being assessed, these analyses commonly neglect downstream mental health impacts and costs of poor prognosis, debilitating adverse events, ineffective therapy, or limited remaining interventional options. Therefore, economic analyses may not capture the full picture when comparing interventions. Aim: This work aims to consider the psychological consequences applicable to all diseases and to outline key areas in economic analyses where such considerations could be effectively captured. The two overarching areas where mental health consequences can be included are: (1) quality of life (QoL), measured as utility in cost-utility analyses;and (2) monetary costs. Health state-specific utility values likely capture the mental health aspects of the included disease states (e.g., progressive or progression-free disease), and adverse event- and administration-related disutilities capture the negative mental health effects of treatment side-effects and administration, respectively. However, other factors can have substantial consequences on a patientâ€™s mental health and, as a result, will impact their QoL (e.g., patients who have exhausted all available treatment/intervention options may have a lower utility than patients who have not). Moreover, monetary costs included in economic analyses typically focus on direct healthcare requirements of the disease and indirect costs relating to caregiving, lost wages and/or lost productivity (depending on the perspective taken). Evaluations rarely consider the potentially significant accompanying monetary costs of psychotherapy or lost working time due to mental health detriment. Conclusions: Most health economic analyses solely include costs and outcomes directly related to the specific indication being assessed, but downstream mental health costs/consequences can have a significant impact on a patientâ€™s QoL and costs incurred. Accounting for mental health in economic analyses can substantially impact findings and may provide more complete view.","Dolph, M.; Tremblay, G.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2021.11.479","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Value in Health; 25(1):S101, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-02","",26342,""
"POSB195 Predicting New Mental Health Cases Pre- vs Post-COVID-19: A Comparison of Medical-Only and Integrated Data","Objectives: Identify factors likely to be associated with new mental-health (NM-H) cases PRE-COVID-19 and POST-COVID-19 and determine whether supplemental information could better identify at risk-employees for interventions. Methods: Workpartners Research Reference Database (RRDb) includes direct components (medical and prescription claims), indirect components (sick-leave/paid-time-off, short-term disability, family medical leaves [FMLA]), additional demographics, job-related information, and self-reported survey data. Gradient boosting was used to predict NM-H cases in the periods PRE-COVID-19 and POST-COVID-19 and compared for precision using demographic and direct-claims only (DIRECT) and integrated (INTEGRATED) data models. Proportion of days covered (PDC) was used for medication-adherence for non-mental-health conditions. Results: The PRE-COVID-19: Compared with DIRECT model, the INTEGRATED model identified 18x as many likely events and had increased precision (70% versus 53%, missing 99% and 91% of cases, respectively). Top predictors in the DIRECT model included: #-of-Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) specific-conditions, medication-adherence, age, gender, #-of chronic conditions, #-of unique medications. Top predictors in the INTEGRATED model included absence days (prior 30 days), self-reported anxiety, absence days (sick-leave/paid-time-off), #-of-AHRQ specific-conditions, medication-adherence, working =70 hours/week. POST-COVID-19: the INTEGRATED model identified &gt;3x as many likely events, with improved precision (79% versus 68%, missing 74% and 30% of cases, respectively). Top predictors in the DIRECT model included #-of unique medications, medication-adherence, gender, #-of-AHRQ specific-conditions, #-of chronic conditions, and total costs while the INTEGRATED modelâ€™s top predictors were #-of-prescriptions, absence days (sick-leave/paid-time-off), absence days (COVID), absence days (prior 30 days), self-reported anxiety and salary. Conclusions: In both PRE-/POST-COVID-19 time periods, INTEGRATED models reduced false positive rates and outperformed the DIRECT models, suggesting new mental health events can be better identified using additional information. The POST-COVID model identified different factors predicting new mental health claims and outperformed the PRE-COVID model. Accurate prediction of triggers can be used to enable policies proactively addressing potential challenges.","Brook, R. A.; Drnach, A. A.; Beren, I. A.; Papa, S. C.; Schaneman, J. A.; Rosenberg, E.

"POSB189 Mental Health in COVID Times: A Quasi-Experimental Analysis of the Impact of Lockdown Measures on Mental Healthcare Use in Germany","Objectives: On March 22, 2020, German federal authorities announced lockdown measures to contain the spread of COVID-19. There are concerns that these measures reduced the use of health services. Using a quasi-experimental approach, we investigated the impact that the enactment of lockdown measures had on mental healthcare utilization in Germany. Methods: Using data from a German health insurance covering the first 6 months of years 2019 and 2020, we identified hospitalizations with a mental health condition as the main diagnosis. Difference-in-differences Poisson regression models were used to evaluate the impact of lockdown measures on the number of weekly hospitalizations due to a mental health condition. All models controlled for age, gender, year, and week of the year. Analyses were further stratified by gender, age group (&lt;18, 18-25, 26-49, &gt;50), and diagnosis group (anxiety, behavioral disorders, disturb of personality, mood disorders, and schizophrenia). Results: During the first six months of 2020, the total number of mental-health related hospitalizations (14,127) was significantly lower compared to the first six months of 2019 (16,678, p&lt;0.001). Compared to 2019, mental-health hospitalizations in 2020 showed similar trends until week 12 (start of first lockdown) and then showed a relative decrease. On the date of lockdown start, the number of mental health hospitalizations dropped by 44.4% and the average weekly number of mental-health hospitalizations afterwards was significantly lower in 2020 compared to 2019 (428.4 vs. 616.3;aIRR: 0.726;95% CI: 0.88-0.766;p&lt;0.001). When stratified by gender, age, and diagnoses group, results remained to be consistent to above numbers. Conclusions: Our results show that there were substantial reductions in mental-health hospitalizations following the introduction of lockdown measures compared to 2019. Whether this can be interpreted as a sign for an underuse of needed health-care during pandemic times or an overuse of health-care during non-COVID times remains open for future research.","Ghiani, M.; Wilke, T.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2021.11.627","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Value in Health; 25(1):S131, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-02","",26344,""
"Patient Experiences and Insights on Chronic Ocular Pain from a Social Media Listening Study","Objective: To identify the perceived causes for chronic ocular pain (COP) (=3 months pain duration), its impact on quality of life (QoL) and understand the patient journey from social media posts. Methods: In this retrospective study, publicly available social media conversations were identified from searches triaged by a combination of automated relevancy keyword algorithm and manual review, and subsequently analyzed post anonymizing for COP content. Twitter, forums, and other (Facebook, Blogs, etc.) platforms were leveraged for the time period February 2020 to February 2021. Results: A total of 464 (UK=208, US=175, Canada=65 and Australia=16) patient/caregiver conversations on COP were identified. Top discussion points were symptoms (62%) and causes of COP (58%). Ocular factors (including dry eye disease, thyroid/Gravesâ€™ disease, and ocular surgeries) contributed to ~46% of causes identified, while non-ocular factors (including migraine, COVID, and side-effects/withdrawal of medications) contributed to ~54%. The most commonly mentioned symptoms (555) were headache/head pressures (96), dry/gritty eyes (67), light sensitivity (34), insomnia (29), and redness/pink eyes (28). Symptoms impacted all aspects of patientsâ€™ QoL: physical day-to-day activities such as reading, driving, and sleeping;emotional wellbeing such as depression/hopelessness, frustration/anger, fear, and suicidal thoughts;functional wellbeing such as difficulty at work/study place, reduced productivity or having to quit their job;social impacts such as being irritated around people, and having a less active social life. Eye drops (58/140 mentions) are the most commonly mentioned treatment option. Common coping strategies mentioned were blue-light filter glasses/eyeglasses (17), and hot compresses (11). Key unmet needs mentioned by patients were failed, improper, delayed diagnosis (62), and lack of effective treatments or appropriate management (30). Conclusion: Insights from this study reported patientsâ€™ experiences, concerns, and the adverse impact on overall QoL. The results can help in better understanding the patientsâ€™ perspective, which can be considered during drug development.","Goel, K.; Parashar, N.; Aasaithambi, S.; Verma, H.; O'Brien, P.; Sloesen, B.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2021.11.032","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Value in Health; 25(1):S8, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-02","",26345,""
"PaLS Study: Tobacco, Alcohol and Drugs Usage among Polish University Students in the Context of Stress Caused by the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic and imposed restrictions were strong stress factors for young people, especially students. Increased alcohol consumption, smoking cigarettes, usage of heated tobacco products, and other stimulants are common methods of coping with anxiety. However, they can have serious negative health effects. A survey consisting of 12 questions related to mental health and psychoactive substance taking habits was distributed among Polish students between 22 February 2021 and 3 April 2021. A total of 1323 participants met all inclusion criteria (nfemales = 1021, nmales = 297, nother gender = 5). The mean age was 22 years old (&plusmn;4.17);47.62% were medical university students. A total of 71.92% reported negative impact, 8.25% did not notice changes, and 12.58% declared a positive pandemic impact on their mental health. A total of 12.58% declared an increase, 70.22% did not see any differences, and 17.20% reported a decrease in their psychoactive substance usage tendency due to the pandemic. Worse perceived psychologic well-being was correlated with a higher tendency to use tobacco (p &lt; 0.001) and alcohol (p &lt; 0.001), and not with marijuana and products containing tetrahydrocannabinol (p = 0.136), and hard drugs (p = 0.799). The majority of participants declared a negative pandemic impact on mental health and did not report significant changes in psychoactive substance taking habits. Medical personnel should be aware of the current situation and apply for proper prevention and treatment programs.","Jodczyk, Alicja Monika, Kasiak, Przemyslaw Seweryn, Adamczyk, Natalia, Gebarowska, Joanna, Sikora, Zuzanna, Gruba, Grzegorz, Mamcarz, Artur, Sliz, Daniel","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19031261","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(3):1261, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-02","",26346,""
"New Recovery Strategies in Motor and Cognitive Functions, before, during and after Home-Confinement COVID-19, for Healthy Adults and Patients with Neurodegenerative Diseases: Review","Distancing and confinement at home during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has led to worsening of motor and cognitive functions, both for healthy adults and for patients with neurodegenerative diseases. The decrease in physical activity, the cessation of the intervention of the recovery and the social distance imposed by the lockdown, has had a negative impact on the physical and mental health, quality of life, daily activities, as well as on the behavioral attitudes of the diet. The purpose of this paper was to evaluate the impact of decreasing physical activity and the affected emotional status in healthy adults and patients with neurodegenerative diseases in conditions imposed by the stay at home mandate of COVID-19, along with new interventions, such as telemedicine and telerehabilitation. These interventions include online surveys carried out in multi-languages, semi-structured interviews, intervention smartphones and interventions through online platforms, for instance: Google, WhatsApp, Twitter, ResearchGate, Facebook and LinkedIn. For this study, we selected original papers that were intensively processed using characteristics co-related with physical activity, mental wellbeing, sleep quality, good eating behavior and healthy lifestyle. By searching the last two years of literature, our review presents and demonstrates the benefit of online technological interventions in lockdown, which promote physical exercise patterns and rehabilitation techniques, for healthy adults and patients with neurodegenerative diseases, and the need to develop new strategic directions and governmental measures, designed procedures and health services, which are expected to improve the quality of life, the progress of physical and cognitive functions, mental health and wellbeing for all.","Bacanoiu, Manuela, Danoiu, Mircea, Marin, Mihnea, Rusu, Mihai Robert, Rusu, Ligia","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm11030597","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Journal of Clinical Medicine; 11(3):597, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-02","",26347,""
"Network analysis of subjective well-being in general public during the regular prevention and control of COVID-19","Objective: To investigate the related factors of subjective well-being among people in China during the regular prevention and control of COVID-19. Methods: From August 5 to August 11,2020,a total of 1556 people were investigated by using online platform. The Satisfaction with Life Scale(SWLS) and Positive and Negative Affect Scale(PANAS) were used to measure subjective well-being(SWB) of the general population. The Public Risk Perception Scale for Public Health Emergencies(PRPSPHE) was used to measure risk perception of COVID-19, the BDSST was used to measure daily hassles, the DASS was used to measure psychological symptom and the Psychological Capital Scale was used to measure psychological capital. A network analysis was conducted to analyze the correlations between these variables. Results: There was no significant correlation between SWB score and PRPSPHE score(r=-0.06,P&gt;0.05).The SWB scores were negatively correlated with the BDSST scores(r=-0.37,P &lt;0.05).Depression and Stress showed highest centrality(1.29 and 1.09 respectively), and psychological symptom showed highest predictability(0.69-0.72) in the network. Anxiety showed the highest expected influence(0.95), followed by self-efficacy(0.87) and stress(0.84). Conclusions: During the regular prevention and control of COVID-19,subjective well-being may not be related to risk perception of COVID-19, while negatively correlated with daily hassles and psychological symptom. Psychological capital may be a protective factor of subjective well-being.

"The Multi-Relationship Structure Between Some Symptoms and Features Seen During The New Coronavirus 19 Infection and The Levels of Post-Covid Anxiety and Depression","The novel-coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19) epidemic and the measures taken to combat it have adversely affected the psychological-health of societies and individuals. In this study, it was aimed to examine the multi-relationship structure between some symptoms, demographic characteristics during the infection period of individuals treated for COVID-19 infection and their anxiety/depression levels after discharge. One hundred individuals (n=100) who were treated with the diagnosis of COVID-19 participated in the study. Some symptoms and socio-demographic characteristics of the participants during the infection-period were recorded and the Beck anxiety/depression scale was administered to the participants after discharge. Firstly, variables that create multicollinearity were removed from the data set via explanatory - factor-analysis and the variable was reduced. Then, the independent -principal-components were determined and their attributes were found. The relationship structure between the features and the anxiety/depression levels of the patients was analyzed by reducing them to two dimensions via Multiple-Correspondence-Analysis. In this study, patients with chronic renal failure who received oxygen support during the infection process were positively associated with mild/moderate post-infection anxiety. Patients with chronic-renal-failure were found to have higher depression than those without. Patients with COPD who experienced loss of appetite and fever during the infection were positively associated with moderate to high levels of anxiety and moderate depression. In addition, these individuals received more oxygen - support during the treatment-process and the depression level of these individuals was higher than the other patients. Our study revealed the multi-relationships structure between some symptoms and features seen during COVID-19 infection and post-COVID anxiety-depression levels.

"Mental Health Status of People with Multiple Sclerosis during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Objective. This study assesses and compares the mental health status of people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) in Poland during the second wave of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (November 2020) to a similar group whose mental health status was examined in November 2017. It also analyzed the psychological resources such as self-efficacy and health locus of control (HLC) and their relationship to mental health in both groups. Methods. Cross-sectional study included two groups of PwMS with 113 respondents each. The respondents completed the General Health Questionnaire-12 and questionnaires for assessing self-efficacy and HLC. The clinical and demographic data of participants were also collected. Results. No differences in mental health status were observed between the studied groups. A hierarchical regression model of the group studied in 2020 revealed that general self-efficacy (&beta;= &minus;0.21, p = 0.032), HLC&mdash;internal (&beta;= &minus;0.21, p = 0.035), and education (&beta;= &minus;0.18, p = 0.048) explained 18% of the variance in the mental health of PwMS, whereas according to the model of the group assessed in 2017 self-efficacy (&beta;= &ndash;0.31, p &lt; 0.001), HLC&mdash;chance (&beta;= 0.45, p &lt; 0.001), and HLC&mdash;internal (&beta;= &minus;0.37, p &lt; 0.001) explained 48% of the variance. Conclusions. Study results suggest that the pandemic and the related lockdown had no effect on the mental health status of PwMS. At the same time, it was noted that well known determinants of mental health such as self-efficacy and HLC seemed to retain their prominent role for mental functioning in the pandemic.","Wilski, Maciej, Koper, Magdalena, Gabryelski, Jaroslaw, Brola, Waldemar, Tasiemski, Tomasz","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm11030576","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Journal of Clinical Medicine; 11(3):576, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-02","",26350,""
"Increased Risks of Mental Disorders: Youth with Inactive Physical Activity","Before COVID-19, one of the most dangerous pandemics of the 21st century was physical inactivity (PI). Sedentary habits had increased in the last decades, reducing physical condition and increasing non-communicable diseases and mental disorders in the population. This study aimed to analyse the relationships between physical activity level (PAL) and the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and other mental disorders in Spanish young aged 15&ndash;35 years and to calculate the odd ratio (OR) of developing from these mental disorders in inactive young people, based on PAL. Methods: A cross-sectional study based on data from the Spanish National Health Survey 2017 with 4195 participants was conducted. A descriptive analysis was performed. Possible differences between groups were analysed using the non-parametric statistical tests. OR and relative risks for mental disorders in inactive versus others PAL were calculated. Results: Dependence relationships were found between PAL and the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and other mental disorders (p &lt; 0.001). In addition, the risk of developing: anxiety (OR: 6.14. 95% CI: 3.28&ndash;11.50), depression (OR: 5.35. 95% CI: 2.40&ndash;11.96), and other mental disorders (OR: 8.52. 95% CI: 2.90&ndash;25.06) was higher in inactive young people. Conclusions: PI is associated to high risk of mental disorders in Spanish young people.","Denche-Zamorano, Ãngel, Franco-GarcÃ­a, Juan Manuel, Carlos-Vivas, Jorge, Mendoza-MuÃ±oz, MarÃ­a, Pereira-Payo, DamiÃ¡n, Pastor-Cisneros, Raquel, Merellano-Navarro, Eugenio, Adsuar, JosÃ© Carmelo","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10020237","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Healthcare; 10(2):237, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-02","",26351,""
"The Importance of Physical Activity to Augment Mood during COVID-19 Lockdown","The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of COVID-19 lockdown on mood and objective physical activity. A sample of 78 college students in Spain completed an assessment of mood using the valid Profile of Mood State (POMS) questionnaire and had their physical activity tracked objectively using a validated wrist-worn accelerometer (Xiaomi Mi Band 2) for one week before being under COVID-19 lockdown (T1) and for one week during COVID-19 lockdown (T2). Paired samples t-tests revealed significantly greater (p = 0.027) POMS Total Mood Disturbance (TMD) Score T2 (mean &plusmn;SD) (22.6 &plusmn;28.0) compared to T1 (17.7 &plusmn;22.6) (lower score represents better mood) and significantly lower (p &le;0.001) POMS Vigor Score T2 (14.1 &plusmn;5.0) compared to T1 (18.2 &plusmn;4.5) (lower vigor score represents lower mental and physical energy levels). Additionally, Total Objective Steps was significantly less (p &le;0.001) lT2 (15,841.9 &plusmn;17,253.2 steps) compared to T1 (64,607.0 &plusmn;50,525.2 steps). Regression analyses demonstrated significant negative relationships of Total Objective Steps and POMS Depression (p = 0.014, Beta = &minus;0.277, t = &minus;2.511), POMS Anger (p = 0.040, Beta = &minus;0.233, t = &minus;2.091), and POMS TMD (p = 0.007, Beta = &minus;0.302, t = &minus;2.754) T2. The regressions also revealed a significant positive relationship (p = 0.012, Beta = 0.283, t = 2.57) of Total Objective Steps and POMS Vigor T2. These data suggest that being in a lockdown due to a pandemic may have negative physical and mental health-related consequences and that engaging in physical activity may reduce these deleterious mental health-related consequences during lockdowns and quarantines.","Fennell, Curtis, Eremus, Thomas, Puyana, MoisÃ©s Grimaldi, SaÃ±udo, Borja","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19031270","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(3):1270, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-02","",26352,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on the Health-Related Quality-of-Life of Pregnant and Postpartum Persons","Objectives: To assess the impact of COVID-19 on health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) of those who were pregnant or recently pregnant during the pandemic. Methods: Individuals who were pregnant any time since January 2020, the beginning of the pandemic, were invited to participate in an online, national US survey (EuroQol grant: 260-2020RA). Respondents were asked to self-report their experiences with COVID-19, to complete the EQ-5D-5L, and other measurements of HRQoL. To estimate the association between COVID-19 infection with the EQ-5D-5L outcomes, we used median regression for the EQ-5D utility and EQ-VAS scores, and ordinal logistic regressions for the EQ-5D-5L health items. Post-stratification weights were used to ensure representation by age, race and US census region. Results: Among pregnant or postpartum persons, the median EQ-5D-5L utility score was 0.87 and EQ-VAS was 0.80. The median EQ-5D-5L utility score increased by 0.0058 (95% CI 0.0026, 0.009) for each additional year of age of the respondent. We observed no change in EQ-5D-VAS utility measures by maternal age (ÃŸ= 0.00;95% CI -0.09, 0.09). On average, comparing Black pregnant persons to White, EQ-5D-5L utility values were 0.44 points lower, and EQ-5D-VAS scores were 0.31 points lower. Although median EQ-5D-5L utility values were similar for those with and without a diagnosis of COVID-19 (0.87 and 0.88), utility values declined by 0.022 (95% CI -0.040, -0.010) for each unit increase in perceived COVID-19 severity. Similar results were observed for the EQ-5D-VAS scores. When we evaluated EQ-5D-5L items individually, respondents diagnosed with COVID-19 reported more problems related to anxiety/depression compared with those who did not (OR 2.43;95% CI 1.35, 4.40). No other items were significantly associated with COVID-19. Conclusions: We observed lower HRQoL measures associated with severe COVID-19 infection during pregnancy. In particular, problems with anxiety and depression contributed most strongly to lowered HRQoL during pregnancy.","Regan, A.; Aytha Swathi, P.; Nosek, M.; Gu, N.

"Impact of COVID-19 on Health-Related Quality-of-Life in the United States, Sweden and Norway: A Cross-Country Comparison Using a Panel Survey","Objectives: To assess and compare the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) in the United States, Sweden and Norway. Methods: Two waves of web-based survey were conducted in April 2020 and January 2021 to collect demographic data, COVID-19 status, behavior and employment changes related to COVID-19 in each country (EuroQol Grant: 246-2020RA). EQ-5D-5L was used to assess health status of respondents. Results were compared between the two waves to measure changes in HRQoL. One-way ANOVA was used to detect significant differences between countries, and t-tests for differences between waves. Results: We collected 2,734, 1,003 and 1,020 responses in Wave 1, and 2,252, 1,013 and 1,011 responses in Wave 2 for the US, Sweden, and Norway respectively. Corresponding mean (SD) EQ-VAS scores were 74.6 (Â±19.2), 68.7 (Â±21.4), and 69.2 (Â±20.8) in Wave 1 (p&lt;0.001), and 76.4 (Â±18.6), 68.2 (Â±20.3), and 67.8 (Â±21.7) in Wave 2 (p&lt;0.001). Between waves, only the VAS scores in the US were significantly different (p&lt;0.001). Mean (SD) utility scores were 0.822 (Â±0.222), 0.768 (Â±0.260), and 0.808 (Â±0.248) in wave 1 (p&lt;0.001), and 0.823 (Â±0.221), 0.783 (Â±0.237), and 0.777 (Â±0.271) in wave 2 (p&lt;0.001);there were no significant differences between waves for all three countries. Anxiety/depression was consistently the most problematic EQ-5D-5L subdomain among Swedish and Americans (&gt;50%), followed by pain/discomfort. &gt;45% Norwegians also reported problems in anxiety/depression subdomain in both waves. The proportions reporting problems in anxiety/depression increased in wave 2 for Sweden and Norway, but decreased for the US. Conclusions: Population HRQoL in Sweden and Norway has been similar throughout the pandemic, while a rebound in population mean VAS was observed in the US. However, the large proportions reporting problems in anxiety/depression across waves in all 3 countries indicates that mental health issues resulting from the pandemic are a major concern.","Chen, J.; Gong, C.

"From the First to the Second Wave of COVID-19: Anxiety, De-Pressive, and Post-Traumatic Stress Symptoms in the Italian Population","In the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, high rates of clinically relevant anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) have been reported in the Italian population. The persistence of the pandemic and related restrictive measures highlight the need for a reassessment of psychopathological symptoms. The present longitudinal study consisted of two evaluations conducted during the two waves of infection. Participants were asked to complete the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Form Y1 (STAI Y1), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), and the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). There were no significant differences in depressive symptoms and PTSS scores reported by participants between T0 and T1, with single-case analysis revealing that in 71% and 69% of the participants, depressive symptoms and PTSS symptoms, respectively, remained stable during this period. On the contrary, mean scores comparison showed a significant decrease in anxiety levels, with 19% of participants in whom anxiety symptoms improved at single-case analysis. Taken together, these results suggest that depressive symptoms and PTSS not only occurred in a high percentage of participants but also tended to remain stable over time, thus warranting the importance of large-scale psychological screening and interventions to prevent the chronicization of these symptoms and their evolution to psychopathological disorders.","Benfante, Agata, Tesio, Valentina, Di Tella, Marialaura, Romeo, Annunziata, Castelli, Lorys","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19031239","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(3):1239, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-02","",26355,""
"Food Habits and Lifestyle of Romanians in the Context of the COVID-19 Pandemic","The pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has produced significant changes in socio-cultural life, diet, and interpersonal relationships across the world&rsquo;s population. The present study aims to identify changes in lifestyle and diet among the Romanian population one year after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. An online questionnaire with 58 items (addressing the following aspects: socio-demographic and anthropometric data, current eating habits, and lifestyle changes) was distributed using institutional mailing lists and social media. A total number of 2040 respondents participated in the study, of whom 1464 were women, and 576 men. Among the respondents, 1598 came from urban areas and 442 from rural areas. The processing of the collected data showed significant changes in the behavior of the respondents caused by the pandemic situation with psycho-affective changes in some cases. The number of people who had anxiety, depression and nervousness increased by up to 20%. The majority of respondents (over 57%) were up to 30 years old, either students (43.50%) or employees going to workplaces (33.20%). Analyzing eating habits, we found that diet modification was needed to increase the daily consumption of fruits, vegetables, fish, and seafood. Regarding weight status during the pandemic, we noticed that 34.7% of normal-weight respondents said that they gained weight while 49.7% of overweight people and 52.5% of obese people said that they gained weight (p &lt; 0.0001). Regarding psycho-emotional behavior, 11.81% of the surveyed women stated that they frequently had depressive states during the pandemic period and 11.63% of the men stated that they frequently presented depressive states during the pandemic (p = 0.005).","Nastasescu, Valentin, Mititelu, Magdalena, Stanciu, Tiberius Iustinian, Draganescu, Doina, Grigore, Nicoleta Diana, Udeanu, Denisa Ioana, Stanciu, Gabriela, Neac<U+0219>u, Sorinel Marius, Dinu-PÃ®rvu, Cristina Elena, Oprea, Eliza, Ghica, Manuela","https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14030504","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Nutrients; 14(3):504, 2022.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-02","",26356,""
"Finding Silver Linings: A Mixed Methods Analysis of COVID-19â€™s Challenges and Opportunities for College Studentsâ€™ Functioning and Outlook","This study examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on college students? lives. A mixed methods approach, analyzing open- and closed-ended questions about challenges and opportunities, reveals numerous ways in which the pandemic has impacted students in general and differentially by gender, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, and family income. Cisgender male and heterosexual students generally reported less of a mental health impact from the pandemic. Gender and sexual minorities, and low- to middle-income students, also noted some effects of the pandemic more often than their peers. Finally, thematic analysis revealed that where students found challenges, they also found opportunities within the broad categories of Lifestyle and Routines, Academic/Professional, Health, Interpersonal, and Societal impacts, evidencing heterogeneity and resilience in finding silver linings despite the challenging pandemic.

"Young Adult Adaptability to the Social Challenges of the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Protective Role of Friendships","The continuing COVID-19 pandemic enables assessment of the adaptability of young adults to non-normative stressors threatening their social-emotional wellbeing. Focusing specifically on a developmentally critical social challenge of restricted in-person contact, the goal of the current study was to examine the role of friendships in alleviating social-emotional problems. Data were collected via online surveys from an ethnically diverse sample (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1557) of 20 to 24-year-olds (62% cisgender female, 31% male, 7% gender diverse or gender questioning) in spring of 2021. Longitudinal data from an earlier time point involving an age-normative social challenge (transition out of high school) were used as a comparison. The comparisons between the transition from high school and the pandemic showed that whereas social anxiety and depressive symptoms increased, loneliness decreased. Participants also reported having slightly more friends and rated the overall quality of their friendships as somewhat higher. Regression analyses revealed that a greater number of friends over time and greater satisfaction with friend electronic communication during the pandemic were most robustly related to lower social and generalized anxiety as well as depressive symptoms, over and above earlier social-emotional wellbeing and a number of relevant correlates. Loneliness was protected by higher quality of friendships, greater contact with friends, as well as more frequent and satisfying electronic communication with friends. The results suggest that although young adults are facing emotional challenges during the continued pandemic, they are also able to adapt by keeping in touch with friends to decrease subjective sense of isolation. The findings have novel intervention implications to reduce loneliness.","Juvonen, Lessard, Kline, Graham","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10964-022-01573-w","20220201","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-02","",26360,""

Therefore, we assessed the prevalence of mental health symptoms, including associated risk factors, and quality of life (QoL) in family members of COVID-19 ICU survivors 3 and 12Ã‚Â months post-ICU. A prospective multicentre cohort study in ICUs of ten Dutch hospitals, including adult family members of COVID-19 ICU survivors admitted between March 1, and July 1, 2020. Symptom prevalence rates of anxiety, depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (Impact of Event Scale-6), and QoL (Short Form-12) before ICU admission (baseline), and after 3 and 12Ã‚Â months were measured. Additionally, associations between family and patient characteristics and mental health symptoms were calculated. A total of 166 out of 197 (84.3%) included family members completed the 12-month follow-up of whom 46.1% and 38.3% had mental health symptoms 3 and 12Ã‚Â months post-ICU, respectively; both higher compared to baseline (22.4%) (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001).

"Epidemiology of Suicide in Western Odisha During COVID Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Analysis","Introduction Suicide is the act of deliberately killing oneself. It is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Each year, more than seven lakh people end their lives globally. India is the worst-affected country in Southeast Asia. Both the genders and all age groups are affected. The COVID pandemic has led to the disruption of routine life and business. The proportion of deaths due to suicide was 9.4%Ã‚Â among all deaths reported for autopsiesÃ‚Â by a study in the same mortuary over a seven-year period. Increased stress and anxiety have been postulated to lead to suicide. Our study objective is to describe the epidemiology of suicide during the early COVID pandemic (lockdown period). Methods This is a record-based cross-sectional study. We have analyzed the post-mortem reports for six months starting from April 1, 2020. Descriptive analysis was performed with Epi Info version 7 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, Atlanta, GA, USA). Results During the study period, 340 cases were classified as deaths due to suicide, out of a total of 891 mortalities. The median age for females was 26.5 and for males, it was 30. The male to female ratio was 1.8:1. Most of the deceased (39.8%) were in their third decade, followed by the fourth decade (18.9%), second decade (15%), and fifth decade (12.98%), respectively. Poisoning was the leading method used for suicide, accounting for 238 (70.1%) deaths, followed by hanging (11.8%), burns (6.8%), jumping from a height (6.5%), and jumping in front of the train (4.13%). Self-immolation (burning) was a common mode of suicide for females. Most of the suicides (71.4%) took place from the evening to midnight. Conclusion There was a fourfold rise in suicides during the period compared to previous data. Productive age groups are affected more. A large-scaleÃ‚Â multi-centric study in community settings for estimation of the true burden is the need of the hour. A multi-sectorial public health approach is needed to prevent untimely death due to suicide.","Mishra, Panigrahi, Panda, Panda, Choubey, Panda, Behera, Pradhan","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.21438","20220201","burn; covid pandemic; covid-19 related mental issues; epidemiology; hanging; india; lockdown; odisha; poisoning; suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-02","",26363,""
"Parental Perceptions of Child and Adolescent Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Argentina","As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, governments have implemented preventive measures towards reducing infections. These conditions can affect the mental health of children and adolescents; however, this has not yet been fully explored. The aim of the study was to analyze changes in symptomatology and positive emotions in Argentine children and adolescents since the onset of isolation, based on parent/caregiver report. We analyzed differences based on gender, age, socioeconomic status (SS) and containment measure (and their interactions); their associations with symptomatology and positive affect of parents/caregivers; and the moderating effects of sociodemographic factors on these associations. A total of 1205 caregivers responded to a survey regarding the mental health of children and adolescents under their care. They also completed a set of anxiety, depression, and affect measures about themselves. A considerable proportion of parents/caregivers perceived changes in their children's and adolescents' mental health compared to before the pandemic. Increased levels of anxiety-depression, aggression-irritability, impulsivity-inattention, and dependence-withdrawal were reported, as well as alterations in sleeping and eating habits, and a reduction in positive affect. Differences were observed according to their age and containment measure. Finally, we found correlations between parents/caregivers' symptomatology and that reported about their children or adolescents. Gender, age and SS moderated some of these relationships. Continued monitoring of child and adolescent mental health is a fundamental necessity. We recommend the implementation of early intervention strategies to prevent the escalation of serious mental health problems, particularly in those groups that have been most adversely affected since the onset of the pandemic.","AndrÃƒÂ©s, Galli, Del Valle, Vernucci, LÃƒÂ³pez-Morales, Gelpi-Trudo, Canet-Juric","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10566-021-09663-9","20220201","Adolescents; COVID-19; Children; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-02","",26364,""
"Prevalence and associated factors of depression, anxiety and suicidality among Chinese high school E-learning students during the COVID-19 lockdown","The outbreak of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in 2019 and the resulting quarantine may have increased the prevalence of mental health problems in adolescents. The aim of this study was to explore the association between the effects of home-based learning during the pandemic and the risks of depression, anxiety, and suicidality among junior and senior high school students. An online survey using Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) was conducted between 12 to 30 April 2020, on a total of 39,751 students. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the risk factors of associated depression, anxiety and suicidality during the pandemic. Prevalence of depression, anxiety symptoms and suicidality found was 16.3% (95% CI: 16.0, 16.7), 10.3% (95% CI: 10.0, 10.6) and 20.3% (95% CI: 19.9, 20.7), respectively. Participants with female gender and in junior high school, with poor overall sleep quality and poor academic performance and very worried about being infected during COVID-19 were highly associated with the risk of depression, anxiety symptoms and suicidal ideation (all P&lt;0.001). Prevalence of self-reported mental health problems for adolescents using home-based distance learning was high. Implementing measures (e.g., wearing face masks) and spending only moderate time focusing on COVID-19-related information could be protective factors for mental health. These results provide suggestions for teachers and policy makers regarding adolescent improving sleep quality (sufficient sleep) and academic performance and reducing <i>worry about pandemic during quarantine to prevent mental health problems.</i>","Peng, Liang, Liu, Cai, Chen, Huang, Wang, Zhao","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-02512-x","20220201","Adolescents; Anxiety Symptoms; COVID-19; Depression Symptoms; Suicidality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-02","",26365,""
"Mild anxiety and depression disorders: Unusual reactions to COVID-19 lockdown in caregivers of older adults attending a psychogeriatric clinic in Southwest Nigeria","Many sub-Saharan African countries have fragile healthcare systems and the mental health care of older adults is in a precarious state. The lockdown that accompanied COVID-19 infection was another monumental event. This study examined the effect of the restriction and lockdown on the mental health of the caregivers of older patients attending a psychogeriatric clinic in Ibadan, Nigeria. We selected 178 dyads of patients and their caregivers. These caregivers were administered a semi-structured questionnaire that collected demographic information and asked questions on effect of COVID-19 on caregiving. In addition, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and generalised anxiety disorder-7 item scale were administered. Participants were interviewed through telephone. One hundred and seventy-eight patients' caregivers' dyads were interviewed. About 62.4% of the caregivers were children of the patients. More importantly, 97.2% and 93.8% had neither depressive nor anxiety symptoms and the caregivers expressed little worry about COVID-19. There was no significant difference in the mean depressive and anxiety scores in caregivers of patients with and without dementia (F = 0.28, P = 0.60). Caregivers who were lesser than 50 years in age had significantly higher mean score compared with those who were 50 years and above (F = 5.54, P = 0.03). The rate of anxiety and depressive symptoms was very low in this cohort as the lockdown during the pandemic produced little distress to caregivers including those caring for patients with dementia and cognitive impairment. This is a deviation from reports of some other countries and cultures which described psychological implications of COVID-19 on caregivers as severe.","Elugbadebo, Baiyewu","https://doi.org/10.4103/npmj.npmj_708_21","20220201","Anxiety; COVID-19; caregiver; depression; lockdown; psychogeriatrics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-02","",26366,""
"Perceived social support and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic: A nationally-representative study","The COVID-19 pandemic and the associated containment policies have led to negative mental health consequences in the general population. This study investigated the association between perceived social support and depressive symptoms in Korea. Data from the Korea Community Health Survey conducted from August to November 2020 was used for this cross-sectional study. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and perceived social support was assessed based on the number of contacts that participants had identified as being available in case participants needed isolation due to COVID-19 exposure. This study included the general adult populations aged 19Ã¢â‚¬â€°years and older. The relationship between the perceived social support and depressive symptoms was analyzed using multivariable liner regression analysis. Subgroup analysis was conducted based on income. Analysis of the data obtained from 225,453 participants indicated that PHQ-9 scores were highest in the group with 'no' perceived social support, followed by 'low', 'middle', and 'high' perceived levels of social support. Compared to individuals with 'high' perceived social support, those with 'middle' (ÃŽÂ²: .10, <i>p</i>-value &lt;.001), 'low (ÃŽÂ²: .07, <i>p</i>-value .010), and 'no' (ÃŽÂ²: .34, <i>p</i>-value &lt;.001) perceived levels of social support showed poorer depression scores. The magnitude of the relationship found was particularly strong in the low-income group. During the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals' depression scores varied according to their perceived level of social support. Strategies that address the need of vulnerable individuals are required to reduce the potentially negative mental health consequences of the pandemic.","Ju, Kim, Lee","https://doi.org/10.1177/00207640211066737","20220201","COVID-19; depressive symptoms; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-02","",26367,""
"Longitudinal effects of COVID-19-related stressors on young adults' mental health and wellbeing","The COVID-19 pandemic has presented young adults with novel challenges and disruptions to several life domains. The current study examined how COVID-19-related stressors (i.e., job-related, financial-related, social/relational, and illness-related stressors) relate to young adults' symptoms of depression and anxiety, and satisfaction with life (in the US). In Aim 1, we examined associations between COVID-19-related stressors and indices of mental health and well-being in the initial phase of the pandemic (April/May 2020) while accounting for participants' pre-pandemic levels of these outcomes in January of 2020 (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã‚Â 519; M<sub>age</sub> Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°25.4; 62.8% women). Social/relational stressors were most strongly associated with increased symptoms of anxiety/depression, and financial stressors were most strongly associated with decreased satisfaction with life. Extending this research longitudinally (Aim 2), we sampled young adults bi-monthly across a year-long period (September 2020 to August 2021). Multilevel models revealed within-person associations between each stressor domain and mental health/well-being; young adults reported more symptoms of depression/anxiety and lower satisfaction with life in months that stressors were relatively more salient. Interactions between stressors and time revealed associations were generally stronger in earlier months and decreased linearly across the pandemic. Taken together, longitudinal evidence indicates that COVID-19-related stressors, especially social/relational stressors, have direct and time-varying associations with mental health and well-being.","Graupensperger, Calhoun, Patrick, Lee","https://doi.org/10.1111/aphw.12344","20220201","SARS-CoV-2; anxiety; depression; emerging adulthood; satisfaction with life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-02","",26368,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer patients and psycho-oncology providers: Perspectives, observations, and experiences of the American Psychosocial Oncology Society (APOS) membership","To understand: (1) psycho-oncology providersX2019; perspectives on and observations of the psychological responses of their cancer patients during the pandemic, and (2) psycho-oncology providersX2019; own experiences delivering care. In this concurrent mixed methods study, a survey was distributed to psychosocial providers who were members of the American Psychosocial Oncology Society (APOS). Survey respondents were invited to participate in a one-on-one audio-recorded interview via phone or secure ZoomX00AE;. 76 self-identified psycho-oncology providers responded to the survey and 11 participated in a one-on-one interview. Approximately half reported that patients responded in unique ways to COVID-19 stress relative to other populations. Three themes emerged from qualitative analyses: (1) unique burden on patients, (2) cancer patientsX2019; pandemic response and its relationship to their cancer experience, and (3) unexpected positive changes. Providers emphasized that the cancer experience may have prepared patients for the existential distress of the pandemic and described patientsX2019; resiliency. Two themes emerged regarding delivery of care: (1) new professional and personal challenges and (2) provider resiliency. Although providers observed that the pandemic placed new burdens on patients, they emphasized that the cancer experience may have prepared patients for the existential distress of the pandemic and described patientsX2019; resiliency. To overcome challenges, psycho-oncology providers used innovative strategies to support patients and foster their own mental health. This article is protected by copyright.

"Emotional and Behavioral Impact of the COVID-19 Epidemic in Adolescents","This review of the literature aims to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown on teenagers' mental health. We distinguish two groups: adolescents who had already been diagnosed with a mental disorder and the general population of adolescents. An increase in the number of mental health-related difficulties in adolescents has already been reported in previous health crises. Accordingly, the perceived well-being of teenagers declined during the COVID-19 pandemic. Adolescents with mental disorders were significantly more affected by the lockdown than those in the general population. The effect of the COVID-19 crisis on the mental health of adolescents has been heterogeneous. The first pandemic wave was essentially associated with an increase of internalizing symptoms in adolescents, particularly anxiety, depression and eating disorders. The impact on externalizing symptoms was less clear, and seem to concern mostly adolescents with pre-existing behavioral disorders. During the second and later waves of the pandemic, an upsurge of suicidal ideation and attempts among adolescents have been reported in many countries.","Bera, Souchon, Ladsous, Colin, Lopez-Castroman","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11920-022-01313-8","20220201","Anxiety; Behavioral disorder; Depression; Mental disorder; Pandemic; Suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-02","",26370,""

"Narrative review of the COVID-19, healthcare and healthcarers thematic series","This review covers the thematic series of 22 papers selected from among manuscripts published by BJPsych Open concerning coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and healthcare. We report nine papers that cover concepts and epidemiology relating to the public and patients. We review 11 papers about the impact of COVID-19 on healthcare services and their staff in 15 countries. Two papers consider the psychosocial impact on staff working in mental health services in the UK. Most papers report cross-sectional analyses of data collected from convenience samples by self-reported surveys conducted at single times. They have limitations of generalisability, do not enable conclusions about diagnosis or causality, and many are likely to have attendant bias and noise. BJPsych Open published these papers to meet requirements for early indications of the mental health impact of COVID-19 on the public and on healthcare staff. They claim high prevalence of symptoms of anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress. We contrast these findings with selected reports of studies with different methodologies published elsewhere. We emphasise the need for longitudinal clinical studies with refined sampling and methodological rigour. We identify several longitudinal research programmes; two in this series. We advocate tuning advice offered about caring for the public and healthcare staff to the realities of their circumstances and their perceptions of need in the context of findings from further longitudinal studies. We draw attention to the importance of the social, relationship and environmental circumstances of the public and healthcare staff in order to understand their distress and their risks of developing mental health disorders.","Williams, Kaufman","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2021.1085","20220201","COVID-19; bias; distress; healthcare workers (HCWs); mental health disorders; noise; outbreaks of infectious disease; policy; qualitative research; quantitative research; research methods; the impact of COVID-19 on staff of healthcare services; the impact of COVID-19 on the public; variants of SARS-CoV-2; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-02","",26372,""
"Rationale, design and methods of VA-BRAVE: a randomized comparative effectiveness trial of two formulations of buprenorphine for treatment of opioid use disorder in veterans","To address the US opioid epidemic, there is an urgent clinical need to provide persons with opioid use disorder (OUD) with effective medication treatments for OUD (MOUD). Formulations of sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone (SL-BUP/NLX) are considered the standard of care for OUD including within the Veterans Healthcare Administration (VHA). However, poor retention on MOUD undermines its effectiveness. Long-acting injectable monthly buprenorphine (INJ-BUP) (e.g., SublocadeÃ‚Â®) has the potential to improve retention and therefore reduce opioid use and overdose. Designing and conducting studies for OUD pose unique challenges. The strategies and solutions to some of these considerations in designing Cooperative Studies Program (CSP) 2014, Buprenorphine for Treating Opioid Use Disorder in Veterans (VA-BRAVE), a randomized, 20-site, clinical effectiveness trial comparing INJ-BUP to SL-BUP/NLX conducted within the VHA may provide valuable guidance for others confronted with similar investigation challenges. This 52-week, parallel group, open-label, randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluates the comparative effectiveness of two current FDA-approved formulations of buprenorphine: (1) daily SL-BUP/NLX vs. (2) monthly (28-day) INJ-BUP for Veterans with moderate to severe OUD (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°952). The primary outcomes are (1) retention in MOUD and (2) opioid abstinence. Secondary outcomes include measures of other drug use, psychiatric symptoms, medical outcomes including prevalence rates of HIV, hepatitis B and C as well as social outcomes (housing instability, criminal justice involvement), service utilization and cost-effectiveness. Special considerations in conducting a comparative effectiveness trial with this population and during COVID-19 pandemic were also included. The evaluation of the extended-release formulation of buprenorphine compared to the standard sublingual formulation in real-world VHA settings is of paramount importance in addressing the opioid epidemic. The extent to which this new treatment facilitates retention, decreases opioid use, and prevents severe sequelae of OUD has not been studied in any long-term trial to date. Positive findings in this trial could lead to widespread adoption of MOUD, and, if proven superior INJ-BUP, by clinicians throughout the VHA and beyond. This treatment has the potential to reduce opioid use among Veterans, improve medical, psychological, and social outcomes, and save lives at justifiable cost.

"The association between physical activity and mental health during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review","The Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic affected countries worldwide and has changed peoples' lives. A reduction in physical activity and increased mental health problems were observed, mainly in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, this systematic review aims to examine the association between physical activity and mental health during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. In July 2021, a search was applied to PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Eligibility criteria included cross-sectional, prospective, and longitudinal study designs and studies published in English; outcomes included physical activity and mental health (e.g., depressive symptoms, anxiety, positive and negative effects, well-being). Thirty-one studies were included in this review. Overall, the studies suggested that higher physical activity is associated with higher well-being, quality of life as well as lower depressive symptoms, anxiety, and stress, independently of age. There was no consensus for the optimal physical activity level for mitigating negative mental symptoms, neither for the frequency nor for the type of physical activity. Women were more vulnerable to mental health changes and men were more susceptive to physical activity changes. Physical activity has been a good and effective choice to mitigate the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Public health policies should alert for possibilities to increase physical activity during the stay-at-home order in many countries worldwide.","Marconcin, Werneck, Peralta, Ihle, Gouveia, Ferrari, Sarmento, Marques","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-12590-6","20220201","Anxiety; Exercise; Mental health; Pandemic; SARS CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-02","",26374,""
"Rare neurogenetic conditions and mental health of families during COVID-19","Background: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the wellbeing of parents and children in the general population has been well-documented. This study investigated wellbeing in parents of and children with rare neurogenetic conditions, who may have been at greater risk of negative impact on mental health and behavioural challenges during the first UK lockdown. Method: An online survey data was completed by parents of children with a rare neurogenetic condition between May and July 2020 (CoIN sample; N=123) and compared to responses from parents of children in the wider population (Co-SPACE sample; N=2121). Measures of wellbeing included the 21-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale for parents and the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire for child behaviour. Results: Parent anxiety was significantly higher in CoIN (MedianAnx = 4) than Co-SPACE (MedianAnx = 2). Parent-rated internalising, externalising and impact of child behavioural difficulties were also significantly higher in CoIN (MedianInt = 9.5; MedianExt = 11, MedianImp = 8) than Co-SPACE (MedianInt = 6; MedianExt = 7, MedianImp = 1). Only group differences in child behaviour and impact remained significant when matching for demographic factors and were also larger than previously reported pre-pandemic differences. Discussion: Families of children with rare neurogenetic conditions reported poorer wellbeing during the first lockdown compared to the wider population, affecting both parents and children. This likely reflects pre-existing complex needs, which should be prioritised during future national crises. Investigation of changes in wellbeing in this population over the course of the pandemic is warranted.","Sarah Charles et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0092-5F5-B1D","20220201","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; covid19; rare genetic condition; mental health; vulnerable population; psychology; lockdown","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-02","",26375,""
