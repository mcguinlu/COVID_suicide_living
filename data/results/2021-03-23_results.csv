"Primary care clinical management following self-harm during the first wave of COVID-19 in the UK","Background A substantial reduction in GP-recorded self-harm occurred during the first wave of COVID-19 but effects on primary care management of self-harm are unknown. Aim To examine the impact of COVID-19 on clinical management within three months of an episode of self-harm. Design and setting Prospective cohort study using data from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink. Method We compared cohorts of patients with an index self-harm episode recorded during a pre-pandemic period (10th March-10th June, 2010-2019) versus the COVID-19 first-wave period (10th March-10th June 2020). Patients were followed up for three months to capture psychotropic medication prescribing, GP/practice nurse consultation and referral to mental health services. Results 48,739 episodes of self-harm were recorded during the pre-pandemic period and 4,238 during the first-wave COVID-19 period. Similar proportions were prescribed psychotropic medication within 3 months in the pre-pandemic (54.0%) and COVID-19 first-wave (54.9%) cohorts. Likelihood of having at least one GP/practice nurse consultation was broadly similar (83.2% vs. 80.3% in the COVID-19 cohort). The proportion of patients referred to mental health services in the COVID-19 cohort (3.4%) was around half of that in the pre-pandemic cohort (6.5%). Conclusion Despite the challenges experienced by primary healthcare teams during the initial COVID-19 wave, prescribing and consultation patterns following self-harm were broadly similar to pre-pandemic levels. However, the reduced likelihood of referral to mental health services warrants attention. Accessible outpatient and community services for people who have self-harmed are required as the COVID-19 crisis recedes and the population faces new challenges to mental health.","Sarah Steeg; Matthew J Carr; Laszlo Trefan; Darren M Ashcroft; Nav Kapur; Emma Nielsen; Brian McMillan; Roger Webb","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.19.21253969","20210322","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-23","",12255,""
"Emotional responses toward COVID-19: A longitudinal assessment of age differences","The current study investigates the relation between age and emotional responses and coping strategies at two moments during the spread of COVID-19 in Poland, namely the first peak (March-May 2020) and the second pick (October-December 2020). A sample of 414 individuals between the ages of 18 and 81 were asked to rate the intensity of the shock, sadness, anger, and fear they experienced due to COVID-19 and respond to items from the Brief Cope questionnaire. The present findings demonstrate that anger was consistently less intense among older adults than younger ones. Emotion-focused coping strategies were more commonly used by younger adults than middle-aged or older ones at the first peak of the outbreak; however, this trend had reversed during the second peak of the pandemic, as the older age groups demonstrated a far greater increase in the use of this form of coping. Results indicate a greater ability to use emotional regulation among older adults than younger ones, as the former are less likely to react to a crisis through anger and more able to adapt coping mechanisms to a dynamic environment.","Marta Malesza","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.21.21254050","20210322","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-23","",12256,""
"Psychosocial impact of the Covid-19 pandemic: Identification of most vulnerable populations","With the aim of analyzing the psychosocial impact of Covid-19 pandemic on society in general and health care workers in particular, we developed a 74-question survey questionnaire which was shared through social media. After analyzing 56,656 responses obtained during the first pandemic peak, the results showed an early and important negative impact on family finances, fear of working with Covid-19 patients and ethical issues related to Covid-19 care among healthcare workers (HCW). We have identified 7 target groups at higher risk of impaired mental health and susceptible to benefiting from an intervention: women, under 42 years of age, people with care burden, socio-economically deprived groups, people with unskilled or unqualified jobs, Covid-19 patients, and HCW working with Covid-19 patients. These results should encourage the active implementation of specific strategies to increase resilience in these groups and to prepare an adequate organizational response.","Judith Farres; Jose Luis Ruiz; Jose Manuel Mas; Lilibeth Arias; Maria-Rosa Sarrias; Carolina Armengol; Pere-Joan Cardona; Jose A Munoz-Moreno; Miriam Vilaplana; Belen Arranz; Judith Usall; Antoni Serrano-Blanco; Cristina Vilaplana","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.20.21254029","20210322","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-23","",12257,""
"US adolescents' mental health and COVID-19-related changes in technology use, Fall 2020","Preliminary reports suggest that during COVID-19, adolescents mental health has worsened while technology and social media use has increased. Much data derives from early in the pandemic, when schools were uniformly remote and personal/family stressors related to the pandemic were limited. This cross-sectional study, conducted during Fall 2020, examines the correlation between mental wellbeing and COVID-19-related changes in technology use, along with influence of COVID-19-related stressors, school status (in-person versus remote), and social media use for coping purposes, among 978 U.S. adolescents. Results suggest self-reported daily social media and technology use increased significantly from prior to COVID-19 through Fall 2020. Increased social media use was significantly associated with higher levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms regardless of other theoretical moderators or confounders of mental health (e.g., demographics, school status, importance of technology, COVID-19-related stress). Despite literature suggesting that remote learning may result in adverse mental health outcomes, we did not find local school reopening to be associated with current depressive/anxiety symptoms, nor with COVID-19-related increases in technology use. Self-reported use of social media for coping purposes moderated the association between increased social media use and mental health symptoms; in other words, some social media use may have positive effects. Although much prior research has focused on social media use as a marker of stress, we also found that increased video gaming and TV/movie watching were also associated with internalizing symptoms, in accordance with others' work. Future research should explore in more granular detail what, if any, social media and technology use is protective during a pandemic, and for whom, to help tailor prevention efforts.","Taylor A Burke; Emily R Kutok; Shira Dunsiger; Nicole R Nugent; John V Patena; Alison Riese; Megan L Ranney","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.15.21253598","20210317","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-23","",12258,""

"Temporal Dynamics of Public Emotions During the COVID-19 Pandemic at the Epicenter of the Outbreak: Sentiment Analysis of Weibo Posts From Wuhan","BACKGROUND: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increase in anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and psychological stress experienced by the general public in various degrees worldwide. However, effective, tailored mental health services and interventions cannot be achieved until we understand the patterns of mental health issues emerging after a public health crisis, especially in the context of the rapid transmission of COVID-19. Understanding the public's emotions and needs and their distribution attributes are therefore critical for creating appropriate public policies and eventually responding to the health crisis effectively, efficiently, and equitably. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to detect the temporal patterns in emotional fluctuation, significant events during the COVID-19 pandemic that affected emotional changes and variations, and hourly variations of emotions within a single day by analyzing data from the Chinese social media platform Weibo. METHODS: Based on a longitudinal dataset of 816,556 posts published by 27,912 Weibo users in Wuhan, China, from December 31, 2019, to April 31, 2020, we processed general sentiment inclination rating and the type of sentiments of Weibo posts by using pandas and SnowNLP Python libraries. We also grouped the publication times into 5 time groups to measure changes in netizens' sentiments during different periods in a single day. RESULTS: Overall, negative emotions such as surprise, fear, and anger were the most salient emotions detected on Weibo. These emotions were triggered by certain milestone events such as the confirmation of human-to-human transmission of COVID-19. Emotions varied within a day. Although all emotions were more prevalent in the afternoon and night, fear and anger were more dominant in the morning and afternoon, whereas depression was more salient during the night. CONCLUSIONS: Various milestone events during the COVID-19 pandemic were the primary events that ignited netizens' emotions. In addition, Weibo users' emotions varied within a day. Our findings provide insights into providing better-tailored mental health services and interventions.","Yu, Shaobin; Eisenman, David; Han, Ziqiang","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/27078","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;23(3): e27078, 2021 Mar 18.; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;23(3): e27078, 2021 Mar 18.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-23","",12278,""

"Factors Associated With Psychiatric Adverse Effects in Healthcare Personnel During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Ecuador; Factores relacionados con efectos adversos psiquiÃ¡tricos en personal de salud durante la pandemia de COVID-19 en Ecuador","INTRODUCTION: Since the emergence of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the world has faced a pandemic with consequences at all levels. In many countries, the health systems collapsed and healthcare professionals had to be on the front line of this crisis. The adverse effects on the mental health of healthcare professionals have been widely reported. This research focuses on identifying the main factors associated with adverse psychological outcomes. METHODS: Descriptive, cross-sectional study based on surveys, applying the PHQ-9, GAD-7, ISI and EIE-R tests to healthcare professionals from Ecuador during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: 1,028 participants, distributed in: 557 physicians (54.18%), 349 nurses (33.94%), 29 laboratory workers (2.82%), 27 paramedics (2.62%), 52 psychologists (5.05%) and 14 respiratory therapists (1.36%), from 16 of the 24 provinces of Ecuador. Of these, 27.3% presented symptoms of depression, 39.2% anxiety symptoms, 16.3% insomnia and 43.8% symptoms of PTSD, with the 4 types of symptoms ranging from moderate to severe. The most relevant associated factors were: working in Guayas (the most affected province) (OR = 2.18 for depressive symptoms and OR = 2.59 for PTSD symptoms); being a postgraduate doctor (OR = 1.52 for depressive symptoms and OR = 1.57 for insomnia), perception of not having the proper protective equipment (OR = 1.71 for symptoms of depression and OR = 1.57 for symptoms of anxiety) and being a woman (OR = 1.39 for anxiety). CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare professionals can suffer a significant mental condition that may require psychiatric and psychological intervention. The main associated factors are primarily related to living and working in cities with a higher number of cases and the characteristics of the job, such as being a postgraduate doctor, as well as the perception of security. The main risk factors are primarily related to geographical distribution and job characteristics, such as being a resident physician and self-perception of safety. Further studies are required as the pandemic evolves.","PazmiÃ±o Erazo, Edgar EfraÃ­n; Alvear VelÃ¡squez, MarÃ­a JosÃ©; Saltos ChÃ¡vez, Ivonne Gisselle; PazmiÃ±o Pullas, David Emanuel","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rcp.2020.12.007","","Country: CO; COLÃ”MBIA; COLOMBIA; COLOMBIA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Rev Colomb Psiquiatr;2021 Feb 20.; Publication details: Rev Colomb Psiquiatr;2021 Feb 20.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-23","",12280,""
"Proposal for a Model of Suicidal Ideation in Medical Students in Colombia: A Simulation Study; Propuesta de un modelo de la ideaciÃ³n suicida en estudiantes de Medicina en Colombia: un estudio de simulaciÃ³n","Suicidal behaviour is a global public health problem, and one population group with high prevalence rates is medical students, especially in the ideation component. Various models have tried to explain it, but there are few inferential studies in the Colombian population. The structural equation models used in controlled social sciences to explain this problem and their analytical power allow generalisations to be made with a certain degree of precision. These analyses require a large amount of data for robust estimation, which limits their usability when there are restrictions to access the data, as is the case today due to Covid-19, and a question that stands out in these models is the evaluation of the fit. Through a set of 1,200 simulated data, an appropriate model fit was found (x5242=1.732,300;p<0,001, CFI = 0.97, GFI = 0.97, TLI = 0.97, RMSEA = 0.04[0.042-0.046], SRMR = 0.06) for the predictors of depression and perceived burdensomeness, which were analysed using the JASP program. The role of thwarted belongingness is discussed, as well as the appropriateness of the assessment instrument used to evaluate it an considerations regarding suicidal ideation monitoring, evaluation and intervention in medical students.","Castro-Osorio, Rubby; Maldonado-AvendaÃ±o, Natalia; Cardona-GÃ³mez, Pilar","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rcp.2020.09.001","","Country: CO; COLÃ”MBIA; COLOMBIA; COLOMBIA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Rev Colomb Psiquiatr;2020 Nov 09.; Publication details: Rev Colomb Psiquiatr;2020 Nov 09.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-23","",12281,""

Treating psychiatric patients with COVID-19 poses multiple challenges in the inpatient psychiatric setting in terms of mitigating transmission of the virus. Gracie Square Hospital, a freestanding psychiatric hospital located in New York City, dedicated a unit for treating COVID-19 patients requiring inpatient psychiatric treatment. We faced different challenges including treatment refusal, difficulty complying with safety precautions due to psychosis, agitated behavior, and staff psychological well-being. We considered reformation of protocols, expansion of the use of technology, development of a supportive platform, and standardization of clinical practice.

"Promoting Children's Mental, Emotional, and Behavioral (MEB) Health in All Public Systems, Post-COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbates the mental, emotional, and behavioral (MEB) health problems of children and adolescents in the United States (U.S.). A collective and coordinated national economic and social reconstruction effort aimed at shoring up services to promote children's MEB, like the Marshall Plan that helped rebuild Europe post-World War II, has been proposed to buttress against the expected retrenchment. The plan prioritizes children's well-being as a social objective. We propose strategically reconstructing the public safety-net systems serving youth, including early education, maternal and child health, child welfare, corrections, and mental health. That plan called for a concentrated focus on coalition-building and contracting by state mental health systems to establish a foundation for an improved health system. This paper offers a complementary set of suggestions for the four non-mental health systems mentioned above by recommending actionable steps based on scientific evidence to support improved services for children at risk for MEB problems. For each system we describe examples of evidence-informed services, policies or programs that (1) prevent disabilities and promote health, (2) protect and preserve families and neighborhoods, and (3) provide quality care. Prioritizing the promotion of children's MEB health by all state systems can shape U.S. children's health and well-being for generations to come.","Hoagwood, Gardner, Kelleher","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10488-021-01125-7","20210322","Child welfare system; Corrections; Early childhood education Mental Health; Incarceration; Maternal and child health; Policymaking; Public health; United States","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-23","",12284,""
"SARS-CoV-2 infection represents a high risk for the elderly: analysis of pathogenesis","As people get older, age-related alterations occur that lead to increased susceptibility to disease. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, older people are particularly susceptible to a SARS-CoV-2 infection developing into severe disease. The objective of this review was to examine the literature regarding factors that may explain the tendency of this population to develop severe COVID-19. Research articles considered in this review were searched for in EMBASE, PubMed, and Web of Science from December 2019 to December 2020. Citations were screened by two independent reviewers. Studies of the immune system in older individuals found alterations in both the adaptive and innate immune systems. The adaptive system is depressed in its functions, and the innate system is in a pro-inflammatory state that can lead to chronic disease. This pro-inflammatory state may be related to a severe course of disease in COVID-19. This review shows that the level of evidence supporting an association between immune alterations in the elderly and susceptibly to severe progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection is generally consistent. Preventive measures such as early antiviral treatment are of key importance for prevention of severe progression of COVID19.","PedreaÃƒÂ±ez, Mosquera-Sulbaran, MuÃƒÂ±oz","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-021-05042-w","20210322","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-23","",12285,""
"The impact of COVID-19 on mental health outcomes among hospital fever clinic attendants across Nepal: A cross-sectional study","The COVID-19 pandemic has been creating a panic and distressing situations among the entire population globally including Nepal. No study has been conducted assessing the psychological impact of this pandemic on the general public in Nepal. The objective of this study is to assess the mental health status during COVID-19 outbreak and explore the potential influencing factors among the population attending the hospital fever clinics with COVID-19 symptoms. A cross-sectional survey was conducted between May-June, 2020 with a sample of 645 participants aged 18 and above in 26 hospitals across Nepal. Telephone interviews were conducted using a semi-structured questionnaire along with a validated psychometric tool, the Depression, Anxiety and Stress (DASS-21) scale. The metrics and scores of symptoms and their severity were created and analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the association of potential covariates with outcome variables. The prevalence of anxiety, depression and stress were 14%, 7% and 5% respectively. In reference to Karnali, participants from Bagmati province reported higher level of anxiety (OR 3.44, 95% CI 1.31-9.06), while stress (OR 4.27, 95% CI 1.09-18.32) and depressive symptoms (OR 3.11, 95% CI 1.05-9.23) observed higher among the participants in Province 1. Women were more at risk of anxiety (OR 3.41, 95% CI 1.83-6.36) than men. Similarly, people currently living in rented houses reported more stress (OR 2.97, 95% CI 1.05-8.43) and those living far from family reported higher rates of depressive symptoms (OR 3.44, 95% CI 1.03-11.46). The study identified increased prevalence of stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms during the initial stage of COVID-19 pandemic in Nepal. Considering the findings, there is urgent need to develop and implement appropriate community-based mental health programs targeting individuals who have had COVID-19 symptoms and who are prone to develop adverse mental health outcomes.","Devkota, Sijali, Bogati, Ahmad, Shakya, Adhikary","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0248684","20210322","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-23","",12286,""
"COVID-19 Pandemic: Gender difference in satisfaction with a daily supportive text message program (Text4Hope) and anticipated receptivity for technology-based health support during emergencies-Cross Sectional Survey","During the unprecedented time of the COVID-19 pandemic, the need to support mental wellbeing is urgent. In March 2020, Text4Hope was provided as a community health service to Alberta residents. This free service aims to promote psychological resilience and alleviate pandemic-associated stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms. This study aimed to evaluate the feedback, satisfaction, experience, and perceptions of Text4Hope subscribers, and to examine any differences based on gender after receiving six weeks of daily supportive text messages. Additionally, the study examined anticipated receptivity for technology-based medical services that could be offered during major crises, emergencies, or pandemics, such as COVID-19. Individuals self-subscribed to Text4Hope to receive daily supportive text messages for three months. Subscribers were invited to complete an online survey at six weeks to collect service satisfaction related information. Overall satisfaction was assessed on a scale from 0 to 10, using a related-measures t-test; and Likert scale satisfaction responses were used to assess various aspects of the Text4Hope program. Gender differences were analyzed using One-Way ANOVA and Chi-Square analysis. The total number of subscribers who completed baseline and six-week survey were 2032, 1788 (88.0%) were female, 219 (10.8%) were male, and 25 (1.2%) were other gender. The mean age of study participants was 44.58 (SD=13.45) The mean overall satisfaction score was 8.55/10 (SD=1.78) suggesting that overall, respondents' satisfaction with the Text4Hope program was high. ANOVA analysis, using the Welch test (n=1,716) demonstrated that females had significantly higher mean satisfaction scores, compared to males; 8.65 vs. 8.11, respectively (Mean Difference=0.546, 95% CI=0.19-0.91, P&lt;.001), but not to &quot;Other&quot; gender (Mean Difference= -0.938, 95% CI= -0.37-2.25, P&gt;.05). More than 70% of subscribers agreed that Text4Hope helped them to cope with stress and anxiety, feel connected to a support system, manage COVID-19 related issues, and improve mental wellbeing. Similarly, subscribers agreed that messages were positive, affirmative, and succinct. Messages were read by 97.9% of respondents always or often and more than 20% returned to messages always or often. The majority of subscribers (89.3%) read the messages and either reflected upon them or took a positive action. Subscribers welcomed almost all technology-based services as part of their health care during crisis or emergency situations (70%). Text4Hope was perceived to be more effective by subscribers identifying as female, who reported higher satisfaction and improved coping after receiving messages for 6 weeks. Respondents affirmed the high quality of the messages with their positive feedback. Technology-based services can provide remotely accessible and population-level interventions that align with recommended distancing practices during pandemics. Text4Hope subscriber feedback revealed high satisfaction and acceptance rates after six weeks of receiving daily messages.

"Brief videoconferencing psychological intervention for reducing COVID-19 related distress: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial","Globally COVID-19 has had a profound impact on the psychological wellbeing of millions of people, and there is an urgent imperative to address elevated levels of distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed Problem Management Plus (PM+), a low intensity psychological intervention for adults experiencing psychological distress. This paper outlines the study protocol for a trial that tests the effectiveness of an adapted version of PM+ to reduce distress associated with COVID-19. A single-blind, parallel, randomized controlled trial will be carried out for distressed people across Australia. via video conferencing on a small group basis. Following informed consent, adults that screen positive for levels of psychological distress (General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12 scoreÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°3) and have access to videoconferencing platform will be randomised to an adapted version of gPM+ (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°120) or enhanced treatment as usual (ETAU) (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°120). The primary outcome will be reduction in psychological distress including anxiety and depression at 2-months post treatment. Secondary outcomes include worry, sleep problems, anhedonia, social support, and stress in relation to COVID-19.

"'Now my life is stuck!': Experiences of adolescents and young people during COVID-19 lockdown in South Africa","Consequences of COVID-19 pandemic responses have included exacerbated poverty, food insecurity and state and domestic violence. Such effects may be particularly pronounced amongst adolescents and young people living in contexts of precarity and constraint, including in South Africa. However, there are evidence gaps on the lived experiences of this group. We conducted telephonic semi-structured interviews with adolescents and young people in two South African provinces (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°12, ages 18-25) in April 2020 to explore and document their experiences, challenges and coping strategies during strict COVID-19 lockdown. Participants described indirect effects of COVID-19 including food insecurity, lost livelihoods and changes to social service provisions such as municipal electricity services and sanitation. Psychosocial stressors related to uncertainty over education and work futures were also discussed. The aforementioned challenges were particularly present with young parents, 'working poor' participants, and those with pre-existing mental health challenges. Participants demonstrated excellent COVID-19 transmission and prevention knowledge, showing that they had received and correctly interpreted public health messaging. Despite this, many simultaneously held non-scientific COVID-19 beliefs. Engaging a socio ecological framework, findings demonstrate how the indirect effects of COVID-19 may exacerbate underlying multi-layered vulnerabilities for adolescents and young people living in contexts of precarity and constraint.","Gittings, Toska, Medley, Cluver, Logie, Ralayo, Chen, Mbithi-Dikgole","https://doi.org/10.1080/17441692.2021.1899262","20210322","Adolescence; COVID-19; South Africa; young people","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-23","",12289,""

"Disruptions in the management and care of university students with preexisting mental health conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic","Students with preexisting mental health conditions or disabilities may fair worse due to virus mitigation strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study was conducted to understand the experiences of students with preexisting mental health conditions or disabilities at a public university during COVID-19. We examined disruptions in the management of preexisting mental health conditions or disabilities and its impact on psychological well-being. Students were surveyed about their health care experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic between June and September 2020. Linear regressions and mediation analyses were conducted to examine the relationships between disruption to care, mental health self-efficacy, and four psychological well-being outcomes (stress, anxiety, depression, and overall distress). Of the total (N = 1,082) study participants, 258 (24%) reported having a preexisting mental health condition(s) or disabilities (81% female; Mage = 23.47). Of those, 155 (61%) reported that COVID-19 disrupted health care delivery and management of their conditions or disabilities. Of those who reported this disruption, 51% (n = 109) of participants reported a disruption in their ability to see a health care professional and 58% (n = 69) reported either that they lost care or that the quality of the new telemedicine care was not sufficient. A series of linear regressions revealed significant relationships between disruption to care and the four psychological outcomes. Mediation analyses revealed that depression, stress, anxiety, and overall distress were mediated by self-efficacy in managing mental health.

"Prevalence of Internet-based addictive behaviors during COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review","With the outbreak of the COVID-19 worldwide pandemic, many countries have imposed lockdowns which have caused an increase in Internet use. As large-scale disasters may have an impact on addictions, a review on Internet-based addictive behaviors seems necessary. The goals of this review are to find whether Internet-based addictive behaviors have increased during the pandemic and to define the main reasons for this increase. The systematic search was conducted in Google Scholar, Science Direct, PsycINFO, and PubMed in October of 2020, to determine the current evidence and observations concerning the Internet-based addictive behaviors amid COVID-19. Studies were included if they considered the Internet-based addictive behaviors during the current pandemic. We used all the names of the coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2 previously 2019 nCoV), the name of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and common Internet-based addictive behaviors, namely Internet addiction, online gaming disorder, online gambling disorder, pornography use, and smartphone use disorder. The study design is PEOs, finding if individuals' exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic has caused an increase in Internet-based addictive behaviors. The quality of the studies was assessed independently by two authors using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. The articles found in this review proved an increase in Internet-based addictive behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic mostly due to financial hardships, isolation, problematic substance use, and mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and stress.

Two mental health measures (depression and anxiety) were regressed on social network variables relevant to the Covid-19 crisis (frequency of face-to-face contact and frequency of contact through electronic means), controlling for confounders. Interactions of age group and social networks were considered. Baseline mental health was controlled, focusing the analysis on post-outbreak mental health change. Face-to-face network contact significantly reduced negative mental health changes while electronic contact significantly increased them. The age interactions were insignificant.

"Psychological impact of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on nurses","The new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has laid unprecedented stress on healthcare workers and especially nurses. The main objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression and sleep disturbance among nurses in Oman during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to explore the contributing factors. A cross-sectional and descriptive correlational design using QualtricsÃ‚Â® software was performed. Data were collected using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Perceived Stress Scale. Of the 1,130 nurses who participated, 75.6% (n = 854) reported stress, 44.2% (n = 499) reported anxiety, 38.5% (n = 435) reported depression and 73.7% (n = 833) reported poor sleep. Stress, anxiety, depression and sleep disturbance (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05) were significantly associated with age, marital status, comorbidity and whether family members or relatives were suspected or confirmed with COVID-19. The stress, anxiety, depression and sleep disturbance were significantly positively corelated with each other. Logistic regression showed nurses in the age group between 18 and 30, who worked at the frontline, were at a higher risk of stress, anxiety, depression and sleep disturbance. Stress, anxiety, depression and sleep disturbance are significant problems for nurses working in Oman during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"The Impact of Lockdown During the COVID-19 Outbreak on Dietary Habits in Various Population Groups: A Scoping Review","<b>Background:</b> Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, access to fresh food has been restricted, and people are spending more time inside and have limited their physical activity. However, more time at home may have resulted in some positive habits including an increase in cooking. The aim of this review was to assess dietary changes during the first lockdown. Themes and patterns were considered and associations with other lifestyle factors were assessed. <b>Methods:</b> Between June and July 2020, the PubMed, Google Scholar, and Science Direct databases were searched, and results were screened for eligibility based on title, abstract, and full text. The inclusion criteria of this search included: papers published (or in pre-print) in the year 2020; studies that investigated the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on diet; papers published in English. Exclusion criteria were as follows: papers examining dietary changes in those following a structured diet based on diagnosed conditions or dietetic advice; literature, systematic, or narrative studies reviewing previous research. Researchers agreed on the study characteristics for extraction from final papers. <b>Results:</b> Four thousand three hundred and twenty-two studies were originally considered with 23 final full-text papers included. Four themes were identified: dietary patterns, dietary habits (favorable), dietary habits (unfavorable), and other (includes physical activity levels, weight gain). A total of 10 studies reported an increase in the number of snacks consumed, while six studies found that participants increased their meal number and frequency during quarantine. Eleven studies reported favorable changes in dietary habits with an increase in fresh produce and home cooking and reductions in comfort food and alcohol consumption. However, nine studies found a reduction in fresh produce, with a further six reporting an increase in comfort foods including sweets, fried food, snack foods, and processed foods. Two studies reported an increase in alcohol consumption. In eight studies participants reported weight gain with seven studies reporting a reduction in physical exercise. <b>Conclusion:</b> The effect of COVID-19 lockdown both negatively and positively impacted dietary practices throughout Europe and globally, and negative diet habits were associated with other poor lifestyle outcomes including weight gain, mental health issues, and limited physical activity. Both in the short term and if sustained in the long term, these changes may have significant impacts on the health of the population.","Bennett, Young, Butler, Coe","https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2021.626432","20210322","COVID-19; LockDown; diet; fruit and vegetables; lifestyle","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-23","",12295,""
"Depressive and Anxiety Symptoms of Healthcare Workers in Intensive Care Unit Under the COVID-19 Epidemic: An Online Cross-Sectional Study in China","<b>Background:</b> Since the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, intensive care unit (ICU) healthcare workers were responsible for the critical infected patients. However, few studies focused on the mental health of ICU healthcare workers. This study aimed to investigate the psychological impact of COVID-19 on ICU healthcare workers in China. <b>Methods:</b> We distributed the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and seven-item General Anxiety Disorder questionnaire (GAD-7) online to ICU healthcare workers in China. Respondents were divided into frontline and second-line according to whether they have contact with COVID-19 patients. Depressive and anxiety symptoms of all respondents were evaluated based on their questionnaire scores. <b>Results:</b> There were 731 ICU healthcare workers finally enrolled in our study, including 303 (41.5%) male, 383 (52.4%) doctors, and 617 (84.4%) aged 26-45 years. All in all, 482 (65.9%) ICU healthcare workers reported symptoms of depression, while 429 (58.7%) reported anxiety. There was no significant difference between frontline (<i>n</i> = 325) and second-line (<i>n</i> = 406) respondents in depression (<i>P</i> = 0.15) and anxiety severity (<i>P</i> = 0.56). Logistic regression analysis showed that being female, ICU work time &gt;5 years, and night duty number Ã¢â€°Â¥10 were risk factors of developing depressive and anxiety symptoms. Income reduction was separately identified as risk of anxiety. Additionally, ICU work time &gt;5 years was also identified as risk of developing moderate-severe depressive and anxiety symptoms. <b>Conclusions:</b> Frontline ICU work was not associated with higher risk of depressive and anxiety symptoms during COVID-19 pandemic remission period in China. Actions like controlling night duty number, ensuring vacation, and increasing income should be taken to relieve mental health problem. Furthermore, we should pay close attention to those who had worked long years in ICU.","Peng, Meng, Li, Hu, Liu, Liu, Ma, Xu, Xing, Zhu, Liu, Zhang, Peng","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.603273","20210322","COVID-19; ICU; anxiety; depression; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-23","",12296,""
"&quot;Celebrating old age&quot;: an obsolete expression during the COVID-19 pandemic? Medical, social, psychological, and religious consequences of home isolation and loneliness among the elderly","Since epidemiological arguments favouring self-isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic are widely recommended, the consequences of social isolation/loneliness of older people considered to be at higher risk for severe illness are neglected. We identified and described medical, social, psychological, and religious issues, indirectly generated by the COVID-19 lockdown. Mortality induced by SARS-CoV-2 and death from other &quot;neglected&quot; issues were put in balance. Arguments for strict lockdown from most European countries are compared with a relaxed approach, as has been applied in Sweden. Social isolation affects disproportionally the elderly, transforming it into a public health concern. One witnesses openly ageist discourse, while painful decisions to prioritising ventilation for younger patients deepens the sense of hopelessness. Fear has led to anxiety disorders and depression. Various religious practices provide resources for coping with isolation/overcoming loneliness. Higher levels of mortality/morbidity due to &quot;COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19&quot; polarisation oblige the healthcare community to find ways to provide proper care for its elders.","Burlacu, Mavrichi, Crisan-Dabija, Jugrin, Buju, Artene, Covic","https://doi.org/10.5114/aoms.2020.95955","20210322","COVID-19; geriatric patients; loneliness; older people; social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-23","",12297,""
"Mood Responses and Regulation Strategies Used During COVID-19 Among Boxers and Coaches","The COVID-19 pandemic brought unprecedented changes to daily life and in the first wave in the UK, it led to a societal shutdown including playing sport and concern was placed for the mental health of athletes. Identifying mood states experienced in lockdown and self-regulating strategies is useful for the development of interventions to help mood management. Whilst this can be done on a general level, examination of sport-specific effects and the experience of athletes and coaches can help develop interventions grounded in real world experiences. The present study investigated perceived differences in mood states of boxers before and during COVID-19 isolation in the first lockdown among boxers. Boxing is an individual and high-contact sport where training tends to form a key aspect of their identity. Boxers develop close relationships with their coach and boxing. Hence boxers were vulnerable to experiencing negative mood, and support via the coach was potentially unavailable. Participants were 58 experienced participants (44 boxers, male <i>n</i> = 33, female <i>n</i> = 11; 14 boxing coaches, male <i>n</i> = 11, female <i>n</i> = 3). Boxers completed the Brunel Mood Scale to assess mood before COVID-19 using a retrospective approach and during COVID-19 using a &quot;right now&quot; time frame. Boxers responded to open-ended questions to capture mood regulation strategies used. Coaches responded to open ended questions to capture how they helped regulate boxer's mood. MANOVA results indicated a large significant increase in the intensity of unpleasant moods (anger, confusion, depression, fatigue, and tension) and reduction in vigor during COVID-19 (<i>d</i> = 0.93). Using Lane and Terry (2000) conceptual framework, results showed participants reporting depressed mood also reported an extremely negative mood profile as hypothesized. Qualitative data indicated that effective mood-regulation strategies used included maintaining close coach-athlete contact and helping create a sense of making progress in training. When seen collectively, findings illustrate that mood state responses to COVID-19 were severe. It is suggested that that active self-regulation and self-care should be a feature of training programmes to aid coaches and boxers in regulating mood when faced with severe situational changes.","Roberts, Lane","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.624119","20210322","COVID-19; coach-athlete relationship; emotional intelligence; mental toughness; mood regulation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-23","",12298,""
"Burnout and Its Relationship With Depressive Symptoms in Medical Staff During the COVID-19 Epidemic in China","The large-scale epidemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has triggered unprecedented physical and psychological stress on health professionals. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and risk factors of burnout syndrome, and the relationship between burnout and depressive symptoms among frontline medical staff during the COVID-19 epidemic in China. A total of 606 frontline medical staff were recruited from 133 cities in China using a cross-sectional survey. The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) was used to assess the level of burnout. Depressive symptoms were assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire Depression (PHQ-9). During the COVID-19 pandemic, 36.5% of the medical staff experienced burnout. Personal and work-related factors were independently associated with burnout, including age (OR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.52-0.89, <i>p</i> = 0.004), family income (OR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.53-0.99, <i>p</i> = 0.045), having physical diseases (OR = 2.16, 95% CI: 1.42-3.28, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), daily working hours (OR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.03-1.77, <i>p</i> = 0.033), and profession of nurse (OR = 2.14, 95% CI: 1.12-4.10, <i>p</i> = 0.022). The correlation coefficients between the scores of each burnout subscale and the scores of depressive symptoms were 0.57 for emotional exhaustion, 0.37 for cynicism, and -0.41 for professional efficacy (all <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Our findings suggest that the prevalence rate of burnout is extremely high among medical staff during the COVID-19 pandemic, which is associated with other psychological disorders, such as depression. Psychological intervention for medical staff is urgently needed. Young and less experienced medical staff, especially nurses, should receive more attention when providing psychological assistance.","Huo, Zhou, Li, Ning, Zeng, Liu, Qian, Yang, Zhou, Liu, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.616369","20210322","COVID-19; burnout; depression; medical staff; prevalence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-23","",12299,""
"Sporting Resilience During COVID-19: What Is the Nature of This Adversity and How Are Competitive Elite Athletes Adapting?","The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health issue which has severely disrupted and deferred several landmark international sporting competitions. Like the general population, athletes have faced direct psychological consequences from COVID-19 in addition to cancelation of events, loss of support, lack of training, loss of earnings, hypervigilance, and anxiety among others. The aim of the present research was to identify the adversity experiences of athletes caused by COVID-19 (study 1) and explore the process of resilience used by competitive elite athletes for positive adaptation (study 2). Research has indicated psychological resilience to be a protective factor against similar adversities in the sporting context. The study uses an across-cases qualitative design comparing the real-time lived experiences of athletes during COVID-19 using narrative analysis. Data were collected from 10 competitive elite athletes from various countries, as part of a larger doctoral dissertation study during the lockdown period, using in-depth experiential interviews. Study 1 presents detailed narratives on the loss and incongruence, which were the two major adversities experienced. Study 2 outlines the process of resilience as narrated by the participants through the emergent and minimal-impact resilience trajectories. We discuss recommendations for interventions and the role of sports psychologists, coaches, and sporting organizations in ensuring athletes' mental health and their rehabilitation into post-COVID sports life.","Gupta, McCarthy","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.611261","20210322","COVID-19; adaptation; adversity; elite sport; positive psychology; sporting resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-23","",12300,""
"Emotional Creativity Improves Posttraumatic Growth and Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Emotional creativity refers to a set of cognitive abilities and personality traits related to the originality of emotional experience and expression. Previous studies have found that emotional creativity can positively predict posttraumatic growth and mental health. The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has posed great challenges to people's daily lives and their mental health status. Therefore, this study aims to address the following two questions: whether emotional creativity can improve posttraumatic growth and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic and how it works. To do this, a multiple mediation model has been proposed, which supposes that emotional creativity is associated with posttraumatic growth and mental health through perceived social support and regulatory emotional self-efficacy. The study involved 423 participants from multiple regions with different COVID-19 involvement levels. Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire with six parts, which included Emotional Creativity Inventory (ECI), Regulatory Emotional Self-Efficacy Scale (RES), Stress-Related Growth Scale-Short Form (SRGS-SF), Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support scale (MSPSS), Brief Symptom Inventory-18 scale (BSI-18), and COVID-19-related life events questionnaire. Path analysis used to examine the mediation model indicated that under the control of COVID-19-related life events and age, perceived social support mediated a positive association between emotional creativity and posttraumatic growth as well as a negative association between emotional creativity and all mental health problems, including somatization, depression, and anxiety. Regulatory emotional self-efficacy mediates the association between emotional creativity and posttraumatic growth, emotional creativity and anxiety, and emotional creativity and depression. The results suggest that emotional creativity plays an important role in coping with stressful events related to COVID-19. Furthermore, these results might provide a better understanding of the possible paths through which emotional creativity is related to psychological outcomes, such as mental health and posttraumatic growth.","Zhai, Li, Hu, Cui, Wei, Zhou","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.600798","20210322","COVID-19 crisis; emotional creativity; mental health; perceived social support; post-traumatic growth; regulatory emotional self-efficacy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-23","",12301,""

"Psychological Profiles of Chinese Patients With Hemodialysis During the Panic of Coronavirus Disease 2019","<b>Background:</b> Hemodialysis patients not only suffer from somatic disorders but are also at high risks of psychiatric problems. Early this year, the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused great panic and anxiety worldwide. The impact of this acute public health event on the psychological status of hemodialysis patients and its relationship with their quality of life have not been fully investigated. <b>Methods:</b> This study comprised two parts. The initial study enrolled maintenance hemodialysis patients treated in Ruijin Hospital for more than 3 months from March to May 2020 during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Patients completed three questionnaires including the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R), General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28), and Kidney Disease Quality of Life (KDQOL) Short Form (SF). Follow-up study was performed from December 2020 to January 2021, when the pandemic of COVID-19 has been effectively contained in China. Only patients enrolled in the initial study were approached to participate in the follow-up study. <b>Results:</b> There were 273 maintenance dialysis patients enrolled in the initial study and 247 finished the follow-up study. For the initial study, the estimated prevalence of nonspecific psychiatric morbidity was 45.8% (125/273) by GHQ-28. By IES-R, 53/273 (19.4%) patients presented with total scores above 24 that reflected clinical concerns. We found a significant difference regarding KDQOL scores between patients with different stress response (IES-R) groups (<i>p</i> = 0.026). Our follow-up study showed that KDQOL and SF-36 scores were significantly improved in comparison with those in the initial study (<i>p</i> = 0.006 and <i>p</i> = 0.031, respectively). Though total scores of GHQ-28 and IES-R did not change significantly, some subscales improved with statistical significance. Furthermore, gender, education background, and duration of hemodialysis were three factors that may affect patients' mental health, quality of life, or health status while dialysis duration was the only variable that correlated with those parameters. However, these correlations were combined effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the dialysis itself. <b>Conclusions:</b> We found a correlation between changes in the mental health status of dialysis patients and changes in their quality of life. These responses were also mediated by patients' psychosocial parameters. Our results urge the necessity of psychotherapeutic interventions for some patients during this event.","Yang, Pan, Chen, Wang, Chen, Zhu, Zhu, Chen, Chen","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.616016","20210322","COVID-19; hemodialysis; mental health; psychological profiles; quality of life; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-23","",12303,""

We calculated one-way between-groups ANOVA with Tukey's <i>post hoc</i> test. <b>Results:</b> Regionally, the center and the most populated area differed in psychological well-being/discomfort and negative alcohol-related consequences, but not in the remaining MHS indicators. According to the quarantine sub-periods, there were differences in psychological well-being/discomfort, social functioning and coping, psychological distress, and negative alcohol-related consequences. Negative alcohol-related consequences were the only MHS indicator improving over time. For all of the remaining MHS indicators, we found a similar deterioration pattern in the course of time, with mean scores decreasing from the first to the 2nd week of the quarantine pre-extensions, then increasing toward the 1st week of the quarantine post-extension (with some MHS indicators reaching mean scores worse than the start), and then continued to increase. <b>Conclusion:</b> A worsened mean MHS during quarantine suggests that quarantine and its extensions contribute to negative mental health impacts.","LÃƒÂ³pez Steinmetz, Leyes, Dutto Florio, Fong, LÃƒÂ³pez Steinmetz, Godoy","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.557880","20210322","COVID-19; anxiety; coronavirus disease (COVID-19); depressive symptoms; learned helplessness; quarantine; social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-23","",12304,""
"Mental health during COVID-19 lockdown in India: Role of psychological capital and internal locus of control","The Government of India implemented a nationwide lockdown from March 24, 2020 in response to the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak. This study examines the effects of two positive psychological resources on the mental health of Indian citizens during the early days of the lockdown. The effects of psychological capital (PsyCap)Ã‚Â and internal locus of control on psychological distress of people via affect balance were tested. Data were collected through an online survey from 667 participants. Psychological distress was assessed using the GHQ-12, and affect balance was assessed as the preponderance of positive over negative affect. Results reveal that psychological capital and internal locus of control were negatively associated with psychological distress. In addition, affect balance mediated the relationship between psychological capital and psychological distress and the relationship between internal locus of control and psychological distress. Thus, both the psychological resources through affect balance acted as buffers protecting people from mental health deterioration during COVID-19 lockdown. However, the direct and indirect effects of psychological capital on psychological distress is stronger than that of internal locus of control. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.","Alat, Das, Arora, Jha","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-01516-x","20210322","COVID-19; Internal locus of control; Lockdown; Positive and negative affect; Psychological capital; Psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-23","",12305,""

The subjects were divided into 3 groups: non-immigrants living in Poland (N = 50), Dutch citizens (N = 56), and Polish immigrants living in the Netherlands (N = 62). The level of stress and negative emotions was higher in the groups of Poles living in Poland and Poles living in the Netherlands than in the group of Dutch citizens. Therefore, access to psychological care should be improved during the pandemic, especially for immigrants, due to the increased risk of developing stress-induced mental disorders.

"Ingenuity and Resiliency of Syringe Service Programs on the Front Lines of the Opioid Overdose and COVID-19 Crises","As COVID-19 accelerated throughout 2020, syringe service programs (SSPs) faced challenges necessitating programmatic adaptations to prevent overdose deaths while simultaneously keeping workers and participants safe from COVID-19. We used qualitative methods to gain an understanding of the social context within which SSPs are operating during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted 36 in-depth interviews with program representatives from 18 programs and used the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) implementation framework to guide data analysis. We focused on three of the four EPIS constructs: outer context, inner context, and innovation factors. Our data indicate that responding to the pandemic led to innovations in service delivery such as secondary and mail-based distribution, adoption of telemedicine for enrolling participants in medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and use of virtual training platforms for overdose prevention. We found high levels of staff and volunteer commitment, which was a cornerstone to the success of these innovations. We observed that many SSPs were short-staffed because of their commitment to safety, and some lost current funding as well as opportunities for future funding. Despite minimal staffing and diminished funding, SSPs innovated at an accelerated pace with minimal staffing and diminished funding. To ensure the sustainability of these new approaches, a supportive external context (federal,state, and local policies and funding) is needed to support the development of SSPs' inner contexts (organizational characteristics, characteristics of individuals) and sustainment of the innovations achieved with regarding delivery of naloxone and MOUD.","Wenger, Kral, Bluthenthal, Morris, Ongais, Lambdin","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trsl.2021.03.011","20210322","COVID-19; Overdose; Prevention; Syringe Services Programs; programmatic adaptations","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-23","",12307,""

The mean age was 71.5 Ã‚Â± 5.6 (min: 65, max: 94) years, and 26 participants were living alone. Moreover, 47.6% participants considered they had sufficient information about the COVID-19 outbreak, and 61.6% received information about the pandemic from television and 22.2% from their inner circle. While 11.7% participants considered they would require psychological support after the COVID-19 pandemic, 30.8% had sleep disorders for the last month. The mean FCV-19 S score was 16.0 Ã‚Â± 6.4; the FCV-19 S scores were statistically higher in participants who were women, living alone, had partial information about the COVID-19 pandemic, had sleep disorders for the last month, and were in requirement of psychological support after the pandemic. It is necessary to screen the older people for the COVID-19-related fear and accompanying psychological disorders and to develop appropriate intervention programs for individuals at risk.","Gokseven, Ozturk, Karadeniz, SarÃ„Â±, Tas, Ozdemir","https://doi.org/10.1177/08919887211002651","20210322","Covid-19; FCV-19 S; fear; mental health; older people","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-23","",12311,""
"Fireside Chats: A Novel Wellness Initiative for Medical Students in the COVID-19 Era","To supplement preexisting wellness programming for the surgery clerkship, a faculty surgeon at Vanderbilt initiated Fireside Chats (FC) in 2015. Inspired by Franklin Roosevelt's Depression-era radio broadcasts, FC features small group sizes, off-campus excursions, and a reimagining of the mentor-mentee relationship that eschews hierarchy in favor of deep, mutualistic connections in both personal and professional domains. Here we describe the rationale and implementation of FC and present survey data that demonstrate the warm reception of FC and its efficacy in stewarding the mental health of medical students. Moreover, unlike large group activities such as &quot;learning communities,&quot; FC continues to meet in-person during COVID-19 and preserves social engagement opportunities that may alleviate pandemic-induced isolation and distress.","Lee, Natour, Geevarghese","https://doi.org/10.1177/00031348211003060","20210322","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-23","",12312,""
"Examining the associations between self-care practices and psychological distress among nursing students during the COVID-19 pandemic","There is limited research regarding the impact of self-care practices on psychological distress, specifically on nursing students during a pandemic, such as COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease- 2019). A 10-minute electronic survey was sent to nursing students at a large academic-medical center, and data from 285 student respondents were analyzed to assess psychological status, attitudes and behaviors in regards to the COVID-19 pandemic. Significant differences were found when comparing self-care practice scores by school grade for total scores (FÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 4.48 [dfÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 4250], pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .002), emotional subscale (FÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 4.78 [dfÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 4250], pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .001), and relationship subscale (FÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 3.44 [dfÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 4250], pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .009). While there were no significant differences in psychological distress by school grade, graduate students had the lowest self-care practice score compared to all the other grades. Finally, the subscale and total self-care practice scores were significantly and negatively associated with psychological distress. These findings suggest that utilization of self-care practices is associated with lower psychological distress, and should therefore be promoted among nursing student populations and integrated into curricula. Future studies should assess specific needs geared towards populations that may have poor self-care practices, such as graduate students, and understand ways to improve sleep quality to mitigate rates of psychological distress during a pandemic.","Brouwer, Walmsley, Parrish, McCubbin, Braido, Okoli","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nedt.2021.104864","20210321","Nursing student mental health; Psychological distress; Self-care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-23","",12313,""
"An A-E assessment of post-ICU COVID-19 recovery","The COVID-19 global pandemic has placed unprecedented strain on healthcare and critical care services around the world. Whilst most resources have focused on the acute phase of the disease, there is likely to be an untold burden of patients chronically affected.A wide range of sequelae contribute to post intensive care syndrome (PICS); from our current knowledge of COVID-19, a few of these have the potential to be more prevalent following critical care admission. Follow-up assessment, diagnosis and treatment in an increasingly virtual setting will provide challenges but also opportunities to develop these services.

"Workplace factors associated with mental health of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: an international cross-sectional study","The association of workplace factors on mental health of healthcare workers (HCWs) during the COVID-19 pandemic needs to be urgently established. This will enable governments and policy-makers to make evidence-based decisions. This international study reports the association between workplace factors and the mental health of HCWs during the pandemic. An international, cross-sectional study was conducted in 41 countries. The primary outcome was depressive symptoms, derived from the validated Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2). Multivariable logistic regression identified factors associated with mental health outcomes. Inter-country differences were also evaluated. A total of 2527 responses were received, from 41 countries, including China (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1213; 48.0%), UK (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°891; 35.3%), and USA (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°252; 10.0%). Of all participants, 1343 (57.1%) were aged 26 to 40Ã¢â‚¬â€°years, and 2021 (80.0%) were female; 874 (34.6%) were doctors, and 1367 (54.1%) were nurses. Factors associated with an increased likelihood of depressive symptoms were: working in the UK (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.63; CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°[2.90-4.54]; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and USA (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.10; CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°[3.03-5.54]), pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001); being female (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.74; CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°[1.42-2.13]; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001); being a nurse (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.64; CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°[1.34-2.01]; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001); and caring for a COVID-19 positive patient who subsequently died (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.20; CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°[1.01-1.43]; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.040). Workplace factors associated with depressive symptoms were: redeployment to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.67; CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°[1.14-2.46]; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.009); redeployment with perceived unsatisfactory training (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.67; CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°[1.32-2.11]; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001); not being issued with appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.49; CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°[2.03-3.04]; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001); perceived poor workplace support within area/specialty (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.49; CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°[2.03-3.04]; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001); and perceived poor mental health support (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.63; CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°[1.38-1.92]; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). This is the first international study, demonstrating that workplace factors, including PPE availability, staff training pre-redeployment, and provision of mental health support, are significantly associated with mental health during COVID-19. Governments, policy-makers and other stakeholders need to ensure provision of these to safeguard HCWs' mental health, for future waves and other pandemics.","Khajuria, Tomaszewski, Liu, Chen, Mehdian, Fleming, Vig, Crawford","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-021-06279-6","20210321","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Healthcare workers; Mental health; Workplace","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-23","",12315,""
"Mental health problems in the general population during and after the first lockdown phase due to the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic: rapid review of multi-wave studies","The SARS-Cov-2 pandemic and the lockdown response are assumed to have increased mental health problems in general populations compared to pre-pandemic times. The aim of this paper is to review studies on the course of mental health problems during and after the first lockdown phase. We conducted a rapid review of multi-wave studies in general populations with time points during and after the first lockdown phase. Repeated cross-sectional and longitudinal studies that utilised validated instruments were included. The main outcome was whether indicators of mental health problems have changed during and after the first lockdown phase. The study was registered with PROSPERO No. CRD42020218640. Twenty-three studies with 56 indicators were included in the qualitative review. Studies that reported data from pre-pandemic assessments through lockdown indicated an increase in mental health problems. During lockdown, no uniform trend could be identified. After lockdown, mental health problems decreased slightly. As mental health care utilisation indicators and data on suicides do not suggest an increase in demand during the first lockdown phase, we regard the increase in mental health problems as general distress that is to be expected during a global health crisis. Several methodological, pandemic-related, response-related and health policy-related factors need to be considered when trying to gain a broader perspective on the impact of the first wave of the pandemic and the first phase of lockdown on general populations' mental health.","Richter, Riedel-Heller, ZÃƒÂ¼rcher","https://doi.org/10.1017/S2045796021000160","20210322","Mental health; Pandemic; Rapid review; SARS-Cov-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-03-23","",12316,""
"Emotion regulation, psychological distress and demographic characteristics from a Spanish-speaking sample: Data from the lockdown due to COVID-19","Due to the rapid spread of COVID-19, several governments around the world implemented strict lockdown measures. However, these measures produced a number of negative psychological and social consequences, such as increased anxiety and depression [1,2]. This article presents raw data from variables related to psychological distress, and from possible sources of psychological distress, such as the use of certain emotion regulation strategies, exposure to different media sources, demographic information (e.g., age, marital status, having children), or characteristics of the house (e.g., overcrowding or isolation). The data were collected online during the first months of the lockdown measure in Ecuador (from March to June 2020) in a Spanish speaking sample of 663 participants (18-75 years old). The provided dataset could be useful to other researchers interested in investigating potential sources of psychological distress or vulnerable groups during a lockdown situation.","Jose A.
