"Individual and Work Factors Associated with Psychosocial Health of Registered Nurses During the Covid-19 Pandemic: A Mixed Methods Study","To describe the initial influence of the Covid-19 pandemic on U.S. nurses' psychosocial health, and to identify factors associated with poor psychosocial health outcomes. We conducted a convergent (QUAN+qual) mixed methods study. From June-August 2020, we administered surveys (N=629) and conducted semi-structured interviews (NÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 34) among nurses working across healthcare settings in 18 states. We developed separate multivariable logistic regression models for three psychosocial outcomes (anxiety, depressive symptoms, insomnia). We used content analysis to process and analyze qualitative data, and integrated results in the final analysis step. Nurses reported high rates of depressive symptoms (22%), anxiety (52%), and insomnia (55%). Disturbances to sleep were both a contributing factor to, and an outcome of, poor psychosocial health. Evidence-based interventions addressing work stress and sleep, and proactive monitoring of nurses' psychosocial health by employers are urgently needed.","Stimpfel, Ghazal, Goldsamt, Dickson","https://doi.org/10.1097/JOM.0000000000002495","20220126","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-27","",26063,""
"Association between urbanization and Internet addiction","Understanding the association between urbanization and Internet addiction is essential to the design and implementation of Internet addiction prevention measures in urban areas. This epidemiological review explores the urbanization-Internet addiction association and its potential underlying factors. Nine studies have reported that Internet addiction prevalence is higher in urban areas, but three studies have noted the opposite. Psychiatric disorders and stress are the most commonly mentioned factors underlying the association. The effects of urbanization on Internet availability, Internet cafÃƒÂ©s, online gaming, outdoor or interactive activities, and family regulation and monitoring have been suggested to lead to higher Internet addiction risk. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, obesity, sleep problems, and the migration of parents to urban areas in search of work have strengthened the effect of urbanization on Internet addiction. Early assessment and treatment provided by mental health services are crucial for mitigating the effect of urbanization on Internet addiction risk. Cities should be designed to provide adequate space for physical and interactive activities. To promote outdoor activities, air pollution, traffic congestion, and crime should be controlled. Prospective face-to-face studies involving analysis of data on pollution, traffic, and Internet addiction could provide evidence to elucidate the urbanization- Internet addiction association.","Ko, Yen, Lin","https://doi.org/10.1097/YCO.0000000000000780","20220126","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-27","",26064,""
"Context, COVID-19 and comorbidities: exploring emergent directions in syndemics and HIV research","The purpose of this review is to identify themes across articles that aimed to explore HIV-related syndemics in 2020 and 2021 and to discuss their implications for research on syndemics. We identified 189 articles on syndemics between 2020 and 2021. Key themes across studies included COVID-19; mental health and psychosocial challenges; substance use; socio-structural factors; protective factors; and methodological approaches. COVID-19's implications for HIV syndemic research were discussed. Mental health and substance use research largely examined linkages with sexual practices or reduced HIV care retention. Researchers examined associations between socio-structural variables (e.g. poverty) and elevated HIV exposure, reduced HIV testing and poorer health. Concepts of water insecurity and 'ecosyndemics' were also raised, as was the importance of attending to noncommunicable diseases and comorbidities. Most studies did not assess interactions between health conditions, signalling the need for methodological grounding in the foundational concepts of syndemic theory. Most studies recommended that HIV prevention and care research attend to the interplay between poor mental health, substance use and multidimensional violence. Increased attention to structural factors, particularly exacerbated poverty in the COVID-19 pandemic, is required. Research can identify protective factors to harness to advance HIV prevention and care.","Logie, Coelho, Kohrt, Tsai, Mendenhall","https://doi.org/10.1097/COH.0000000000000722","20220126","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-27","",26065,""
"Physician suicide demographics and the COVID-19 pandemic","To identify suicide rates and how they relate to demographic factors (sex, race and ethnicity, age, location) among physicians compared to the general population when aggravated by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We searched U.S. databases to report global suicide rates and proportionate mortality ratios (PMRs) among U.S. physicians (and non-physicians in health occupations) using National Occupational Mortality Surveillance (NOMS) data and using Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (WONDER) in the general population. We also reviewed the effects of age, suicide methods and locations, COVID-19 considerations, and potential solutions to current challenges. Between NOMS1 (1985-1998) and NOMS2 (1999-2013), the PMRs for suicide increased in White male physicians (1.77 to 2.03) and Black male physicians (2.50 to 4.24) but decreased in White female physicians (2.66 to 2.42). The interaction of non-modifiable risk factors, such as sex, race and ethnicity, age, education level/healthcare career, and location, require further investigation. Addressing systemic and organizational problems and personal resilience training are highly recommended, particularly during the additional strain from the COVID-19 pandemic.","Duarte, El-Hagrassy, Couto, Gurgel, Frey, Kapczinski, CorrÃƒÂªa","https://doi.org/10.1590/1516-4446-2021-1865","20220126","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-27","",26066,""
"Breaking Down Barriers: Young Adult Interest and Use of Telehealth for Behavioral Health Services","Use of telehealth for behavioral health services has increased since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study examines which young adults in Rhode Island were using these telehealth services and are interested in its use. This cross-sectional web-based survey was administered in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, from May to October 2020. Results suggest sexual and gender minorities and those with low social status were more likely to access these services, highlighting its effectiveness at reaching disadvantaged young adults. Those with mental health symptoms were more likely to utilize telehealth, but those with substance use were not. There is a missed opportunity to target substance use telehealth services to this willing and interested population. Continued coverage and use of telehealth for mental health and substance use services is essential in breaking down barriers to care for young adults in Rhode Island.","Rosenthal, Sonido, Tobin, Sammartino, Noel","https://www.google.com/search?q=Breaking+Down+Barriers:+Young+Adult+Interest+and+Use+of+Telehealth+for+Behavioral+Health+Services.","20220126","Rhode Island; behavioral health; telehealth; young adult","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-27","",26067,""
"Effects of physical activity and exercise on well-being in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was discovered in China and characterized by the World Health Organization as a pandemic in March 2020. Many countries worldwide implemented stringent social isolation as a strategy to contain virus transmission. However, the same physical distancing that protects against the spread of COVID-19 may negatively impact mental health and well-being of the population. The present study sought to shed light on this phenomenon by assessing the relationship between physical activity and subjective well-being (SWB) among individuals who were subjected to social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected in Brazil between March 31 and April 2, 2020. All of the volunteers agreed to participate by digitally checking the option of agreement after reading consent terms. The inclusion criteria were participants who had been in social isolation for at least 1 week and agreed to the consent terms. Three instruments were applied. A questionnaire was constructed for this study that assessed the participants' exercise routines. The Psychosocial Aspects, Well-being, and Exercise in Confinement (PAWEC) scale was created by researchers of this study that assessed the relationship between well-being and physical activity during social isolation. The Brazilian Portuguese-adapted version of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) was also used. A total of 592 participants (371 female, 220 male, 1 transgender), 14-74 years old (M = 32.39 years, SD = 10.5 years), reported being in social isolation for an average of 14.4 days (SD = 3.3 days). Well-being that was related to the practice of physical activity during quarantine was linked to an established routine of physical activity before the social isolation period. Participants who already practiced physical exercises previously and reported continuing the practice during the quarantine period had higher positive affect scores. Participants who engaged in physical activity without direct guidance only during the quarantine period had higher negative affect scores. Participants who already practiced physical activity felt more motivated to continue practicing physical activity during the social isolation period, resulting in positive affect, unlike participants who began exercising only during quarantine. Our results suggest that negative affect can occur among individuals who only just begin exercising during social isolation, indicating that physical activity should be habitual and not only occur during periods of social isolation. Engaging in exercise only during social isolation may contribute to an increase in malaise.","de Abreu, de Souza, Viana-Meireles, Landeira-Fernandez, Filgueiras","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0260465","20220126","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-27","",26068,""
"The COVID-19 Pandemic Significantly Impacts Pregnancy Planning and Mental Health of Women With Inflammatory Bowel Disease","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly impacted daily life, particularly in those with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We aimed to determine the impact of the pandemic on the pregnancy planning and mental health of women with IBD. Women with IBD (age 18 to 45Ã¢â‚¬â€°y) were asked to complete anonymous surveys on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on pregnancy planning and mental health symptoms such as stress (Perceived Stress Scale), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7). Univariate and multivariable analyses were conducted to identify risk factors associated with stress, depression, and anxiety during the pandemic. Seventy-three women with IBD were included (mean age: 32.1). Of 39 patients who were preconception, 20 (51.3%) reported a significant impact of the pandemic on pregnancy planning, with common reasons for not planning conception being fear of transmission of the virus to the fetus, lack of social supports, and no desire to be in hospital during pregnancy. Over half of all women reported an increase in stress and depression symptoms during the pandemic, with over half also reporting symptoms of anxiety. On multivariable linear regression analyses, increased anxiety levels were a significant predictor of increased stress and depression symptoms during the pandemic. Urban residence and younger age were significant predictors of increased anxiety symptoms during the pandemic. A significant proportion of women with IBD experienced an impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on pregnancy planning and mental health illnesses such as stress, depression, and anxiety.","Tandon, O'Connor, Nguyen, Maxwell, Huang","https://doi.org/10.1097/MCG.0000000000001672","20220126","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-27","",26069,""
"Suicidal Behavior in the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic","Since the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been numerous social changes to try to Ã¢â‚¬â€¹Ã¢â‚¬â€¹contain the spread of the disease. These sudden changes in daily life have also changed the way we relate to others, in addition to creating a climate of uncertainty and fear. Therefore, the objective of this review is to compile published data of the consequences of suicidal behavior in the first months from the onset of the pandemic. The analysis reflects a concern about issues related to suicide since the beginning of the pandemic. A large number of online surveys have been released and have provided data on relatively large populations. The percentage of the population with suicidal ideation in that period seems to be approximately 5-15%. Many studies associate suicidal ideation with being young, female, and presence of sleep problems. Surveys of healthcare workers do not seem to indicate a higher prevalence of suicidal ideation compared to the general population. The incidence of suicide attempts seen in emergency departments did not seem to change, while the number of visits for other issues, unrelated to suicide, did decrease. The few studies on completed suicide do not indicate an increase in incidence in these first 6Ã‚Â months since March 2020, when the WHO declared the start of the pandemic. It does not seem that there have been major changes in the figures related to suicidal behavior in the studies from the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, although it is still too early to know the consequences it will have long term. The social and economic damages resulting from the pandemic will certainly take a long time to recover.","Giner, Vera-Varela, de la Vega, Zelada, Guija","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11920-022-01312-9","20220126","COVID-19; Depression; Lockdown; Natural disasters; Pandemic; Psychological consequences; Suicidal behavior; Suicidal ideation; Suicide; Suicide attempt","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-27","",26070,""
"Challenges of Telemonitoring Programs for Complex Chronic Conditions: Randomized Controlled Trial With an Embedded Qualitative Study","Despite the growing prevalence of people with complex conditions and evidence of the positive impact of telemonitoring for single conditions, little research exists on telemonitoring for this population. This randomized controlled trial and embedded qualitative study aims to evaluate the impact on and experiences of patients and health care providers (HCPs) using a telemonitoring system with decision support to manage patients with complex conditions, including those with multiple chronic conditions, compared with the standard of care. A pragmatic, unblinded, 6-month randomized controlled trial sought to recruit 146 patients with Ã¢â€°Â¥1 diagnosis of heart failure (HF), uncontrolled hypertension (HT), and insulin-requiring diabetes mellitus (DM) from outpatient specialty settings in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Participants were randomized into the control and telemonitoring groups, with the latter being instructed to take readings relevant to their conditions. The telemonitoring system contained an algorithm that generated decision support in the form of actionable self-care directives to patients and alerts to HCPs. The primary outcome was health status (36-Item Short Form Health Survey questionnaire). Secondary outcomes included anxiety and depression, self-efficacy in chronic disease management, and self-reported health service use. HF-related quality of life and self-care measures were also collected from patients followed for HF. Within- and between-group change scores were analyzed for statistical significance (P&lt;.05). A convenience sample of HCPs and patients in the intervention group was interviewed about their experiences. A total of 96 patients were recruited and randomized. Recruitment was terminated early because of implementation challenges and the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. No significant within- and between-group differences were found for the main primary and secondary outcomes. However, a within-group analysis of patients with HF found improvements in self-care maintenance (P=.04) and physical quality of life (P=.046). Opinions expressed by the 5 HCPs and 13 patients who were interviewed differed based on the monitored conditions. Although patients with HF reported benefitting from actionable self-care guidance and meaningful interactions with their HCPs, patient and HCP users of the DM and HT modules did not think telemonitoring improved the clinical management of those conditions to the same degree. These differing experiences were largely attributed to the siloed nature of specialty care and the design of the decision support, whereby fluctuations in the status of HT and DM typically required less urgent interventions compared with patients with HF. We recommend that future research conceive telemonitoring as a program and that self-management and clinical decision support are necessary but not sufficient components of such programs for patients with complex conditions and lower acuity. We conclude that telemonitoring for patients with complex conditions or within multidisciplinary care settings may be best operationalized through nurse-led models of care.

"Patient Engagement With a Game-Based Digital Therapeutic for the Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Open-Label, Decentralized Trial","Prescription digital therapeutics are software-based disease treatments that are regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration; the reSET-O prescription digital therapeutic was authorized in 2018 and delivers behavioral treatment for individuals receiving buprenorphine for opioid use disorder. Although reSET-O improves outcomes for individuals with opioid use disorder, most of the therapeutic content is delivered as narrative text. PEAR-008 is an investigational device based on reSET-O that uses an interactive, game-based platform to deliver similar therapeutic content designed to enhance patient engagement, which may further improve treatment outcomes. We aim to investigate how participants interact with the prescription digital therapeutic's new content delivery format. Secondary objectives include evaluating treatment success, symptoms of co-occurring mental health disorders, recovery capital, and skill development. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this study was redesigned using a decentralized model because it was not possible to conduct medication initiation and study visits in person, as initially intended. A decentralized, randomized controlled trial design will be utilized to compare patient engagement with PEAR-008 and that with reSET-O using both subjective and objective assessments. The study population will consist of approximately 130 individuals with opioid use disorder (based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 criteria) who have recently started buprenorphine treatment for opioid use disorder. Participants will be virtually recruited and randomly assigned to receive either PEAR-008 or reSET-O. All study sessions will be virtual, and the duration of the study is 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure of engagement is operationalized as the number of active sessions per week with either PEAR-008 or reSET-O. (An active session is any session that contains some active participation in the app, such as navigating to a different screen, engaging with a learning module, or responding to a notification.) Subjective dimensions of engagement will be assessed with participant surveys. The hypothesis is that PEAR-008 will have significantly greater participant engagement than reSET-O. As of February 2021, participant enrollment is ongoing. This randomized controlled trial will investigate if changing the delivery format and enhancing the content of a prescription digital therapeutic for opioid use disorder will affect how participants use and interact with the prescription digital therapeutic. The study design may serve as a useful model for conducting decentralized studies in this patient population. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04542642; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04542642.

"Listening to COVID-19 survivors: what they need after early discharge from hospital - a qualitative study","This study aims to explore the post-discharge experience and needs of COVID-19 survivors. A qualitative study was conducted. A total of 16 post-discharge COVID-19 patients aged 31-68Ã‚Â years were recruited. The semi-structured interviews were conducted by telephone one month after discharge and were analysed by Colaizzi's 7-step method. The post-discharge experience of COVID-19 patients were classified into four categories and ten subcategories. Category I: physiological problems consisted of physical sequelae (such as fatigue, shortness of breath, sleep disorder, chest pain) and a lack of physical rehabilitation guidance. Category II: psychological issues included anxiety, depression, fear, and psychological trauma. Category III: social issues included social stigma and financial stress. Category IV: positive experience and change included gratitude to social support and cherishing life and family. COVID-19 survivors urgently need guidance for physical rehabilitation and psychological growth, social support provisions, and protection from social stigma. The experience of COVID-19 survivors is significant for planning healthcare management systems and guiding public health prevention efforts.","Guo, Kong, Shi, Wang, Yang","https://doi.org/10.1080/17482631.2022.2030001","20220126","COVID-19; pandemic; post-discharge experience; qualitative study; survivors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-27","",26073,""
"Characterization of Healthy Housing in Africa: Method, Profiles, and Determinants","Housing is a key social determinant of health with implications for both physical and mental health. The measurement of healthy housing and studies characterizing the same in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are uncommon. This study described a methodological approach employed in the assessment and characterization of healthy housing in SSA using the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data for 15 countries and explored healthy housing determinants using a multiple survey-weighted logistic regression analysis. For all countries, we demonstrated that the healthy housing index developed using factor analysis reasonably satisfies both reliability and validity tests and can therefore be used to describe the distribution of healthy housing across different groups and in understanding the linkage with individual health outcomes. We infer from the results that unhealthy housing remains quite high in most SSA countries. Having a male head of the household was associated with decreased odds of healthy housing in Burkina Faso (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.80, CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.68-0.95), Cameroon (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.65, CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.57, 0.76), Malawi (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.70, CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.64-0.78), and Senegal (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.62, CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.51-0.74). Further, increasing household size was associated with reducing odds of healthy housing in Kenya (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.53, CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.44-0.65), Namibia (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.34, CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.24-0.48), Nigeria (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.57, CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.46-0.71), and Uganda (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.79, CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.67-0.94). Across all countries, household wealth was a strong determinant of healthy housing, with middle and rich households having higher odds of residing in healthy homes compared to poor households. Odds ratios ranged from 3.63 (CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.96-4.44) for households in the middle wealth group in the DRC to 2812.2 (CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1634.8-4837.7) in Namibia's wealthiest households. For other factors, the analysis also showed variation across countries. Our findings provide timely insights for the implementation of housing policies across SSA countries, drawing attention to aspects of housing that would promote occupant health and wellbeing. Beyond the contribution to the measurement of healthy housing in SSA, our paper highlights key policy and program issues that need further interrogation in the search for pathways to addressing the healthy housing deficit across most SSA countries. This has become critical amid the COVID-19 pandemic, where access to healthy housing is pivotal in its control.","Iddi, Muindi, Gitau, Mberu","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11524-021-00603-5","20220126","Africa; COVID-19; Determinants; Healthy; Housing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-27","",26074,""
"Online Mindfulness Experience for Emotional Support to Healthcare staff in times of Covid-19","During the first confinement in Spain, between the months of March to June 2020, Information and Communication Technologies strategies were implemented in order to support health workers in the Wellbeing of Mental Health. Faced with so much uncertainty about the pandemic, an Online Mindfulness course. The objective of the course was to support healthcare professionals in Castilla y LeÃƒÂ³n in managing stress, anxiety and other emotional disturbances generated by coping with a situation as uncertain and unexpected as a pandemic, in order to manage emotions and thoughts that can lead to suicidal ideation. The motivations for the demand, reasons or motivations in which the health professionals of Castilla y LeÃƒÂ³n decided to participate in the mindfulness course in the first wave of Covid-19 in Spain are described. The descriptive and inferential statistical analysis of the customer satisfaction survey applied at the end of the mindfulness course, to the health professionals who participated in a satisfaction survey (CSQ-8: Client Satisfaction Questionnaire).

"Health management of patients with COVID-19: is there a room for hydrotherapeutic approaches?","With highly variable types of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms in both severity and duration, there is today an important need for early, individualized, and multidisciplinary strategies of rehabilitation. Some patients present persistent affections of the respiratory function, digestive system, cardiovascular function, locomotor system, mental health, sleep, nervous system, immune system, taste, smell, metabolism, inflammation, and skin. In this context, we highlight here that hydrothermal centers should be considered today as medically and economically relevant alternatives to face the urgent need for interventions among COVID-19 patients. We raise the potential benefits of hydrotherapy programs already existing which combine alternative medicine with respiratory care, physical activity, nutritional advice, psychological support, and physiotherapy, in relaxing environments and under medical supervision. Beyond the virtues of thermal waters, many studies reported medical benefits of natural mineral waters through compressing, buoyancy, resistance, temperature changes, hydrostatic pressure, inhalations, or drinking. Thermal institutions might offer individualized follow-up helping to unclog hospitals while ensuring the continuity of health care for the different clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in both post-acute and chronic COVID-19 patients. Our present review underlines the need to further explore the medical effectiveness, clinical and territorial feasibility, and medico-economic impacts of the implementation of post-COVID-19 patient management in hydrotherapeutic establishments.","Bailly, Evrard, Coudeyre, Rochette, Meriade, Blavignac, Fournier, Bignon, Dutheil, Duclos, Thivel","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00484-022-02246-w","20220126","Alternative medicine; COVID-19; Hydrotherapy; SARS-CoV-2; Thermal waters","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-27","",26076,""
"Factors associated with suicidal behavior among university students in Bangladesh after one year of COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 outbreak spillovers mental health burden where suicide is a common psychological public health issue that affects people all over the world. This study aimed to explore the factors associated with suicidal behavior among university students in Bangladesh after one year of the COVID-19 outbreak. An online cross-sectional survey was conducted among 2100 Bangladeshi university students aged Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years from April 29 to May 15, 2021. The survey questionnaire contained socio-demographic information, COVID-19 related physical and psychosocial factors (CRPPF), preventive response to psychological stress, and the Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R) scale. Descriptive statistics along with logistic regression were performed for statistical analysis. About 47.90% of the students were at risk of suicidal behavior, and female students were very likely to be at risk of suicidal behavior than their male counterparts (AOR = 2.28; 95% CI: 1.86 to 2.81). Keeping distance from friends or family (AOR = 1.66; 95% CI: 1.34 to 2.04), having relationship problems (AOR = 2.20; 95% CI: 1.79 to 2.70), feeling own selves as burden to families (AOR = 2.50; 95% CI: 2.02 to 3.11), and being stressed of lockdown (AOR = 1.56; 95% CI: 1.19 to 2.03) were highlighted as some of the significant factors associated with increased risk of suicidal behavior. University students were exposed to several factors that impose the risk of developing suicidal behavior. Concerned authorities should design &amp; implement appropriate strategies for ensuring suicidal prevention besides their mental well-being.","Rahman, Khan, Al Zubayer, Ahmed, Hasan, Rahaman, Islam, Al Mazid Bhuiyan, Rimti, Khan, Hossain, Haque","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e08782","20220126","Bangladesh; COVID-19; Suicidal behavior; Suicidal factors; University students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-27","",26077,""
"Mental Health Over Time and Financial Concerns Predict Change in Online Gambling During COVID-19","This study examined online gambling behavior during COVID-19 land-based gambling restrictions and associations with changes in mental health, impacts on household income due to the pandemic, financially focused motivations, and symptoms of gambling problems. A repeated online survey was administered to adult gamblers in Ontario, Canada. Wave 1 was conducted at the beginning of the first COVID-19 lockdown (April 2020) and wave 2 in August 2020. Respondents (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°940) completed validated self-report questionnaires related to depression and anxiety, financial motivation, financial impacts due to the pandemic, online gambling behaviors, and problem gambling symptomatology. A cluster analysis identified three subgroups: no online gambling (subgroup 1), engagement in a range of gambling games online and change in gambling involvement (i.e., some increased and some decreased gambling; subgroup 2), and predominantly online lottery play with no change in online gambling (subgroup 3). Respondents who reported increased anxiety and depression symptom severity between the two waves and those who experienced greater symptoms of problem gambling and negative impacts on household income due to COVID-19 were most likely to be found in subgroup 2. Greater financial focus was also noted in this group. Results indicate a link between change in online gambling involvement during COVID-19 and increased mental health problems, elevated problem gambling severity, negative impacts on household income, and a greater financially focused self-concept. These results may help generate novel research questions examining short and long-term effects of the pandemic on online behaviors that inform policy and practice.","Price, Tabri, Stark, Balodis, Wohl","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-021-00750-5","20220126","COVID-19; Financial impact; Financial motivation; Mental health; Online gambling","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-27","",26078,""
"Anxiety, Depression and Burnout Levels of Turkish Healthcare Workers at the End of the First Period of COVID-19 Pandemic in Turkey","COVID-19 pandemic affected the mental health of healthcare workers (HCWs) as well as their physical health. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the anxiety, depression and burnout levels of Turkish HCWs after the first period of the pandemic. The participants filled sociodemographic data form, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). In this study, 221 HCWs (68.8% female) with a median age of 28 (20-66) years were included. Concerning HADS cut-off points, 39.8% of the participants scored above the depression cut-off point, while 26.2% scored above the cut-off point for anxiety. The anxiety (HADS-A) and depression (HADS-D) scores of nurses and medical secretaries were significantly higher than the physicians. Also, the anxiety and depression rates of nurses were higher than both physicians and medical secretaries. Emotional exhaustion (MBI-EE) and depersonalization (MBI-D) scores were highest in nurses, followed by medical secretaries and physicians, respectively. In multivariate analysis, being a nurse (OR: 4.671, <i>p</i> = 0.044) or medical secretary (OR: 4.013, <i>p</i> = 0.048), requirement of using a mental health support line (OR: 4.641, <i>p</i> = 0.005), having any kind of addiction (OR: 2.562, <i>p</i> = 0.019) and being under antidepressant therapy (OR: 3.096, <i>p</i> = 0.036) significantly increased the risk of anxiety. However, in multivariate analyses, the only requirement of using a mental health support line significantly increased the risk of depression (OR: 8.542, <i>p</i> = 0.001). Female HCWs, nurses and medical secretaries experienced higher levels of mental health symptoms than male HCWs and physicians.","Uz, SavaÃ…Å¸an, SoÃ„Å¸ancÃ„Â±","https://doi.org/10.9758/cpn.2022.20.1.97","20220126","Anxiety; Burnout; COVID-19; Depression; Healthcare workers; Mental health support line","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-27","",26079,""
"Longitudinal survey of UK veterans with pre-existing mental health difficulties: mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic","At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals with pre-existing mental health difficulties were thought to be vulnerable to mental health deterioration due to the emerging threat and the actions taken to control infection rates. Yet, there remained a paucity of research investigating changes in veteran well-being, a population facing higher rates of mental health difficulties compared with the general public. This longitudinal study aimed to investigate the mental health and well-being of UK veterans with pre-existing mental health difficulties at two time points during the COVID-19 pandemic. UK treatment-seeking veterans (N=121) completed an online survey administered towards the end of the first UK lockdown in June 2020 and 1Ã¢â‚¬â€°year later. Data were gathered on sociodemographic characteristics as well as psychometric measures of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), common mental disorders (CMDs), anger difficulties and alcohol misuse. The proportion of veterans meeting criteria of PTSD, anger and alcohol misuse remained similar across the two time points, while significantly fewer veterans met criteria for CMDs 1Ã¢â‚¬â€°year later. A notable proportion of the sample reported challenges in attending mental and physical health appointments, which was positively associated with not working and negatively associated with more COVID-19-related stressors. These findings suggest that, to date, veterans with pre-existing mental health difficulties appear to demonstrate resilience as the COVID-19 pandemic progressed. However, as the pandemic continued, veterans faced significantly more COVID-19-related stressors, less social support, as well as difficulties attending health appointments.","Murphy, Hendrikx, Williamson, Baumann","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjmilitary-2021-002046","20220126","adult psychiatry; depression &amp; mood disorders; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-27","",26080,""
"The role of risk perception and affective response in the COVID-19 preventive behaviours of young adults: a mixed methods study of university students in the Netherlands","Due to an increased infection rate among young adults, they need to adhere to the preventive guidelines to stop the spread of COVID-19 and protect vulnerable others. The purpose of this mixed methods study was to explore the role of risk perception and affective response in the preventive behaviours of young adults during the COVID-19 outbreak. This study followed a convergent mixed methods design, in which a quantitative online survey (n=1081) and 10 qualitative in-depth semistructured video interviews were conducted separately in the Netherlands during April-August 2020. 1081 participants filled in the online survey, and 10 participants participated in the interviews. Eligibility criteria included being a university student. Data on risk perception, affective response, that is, worry, and adherence to preventive guidelines were combined and analysed during this study. There were no secondary outcome measures. The results showed that young adults perceived their risk as low. Their affective response for their own well-being was also low; however, their affective response was high with regards to vulnerable others in their surroundings. Due to their high impersonal risk perception (ie, perceived risk to others) and high affective response, young adults adhered to most preventive guidelines relatively frequently. However, young adults sometimes neglected social distancing due to the negative effects on mental health and the uncertainty of the duration of the situation. In conclusion, high impersonal risk perception and high affective response regarding others are key motivators in young adults' preventive behaviour. To maximise adherence to the preventive guidelines, risk communication should put emphasis on the benefits to vulnerable others' health when young adults adhere to the preventive guidelines.","Kollmann, Kocken, Syurina, Hilverda","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-056288","20220126","COVID-19; epidemiology; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-27","",26081,""
"Why did COVID-19 not further harm the mental health of poor mothers? A mixed-method study on low-income families in Singapore","This paper examines the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on a disadvantaged group of financially poor mothers' mental health conditions in Singapore during the phase of acute COVID-19 infection. A mixed-method design is used. We conducted five focus group discussions with interviewers (n=39) who administered a third wave of survey questionnaire to 424 mothers from low-income families between June and September 2020. The focus group discussions gleaned observations by the interviewers on the risk and stress levels of the mothers during the period leading up to the height of COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, survey data from two time points-pre-COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 pandemic height, measuring the relationship of mother's job loss, income earner loss, marital status, number of children and, permanency of employment and mother's hope levels with mother's depression and anxiety were used to triangulate the observations from the focus group discussions. Majority of the interviewers did not observe any marked increase in stress levels. Correspondingly the quantitative data did not show any significant increase in depression and anxiety scores between wave 2 and 3 results. Qualitative data showed that numerous mothers were able to report different strategies in coping with the financial distress. The government COVID-19 support grants were cited by many as helpful in cushioning the financial stress. Comparing the quantitative measurements, the relationship between loss of income earner and mother's depression and anxiety was moderated by marital status. In addition, the relationship between mother's job loss and mother's depression, as well as loss of income earner and mother's anxiety, was moderated by mother's hope. We speculate the relatively stable level of mental health state of financially poor mothers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic to their internal (psychological traits) resilience which is facilitated by the availability of resources in the social milieu through the COVID-19 support grants.","Goh, Wen, Ang","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-052103","20220126","COVID-19; adult psychiatry; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-27","",26082,""

"A Year of Pandemicâ€”Comparison of Depression Among Neurosurgeons After the Advent of the COVID-19 Vaccine","Objective To determine factors associated with anxiety and depression among neurosurgeons after vaccination during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods An online survey was completed by neurosurgeons worldwide over 4 weeks. Depression in neurosurgeons was assessed by the 20-item self-reporting questionnaire. Results A total of 534 responses were received and analyzed. Almost half of the respondents were from Asia (50.9%), followed by Europe (38.8%). The majority of the respondents were <40 years old (88%), and almost two thirds were trainees (62.2%). Half of the respondents worked in departments with <40 beds (50.7%), and the majority were practicing in the private sector (72.5%). Most of the respondents (85.8%) had COVID-19â€“positive colleagues in their department, and 64% had exposure to a COVID-19â€“positive colleague, family member, and/or patient. More than half of the respondents were exposed to infected patients and/or colleagues, and almost half (43.1%) underwent COVID-19 testing when exposed. Nearly half of the respondents underwent COVID-19 testing more than twice (52.4%). Of respondents, 83% had received at least the first dose of the vaccine. The odds of depression among vaccinated respondents were found to be significantly less than among unvaccinated respondents in the univariable model. Conclusions Among health care workers, neurosurgeons are one of the groups indirectly affected by the pandemic. Adaptation to the new normal and advent of vaccines is speculated to control psychological distress among all groups of health care workers, including neurosurgeons. We found that odds of depression among vaccinated people were lower than among people who were not vaccinated.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2021.12.076","20220101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-27","",26088,""
