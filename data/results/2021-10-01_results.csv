"The impact of Covid-19 on unemployment across Italy: Consequences for those affected by psychiatric conditions","Severe psychological and psychosocial consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic are expected, especially for people already vulnerable to biological or psychosocial stressors, including those with mental health problems. The study aimed to investigate factors associated with the loss of jobs and unemployment during the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, we investigated whether mental illness was associated with a higher risk of losing one's job because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nineteen thousand four hundred ninety-six adults living in Italy were administered an online protocol including a sociodemographic checklist and questionnaires investigating suicide ideation and risk, mental health status and general distress (stress, anxiety, and depression), resilience, and perceived support. One thousand two hundred seventy-four reported having lost their job because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and 5.4% of the sample reported a mental illness (mostly a depressive disorder). Unemployment was independently associated with mental illness, poor mental health, and depression. Mental illness was associated with the risk of losing one's job because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but not at the multivariate analyses. Those who lost their job because of the COVID-19 pandemic (compared to others) reported worse mental health and depression. The presence of mental illness was self-reported by respondents and the administered measures were self-reported questionnaires affected by social desirability and other response bias. The COVID-19 pandemic and social isolation measures and lockdown used to contain its spread among the Italian population were associated with occupational insecurity, especially among the more vulnerable social categories.","Pompili, Innamorati, Sampogna, Albert, Carmassi, CarrÃƒÂ , Cirulli, Erbuto, Luciano, Nanni, Sani, Tortorella, ViganÃƒÂ², Volpe, Fiorillo","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.09.035","20210930","COVID-19 pandemic; Depression; Mental illness; Unemployment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-01","",18456,""
"COVID-19 deaths in a secondary mental health service","We present data on outcomes associated with COVID-19 in a time-limited sample of 1181 patients who were receiving treatment within secondary care services from a mental health and learning disabilities service provider. Unfortunately, 101 (9%) died after contracting COVID-19, though the real death rate is probably lower due to mild, unreported cases. Those who died were more likely to be male, of older age (75.7 vs. 42.7Ã‚Â yrs) and have a diagnosis of dementia (57% vs. 3.4%). We examined Health of the Nation Outcome Scale (HoNOS) scores as possible predictors for COVID-19 outcomes. Although the deceased group had higher HoNOS scores (17.7 vs. 13.2), the differences disappeared when examining only cases of dementia in 65+ age-group, suggesting that diagnosis is key. There has been little information published about people with severe mental health problems within secondary care. Although our sample is small, it does highlight some important inequalities that would benefit from further research.","Gale, Boland","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comppsych.2021.152277","20210930","COVID-19; Dementia; HoNOS; Mental health; Old age; Psychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-01","",18457,""
"Five probable factors responsible for COVID-associated mucormycosis outbreak in India","The second wave of COVID-19 due to Delta (B.1.617.2) variant led to the rapid rise of total coronavirus and COVID-associated mucormycosis cases reported from India. Hence, the current perspective explores the possible causes of rapid upsurge in COVID-associated mucormycosis cases, which was accounted for over 70% of global cases. The five most probable factors associated with the increase of mucormycosis in COVID-19 patients include diabetes mellitus, steroids overdose, high iron levels, immuno-suppression, combined with other possible factors such as unhygienic conditions, prolonged hospitalization, use of ventilators and leaky humidifiers in oxygen cylinders, creates an ideal environment for contracting mucormycosis. However, these cases could be brought down by disseminating simple preventive measures and creating awareness among the medical society and general public on this rare and deadly contagion of COVID-associated mucormycosis. The identification of the early symptoms will help to restrict the spread of lethal fungal diseases. Further, a collaborative team of surgeons, ophthalmologists, physicians, otolaryngologists specialists would be required in the hospital wards to proceed with quick surgeries on severely impacted patients.","Ravindra, Ahlawat","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2021.09.057","20210930","COVID-19; COVID-associated mucormycosis; awareness; diabetes mellitus; steroids overdose","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-01","",18458,""
"Facial masks affect emotion recognition in the general population and individuals with autistic traits","Facial expressions, and the ability to recognize these expressions, have evolved in humans to communicate information to one another. Face masks are equipment used in healthcare by health professionals to prevent the transmission of airborne infections. As part of the social distancing efforts related to COVID-19, wearing facial masks has been practiced globally. Such practice might influence affective information communication among humans. Previous research suggests that masks disrupt expression recognition of some emotions (e.g., fear, sadness or neutrality) and lower the confidence in their identification. To extend the previous research, in the current study we tested a larger and more diverse sample of individuals and also investigated the effect of masks on perceived intensity of expressions. Moreover, for the first time in the literature we examined these questions using individuals with autistic traits. Specifically, across three experiments using different populations (college students and general population), and the 10-item Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ-10; lower and higher scorers), we tested the effect of facial masks on facial emotion recognition of anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and neutrality. Results showed that the ability to identify all facial expressions decreased when faces were masked, a finding observed across all three studies, contradicting previous research on fear, sad, and neutral expressions. Participants were also less confident in their judgements for all emotions, supporting previous research; and participants perceived emotions as less expressive in the mask condition compared to the unmasked condition, a finding novel to the literature. An additional novel finding was that participants with higher scores on the AQ-10 were less accurate and less confident overall in facial expression recognition, as well as perceiving expressions as less intense. Our findings reveal that wearing face masks decreases facial expression recognition, confidence in expression identification, as well as the perception of intensity for all expressions, affecting high-scoring AQ-10 individuals more than low-scoring individuals.","Pazhoohi, Forby, Kingstone","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0257740","20210930","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-01","",18459,""
"Inhabiting the state subjunctively: Transgender life-making alongside death and a pandemic","The Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, while addressing the United Nations General Assembly on 26 September 2020, stated that India had introduced legal reforms to accord rights to transgender citizens. Even though there is not much material basis to these rights, transgender communities have been protesting against the state and at times negotiating with it to get laws that are more in alignment with their rights. In the wake of serialised deaths and precarity intensified by the Covid-19 pandemic, transgender communities also stage other negotiations in the everyday with activists, transnationally funded NGOs and academics researching their communities, encounters that are not as spectacular as the protests against the state, but that which ensures their daily sustenance. This paper investigates how they inhabit these systemically violent institutions. Deploying ethnographic field notes from eastern India, this paper argues that they inhabit them subjunctively, which is not about refusing engagement with what is oppressive but about the ceaseless conjuring of improvisatory and contingent gestures that are marked by hope as well as uncertainty. The simultaneity of protests, rage, hopelessness, hope, negotiations, supplications and scepticism allow them to not only endure the violence of institutions but also to rupture them and imagine them otherwise.","Bhattacharya","https://doi.org/10.1080/17441692.2021.1986561","20210930","Covid; Transgender communities; death; homonationalism; nation-state","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-01","",18460,""

"Generational differences in psychological wellbeing and preventative behaviours among nursing students during COVID-19: a cross-sectional study","Many nursing programs have had to swiftly move online in response to COVID-19. Nursing students are often a heterogenous group that traverse generational boundaries. Exploring generational differences may assist in developing support systems for specific groups. This study sought to examine psychological wellbeing and preventative behaviours among nursing students from the iGeneration in comparison to older generations. A prospective cross-sectional study was undertaken using a convenience sample of pre-registration nursing students studying at two Australian Universities, one regional and one metropolitan. 631 pre-registration nursing students completed an online survey. An Independent Samples t-test revealed that students from the iGeneration possess higher anxiety compared to nursing students from older generations (p=0.000). Compared to iGeneration participants, older generation participants had significantly higher scores for knowledge of COVID-19 (p=0.015). iGeneration participants utilised social media to source information about COVID-19 far more than older generations (p=0.008). iGeneration participants were significantly more concerned than older generations about the impact of COVID-19 on completing their clinical placement (p=0.014). Older generations tended to have higher academic preventative behaviours, with significant mean scores for not attending university if they or others they knew had symptoms of COVID-19. Given the differences between generation groups with regard to psychological wellbeing, knowledge about COVID-19, and concerns about studying in an altered study environment, strategies should be targeted to generational groups. Anxiety negatively impacts quality of life, educational performance and clinical practice, and is experienced more frequently in the iGeneration. Therefore it is crucial for nursing educators to reflect on how they engage this generation in the online space to provide support, stability and a sense of connection. This will contribute towards ensuring a well-prepared future nursing workforce who may encounter other pandemics and isolating events. Compared with other generations, iGeneration students have a greater likelihood to experience mental health issues, isolation and insecurity. Nursing leaders and educators must be sensitive to such intergenerational differences, to ensure they are developing a skilled and productive workforce.","Middleton, Fernandez, Moxham, Tapsell, Halcomb, Lord, Alomari, Hunt","https://doi.org/10.1080/10376178.2021.1987941","20210930","COVID-19; generational groups; learning behaviours; nursing students; psychological wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-01","",18462,""
"Anxiety, depression and coping strategies among chronic medical patients with coronavirus disease-2019: a multicenter follow-up cohort study","Studies have shown that COVID-19 patients experience high levels of anxiety, depression, and stress during the pandemic. Patients adopt different coping strategies to reduce their psychological distress. To compare the immediate and long-term psychological impact of COVID-19 disease on patients with and without chronic medical illnesses (CMI) and identify coping styles of both groups during the peak of COVID-19 disease in Egypt. This is a cohort follow-up study, that included an online survey consisting of General Health Questionnaire-12, Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale, Beck Depression Inventory and Brief-COPE scale. The Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Checklist was completed after 6Ã¢â‚¬â€°months. Questionnaires were distributed to adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection during their quarantine in Egypt. There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding anxiety and depression during the acute infection. Patients without CMI relied significantly on the use of informational support to cope with COVID-19 disease. Patients with CMI continued to show significant depressive symptoms after 6Ã¢â‚¬â€°months without significant PTSD symptoms.

"Black adolescents' perceptions of COVID-19: Challenges, coping, and connection to family, religious, and school support","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic swept the nation by surprise, leaving a deep-seated impact on individuals' social, mental, and physical health. Despite there being disparities between Black and White/non-Hispanic individuals, minimal research has been conducted to explore the effects of the virus on marginalized groups. This study aimed to investigate Black adolescents' perceptions of their experiences with COVID-19, including the challenges they encountered, the coping strategies they employed, and their use of religious/spiritual and school-based support. Twelve Black youth between the ages of 12 and 18 years were interviewed during the early stages of the pandemic (June and July of 2020). Participants struggled with adjusting to the changes in their daily routines, navigating virtual learning, and emerging mental health difficulties (e.g., anxiety). To cope with these challenges, participants relied on emotion and problem-focused coping strategies, including strategies that were religious/spiritual in nature. Participants also relied on social support from family, school personnel, and their religious community, though they lamented about the varied support received from the latter two. Findings from this research support calls for mental health providers to employ culturally affirming mental health services and engage in interagency collaboration to support Black youth.

"Health effects of COVID-19 for vulnerable adolescents in a randomized controlled trial","Emerging evidence suggests the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is adversely affecting adolescents' mental health and health behaviors, particularly among those with preexisting mental health conditions and from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. However, direct tests of changes in health outcomes among vulnerable adolescents from before to during COVID-19 are limited. In addition, little is known about how to buffer adolescents, particularly those who are most vulnerable, against stress-related decrements in health. This randomized controlled trial begins to fill these gaps in the literature by exploring changes in mental health, health behaviors, executive function, emotion regulation, and mindfulness among vulnerable adolescents involved in a mentoring program during the COVID-19 pandemic. It also examined to what extent there were protective benefits of incorporating mindfulness training within a mentoring program for buffering adolescents from negative pandemic health effects. Thirty-five adolescents (M<sub>age</sub> = 12.9, 37% female) and 32 parents (M<sub>age</sub> = 44.75, 80% female) completed questionnaires at baseline (February 2020) and follow-up (July 2020). There were few significant reductions in health; instead, on average, youth reported improvements in sleep, emotion regulation, executive function, and mindfulness over time. Adolescents randomized to mentoring + mindfulness displayed significantly less posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomatology and emotional impulsivity at follow-up, compared to the mentoring-as-usual condition. These pilot findings suggest that mentoring with a mindfulness training component may offer an effective strategy for protecting adolescents from deteriorations in health outcomes during COVID-19. Further, there may be unique benefits of mindfulness training for vulnerable youth as a way to adapt to stressful events.

"The COVID-19 pandemic as a long-term school crisis: Impact, risk, resilience, and crisis management","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic presents school communities across the United States and world with an unpresented challenge. Virtually, all members of school communities have been impacted and the long-term ramifications of the pandemic remain unknown. However, despite being a novel virus, crisis management practices for other crisis (e.g., natural disasters, technological disasters, unexpected deaths) have utility for school safety promotion and helping affected individuals cope effectively with the monumental challenges they face during the pandemic. Such practices can reduce risk while fostering resilience concomitantly. This special issue, <i>Perspectives on COVID-19: Addressing Diverse Needs of Children, Youth, Families, Educators, and Human Service Professionals</i>, includes a diverse collection of conceptual, quantitative, and qualitative articles addressing the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on youth and their families, educators, allied human services professionals, and the systems in which they work. Consistent with a crisis management and risk and resilience perspectives, articles emphasize youth most vulnerable to the impact of COVID-19, including youth with disabilities, from minoritized backgrounds, and within underserved populations. Articles also have implications for coping, resilience, and intervention and focus on how service delivery can best meet the needs of those impacted by acute and chronic crisis events. The research and scholarship included in this special issue represents an important step forward with providing school psychologists and related professions with cutting-edge information that can help enhance their practice during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.

"COVID-19 anti-Asian racism and race-based stress: A phenomenological qualitative media analysis","News media has recently been replete with stories of anti-Asian rhetoric and racism related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Empirical literature, however, has yet to systematically analyze and document these experiences and their impact. Our study aimed to examine this phenomenon by analyzing news media coverage published between December 31, 2019-June 30, 2020 on COVID-related anti-Asian incidents. We utilized a phenomenological approach to conduct qualitative content analysis of 84 media articles reporting on coronavirus related anti-Asian incidents. We also present the emerging psychological framework of race-based stress and trauma to conceptualize the psychological impact of these race-based incidents reported in the media. Qualitative analysis revealed five primary themes: (a) pathologizing cultural practices; (b) alien in one's own land; (c) invalidation of interethnic differences; (d) ascription of diseased status; and (e) duality of frontline hero and virus carrier. We provide examples for each of these themes. These themes document stigmatizing narratives and demonstrate the phenomenology of race-based stress and trauma experienced by Asian individuals during the COVID era. We present potential implications for mental health of Asian individuals during and following the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as recommendations for future research.

"The impact of COVID-19 on the mental health and wellbeing of caregivers of autistic children and youth: A scoping review","Caregivers and families of autistic people have experienced stress and increase in demands due to the COVID-19 pandemic that may have long-term negative consequences for both their own and their children's mental health. A scoping review was conducted to identify pandemic related demands experienced by caregivers and families of autistic children and youth. The review also consolidated information on coping strategies and parenting-related guidelines that have emerged to help parents meet these demands. Search strategies were approved by a research librarian and were conducted in peer-reviewed and gray literature databases between May 2020 and February 2021. Additional resources were solicited through author networks and social media. All articles were published between December 2019 and February 2021. Article summaries were charted, and a thematic analysis was conducted with confirmation of findings with our knowledge users. Twenty-three published articles and 14 pieces of gray literature were included in the review. The majority of articles characterized and highlighted the increase in demands on caregivers of autistic children and youth during the pandemic globally. Both quantitative and qualitative studies suggest that parents have experienced an increase in stress and mental health-related symptoms during lockdown measures. Findings suggest that families are employing coping strategies, but there no evidence-based supports were identified. The review highlighted the potential long-term impact of prolonged exposure to increasing demands on the mental health and wellbeing of caregivers and families of autistic people, and pointed to a need for the rapid development and evaluation of flexible and timely support programs. LAY SUMMARY: Caregivers and families of autistic children and youth have faced increased demands due to pandemic-related lockdown measures. We reviewed the literature to outline sources of stress, links to their influence on caregiver mental health, and if support programs have emerged to help them. Our findings suggest a number of demands have increased caregivers' risk to mental health challenges, and their potential impact on family wellbeing.

"Analysis of the SPARK study COVID-19 parent survey: Early impact of the pandemic on access to services, child/parent mental health, and benefits of online services","Children with ASD receive a multitude of educational, medical, and therapeutic services. At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, all of these services came to a complete halt following strict lockdowns. Many services have resumed in a hybrid format using face to face and virtual modes of delivery. This study describes findings from the COVID-19 impact survey administered at the onset of the pandemic in a subgroup of families from the SPARK cohort (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 6393), one of the largest ASD cohorts in the US. The differential early impact of COVID-19 on various subgroups of children with ASD and their families was examined. Caregivers of children and adolescents with ASD between 19Ã¢â‚¬â€°months and 18Ã¢â‚¬â€°years completed an online survey inquiring about the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on access to services, parent concerns about the same, impact on child's ASD-related behaviors, child, and parent mental health, and the benefits/potential benefits of online/future online services. Analysis revealed that certain demographic (age, income/SES) and child-related factors (repetitive behaviors, language, functional, cognitive, and motor impairments, and child's understanding), as well as parent's past mental health were associated with/predicted greater service disruptions, greater ASD-related behaviors, and greater negative impact on parent mental health. In conclusion, younger children, children from low-income families, and children with greater impairment severity (more severe repetitive behaviors, language, cognitive, function, language, and motor impairments) were more negatively impacted by the pandemic through service disruptions, increased ASD-related behaviors, parent health/family impact, and found online interactions to be less beneficial. LAY SUMMARY: The SPARK study impact survey shows that at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, parents reported significant service disruptions, negative impact on their child's ASD-related behaviors as well as their own mental health; which was greater in families with younger children, children with greater ASD severity, and children from low-income families. Majority of families did not report significant benefits of online services whereas some families did. Low-income families were hopeful about receiving benefits through future online services. Overall, these findings have important implications for future clinical care delivery and healthcare policies to ensure that healthcare services are not interrupted during a potential resurgence of COVID-19 or other pandemics. A combination of in-person and online healthcare and family support services must be implemented to prevent negative health impacts in the future.","Bhat","https://doi.org/10.1002/aur.2618","20210930","ASD services; Autism Spectrum disorder; COVID-19; child health; online service benefits; parent health; unmet needs","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-01","",18469,""
"A Cross-Sectional Survey of the Workplace Factors Contributing to Symptoms of Anxiety and Depression Among Nurses and Physicians During the First Wave of COVID-19 Pandemic in Two US Healthcare Systems","Anxiety and depression among physicians and nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA are not well described and their modifiable causes are poorly understood. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of symptoms of anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) among physicians and nurses in two US healthcare systems in June through September 2020; participation rate was 5-10%. We described features of work as well as their perceptions and associated concerns in relation to the risk of anxiety and depression, while controlling for health history via regression and path analyses. About a third of 684 nurses and 185 physicians surveyed showed symptoms of anxiety or depression, and the excess of symptoms of mood disorders was particularly prominent in nurses. The belief that one was infected was a dominant correlate of both anxiety and depression. This belief was more associated with history of symptoms of pneumonia than the contact with COVID-19 diagnosed patients. Factors found to be associated with reduced anxiety and depression in this working environment were having confidence in the competent use of and access to personal protective equipment, maintaining usual working hours, being surrounded by colleagues who were both sufficient in numbers and not stressed, and the support of immediate family and religious communities. Involvement in aerosol-generating procedures with infected patients was linked with lower depression in nurses but higher among physicians. Likewise, the setting of recent patient encounters affected risk of anxiety and depression differently for physicians and nurses. Our findings may help develop mitigation measures and underscore the need to help nurses and physicians bear the psychological burden of the COVID-19 pandemic and similar events in the future.","Burstyn, Holt","https://doi.org/10.1093/annweh/wxab085","20210930","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; epidemic; epidemiology; healthcare workers; mental health; mood disorders; nurses; pandemic; physicians","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-01","",18470,""
"Keeping it human: Pandemic era psychiatry teaching","Mental health is an important global issue, and doctors in training need a grounding in the principles of psychiatry. Undergraduate clinical placements in psychiatry can develop core knowledge and skills as well as challenging stigma towards mental illness. The onset of the coronavirus pandemic saw disruption to undergraduate clinical placements. In a U.K. medical school, th e authors were tasked with transforming a 6-week clinical placement in psychiatry into a primarily online course. A 4-week online course was developed in preparation for a condensed clinical placement. A range of resources were drawn upon to address key learning objectives and to engage students in broader thinking about mental health. These included videos and blogs describing personal experiences of mental illness, as well as interviews with prominent psychiatrists. Peer- and tutor-led sessions complemented these self-directed elements and reduced social isolation. Sixty-seven students undertook the course, supported by eight consultant tutors. The content and structure of the course were highly rated; however, students indicated that peer group activities could benefit from further development. Students felt prepared for clinical placements and performed equally well in summative written examinations. Feedback indicated the development of positive attitudes towards mental health and illness. This course demonstrates how, even when clinical contact is challenged, a strong focus can be maintained on social elements of learning and patients' experiences of mental illness. This approach provides opportunities to develop essential knowledge and skills alongside broader attitudinal learning that may have a de-stigmatising effect.","Morris, Greenstone, Chute","https://doi.org/10.1111/tct.13415","20210930","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-01","",18471,""
"Effects of work conditions and organizational strategies on nurses' mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic","To examine coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic-related work factors for adverse effects on the mental health and whether organisational strategies attenuate these effects. COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased work burden and mental health risks for nurses. A total of 1499 Taiwanese full-time nurses completed a web-based questionnaire between July and December 2020. Pandemic-related work conditions, namely increased working hours, caring for COVID-19 patients, occupational stigma, and redeployment, were assessed. Organisational strategies to combat pandemic-related work stressors including compensation to workers and adequate protection equipment were surveyed. Outcome measures were intention to leave, burnout, and depression assessed using validated questionnaires. Redeployment, increased working hours, and occupational stigma were associated with adverse mental health and intention to leave in logistic regression analysis. Caring for COVID-19 patients was negatively associated with depression. Adequate compensation for workers modified the association between redeployment and burnout. Pandemic-related work conditions were associated with adverse mental health and intention to leave. Organizational strategies attenuated the adverse impact of the pandemic. Efforts to decrease stigma, and organizational strategies including compensation for workers and adequate protection equipment provision should be adopted to improve nurses' health during a pandemic.","Li, Pien, Kao, Kubo, Cheng","https://doi.org/10.1111/jonm.13485","20210930","burnout; healthcare workers; mental health; pandemic; stigma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-01","",18472,""
"Mental Images of Nurses Regarding COVID-19: A Metaphor Study","To understand the thoughts and perceptions of nurses caring for patients with COVID-19 diagnosis about the COVID-19 pandemic. The nursing profession, with the basic duty of caring for people, is among the professional groups most affected by COVID-19. The high rate of transmission of COVID-19, inadequate numbers of nurses for the increasing case numbers, inadequate personal protective equipment and increases in numbers of deaths negatively affected nurses, as they affected all health professionals. This research is phenomenological research. A parallel mixed design including quantitative and qualitative research methods was used in the research. A sociodemographic data form and metaphor perception related to the COVID-19 pandemic form were used for data collection. Responses of nurses to the open-ended metaphor questions were evaluated with descriptive analysis and content analysis using the document investigation method. The research was completed with 227 nurses. Most of the nurses were employed in COVID-19 wards (68.3%), were not diagnosed with COVID-19 (65.2%) and had not lost any relatives to COVID-19 (59.0%). It was determined that the answers given by the nurses comprised 151 metaphors collected in 8 categories in total. The results show that the metaphors mentioned by nurses involve hopelessness. This study reflects the ideas of nurses who are working with all their might during the COVID-19 pandemic and reveals the psychological status of the nurses.","Durgun, KÃƒÂ¶ktÃƒÂ¼rk DalcalÃ„Â±, Bayraktar","https://doi.org/10.1111/jonm.13482","20210930","COVID-19; mental image; metaphor; nursing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-01","",18473,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on psychological distress among SME owners in Ghana: Partial least square-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) approach","A critical part of the national economy is small and medium enterprises (SMEs). SME owners are vital contributors to the overall economy. Due to their limited capital and assets, they are more vulnerable. In comparison to their contribution, the value of assessing SME owner's depression, anxiety, and mental stress has been very minimal during the COVID-19 outbreak. Firms were forced to close due to lockdown, and they faced substantial business losses. Thus, this study aims to investigate SME owners' psychological distress due to business losses during this pandemic. The study used psychological parameters: Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) to examine SME owners' psychological distress. A total number of 217 owners were surveyed through a judgmental sampling technique using a structured questionnaire. Data were analyzed employing partial least square-based structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The findings showed that DASS-21 parameters and fear of business loss affected psychological distress. Besides, fear of business loss increases psychological distress, whereas government support lessens the distress. Theoretically, this study extended the scope of DASS-21 scale and contributed to the literature of psychology. In terms of policy implications, this study provides useful information for government, policymakers, and SME owners about the effects mentioned above.","Uzir, Bukari, Jerin, Hasan, Abdul Hamid, Thurasamy Ramayah","https://doi.org/10.1002/jcop.22716","20210930","COVID-19; DASS-21; Ghana; SME; business loss; government support; mental distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-01","",18474,""
"Is talk cheap? Correspondence between self-attributions about changes in drinking and longitudinal changes in drinking during the COVID-19 pandemic","There are concerns that the COVID-19 pandemic may increase drinking, however most accounts to date are cross-sectional studies of self-attributions about alcohol-related impacts and the accuracy of those perceptions has not been investigated. The current study examined the correspondence between self-attributions of pandemic-related changes in drinking and longitudinally measured changes in drinking and alcohol-related consequences in a sample of emerging adults. In an existing on-going longitudinal study on alcohol misuse (Ã¢â€°Â¥1 heavy episodic drinking day/month) in emerging adults, 473 individuals (Mage= 23.8; 41.7% male) received a supplemental assessment from June 17th to July 1st, 2020, during public health restrictions in Ontario, Canada. These intra-pandemic data were matched to the most recent assessment prior to the pandemic (~8-months earlier). Self-attributions about changes in drinking were assessed globally (i.e., increases/decreases/no change) and with higher-resolution questions clarifying the magnitude of changes. Global self-attributions about changes in drinking substantively paralleled longitudinal changes in weekly drinking days. In the longitudinal data, individuals self-reporting increases exhibited significant increases; individuals self-reporting decreases exhibited significant decreases; and individuals self-reporting no change exhibited non-significant changes. Higher resolution items likewise revealed longitudinal patterns of weekly drinking that were substantively consistent with self-attributions. Heavy drinking days and alcohol-related consequences exhibited similar patterns, but only individuals who self-reported large increases in drinking exhibited increases on these outcomes. Individuals who reported large increases in drinking also exhibited significant increases in depression and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. Self-attributions about drinking closely corresponded with longitudinal changes in drinking, supporting the validity of self-attributions in population-level surveys, particularly in young adults. Notably, a subgroup was identified that exhibited pronounced increases for all alcohol outcomes and concurrent increases in internalizing psychopathology.","Minhas, Belisario, Gonzalez-Roz, Halladay, Morris, Keough, Murphy, MacKillop","https://doi.org/10.1111/acer.14724","20210930","COVID-19; alcohol; emerging adults; self-report; validity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-01","",18475,""
"Chronic circadian phase advance in male mice induces depressive-like responses and suppresses neuroimmune activation","Altered working and sleeping schedules during the COVID-19 pandemic likely impact our circadian systems. At the molecular level, clock genes form feedback inhibition loops that control 24-hr oscillations throughout the body. Importantly, core clock genes also regulate microglia, the brain resident immune cell, suggesting circadian regulation of neuroimmune function. To assess whether circadian disruption induces neuroimmune and associated behavioral changes, we mimicked chronic jetlag with a chronic phase advance (CPA) model. 32 adult male C57BL/6J mice underwent 6-hr light phase advance shifts every 3 light/dark cycles (CPA) 14 times or were maintained in standard light/dark cycles (control). CPA mice showed higher behavioral despair but not anhedonia in forced swim and sucrose preferences tests, respectively. Changes in behavior were accompanied by altered hippocampal circadian genes in CPA mice. Further, CPA suppressed expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 beta in the hippocampus. Plasma corticosterone concentrations were elevated by CPA, suggesting that CPA may suppress neuroimmune pathways via glucocorticoids. These results demonstrate that chronic circadian disruption alters mood and neuroimmune function, which may have implications for shift working populations such as frontline health workers.","Chen, Weitzner, McKennon, Fonken","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2021.100337","20210930","Chronic phase advance; Circadian; HPA axis; Hippocampus; Mood; Neuroinflammation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-01","",18476,""

"One-Year Functional, Cognitive, and Psychological Outcomes Following the Use of Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation in Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Prospective Study","To prospectively describe 1-year outcomes, with a focus on functional outcome, cognitive outcome, and the burden of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder, in coronavirus disease 2019 patients managed with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Prospective case series. Tertiary extracorporeal membrane oxygenation center in the United States. Adult coronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory distress syndrome patients managed with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation March 1, 2020, to July 31, 2020. Baseline variables, treatment measures, and short-term outcomes were obtained from the medical record. Survivors were interviewed by telephone, a year following the index intensive care admission. Functional outcome was assessed using the modified Rankin Scale and the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Scale 2.0. Cognitive status was assessed with the 5-minute Montreal Cognitive Assessment. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was used to screen for anxiety and depression. Screening for post-traumatic stress disorder was performed with the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist 5 instrument. Twenty-three patients were managed with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, 14 (61%) survived to hospital discharge. Thirteen (57%) were alive at 1 year. One patient was dependent on mechanical ventilation, another intermittently required supplemental oxygen at 1 year. The median modified Rankin Scale score was 2 (interquartile range, 1-2), median World Health Organization Disability Assessment Scale 2.0 impairment score was 21% (interquartile range, 6-42%). Six of 12 previously employed individuals (50%) had returned to work, and 10 of 12 (83%) were entirely independent in activities of daily living. The median Montreal Cognitive Assessment score was 14 (interquartile range, 13-14). Of 10 patients assessed with Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, 4 (40%) screened positive for depression and 6 (60%) for anxiety. Four of 10 (40%) screened positive for post-traumatic stress disorder. Functional impairment was common a year following the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in coronavirus disease 2019, although the majority achieved independence in daily living and about half returned to work.

"Effects of Peer Mentoring for Caregivers of Patients With Acquired Brain Injury: A Preliminary Investigation of Efficacy","To evaluate effectiveness of a peer mentor intervention for caregivers of patients with acquired brain injury (ABI) in encouraging caregiver participation in support services to prepare them for the role of caregiving and in reducing caregiver stress and depression. Controlled trial with participants randomized to either usual care or 1-to-1 visits with a family caregiver peer mentor during the ABI inpatient rehabilitation stay. Nonprofit rehabilitation hospital specializing in care of persons with brain and spinal cord injury. Caregivers (N=36) of patients with ABI admitted for rehabilitation whose discharge location was home with care provided by family members (caregivers: 93% female; 58% White; mean age, 48Ã‚Â±10.4y). One-to-one peer mentoring visits during the inpatient stay with a trained peer mentor who is also a family caregiver of a survivor of brain injury. Frequency of participation in support services for family caregivers, reported caregiver stress, and reported caregiver depressive symptoms. There was no difference between groups in participation in support services for family caregivers. Participants in the peer mentor intervention group reported significantly greater improvement in caregiver stress at discharge and 30 days post discharge than participants in the usual care group. Reported depressive symptoms were also lower for the intervention group, but change scores did not achieve statistical significance at discharge or 30-day follow-up. Peer mentoring appears to improve caregivers' ability to handle the stress of caregiving and reduces reported depressive symptoms. There was no between-group difference noted in participation in support services for families; however, participation was adversely affected by restrictions imposed during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, which may have masked any effect.","Jones, Holley, Jacobs, Batchelor, Mangin","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arrct.2021.100149","20210930","Brain injuries; Caregivers; Rehabilitation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-01","",18479,""

The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) with 95% confidence intervals and Bland-Altman plots were used as measures of reliability. To assess generalizability, ICCs were further evaluated by health conditions (type 2 diabetes, arthritis, obesity, depression). Assessments were conducted among 55 participants. The ICC was above 0.98 for all 3 tests across health conditions and Bland-Altman plots indicated that there were no significant systematic errors in the measurement.

"PSYCHOSOCIAL IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON STUDENTS AT INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING","Students at higher institutions of learning are more susceptible to psychosocial problems compared to the general public. These may further be exacerbated by the measures put in place to curb the spread of COVID-19. This mixed methods study examined the factors associated with the psychosocial impact of COVID-19 on students' financial stability, interpersonal relationships and worries related to achieving academic milestones. Data comprised of a series of closed and open-ended questions collected via Qualtrics from students in the United States and Africa (Central and West). The quantitative data were analyzed using frequency counts, percentages and chi-square, while the qualitative data was analyzed using thematic content analysis. More than 90% of the students resided in the United States, 72.5% were females and 78.4% were undergraduates. Financial hardship was experienced by 26.4% of the students, 55.8% indicated that COVID-19 negatively affected their relationship with friends and over 40% worried over delays in achieving academic milestones. Continent of residence, employment status and financial hardship were significantly associated with the negative impact of COVID-19 on one or more of the students' relationships and with worries about achieving academic milestones. Qualitative data support the findings that financial hardship contributed to experience of psychological distress by students. It also revealed negative (compromised relationships - broken or fractured relationships and loneliness) and positive (bonding) impact of COVID-19 on interpersonal relationships.

"Pain experience and mood disorders during the lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States: an opportunistic study","The unknown and uncontrollable situation of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may have triggered changes in pain, anxiety, and depression along with a perception of nonspecific COVID-19 symptoms. We determined how anxiety, depression, and pain outcomes varied during the ""Stay-at-Home"" order compared with the prepandemic period and whether nonspecific COVID-19 symptoms would occur. We conducted an online survey to opportunistically reassess clinical anxiety, depression, pain intensity, and pain interference while controlling for somatic symptom severity during the prepandemic and Stay-at-Home order period. During the Stay-at-Home period, anxiety, depression, pain intensity, and pain interference were reassessed. Coping strategies were assessed as a critical factor influencing pain behaviors. In addition, we explored the occurrence of nonspecific COVID-19 symptoms with an ad hoc survey referencing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention publicly available COVID-19 symptoms. We observed a significant increase in depression and anxiety levels during the Stay-at-Home period. Coping strategy changes (eg, increased exercise) were linked to lower pain severity and interference which improved overall. Participants who self-reported nonspecific COVID-19 symptoms had higher prepandemic depression. Among the 72 participants not diagnosed with COVID-19, 70.8% of the participants experienced symptoms resembling those associated with COVID-19. We suggest the parallel between pain outcome improvement and worsening anxiety and depression during the Stay-at-Home order might reflect a shift in symptoms, indicating that those patients with underlying mood disorders may require more help than they did before the pandemic.","Colloca, Thomas, Yin, Haycock, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1097/PR9.0000000000000958","20210930","Expectations; Illness behaviors; Mood disorder; Nocebo; Temporomandibular disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-01","",18482,""
"Association of Working Environment and Anxiety Levels in Clinical Professionals During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic and has become a major life-threatening challenge. The sudden and fast spreadÃ‚Â of the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide caused a sudden increase in the workload of health care workers in parallel with the possible increase in mortality rates and the spread of this disease to a large number of people. Clinicians, who are our frontline warriors, are not only at high risk of catching COVID-19, but their mental health is also at stake. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of anxiety and its association with the working environment in clinical professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This cross-sectional study collected data from 400 medical doctors through an online survey, carried out for six months. The anxiety of participants was assessed by using the Zung Self Rating anxiety scale (SAS). An anxiety index of greater than or equal to 50 was marked as anxious. Descriptive chi-square analysis and correlation analysis were used. Results This study found that out of a total, 20.1% of the participants suffered from anxiety. Anxiety was found to be positively associated with sociodemographic factors like the age of the doctor (p=0.001), their gender (p=0.000), their working environment (p=0.005), working in basic healthcare units (p=0.015), patient load per week (p=0.005), personal protective equipment (PPE) availability to doctor according to WHO guidelines (p=0.007), and patient compliance with doctors' orders (p=0.009). Conclusion We conclude that professional healthcare workers suffered from anxiety due to working conditions in the COVID-19 pandemic. Specific interventions and steps such as improving staffing and resources, policies to ensure fair distribution of working hours and rest breaks, workplace protections, work-family balance, health professional's emotional stability, and long-term benefits should be taken so as to minimize the lasting effects of these factors.","Azhar, Mahmood, Hasan, Tauseef, Shahzad, Tarin","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.17450","20210930","anxiety; clinical professionals; covid-19; working environment; zung anxiety scale","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-01","",18483,""
"Remdesivir use and outcomes during the FDA COVID-19 emergency use authorization period","Remdesivir (RDV) was approved for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), in May 2020 under US Food and Drug Administration emergency use authorization (EUA). Clinical outcomes related to RDV use in hospitalized patients during the EUA period are not well described. We conducted a retrospective study of patients who received RDV under EUA. The primary outcome was clinical recovery by day 14 as determined by an eight-category ordinal scale. Secondary outcomes included recovery and survival to day 28, and adverse events. Recovery and survival were calculated using a stratified log-rank Kaplan-Meier estimator and a Cox proportional hazards model. Overall, 164 patients received RDV between May and October 2020, and 153 (93.3%) had evaluable data. Most (77.1%) were hospitalized within 10Ã¢â‚¬â€°days of symptom onset, and 79.7% started RDV within 48Ã¢â‚¬â€°hours. By days 14 and 28, 96 (62.7%) and 117 patients (76.5%) met the definition of clinical recovery, respectively. Median time to recovery was 6Ã¢â‚¬â€°days [interquartile range (IQR) 4-12]. Mortality rates were 6.5% and 11.8% by days 14 and 28, respectively. Age and time to start of RDV after hospital admission were predictive of recovery and 28-day mortality. In this real-world experience, outcomes after 5Ã¢â‚¬â€°days of RDV therapy were comparable to those of clinical trials. Disease severity, age, and dexamethasone use influenced clinical outcomes. Time to RDV initiation appeared to affect recovery and 28-day mortality, a finding that should be explored further. Mortality rate decreased over the analysis period, which could be related to dexamethasone use and improved management of COVID-19.","Elshaboury, Monk, Bebell, Bidell, Adamsick, Gandhi, Paras, Hohmann, Letourneau","https://doi.org/10.1177/20499361211046669","20210930","COVID-19; coronavirus; emergency use authorization (EUA); outcomes; remdesivir","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-01","",18484,""
"COVID-19-Related Daily Stress Processes in College-Aged Adults: Examining the Role of Depressive Symptom Severity","Exposure to daily stressors specific to the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., threat of infection) is associated with emotional distress, heightened stress reactivity, and increased depressive symptomology. Herein, we examined whether current depressive symptomology modulates the association between COVID-19-related daily stressor exposure and negative affective reactivity in young, otherwise healthy, college-aged adults. Fifty-eight adults (21 men; 22Ã‚Â±3years) completed a daily web-based interview for eight consecutive days to assess COVID-19-related daily stress exposure and emotional responsiveness (September-November 2020). Depressive symptom severity was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and a score of Ã¢â€°Â¥10 (range: 0-27) was used to define adults with a depressive episode (<i>n</i>=20). Participants reported at least one COVID-19-related stressor on 35.8% of interview days. Depressive symptomology did not predict the likelihood of exposure to a COVID-19-related stressor (<i>p</i>=0.46; OR=1.52; 95% CI: 0.492-4.718). However, negative affect (NA) was greater on days with an exposure to any COVID-19-specific daily stressor in adults with moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms (<i>b</i>=0.28, SE=0.093, <i>p</i>=0.003) but not in those without (<i>b</i>=0.009, SE=0.074, <i>p</i>=0.90), such that negative affective reactivity to COVID-19-related stressors was amplified in adults with a current depressive episode (<i>p</i>=0.019). Depressive symptomology did not moderate positive affective reactivity (<i>p</i>=0.686). Taken together, these data suggest that exposure to daily stressors related to COVID-19 further worsens NA in adults with a current depressive episode, potentially rendering them more susceptible to adverse mental health outcomes during the pandemic.","Greaney, Darling, Turner, Saunders, Almeida, Mogle","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.693396","20210930","COVID-19 pandemic; daily stress; depression; mood; negative affect","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-01","",18485,""
"Characteristics of Adaptation in Undergraduate University Students Suddenly Exposed to Fully Online Education During the COVID-19 Pandemic","This study aimed to clarify the adaptation features of University students exposed to fully online education during the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and to identify accompanying mental health problems and predictors of school adaptation. The pandemic has forced many universities to transition rapidly to delivering online education. However, little is known about the impact of this drastic change on students' school adaptation. This cross-sectional study used an online questionnaire, including assessments of impressions of online education, study engagement, mental health, and lifestyle habits. In total, 1,259 students were assessed. The characteristics of school adaptation were analyzed by a two-step cluster analysis. The proportion of mental health problems was compared among different groups based on a cluster analysis. A logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of cluster membership. <i>P</i>-values &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The two-step cluster analysis determined three clusters: school adaptation group, school maladaptation group, and school over-adaptation group. The last group significantly exhibited the most mental health problems. Membership of this group was significantly associated with being female (OR = 1.42; 95% CI 1.06-1.91), being older (OR = 1.21; 95% CI 1.01-1.44), those who considered online education to be less beneficial (OR = 2.17; 95% CI 1.64-2.88), shorter sleep time on weekdays (OR = 0.826; 95% CI 0.683-.998), longer sleep time on holidays (OR = 1.21; 95% CI 1.03-1.43), and worse restorative sleep (OR = 2.27; 95% CI 1.81-2.86). The results suggest that academic staff should understand distinctive features of school adaptation owing to the rapid transition of the educational system and should develop support systems to improve students' mental health. They should consider ways to incorporate online classes with their lectures to improve students' perceived benefits of online education. Additionally, educational guidance on lifestyle, such as sleep hygiene, may be necessary.","Ishimaru, Adachi, Nagahara, Shirai, Takemura, Takemura, Mehrasa, Higashino, Yagi, Ikeda","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.731137","20210930","COVID-19; University students; mental health; online learning; school adaptation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-01","",18486,""
"How our Dreams Changed During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Effects and Correlates of Dream Recall Frequency - a Multinational Study on 19,355 Adults","Many have reported odd dreams during the pandemic. Given that dreams are associated with mental health, understanding these changes could provide crucial information about wellbeing during the pandemic. This study explored associations between COVID-19 and dream recall frequency (DRF), and related social, health, and mental health factors. We conducted a cross-sectional web survey of 19,355 individuals in 14 countries from May to July 2020. We collected data on COVID-19, mental health, sleep and DRF during the pandemic. We performed McNemar Tests to compare low (&lt;3 nights per week) and high DRF (Ã¢â€°Â¥3 nights per week) before and during COVID-19 and to evaluate changes in sleep variables segmented by DRF. Chi-square tests were conducted to compare characteristics between low and high DRF. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine associations between various independent variables and DRF. Reports of high DRF during the pandemic were higher than before the pandemic (P&lt;0.001). Female gender (aOR=1.25, 95% CI 1.10-1.41), nightmares (aOR=4.22, 95% CI 3.45-5.17), sleep talking (aOR= 2.36, 1.73-3.23), sleep maintenance problems (aOR=1.34, 95% CI 1.15-1.56), symptoms of REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD; aOR=1.24, 95% CI 1.09-1.41) and repeated disturbing thoughts (posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms) were associated with high DRF. Age group 55-64 years (aOR=0.69, 95% CI 0.58-0.83) reported less high DRF than younger participants. Unadjusted OR showed associations between depression, anxiety, and DRF; however, in adjusted regression depression (aOR= 0.71, 0.59-0.86) and anxiety (aOR=0.79, 95% CI 0.66-0.94) were negatively associated with high DRF. DRF was higher than pre-pandemic levels across four continents. DRF was associated with gender and parasomnias like nightmares and RBD symptoms, sleep maintenance problems, PTSD symptoms and negatively associated with depression and anxiety. The results implicate that COVID-19 is reflected in our dreams as an expression of the emotional intensity of the pandemic.","FrÃƒÂ¤nkl, Scarpelli, Nadorff, Bjorvatn, Bolstad, Chan, Chung, Dauvilliers, Espie, Inoue, Leger, MacÃƒÂªdo, Matsui, Merikanto, Morin, Mota-Rolim, Partinen, Penzel, Plazzi, Sieminski, Wing, De Gennaro, Holzinger","https://doi.org/10.2147/NSS.S324142","20210930","collective threat; mental health; parasomnia; sleep; sleep disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-01","",18487,""

"Virtual reality for relatives of ICU patients to improve psychological sequelae: study protocol for a multicentre, randomised controlled trial","Intensive care unit (ICU) admission of a relative might lead to psychological distress and complicated grief (post-intensive care syndrome-family; PICS-F). Evidence suggests that increased distress during ICU stay increases risk of PICS-F, resulting in difficulty returning to their normal lives after the ICU experience. Effective interventions to improve PICS-F are currently lacking. In the present trial, we hypothesised that information provision using ICU-specific Virtual Reality for Family members/relatives (ICU-VR-F) may improve understanding of the ICU and subsequently improve psychological well-being and quality of life in relatives of patients admitted to the ICU. This multicentre, clustered randomised controlled trial will be conducted from January to December 2021 in the mixed medical-surgical ICUs of four hospitals in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. We aim to include adult relatives of 160 ICU patients with an expected ICU length of stay over 72 hours. Participants will be randomised clustered per patient in a 1:1 ratio to either the intervention or control group. Participants allocated to the intervention group will receive ICU-VR-F, an information video that can be watched in VR, while the control group will receive usual care. Initiation of ICU-VR-F will be during their hospital visit unless participants cannot visit the hospital due to COVID-19 regulations, then VR can be watched digitally at home. The primary objective is to study the effect of ICU-VR-F on psychological well-being and quality of life up to 6 months after the patients' ICU discharge. The secondary outcome is the degree of understanding of ICU treatment and ICU modalities. The Medical Ethics Committee of the Erasmus Medical Centre, Rotterdam, the Netherlands, approved the study and local approval was obtained from each participating centre (NL73670.078.20). Our findings will be disseminated by presentation of the results at (inter)national conferences and publication in scientific, peer-reviewed journals.

"Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in next of kin during suspension of ICU visits during the COVID-19 pandemic: a prospective observational study","During the COVID-19 pandemic, suspension of visits by next of kin to patients in intensive care units (ICU), to prevent spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has been a common practice. This could impede established family-centered care and may affect the mental health of the next of kin. The aim of this study was to explore symptoms of post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD) in the next of kin of ICU patients. In this prospective observational single-center study, next of kin of ICU patients were interviewed by telephone, using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), to assess symptoms of acute stress disorder during the ICU stay and PTSD symptoms at 3Ã¢â‚¬â€°months after the ICU stay. The primary outcome was the prevalence of severe PTSD symptoms (IES-R scoreÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°33) at 3Ã¢â‚¬â€°months. The secondary outcomes comprised the IES-R scores during the ICU stay, at 3Ã¢â‚¬â€°months, and the prevalence of severe symptoms of acute stress disorder during ICU stay. An inductive content analysis was performed of the next of kin's comments regarding satisfaction with patient care and the information they were given. Of the 411 ICU patients admitted during the study period, 62 patients were included together with their next of kin. An IES-R scoreÃ‚Â &gt;Ã‚Â 33 was observed in 90.3% (56/62) of next of kin during the ICU stay and in 69.4% (43/62) 3Ã¢â‚¬â€°months later. The median IES-R score was 49 (IQR 40-61) during the ICU stay and 41 (IQR 30-55) at 3Ã¢â‚¬â€°months. The inductive content analysis showed that communication/information (55%), support (40%), distressing emotions (32%), and suspension of ICU visits (24%) were mentioned as relevant aspects by the next of kin. During the suspension of ICU visits in the COVID-19 pandemic, high prevalence and severity of both symptoms of acute stress disorder during the ICU stay and PTSD symptoms 3Ã¢â‚¬â€°months later were observed in the next of kin of ICU patients.","Zante, Erne, Grossenbacher, Camenisch, Schefold, Jeitziner","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03468-9","20210930","Critical care; Mental distress; Post intensive care syndromeÃ¢â‚¬â€œfamily; Psychological disease; Relatives; Stress disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-01","",18490,""
"COVID-19 in pediatrics: The current knowledge and practice","SARS-CoV-2 is the novel coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome and could afflict individuals from all walks of life. Children are usually asymptomatic or represent non-specific mild to moderate symptoms; therefore, they often remain undiagnosed and could be potential reservoirs and silent carriers of the virus. Despite the global attention to COVID-19 and its importance in public health, some clinical and paraclinical aspects of this disease in children are still unclear. Thus, we conducted a comprehensive systematic review of available literature to reflect on the current knowledge and practice of the disease among children. This study was a systematic review of current evidence conducted in October 2020. We performed a systematic search using the keywords in online databases. The investigation adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist to ensure the reliability and validity of extracted literature and results. We selected and reviewed 23 most related studies out of 1744 identified paper in an initial online search based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the present review; of whom, 13 were original research studies, and 10 were a letter to the editors, commentaries, viewpoints, consensus statements, and perspectives. Although due to the origin of the current pandemic, China was the country with the most publications (14 articles), data from several countries have beenincluded in this review. COVID-19 can also affect children and cause systemic disease with several internal organ involvements. However, the prevalence, severity, and diversity of the symptoms in children are less than in adults. Cough and fever appear to be some of the most common symptoms, followed by other symptoms such as gastrointestinal manifestations. Comorbidities increase the risk of severe COVID-19 in children, and those without underlying conditions are very unlikely to suffer from severe disease. Mental health issues such as anxiety and depression due to the isolated situation caused by pandemics are common findings in children of early ages and should be seriously considered in current practice.","Mehraeen, Oliaei, SeyedAlinaghi, Karimi, Mirzapour, Afsahi, Barzegary, Vahedi, Soleymanzadeh, Behnezhad, Javaherian, Zargari, Mirghaderi, Noori, Sabatier","https://doi.org/10.2174/1871526521666210929121705","20210930","COVID-19; Children; Coronavirus; Morbidity; Mortality; Pediatrics; Prognosis; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-01","",18491,""

"The associations between metacognition problems, childhood trauma and internalizing symptoms in healthcare workers working directly with patients infected with COVID-19","Healthcare workers (HCWs) providing medical support while facing one of the highest levels of adverse and potentially fatal outcomes due to COVID-19 are put in a vulnerable position leading to the development of mental health problems. The development of any prevention and intervention programs to reduce this risk is possible with better understanding and knowledge of possible vulnerability factors. The aim of the present study is to investigate psychological effect of working directly with patients infected with COVID-19 (WD) and possible individual vulnerability factors for the development of psychological problems in HCWs. The data used in this cross-sectional study were collected using online self-reported questionnaires from 290 HCWs aged 21-61Ã‚Â years old. The mean score of the scales of 145 HCWs-WD and 145 HCWs not WD (HCWs-NWD) were compared by independent sample t test. Associations between childhood traumas, metacognitive dysfunctional beliefs and internalizing symptoms were analyzed using structural equation modelling (SEM). The depression, anxiety, stress symptoms levels, somatization and sleep problem levels were found to be higher in HCWs-WD compared to HCWs-NWD. SEM revealed that childhood trauma levels was associated with the increased risk of internalizing problems, and metacognitive dysfunctional beliefs had a partial mediator role between childhood traumas and internalizing symptoms in HCWs-WD. Improving metacognitive abilities may hence need to be considered in prevention programs for the HCWs. The findings can also be used to set up further research on the specific interventions on the HCWs who are at a risk as their profession entails them being in such traumatic situations.","Sen Demirdogen, Algedik, Warikoo, BahadÃ„Â±r, Akbiyik, BÃƒÂ¼yÃƒÂ¼ktarakÃƒÂ§Ã„Â±, Kadak, Yavuz","https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2021.1985147","20210930","COVID-19; healthcare workers; internalizing symptoms; metacognition; trauma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-01","",18493,""

"Decision-making by laypersons equipped with an emergency response smartphone app for opioid overdose","Background Targeted naloxone distribution to potential lay responders increases the timeliness of overdose response and reduces mortality. Little is known, however, about the patterns of decision-making among overdose lay responders. This study explored heuristic decision-making among laypersons equipped with an emergency response smartphone app. Methods UnityPhilly, a smartphone app that connects lay responders equipped with naloxone to overdose victims, was piloted in Philadelphia from March 2019 to February 2020. Participants used the app to signal overdose alerts to peer app users and emergency medical services, or respond to alerts by arriving at overdose emergency sites. This study utilised in-depth interviews, background information, and app use data from a sample of 18 participants with varying histories of opioid use and levels of app use activity. Results The sample included 8 people who used opioids non-medically in the past 30 days and 10 people reporting no opioid misuse. Three prevailing, not mutually exclusive, heuristics were identified. The heuristic of unconditional signalling (â€œAlways signal for help or backupâ€) was used by 7 people who valued external assistance and used the app as a replacement for a 911 call; this group had the highest number of signalled alerts and on-scene appearances. Nine people, who expressed confidence in their ability to address an overdose themselves, followed a heuristic of conditional signalling (â€œRescue, but only signal if necessaryâ€); these participants had the highest frequency of prior naloxone administrations. Eleven participants used the heuristic of conditional responding (â€œAssess if I can make a differenceâ€), addressing an alert if they carried naloxone, were nearby, or received a signal before dark hours. Conclusion The deployment of specific heuristics was influenced by prior naloxone use and situational factors. Success of overdose prevention interventions assisted by digital technologies may depend on the involvement of people with diverse overdose rescue backgrounds.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2021.103250","20210901","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-01","",18496,""
