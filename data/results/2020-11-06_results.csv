"How has Covid-19 affected mental health nurses and the delivery of mental health nursing care in the UK? Results of a mixed methods study","Introduction: While evidence has emerged concerning the impact of Covid-19 on the general population and the challenges facing health services, much less is known regarding how the pandemic has directly affected the delivery of mental health nursing care. Aim: This paper aims to explore how Covid-19 has affected the ability of mental health nurses to deliver care in community and inpatient mental health services in the UK. Method: We investigated staff reports regarding the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on mental healthcare and mental health service users in the UK, using a mixed methods online survey. A total of 897 nurses across a range of inpatient and community settings participated. Discussion: Key themes within the data explore: new ways of working; remote working; risks of infection/infection control challenges; and the impact on service users. Targeted guidelines are required to support mental health nurses providing care and support during a pandemic to people in severe mental distress, often in unsuitable environments. Implications for Practice: Service developments need to occur alongside tailored guidance and support for staff welfare supported by clear leadership. These findings identify areas requiring attention and investment to prepare for future crises and the consequences of the pandemic.","Una Foye; Christian Dalton-Locke; Jasmine Harju-Seppanen; Rebecca Lane; Lewys Beams; Norha Vera San Juan; Sonia Johnson; Alan Simpson","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.05.20226472","20201106","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-06","",6826,""
"Effect of a Mobile-based Intervention on Mental Health in Frontline Healthcare Workers Against COVID-19: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial","Aim: To evaluate the impact of a psychoeducational, mobile health intervention based on cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness-based approaches on the mental health of healthcare workers at the frontline against COVID-19 in Spain. Design: We will carry out a two-week, individually randomised, parallel group, controlled trial. Participants will be individually randomised to receive the PsyCovidApp intervention or control App intervention. Methods: The PsyCovidApp intervention will include five modules: emotional skills, lifestyle behaviour, work stress and burnout, social support, and practical tools. Healthcare workers having attended COVID-19 patients will be randomized to receive the PsyCovidApp intervention (intervention group) or a control App intervention (control group). A total of 440 healthcare workers will be necessary to assure statistical power. Measures will be collected telephonically by a team of psychologists at baseline and immediately after the two weeks intervention period. Measures will include stress, depression and anxiety (DASS-21 questionnaire - primary endpoint), insomnia (ISI), burnout (MBI-HSS), post-traumatic stress disorder (DTS), and self-efficacy (GSE). The study was funded in May 2020, and was ethically approved in June 2020. Trial participants, outcome assessors and data analysts will be blinded to group allocation. Discussion: Despite the increasing use of mobile health interventions to deliver mental health care, this area of research is still on its infancy. This study will help increase the scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of this type of intervention on this specific population and context. Impact: Despite the lack of solid evidence about their effectiveness, mobile-based health interventions are already being widely implemented because of their low cost and high scalability. The findings from this study will help health services and organizations to make informed decisions in relation to the development and implementation of this type of interventions, allowing them pondering not only their attractive implementability features, but also empirical data about its benefits.","Maria J Serrano-Ripoll; Ignacio Ricci Cabello; Rafael Jimenez; Rocio Zamanillo-Campos; Aina M Yanez Juan; Miquel Bennasar-Veny; Carolina Sitges; Elena Gervilla; Alfonso Leiva; Javier Garcia-Campayo; Esther Garcia-Buades; Mauro Garcia-Toro; Guadalupe Pastor-Moreno; Isabel Ruiz-Perez; Pablo Alonso-Coello; Joan Llobera-Canaves; Maria A Fiol-DeRoque","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.03.20225102","20201106","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-06","",6827,""
"Psychological resilience, coping behaviors, and social support among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review of quantitative studies","Background: A wide range of evidence has shown that healthcare workers, currently on the frontlines in the fight against COVID-19, are not spared from the psychological and mental health-related consequences of the pandemic. Studies synthesizing the role of coping behaviours, psychological resilience, and social support in safeguarding the mental health of HCWs during the pandemic is largely unknown. Aim (s): To appraise and synthesize studies examining psychological resilience, coping behaviours, and social support among healthcare workers (HWCs) during the coronavirus pandemic. Design: This is a systematic review with a narrative synthesis. Method: Using articles from PubMed, CINAHL, SCOPUS, MEDLINE and PsychINFO, a total of 31 articles were included in the review. Reporting followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement guidelines. Results: Healthcare workers were found to have moderate to high levels of psychological resilience and utilized both problem-centred coping (e.g., use of social support, praying) and emotion-centred coping (e.g., use of diversionary activities) to manage the stress-associated with the coronavirus pandemic. Coping behaviours, psychological resilience, and social support were associated with positive mental and psychological health outcomes. Conclusion: Substantial evidence supports the effectiveness of coping behaviours, psychological resilience, and social support to preserve psychological and mental health among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Relevance to Practice: In order to safeguard the mental health and well-being of HCWs during the pandemic, hospital and nursing administrators should focus on building coping skills, psychological resilience, and social support in HWCs through innovative and theory-based interventions, supportive leadership, and fostering a resilient work environment.","Leodoro Labrague","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.05.20226415","20201106","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-06","",6828,""
"What support do frontline workers want? A qualitative study of health and social care workers experiences and views of psychosocial support during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background. The COVID-19 pandemic has placed a significant burden on the mental health and wellbeing of frontline health and social care workers. The need to support frontline staff has been recognised. However, there is to date little research specifically on how best to support the mental health needs of frontline workers, and none on their own experiences and views about what might be most helpful. Aims. We set out to redress this research gap by qualitatively exploring UK frontline health and social care workers own experiences and views of psychosocial support during the pandemic. Method. Frontline health and social care workers were recruited purposively through social media and by snowball sampling via healthcare colleagues. Workers who volunteered to take part in the study were interviewed remotely following a semi-structured interview guide. Transcripts of the interviews were analysed by the research team following the principles of Reflexive Thematic Analysis. Results. We conducted 25 interviews with frontline workers from a variety of professional groups working in health and social care settings across the UK. Themes derived from our analysis showed that workers experiences and views about psychosocial support were complex. Peer support was many workers first line of support but could also be experienced as a burden. Workers were ambivalent about support shown by organisations, media and the public. Whilst workers valued psychological support services, there were many disparities in provision and barriers to access. Conclusions. The results of this study show that frontline health and social care workers are likely to need a flexible system of support including peer, organisational and professional support. More research is needed to fully unpack the structural, systemic and individual barriers to accessing psychosocial support. Greater collaboration, consultation and co-production of support services and their evaluation is warranted.

"Does greenery experienced indoors and outdoors provide an escape and support mental health during the COVID-19 quarantine?","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly changed peopleâ€™s ability to recreate in public green spaces, which is likely to exacerbate the psychological impacts of the pandemic  In the current study, we seek to understand whether greenery can support mental health even with insufficient outdoor exposure in times of physical isolation from the outdoor environment  Methods Between 17 May and 10 June 2020, we conducted an online survey among 323 students (21 99 Â± 3 10 years;31% male) in health-related programs from two universities in the city of Plovdiv, Bulgaria  Severities of depressive and anxiety symptoms over the past two weeks were measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale  We employed two self-reported measures of greenery experienced indoors (number of houseplants in the home and proportion of exterior greenery visible from inside the home) and two measures of greenery experienced outdoors (presence/absence of a domestic garden and availability of neighborhood greenery)  Restorative quality of the home (the ""being away"" dimension of the Perceived Restorativeness Scale;PRS) and the neighborhood (the â€œbeing awayâ€ and â€œfascinationâ€ dimensions of the PRS), engagement with outdoor greenery (frequency of different types of interaction) and perceived social support were treated as mediators  Associations between greenery and mental health were tested using generalized linear regression and logistic regression  Structural equation modelling (SEM) techniques were used to test the theoretically-indicated relations among the variables  Results Clinically-meaningful symptoms of moderate depression and anxiety were reported by approximately 33% and 20% of the students, respectively  The relative abundance of greenery visible from the home or in the neighborhood was associated with reduced depressive/anxiety symptoms and lower depression/anxiety rates  Having more houseplants or a garden was also associated with some of these markers of mental health  As hypothesized, the mental health-supportive effects of indoor greenery were largely explained by increased feelings of being away while at home  Neighborhood greenery contributed to neighborhood restorative quality, which in turn facilitated social support and more frequent engagement with greenery, and that led to better mental health  Conclusions Students who spent most of their time at home during the COVID-19 epidemic experienced better mental health when exposed to more greenery  Our findings support the idea that exposure to greenery may be a valuable resource during social isolation in the home  However, no causal interpretation of these associations is possible","Dzhambov, Angel M.; Lercher, Peter, Browning, Matthew H.

"Social Isolation and Psychological Distress During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-National Analysis","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic resulted in social isolation globally, creating heightened levels of stress and anxiety. This study investigates the link between social isolation and mental well-being in later life, and how it varies across countries. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We draw on a subset of older adults from Global Behaviors and Perceptions in the COVID-19 pandemic, a unique global online survey of 13,660 participants from 62 countries. We use mixed-effects models to analyze the data. RESULTS: Social isolation (distancing) significantly predicts poor mental health operationalized as coronavirus-induced distress (p < 0.01). At the aggregate level, average distress varies positively across countries with higher numbers of coronavirus-related deaths (p < 0.10) and more fragile state capacity (p < 0.05), while varying negatively across those with more stringent anti-coronavirus policies (p < 0.05). Finally, we report several cross-level interactions between social isolation and the total number of deaths (p = 0.025), policy stringency (p =0.065), state fragility (p = 0.061), and globalization index (p = 0.071).

Objective: To examine levels of severity of depressive symptoms over time among individuals with high risk in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study is part of an ongoing large panel study of adults aged 18 years and older residing in the UK, the COVID-19 Social Study, established on March 21, 2020. Data analysis was conducted in May 2020. Exposures: Sociodemographic risk factors included belonging to the Black, Asian, and minority racial/ethnic communities, low socioeconomic position (SEP), and essential worker roles (eg, workers in health and social care, education, childcare, or key public services). Health-related and psychosocial risk factors included preexisting physical and mental health conditions, experience of psychological or physical abuse, and low social support. Main Outcomes and Measures: Depressive symptoms were measured on 7 occasions from March 21 to April 2, 2020, using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Group-based depressive symptom trajectories were derived using latent growth mixture modeling. Results: The analytical sample comprised 51Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯417 adults aged 18 years and older (mean [SD] age, 48.8 [16.8] years; 26Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯276 [51.1%] women; 6145 members [12.0%] of Black, Asian, and minority racial/ethnic communities).

After adjusting for covariates, experiences of physical or psychological abuse (odds ratio [OR], 13.16; 95% CI, 12.95-13.37; P < .001), preexisting mental health conditions (OR, 12.99; 95% CI, 12.87-13.11; P < .001), preexisting physical health conditions (OR, 3.41; 95% CI, 3.29-3.54; P < .001), low social support (OR, 12.72; 95% CI, 12.57-12.86; P < .001), and low SEP (OR, 5.22; 95% CI, 5.08-5.36; P < .001) were significantly associated with severe depressive symptoms. No significant association was found for race/ethnicity (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.85-1.28; P = .56). Participants with essential worker roles were less likely to experience severe depressive symptoms (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.53-0.80; P < .001). Similar patterns of associations were found for the group of participants with moderate depressive symptoms (abuse: OR, 5.34; 95% CI, 5.15-5.54; P < .001; mental health condition: OR, 4.24; 95% CI, 4.24-4.24; P < .001; physical health condition: OR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.80-1.98; P < .001; low social support: OR, 4.71; 95% CI, 4.60-4.82; P < .001; low SEP: OR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.87-2.08; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of UK adults participating in the COVID-19 Social Study, people with psychosocial and health-related risk factors, as well as those with low SEP, were at the most risk of experiencing moderate or severe depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Iob, Eleonora; Frank, Philipp; Steptoe, Andrew; Fancourt, Daisy","https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.26064","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JAMA Netw Open;3(10): e2026064, 2020 10 01.; Publication details: JAMA Netw Open;3(10): e2026064, 2020 10 01.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-06","",6885,""
"Digital Phenotyping to Enhance Substance Use Treatment During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many clinical addiction treatment programs have been required to transition to telephonic or virtual visits. Novel solutions are needed to enhance substance use treatment during a time when many patients are disconnected from clinical care and social support. Digital phenotyping, which leverages the unique functionality of smartphone sensors (GPS, social behavior, and typing patterns), can buttress clinical treatment in a remote, scalable fashion. Specifically, digital phenotyping has the potential to improve relapse prediction and intervention, relapse detection, and overdose intervention. Digital phenotyping may enhance relapse prediction through coupling machine learning algorithms with the enormous amount of collected behavioral data. Activity-based analysis in real time can potentially be used to prevent relapse by warning substance users when they approach locational triggers such as bars or liquor stores. Wearable devices detect when a person has relapsed to substances through measuring physiological changes such as electrodermal activity and locomotion. Despite the initial promise of this approach, privacy, security, and barriers to access are important issues to address.","Hsu, Michael; Ahern, David K; Suzuki, Joji","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/21814","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Ment Health;7(10): e21814, 2020 Oct 26.; Publication details: JMIR Ment Health;7(10): e21814, 2020 Oct 26.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-06","",6886,""
"Post-COVID-19 Epidemic: Allostatic Load among Medical and Nonmedical Workers in China","As the fight against the COVID-19 epidemic continues, medical workers may have allostatic load. During the reopening of society, medical and nonmedical workers were compared in terms of allostatic load. An online study was performed; 3,590 Chinese subjects were analyzed. Socio-demographic variables, allostatic load, stress, abnormal illness behavior, global well-being, mental status, and social support were assessed. There was no difference in allostatic load in medical workers compared to nonmedical workers (15.8 vs. 17.8%; p = 0.22). Multivariate conditional logistic regression revealed that anxiety (OR = 1.24; 95% CI 1.18-1.31; p &lt; 0.01), depression (OR = 1.23; 95% CI 1.17-1.29; p &lt; 0.01), somatization (OR = 1.20; 95% CI 1.14-1.25; p &lt; 0.01), hostility (OR = 1.24; 95% CI 1.18-1.30; p &lt; 0.01), and abnormal illness behavior (OR = 1.49; 95% CI 1.34-1.66; p &lt; 0.01) were positively associated with allostatic load, while objective support (OR = 0.84; 95% CI 0.78-0.89; p &lt; 0.01), subjective support (OR = 0.84; 95% CI 0.80-0.88; p &lt; 0.01), utilization of support (OR = 0.80; 95% CI 0.72-0.88; p &lt; 0.01), social support (OR = 0.90; 95% CI 0.87-0.93; p &lt; 0.01), and global well-being (OR = 0.30; 95% CI 0.22-0.41; p &lt; 0.01) were negatively associated.

A search in 6 databases (PubMed, Embase, SPORTDiscus, Scopus, Web of Science, and CINAHL) was conducted on July 23, 2020. Medical subject headings and keywords related to PA and COVID-19 were combined to conduct the online search, which covered the period from January to July 2020. Overall, 1784 articles were retrieved. After duplicate removal and title, abstract, and full-text screening, 41 articles were included. Most of the included studies were quantitative and collected data through online interviews/questionnaires, with sample sizes larger than 100 and composed by adults and older adults. Changes in PA levels due to the COVID-19 pandemic were the most assessed outcome, followed by the association between mental health issues and PA. Only 2 studies assessed the direct effects of PA on COVID-19. Most of the evidence identified a decrease in PA levels due to social distancing measures and that PA might help to decrease the mental health burden related to the COVID-19 outbreak.","Caputo, Reichert","https://doi.org/10.1123/jpah.2020-0406","20201105"," <Keyword MajorTopicYN=""N"">COVID-19 pandemic; exercise","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-06","",6888,""
"Modelling the contribution of the Big Five personality traits, health anxiety, and COVID-19 psychological distress to generalised anxiety and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic","In the current study we sought to extend our understanding of vulnerability and protective factors (the Big Five personality traits, health anxiety, and COVID-19 psychological distress) in predicting generalised anxiety and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 502), who were United States residents, completed a variety of sociodemographic questions and the following questionnaires: Big Five Inventory-10 (BFI-10), Whitley Index 7 (WI-7), Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS), COVID-19 Anxiety Syndrome Scale (C19-ASS), and Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety and Depression Scale (PHQ-ADS). Results showed that extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness were negatively correlated with generalised anxiety and depressive symptoms and that neuroticism, health anxiety and both measures of COVID-19 psychological distress were positively correlated with generalised anxiety and depressive symptoms. We used path analysis to determine the pattern of relationships specified by the theoretical model we proposed. Results showed that health anxiety, COVID-19 anxiety, and the COVID-19 anxiety syndrome partially mediated the relationship between the Big Five personality traits and generalised anxiety and depressive symptoms. Specifically, extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness were negatively associated with the three mediators, which, in turn, were positively associated with generalised anxiety and depressive symptoms, with COVID-19 anxiety showing the strongest effect. Conversely, neuroticism and openness were positively associated with COVID-19 anxiety and the COVID-19 anxiety syndrome, respectively. These relationships were independent of age, gender, employment status and risk status. The model accounted for a substantial variance of generalised anxiety and depression symptoms (R<sup>2</sup>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â .75). The implications of these findings are discussed.","NikÃ„ÂeviÃ„â€¡, Marino, Kolubinski, Leach, Spada","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.10.053","20201105","Big Five personality traits; COVID-19 Anxiety Syndrome; Coronavirus (COVID-19); Coronavirus anxiety; generalised anxiety and depressive symptoms; health anxiety","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-06","",6889,""
"The Japanese version of the Fear of COVID-19 scale: Reliability, validity, and relation to coping behavior","COVID-19 is spreading worldwide, causing various social problems. The aim of the present study was to verify the reliability and validity of the Japanese version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) and to ascertain FCV-19S effects on assessment of Japanese people's coping behavior. After back-translation of the scale, 450 Japanese participants were recruited from a crowdsourcing platform. These participants responded to the Japanese FCV-19S, the Japanese versions of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS) and the Japanese versions of the Perceived Vulnerability to Disease (PVD), which assesses coping behaviors such as stockpiling and health monitoring, reasons for coping behaviors, and socio-demographic variables. Results indicated the factor structure of the Japanese FCV-19S as including seven items and one factor that were equivalent to those of the original FCV-19S. The scale showed adequate internal reliability (ÃŽÂ± = .87; Ãâ€° = .92) and concurrent validity, as indicated by significantly positive correlations with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS; anxiety, r = .56; depression, r = .29) and Perceived Vulnerability to Disease (PVD; perceived infectability, r = .32; germ aversion, r = .29). Additionally, the FCV-19S not only directly increased all coping behaviors (ÃŽÂ² = .21 - .36); it also indirectly increased stockpiling through conformity reason (indirect effect, ÃŽÂ² = .04; total effect, ÃŽÂ² = .31). These results suggest that the Japanese FCV-19S psychometric scale has equal reliability and validity to those of the original FCV-19S. These findings will contribute further to the investigation of various difficulties arising from fear about COVID-19 in Japan.","Wakashima, Asai, Kobayashi, Koiwa, Kamoshida, Sakuraba","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0241958","20201105","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-06","",6890,""
"Psychological consequences of COVID-19 home confinement: The ECLB-COVID19 multicenter study","Public health recommendations and government measures during the COVID-19 pandemic have enforced restrictions on daily-living. While these measures are imperative to abate the spreading of COVID-19, the impact of these restrictions on mental health and emotional wellbeing is undefined. Therefore, an international online survey (ECLB-COVID19) was launched on April 6, 2020 in seven languages to elucidate the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on mental health and emotional wellbeing. The ECLB-COVID19 electronic survey was designed by a steering group of multidisciplinary scientists, following a structured review of the literature. The survey was uploaded and shared on the Google online-survey-platform and was promoted by thirty-five research organizations from Europe, North-Africa, Western-Asia and the Americas. All participants were asked for their mental wellbeing (SWEMWS) and depressive symptoms (SMFQ) with regard to &quot;during&quot; and &quot;before&quot; home confinement. Analysis was conducted on the first 1047 replies (54% women) from Asia (36%), Africa (40%), Europe (21%) and other (3%). The COVID-19 home confinement had a negative effect on both mental-wellbeing and on mood and feelings. Specifically, a significant decrease (p &lt; .001 and ÃŽâ€% = 9.4%) in total score of the SWEMWS questionnaire was noted. More individuals (+12.89%) reported a low mental wellbeing &quot;during&quot; compared to &quot;before&quot; home confinement. Furthermore, results from the mood and feelings questionnaire showed a significant increase by 44.9% (p &lt; .001) in SMFQ total score with more people (+10%) showing depressive symptoms &quot;during&quot; compared to &quot;before&quot; home confinement. The ECLB-COVID19 survey revealed an increased psychosocial strain triggered by the home confinement. To mitigate this high risk of mental disorders and to foster an Active and Healthy Confinement Lifestyle (AHCL), a crisis-oriented interdisciplinary intervention is urgently needed.","Ammar, Mueller, Trabelsi, Chtourou, Boukhris, Masmoudi, Bouaziz, Brach, Schmicker, Bentlage, How, Ahmed, Aloui, Hammouda, Paineiras-Domingos, Braakman-Jansen, Wrede, Bastoni, Pernambuco, Mataruna-Dos-Santos, Taheri, Irandoust, Khacharem, Bragazzi, Adrian Washif, Glenn, Bott, Gargouri, Chaari, Batatia, Khoshnami, Samara, Zisi, Sankar, Ahmed, Ali, Abdelkarim, Jarraya, El Abed, Romdhani, Souissi, Van Gemert-Pijnen, Bailey, Moalla, GÃƒÂ³mez-Raja, Epstein, Sanderman, Schulz, Jerg, Al-Horani, Mansi, Jmail, Barbosa, Ferreira-Santos, Ã…Â imuniÃ„Â, PiÃ…Â¡ot, Gaggioli, Zmijewski, Steinacker, Strahler, Riemann, Riemann, Mueller, Chamari, Driss, Hoekelmann","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0240204","20201105","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-06","",6891,""
"Psychodynamic, humanistic, systemic, and behavioral psychotherapists' experiences with remote psychotherapy during COVID-19 in Austria: A cross-sectional online survey","The current situation around the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the measures necessary to fight it are a challenge for psychotherapists, who usually treat face-to-face in personal contact. This situation accelerates the use of remote psychotherapy, i.e. psychotherapy provided via telephone or internet. However, some reservations against remote psychotherapy have been shown in psychotherapists. As psychotherapists are the individuals who determine the frequency of use of remote psychotherapy, the potential of enabling mental health care during COVID-19 in line with the protective measures to fight COVID-19 can be realized only if psychotherapists are willing to utilize remote psychotherapy. This study aimed to investigate experiences with remote psychotherapy in the first weeks of the COVID-19 lockdown in Austria (between March 24th and April 1st, 2020). Austrian psychotherapists were invited to take part in an online survey. The therapeutic orientation (behavioral, humanistic, psychodynamic, systemic), the rating regarding the comparability of remote psychotherapy (internet, telephone) with face-to-face psychotherapy in personal contact, as well as a potential discrepancy between actual experiences and previous expectations with remote psychotherapy were assessed. Data of 1,162 psychotherapists practicing before as well as in the COVID-19 lockdown were analyzed. Psychotherapy conducted via telephone or internet was reported not to be totally comparable to psychotherapy in personal contact (P&lt;.001). Psychodynamic and humanistic therapists reported a higher comparability of psychotherapy via telephone to psychotherapy in personal contact than behavioral therapists (PÃ¢â€°Â¤.005). Experiences with remote therapy (internet as well as telephone) were more positive as previously expected (P&lt;.001). Psychodynamic therapists reported more positive actual experiences for psychotherapy via telephone than expected previously, compared to behavioral and systemic therapists (PÃ¢â€°Â¤.027). In general psychotherapy via internet was rated more positively (regarding comparability to psychotherapy in personal contact and experiences vs. expectations) than psychotherapy via telephone (P&lt;.001), however, not for psychodynamic therapists who reported previous expectations to be equal to actual experiences for telephone and internet. Psychotherapists experienced remote psychotherapy (i.e., psychotherapy via telephone/internet) better than expected, but not totally comparable to face-to-face psychotherapy in personal contact. Especially behavioral therapists were found to rate psychotherapy via telephone less favorable than therapists with other theoretical backgrounds.","Humer, Stippl, Pieh, Pryss, Probst","https://doi.org/10.2196/20246","20201105","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-06","",6892,""
"Professional and Psychological Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Oncology Residents: A National Survey","The COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected clinical practice in oncology, leading to organizational, ethical, and medical issues. In particular, it has raised challenges in the context of competing care priorities between COVID-19 and cancer treatment. Residents on the front line face difficulties related to increasing care needs and urgent reorganization of health care systems while managing psychological stress and uncertainty. We aimed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on oncology residents. We conducted a national survey (39 questions) in France among oncology and radiation therapy residents to determine the psychological impact and professional difficulties (eg, reassignment, training/research time, supervision, teleworking, management of patients) associated with the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, 222 residents (medical oncologists, 61%; radiation therapists, 39%) participated in our survey, representing approximately one third of all residents and fellows in France. One third of respondents had been reassigned to a COVID-19 ward. Training and research activity decreased for 89% and 41% of respondents, respectively. Two thirds (70%) of respondents declared that they had faced ethical issues, 35% felt worried about their own health, and 23% experienced psychological distress. According to the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, 32% were anxious and 17% depressed. Consumption of tobacco, psychostimulants, and alcohol increased in 31%, 24%, and 29% of respondents, respectively. French oncology residents were highly affected by the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of professional activity and psychological impact.

"Predictors of psychological distress among the public in Oman amid coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic: a cross-sectional analytical study","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global, virulent pandemic disease that emerged in December 2019, with both short- and long-term psychological repercussions being inevitable. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and predictors of psychological distress, defined by the presence of either depression or anxiety, among the public in Oman during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was a web-based, cross-sectional study conducted using governmental and private institutional e-mail systems and social media platforms. Anxiety and depression were assessed using both the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Scale and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the independent predictors. There were a total of 1538 participants in this study (75% female). The prevalence of psychological distress was 30%. Being female, having financial instability, being treated for mental illness and self-medication for coping with stress were independent predictors of psychological distress among the study sample (Odds ratio [OR]Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.69, confidence interval [CI]Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.24-2.29; ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2.05, CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.54-2.74; ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 5.35, CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 3.50-8.18; ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 7.23, CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 3.06-17.09, respectively).

"Interventions to support the resilience and mental health of frontline health and social care professionals during and after a disease outbreak, epidemic or pandemic: a mixed methods systematic review","Evidence from disease epidemics shows that healthcare workers are at risk of developing short- and long-term mental health problems. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned about the potential negative impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the mental well-being of health and social care professionals. Symptoms of mental health problems commonly include depression, anxiety, stress, and additional cognitive and social problems; these can impact on function in the workplace. The mental health and resilience (ability to cope with the negative effects of stress) of frontline health and social care professionals ('frontline workers' in this review) could be supported during disease epidemics by workplace interventions, interventions to support basic daily needs, psychological support interventions, pharmacological interventions, or a combination of any or all of these. Objective 1: to assess the effects of interventions aimed at supporting the resilience and mental health of frontline health and social care professionals during and after a disease outbreak, epidemic or pandemic. Objective 2: to identify barriers and facilitators that may impact on the implementation of interventions aimed at supporting the resilience and mental health of frontline health and social care professionals during and after a disease outbreak, epidemic or pandemic. On 28 May 2020 we searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Global Index Medicus databases and WHO Institutional Repository for Information Sharing. We also searched ongoing trials registers and Google Scholar. We ran all searches from the year 2002 onwards, with no language restrictions. We included studies in which participants were health and social care professionals working at the front line during infectious disease outbreaks, categorised as epidemics or pandemics by WHO, from 2002 onwards. For objective 1 we included quantitative evidence from randomised trials, non-randomised trials, controlled before-after studies and interrupted time series studies, which investigated the effect of any intervention to support mental health or resilience, compared to no intervention, standard care, placebo or attention control intervention, or other active interventions. For objective 2 we included qualitative evidence from studies that described barriers and facilitators to the implementation of interventions. Outcomes critical to this review were general mental health and resilience. Additional outcomes included psychological symptoms of anxiety, depression or stress; burnout; other mental health disorders; workplace staffing; and adverse events arising from interventions. Pairs of review authors independently applied selection criteria to abstracts and full papers, with disagreements resolved through discussion. One review author systematically extracted data, cross-checked by a second review author. For objective 1, we assessed risk of bias of studies of effectiveness using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. For objective 2, we assessed methodological limitations using either the CASP (Critical Appraisal Skills Programme) qualitative study tool, for qualitative studies, or WEIRD (Ways of Evaluating Important and Relevant Data) tool, for descriptive studies. We planned meta-analyses of pairwise comparisons for outcomes if direct evidence were available. Two review authors extracted evidence relating to barriers and facilitators to implementation, organised these around the domains of the Consolidated Framework of Implementation Research, and used the GRADE-CERQual approach to assess confidence in each finding. We planned to produce an overarching synthesis, bringing quantitative and qualitative findings together. We included 16 studies that reported implementation of an intervention aimed at supporting the resilience or mental health of frontline workers during disease outbreaks (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS): 2; Ebola: 9; Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS): 1; COVID-19: 4). Interventions studied included workplace interventions, such as training, structure and communication (6 studies); psychological support interventions, such as counselling and psychology services (8 studies); and multifaceted interventions (2 studies). Objective 1: a mixed-methods study that incorporated a cluster-randomised trial, investigating the effect of a work-based intervention, provided very low-certainty evidence about the effect of training frontline healthcare workers to deliver psychological first aid on a measure of burnout. Objective 2: we included all 16 studies in our qualitative evidence synthesis; we classified seven as qualitative and nine as descriptive studies. We identified 17 key findings from multiple barriers and facilitators reported in studies. We did not have high confidence in any of the findings; we had moderate confidence in six findings and low to very low confidence in 11 findings. We are moderately confident that the following two factors were barriers to intervention implementation: frontline workers, or the organisations in which they worked, not being fully aware of what they needed to support their mental well-being; and a lack of equipment, staff time or skills needed for an intervention. We are moderately confident that the following three factors were facilitators of intervention implementation: interventions that could be adapted for local needs; having effective communication, both formally and socially; and having positive, safe and supportive learning environments for frontline workers. We are moderately confident that the knowledge or beliefs, or both, that people have about an intervention can act as either barriers or facilitators to implementation of the intervention. There is a lack of both quantitative and qualitative evidence from studies carried out during or after disease epidemics and pandemics that can inform the selection of interventions that are beneficial to the resilience and mental health of frontline workers. Alternative sources of evidence (e.g. from other healthcare crises, and general evidence about interventions that support mental well-being) could therefore be used to inform decision making. When selecting interventions aimed at supporting frontline workers' mental health, organisational, social, personal, and psychological factors may all be important. Research to determine the effectiveness of interventions is a high priority. The COVID-19 pandemic provides unique opportunities for robust evaluation of interventions. Future studies must be developed with appropriately rigorous planning, including development, peer review and transparent reporting of research protocols, following guidance and standards for best practice, and with appropriate length of follow-up. Factors that may act as barriers and facilitators to implementation of interventions should be considered during the planning of future research and when selecting interventions to deliver within local settings.","Pollock, Campbell, Cheyne, Cowie, Davis, McCallum, McGill, Elders, Hagen, McClurg, Torrens, Maxwell","https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013779","20201105","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-06","",6896,""

"Experiences of geriatric nurses in nursing home settings across four countries in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic","To explore the emotional impact and experiences of geriatric nurses working in nursing homes and caring for patients with coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19). This is a qualitative study with phenomenological method and data were gathered through in-dept interview. The experiences and expectations that nurses are facing during their care duties were explored via video conference, using a semi-structured interview guide. We have followed the Consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research COREQ. 24 interviews were conducted with nurses from four countries (Spain, Italy, Peru and Mexico) during April 2020. Three main categories were extracted: fear of the pandemic situation, the sense of duty and professional commitment, and emotional exhaustion. Regardless of the country and situation, in the face of the pandemic, dramatic situations have been experienced in nursing homes worldwide, with nursing staff feeling exhausted and overwhelmed, and reflection is urged on a global level to consider the most appropriate model of care in nursing homes.","Sarabia-Cobo, PÃƒÂ©rez, De Lorena, Hermosilla-Grijalbo, SÃƒÂ¡enz-JalÃƒÂ³n, FernÃƒÂ¡ndez-RodrÃƒÂ­guez, Alconero-Camarero","https://doi.org/10.1111/jan.14626","20201105","COVID-19; geriatric; mental health; nursing; nursing home","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-06","",6898,""
"The mental health and well-being benefits of exercise during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study of medical students and newly qualified doctors in the UK","University students have been uniquely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is currently little data upon the measures that medical students and newly qualified doctors have taken to help their mental well-being and mood during the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to identify the activities respondents found beneficial for their well-being and mental health and recorded a mood score from survey respondents. A nationwide study was completed to investigate the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic upon medical students and newly qualified doctors (interim foundation year one). We received 2075 respondents from across the UK. Physical activity was found to be the most common activity used by the survey respondents to help with their mental well-being (80.1%) (medical students, 83.7%; interim foundation doctors, 72.3%). Participants who stated that exercise helped their well-being had a mean score (SD) of 52.3 (20.7) which was significantly higher (P = 0.048) than those who reported that they did not exercise (49.8 (21.1)). Respondents who stated they had used exercise to help with their mental well-being had (on average) a higher mood score than those who did not. This was seen in both the medical student and interim foundation doctor subgroups. Exercise can help to benefit the well-being of medical students and interim foundation doctors. It is hoped that higher education providers and employers recognise the importance of promoting physical activity for the well-being of their students and staff, respectively.","Coyle, Ghazi, Georgiou","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11845-020-02423-z","20201105","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Foundation doctors; Medical students; Mental health; Prospective study","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-06","",6899,""
"Social Determinants of Poor Management of Type 2 Diabetes Among the Insured","Even with insurance coverage increasing over time among the population with diabetes, a large proportion continues to have poorly controlled disease. The purpose of this narrative literature review is to describe the social determinants of poor management of type 2 diabetes among the insured population and illustrate drivers of poor outcomes beyond insurance coverage. Despite the provision of health insurance, social determinants play a significant role in shaping diabetes outcomes, especially for economic instability (employment, out-of-pocket expenses associated with diabetes management), food insecurity, education and literacy, access to quality health care (health systems designed to effectively manage chronic disease), neighborhood and the built environment (segregated neighborhoods, socioeconomic conditions of communities, housing), and social and community context (discrimination, social support). Multiple social determinants shape poor diabetes outcomes among the insured. These determinants are now being further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has created the worst economic crisis for US families since the Great Depression. The evidence of this review points to the imperative need for more multilevel intervention approaches to address these determinants in the management of diabetes.","Patel","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11892-020-01354-4","20201105","Diabetes; Health insurance; Outcomes; Social determinants","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-06","",6900,""
"The Health Of Us Adolescent Athletes During Covid-19 Related School Closures And Sport Cancellations","In the spring of 2020, US schools closed to in-person teaching and sports were cancelled to control the transmission of COVID-19. It is critical to understand the mental and physical health of adolescent athletes during this time. Describe the health of athletes during COVID-19 related school closures and sport cancellations. Cross sectional. A national sample recruited via social media. 13,002 US adolescent athletes (age=16.3+1.2 yrs., female=53.1%) completed an anonymous online survey. Demographic information included: sex, grade, sports played and zip code. Assessments included the: General Anxiety Disorder-7 Item (GAD-7) for anxiety, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Item (PHQ-9) for depression, the Pediatric Functional Activity Brief Scale (PFABS) for physical activity, and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 (PedsQL) for quality of life. Mental health, physical activity and quality of life variables were compared between sex, grade, sports played and poverty level using means and 95%CI from the survey weighted ANOVA. Females reported a higher prevalence of moderate to severe anxiety symptoms (females=43.7% vs. males=28.2%). The PFABS score (mean [95%CI] was highest (best) for grade 9 (14.5 [14.0,15.0]) and lowest for grade 11 (10.9 [10.5,11.3]. The prevalence of depression symptoms was highest in team sport (74.1%) and lowest for individual sport participants (64.9%). The total PedsQL score was lowest (worst) for athletes from counties with the highest poverty levels (high=74.5[73.7,75.3], middle=78.9[78.0,79.8], low=78.3 [77.4,79.1]). The health of US adolescents during the COVID-19 related school closures and sport cancellations varied to differing degrees depending on sex, grade level, type of sport participation and level of poverty. Health policy experts should consider these findings when creating and implementing policies to improve the health of adolescents in the US in the future.","McGuine, Biese, Petrovska, Hetzel, Reardon, Kliethermes, Bell, Brooks, Watson","https://doi.org/10.4085/478-20","20201105","Adolescent Athletes; COVID-19; Disparity; Public health; Socioeconomic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-06","",6901,""
"Individual Perceived Stress Mediates Psychological Distress in Medical Workers During COVID-19 Epidemic Outbreak in Wuhan","Since the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Wuhan, thousands of medical workers have been dispatched to support Wuhan against the virus. The purpose of this study was to identify the independent risk factors for psychological distress in order to develop a more effective strategy and precise evidence-based psychological intervention for medical workers. This multisite cross-sectional survey recruited doctors and nurses from local and nonlocal medical teams working at 16 hospitals in Wuhan to complete this online survey from February to March, 2020. Psychological status was evaluated through Perceived Stress Scales (PSS), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), General Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and Acute Stress Disorder Scale (ASDS). Of 966 participants, the prevalence of stress (95.9%), depression (46.0%) and anxiety (39.3%) were high. Local medical workers exhibited even higher scores of PSS, PHQ-9, GAD-7 and ASDS than those from outside Hubei (<i>P</i>&lt;0.001). Females had more severe perceived stress, depression and anxiety than males (<i>P</i>&lt;0.001). Multiple logistic regression showed that perceived stress is associated with increased odds of depression (OR=1.413; 95% CI: 1.338-1.493; <i>P</i>&lt;0.001) and anxiety (OR=1.515; 95% CI: 1.407-1.631; <i>P</i>&lt;0.001). Our findings demonstrated a high prevalence of stress, depression, anxiety and acute distress among medical workers on the front-line during the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan. The level of psychological impact may be mediated by individual perceptions of stressful events.","Zhang, Peng, Lv, Zhuo, Yu, Shen, Xu, Wang","https://doi.org/10.2147/NDT.S266151","20201105","COVID-19; Wuhan; anxiety; depression; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-06","",6902,""
"Depression, Anxiety and Associated Factors Among Chronic Medical Patients Amid COVID-19 Pandemic in Mettu Karl Referral Hospital, Mettu, Ethiopia, 2020","COVID-19 has had a devastating impact on the mental health condition of the world's population. Although the direct effect of COVID-19 on the mental health status of chronic medical patients is well understood, the burden of depression and anxiety on patients with chronic medical conditions is not well studied yet. Therefore, the study aimed to assess the prevalence of depression, anxiety and associated factors among chronic medical patients amid the COVID-19 pandemic in Mettu Karl Referral Hospital, Mettu, Ethiopia. A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted from June 1 to July 30, 2020 among chronic medical patients in Mettu Karl Referral Hospital, Ethiopia. Consecutive sampling technique was applied with a total of 423 samples. Quantitative data were employed by using structured questionnaires. Descriptive statistical procedures, bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions with odds ratios and 95% confidence interval (CI) were employed. The statistical significance was declared at p value &lt; 0.05. The findings showed that the prevalence of depression and anxiety among chronic medical patients was 55.7% and 61.8%, respectively. Female gender (AOR = 1.66, 95% CI (1.06, 2.59)), poor social support (AOR = 1.94, 95% CI (1.10, 3.42)), widowed/divorced (AOR = 3.92, 95% CI (1.59, 9.64)), separated (AOR = 3.66, 95% CI (1.64, 8.19)), and longer duration of illness (AOR = 1.82, 95% CI (1.15, 2.89)) were significantly associated with depression, whereas earlier age at onset of illness, having more than three co-morbid diagnoses, tobacco use and poor social support were found to have significant association with anxiety among chronic medical patients amid the COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia. The magnitude of concurrent depression and anxiety in the current study was high. Strategies for prompt identification and treatment of depression and anxiety should be developed among medically ill patients.","Hajure, Tariku, Mohammedhussein, Dule","https://doi.org/10.2147/NDT.S281995","20201105","COVID-19; Ethiopia; anxiety; chronic illness; depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-06","",6903,""
"Physical and mental health screening in a New York City HIV cohort during the COVID-19 pandemic: A preliminary report","Mental health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic have been observed. Psychiatric symptoms in people living with HIV (PLWH), and their relationship to physical symptomatology and prior psychopathology, are not yet reported. An HIV cohort sheltering-in-place in New York City (NYC). Forty-nine participants in a longitudinal study were contacted by telephone in April 2020. A structured interview queried COVID-19-associated physical symptoms, and mental health screens were performed with the generalized anxiety disorder-2 (GAD-2) and patient health questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2). Prior medical and neuropsychiatric data were obtained from preceding study visits. Post hoc analyses were performed. The mean age of respondents was 62.1 years, 39% were women, and 35% African American, 37% Latinx, and 28% Caucasian. COVID-19-indicator symptoms were present in 69%; 41% had respiratory and 61% extra-pulmonary symptoms. Mental health symptoms were endorsed in 45% with PHQ-2 and 43% with GAD-2, although threshold for major depression was met in only 4% and for GAD in 14%. Higher PHQ scores were associated with respiratory symptoms, but not prior mood or anxiety disorders. GAD-2 scores were higher with past mood disorders, but not with prior anxiety disorders or respiratory symptoms. Physical symptoms were frequent and mild psychiatric symptoms common, but serious anxiety and depression were not often endorsed by this group of PLWH at the acute height of the NYC COVID-19 pandemic. Reasons for this are unclear, as this preliminary report is descriptive in nature. Short and long term consequences of acute mental health symptoms require further study.","Pizzirusso, Carrion-Park, Clark, Gonzalez, Byrd, Morgello","https://doi.org/10.1097/QAI.0000000000002564","20201105","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-06","",6904,""

"Mental health services for infectious disease outbreaks including COVID-19: a rapid systematic review","The upsurge in the number of people affected by the COVID-19 is likely to lead to increased rates of emotional trauma and mental illnesses. This article systematically reviewed the available data on the benefits of interventions to reduce adverse mental health sequelae of infectious disease outbreaks, and to offer guidance for mental health service responses to infectious disease pandemic. PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, PsycINFO, WHO Global Research Database on infectious disease, and the preprint server medRxiv were searched. Of 4278 reports identified, 32 were included in this review. Most articles of psychological interventions were implemented to address the impact of COVID-19 pandemic, followed by Ebola, SARS, and MERS for multiple vulnerable populations. Increasing mental health literacy of the public is vital to prevent the mental health crisis under the COVID-19 pandemic. Group-based cognitive behavioral therapy, psychological first aid, community-based psychosocial arts program, and other culturally adapted interventions were reported as being effective against the mental health impacts of COVID-19, Ebola, and SARS. Culturally-adapted, cost-effective, and accessible strategies integrated into the public health emergency response and established medical systems at the local and national levels are likely to be an effective option to enhance mental health response capacity for the current and for future infectious disease outbreaks. Tele-mental healthcare services were key central components of stepped care for both infectious disease outbreak management and routine support; however, the usefulness and limitations of remote health delivery should also be recognized.","Yue, Yan, Sun, Yuan, Su, Han, Ravindran, Kosten, Everall, Davey, Bullmore, Kawakami, Barbui, Thornicroft, Lund, Lin, Liu, Shi, Shi, Ran, Bao, Lu","https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291720003888","20201105","COVID-19; infectious disease; mental health service; psychological intervention; tele-mental healthcare","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-06","",6907,""
"Mental state of central sterile supply department staff during COVID-19 epidemic and CART analysis","During the COVID-19 epidemic, the central sterile supply department (CSSD) staff handled many devices, implements and non-disposable protective articles used by suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. As a result, the CSSD staff may have experienced psychological stress, however, the mental state of the CSSD staff during the COVID-19 epidemic has been rarely studied. We aim to investigate the mental state of the CSSD staff and relevant influencing factors experienced during the COVID-19 epidemic. The survey utilising a general information questionnaire, Chinese perceived stress scale (CPSS), self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), and Connor-Davidson resilience scale (CD-RISC) was conducted with 423 CSSD staff members from 35 hospitals in Sichuan Province, China. Data was analysed in SPSS24.0. Classification and regression tree (CART) was utilised to analyse variables and find variation between groups. A chi-square test was performed on enumeration data, and t-test and analysis of variance were performed on measurement data. The CSSD staff's SAS score was 37.39Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°8.458, their CPSS score was 19.21Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°7.265, and their CD-RISC score was 64.26Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°15.129 (Tenacity factor score: 31.70Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°8.066, Strength factor score: 21.60Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.066, Optimism factor scores: 10.96Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.189). The CPSS score was positively correlated with the SAS score (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.66; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01), the CPSS score was negatively correlated with the CD-RISC score (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.617, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01), and the SAS score was negatively correlated with the CD-RISC score (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.477, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01). The job position, age, and political status of the CSSD staff were the main factors affecting their mental state; for example, the CPSS score and SAS score of the CSSD nurses were significantly different from those of the CSSD logistic staff (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01). During the epidemic, the CSSD staff's psychological resilience was at a low level; the anxiety level of the CSSD nurses was higher than that of the CSSD logistic staff.

"Gender differences of depression and anxiety among social media users during the COVID-19 outbreak in China:a cross-sectional study","Studies have shown that the outbreak of infectious diseases would result in mental health problems. Females are in greater risk for psychological problems than males. The present study investigated gender differences of depression and anxiety and explored associated factors during the COVID-19 epidemic among Chinese social media users. We recruited 3088 participants through social media cross China. Participants completed sociodemographic and the COVID-19 epidemic related questions, the 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2), and the 2-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-2), the Chinese version of the 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. We applied Chi-square test and ANOVA for data description and linear regression analysis for exploring factors associated with depression and anxiety. Of 3063 participants eligible for analysis, the total prevalence of depression and anxiety was 14.14 and 13.25%. Females were experiencing more severe stress and anxiety symptoms, while males showed better resilience to stress. The severity of depression symptoms would decrease with the increase of age resilience, and it would increase if being unemployed, feeling less adapted, being more stressed. The severity of anxiety symptoms would decrease with higher education and better resilience, and it would increase if being female, spending over 60Ã¢â‚¬â€°min on COVID-19 related information, less adapted, and being more stressed. The findings show the increased prevalence of depression and anxiety in Chinese population during the COVID-19 epidemic, and females are experiencing more severe anxiety symptoms than males.

"Media exposure to COVID-19 information, risk perception, social and geographical proximity, and self-rated anxiety in China","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging infectious disease that spreads around the world. The lack of effective antiviral drugs and vaccines, along with the relatively high mortality rate and high contagiousness, has raised strong public concerns over COVID-19, especially for people living in the most severely affected areas. This study aimed to clarify the influencing factors for the anxiety level among the Chinese people during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a particular focus on the media exposure to different COVID-19 information. A total of 4991 respondents were randomly recruited from a national online panel from February 12th, 2020 to February 14th, 2020, a period when the number of COVID-19 cases surpassed 10,000 in a single day, with the total cases in China reaching up to 90,000. The relationships between media exposure of COVID-19 information, social and geographical proximity to COVID-19, risk perceptions were assessed using hierarchical ordinary least squares regression analysis. The media exposure to COVID-19 information was differently associated with anxiety. Meanwhile, the anxiety level was found to be high in respondents who personally knew someone infected with COVID-19 or those who living in an area with reported cases. Respondents who perceived more risks also reported a higher level of anxiety. This study highlights the role of media exposure in affecting individuals' anxiety level during the COVID-19 pandemic. Besides, it is recommended that government and health professionals are recommended to adopt effective risk communication strategies to protect citizens' mental health during the pandemic.","Liu, Zhang, Huang","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-09761-8","20201105","Geographical proximity; Media exposure; Risk perception; Self-rated anxiety; Social proximity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-06","",6911,""
"Exercise interveNtion outdoor proJect in the cOmmunitY for older people - results from the ENJOY Seniors Exercise Park project translation research in the community","Many research studies evaluate physical activity interventions for older people in the community, however relatively few successfully promote maintenance of physical activity beyond the completion of the intervention. This study aimed to implement and evaluate the effects of sustained engagement in physical activity on mental, social and physical health outcomes through the use of the Seniors Exercise Park physical activity program for older people (the ENJOY project). People aged Ã¢â€°Â¥60Ã¢â‚¬â€°years underwent a 12-week structured supervised physical activity program using outdoor exercise park equipment followed by 6Ã¢â‚¬â€°months unstructured independent use of the exercise park. Participants were assessed at baseline, 3Ã¢â‚¬â€°months and 9Ã¢â‚¬â€°months and completed a test battery evaluating physical activity, physical function and health related quality of life measures. Repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare differences between baseline, 3 and 9Ã¢â‚¬â€°months. Of the 95 participants, 80 (84.2%) completed the 3 months supervised program, and 58 (61%) completed the 9Ã¢â‚¬â€°month assessment (the latter impacted by COVID-19 restrictions). A significant increase in physical activity level was demonstrated following the 12Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks intervention (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.01). Significant improvements were also demonstrated in all physical function measures (p &lt;Ã‚Â 0.01), self-rated quality of life (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.05), wellbeing (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.01), fear of falls (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.01), falls risk (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.01), depressive symptoms (pÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01) and loneliness (pÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.03) at 3Ã¢â‚¬â€°months. At the 9Ã¢â‚¬â€°months follow up, significant improvements from baseline were demonstrated in the frequency, duration and total of physical activity level (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.05), and all physical function measures (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.05), with no decline in these measures from 3 to 9Ã¢â‚¬â€°months. At 9Ã¢â‚¬â€°months, significant changes were observed in the health related quality of life mobility and self care domains with reductions in both fear of falls and falls risk (pÃ‚Â &lt; 0.05). The Seniors Exercise Park may be an effective modality for improving and sustaining older people's physical function and wellbeing and can be an important public health infrastructure investment in promoting physical activity for older people.
