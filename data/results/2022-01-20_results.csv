"COVID-19 and in-somnia: Sleep in times of pandemic","COVID-19 disease caused by a new type of coronavirus has been an integral part of everyday reality for almost two years. Its presence and connection with psychiatric diseases is the subject of intensive and extensive research. A very common problem described in the literature is sleep disorders connected to the coronavirus infection. Sleep is an essential process needed to in-tegrate all the functions of the CNS and is essential for physical and mental health. Studies demonstrate a number of negative effects of sleep deprivation and sleep disorders. Those known include hypopro-sexia, hypoenergy, increased irritability, and increased anxiety. Among the lesser known but particularly important for COV-ID-19 disease are changes in the immune response, including the response to active immunization in the form of vaccination. Previous meetings with coronavirus family show that they significantly interfere with sleep management and cause sleep disorders in a high percentage of patients who have recovered from the infection. Recent studies of the new coronavirus SaRS-CoV2 provide insight into a dual mechanism of sleep disorders. In the first case, the pandemic itself, as a significant historical event, increases the level of stress and anxiety in the population. Individuals have to adapt to a lot of new measures, to learn new forms of work and social interaction. This can lead to the development of insomnia and other sleep disorders in disposed individuals. In the second case, SaRS-CoV2 alone, like other coronaviruses (MERS, SARS), appears to interfere with the sleep control axis and in a high percentage of cases (studies re-port a prevalence of up to 39% of patients) leads to insomnia after overcoming the acute stage of the disease. So far, very lim-ited data are available on the treatment of both forms of sleep disorders caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, the first clues and possibilities for how to adapt the therapy of sleep disorders in the covid period appear.","Vanek, J.; LÃ¡talovÃ¡, K.","https://www.google.com/search?q=COVID-19+and+in-somnia:+Sleep+in+times+of+pandemic","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Ceska a Slovenska Psychiatrie; 117(6):319-324, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-20","",25698,""

"Prophylactic versus therapeutic dose anticoagulation effects on survival among critically ill patients with COVID-19","Although patients with severe COVID-19 are known to be at high risk of developing thrombotic events, the effects of anticoagulation (AC) dose and duration on in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients remain poorly understood and controversial. The goal of this study was to investigate survival of critically ill COVID-19 patients who received prophylactic or therapeutic dose AC and analyze the mortality rate with respect to detailed demographic and clinical characteristics. We conducted a retrospective, observational study of critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU at Stony Brook University Hospital in New York who received either prophylactic (n = 158) or therapeutic dose AC (n = 153). Primary outcome was in-hospital death assessed by survival analysis and covariate-adjusted Cox proportional hazard model. For the first 3 weeks of ICU stay, we observed similar survival curves for prophylactic and therapeutic AC groups. However, after 3 or more weeks of ICU stay, the therapeutic AC group, characterized by high incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI), had markedly higher death incidence rates with 8.6 deaths (95% CI = 6.2-11.9 deaths) per 1,000 person-days and about 5 times higher risk of death (adj. HR = 4.89, 95% CI = 1.71-14.0, p = 0.003) than the prophylactic group (2.4 deaths [95% CI = 0.9-6.3 deaths] per 1,000 person-days). Among therapeutic AC users with prolonged ICU admission, non-survivors were characterized by older males with depressed lymphocyte counts and cardiovascular disease. Our findings raise the possibility that prolonged use of high dose AC, independent of thrombotic events or clinical background, might be associated with higher risk of in-hospital mortality. Moreover, AKI, age, lymphocyte count, and cardiovascular disease may represent important risk factors that could help identify at-risk patients who require long-term hospitalization with therapeutic dose AC treatment.","Hoogenboom, Lu, Musheyev, Borg, Janowicz, Pamlayne, Hou, Duong","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0262811","20220119","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-20","",25700,""
"When Management of Cancer-Related Pain Is Complicated by Coexisting Opioid Use Disorder: A Case Review","Patients with cancer are living longer, and many experience pain secondary to tumor invasion or as a consequence of cancer-directed therapies. Opioid use disorders and associated morbidity and mortality have increased with dramatic rise during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. National and international stakeholders have developed clinical practice guidelines in an effort to curb opioid misuse and overdose-related death. However, to ensure that patients with cancer do not experience barriers to adequate pain management, most of these guidelines are not intended for patients with cancer-related pain or for those receiving palliative or hospice care. Oncology, palliative, and hospice care providers are increasingly tasked with the management of severe disease-related pain in the setting of coexisting opioid use disorder without research on the most effective risk and harm reduction strategies to guide care. Clinicians should be familiar with addiction medicine and chronic pain literature and be able to incorporate some of these best practices. This case study reviews the management of severe cancer-related pain in a patient with co-occurring opioid use disorder, utilizing many of the best practices in available clinical practice guidelines for the management of chronic non-cancer-related pain.","Lowry","https://doi.org/10.1097/NJH.0000000000000828","20220119","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-20","",25701,""
"Brief digital interventions to support the psychological well-being of NHS staff during the COVID-19 pandemic: a three-arm pilot randomised controlled trial","Health and social care staff are at high risk of experiencing adverse mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, there is a need to prioritize and identify ways to effectively support their psychological wellbeing. Compared to traditional psychological interventions, digital psychological interventions are cost effective treatment options that allow for large-scale dissemination and transcend social distancing, overcome rurality, and minimize clinician time. This study reports outcomes of a CONSORT-compliant parallel-arm pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) examining the potential usefulness of an existing and a novel digital psychological intervention aimed at supporting psychological health among NHS staff working through the COVID-19 pandemic. NHS Highland (NHSH) frontline staff volunteers (N = 169) were randomly assigned to the newly developed NHSH Staff Wellbeing Project (NHSWBP), an established digital intervention (My Possible Self; MPS), or to a waitlist (WL) condition for four weeks. Attempts were made to blind participants to which digital intervention they were allocated. The interventions were fully automated, without any human input or guidance. We measured five self-reported psychological outcomes over three time points: before (baseline), middle (after 2 weeks) and after treatment (4 weeks). The primary outcomes were anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9) and mental well-being (Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale). The secondary outcomes included mental toughness (Mental Toughness Index) and gratitude (the Gratitude Questionnaire). Retention rates at middle and post-intervention were 77% (n = 130) and 63.3% (n = 107), respectively. At post-intervention, small differences were noted between the WL condition and the two treatment conditions on anxiety (vs. MPS: d = .07, 95% CI: -.20, .33; vs. NHSWBP: d = .06, 95% CI: -.19, .31), depression (vs. MPS: d = .37, 95% CI: .07, .66; vs. NHSWBP: d = .18, 95% CI: -.11, .46), and mental well-being (vs. MPS: d = -.04, 95% CI: -.62, -.08; vs. NHSWBP: d = -.15, 95% CI: -.41, .10). A similar pattern of between-group differences was found for the secondary outcomes. The NHSWBP group generally had larger within group effects than the other groups and displayed a greater rate of change compared to the other conditions on all outcomes, except for gratitude, where the rate of change was greatest for the MPS group. Our analyses provided encouraging results for the use of brief digital psychological interventions in improving psychological well-being among health and social care workers. Future multi-site RCTs, with power to reliably detect differences, are needed to determine the efficacy of contextualised interventions relative to existing digital treatments.

"A brief, daily, online mental health and wellbeing intervention for university staff during the COVID-19 pandemic: Program description and outcomes using a mixed methods design","The unprecedented changes and isolation measures to contain the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have had multiple psychological and social impacts, with implications for professional and personal functioning. Evidence-informed interventions that can be rapidly implemented under pandemic conditions to support mental health during such times were urgently needed. This study aimed to determine the acceptability and preliminary outcomes of a daily online mental health promotion program for tertiary education staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. The 'VU Elevenses' program was delivered as an uncontrolled intervention at Victoria University (VU) in the western metropolitan region of Melbourne, Australia. In April 2020, an email invitation was sent to all academic and professional staff inviting them to: 1) participate in the program; and 2) opt-in to the research component. The 'VU Elevenses' program provided 10-15-minute micro-interventions comprising lifestyle and wellbeing strategies to promote mental health, via an online meeting platform, at 11am each weekday. A mixed-method approach was used to evaluate the program, combining structured questionnaires with semi-structured interviews to investigate the experiences of staff who participated in the program. Between 16-90 participants provided weekly program feedback. A total of 106 university staff opted into the longitudinal research component and 10 staff participated in the interviews. Participants reported high levels of satisfaction with sessions and perceived benefits for mental health. Approximately one quarter of participants reported moderate to severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress at baseline, with significant reductions in these symptoms in the first seven weeks of the program, corresponding with easing in mandatory isolation ('lockdown') restrictions. However, symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress all increased when lockdown measures were reintroduced, but not to the same levels as the initial lockdown period. Overall changes in depression and anxiety from baseline to the end of the program were explained by changes in COVID related distress, whereas changes in self-compassion explained changes in stress. We show that it is feasible and acceptable to develop and deliver a program of brief interventions in a timely manner, using a simple and accessible online platform. Although participation in the program was initially associated with reduced symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress, participants' mental health worsened with the reintroduction of a 'lockdown' period. However, as symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress did not return to levels observed at the start of the VU Elevenses program, participation in the uncontrolled intervention may have offered a protective benefit against the impact of the second significant lockdown period.","Parker, Dash, Bourke, Patten, Craike, Baldwin, Hosking, Levinger, Apostolopoulos, de Courten, Sharples, Naslund, Stavropoulos, Woessner, Sonn, Stansen, Pascoe","https://doi.org/10.2196/35776","20220119","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-20","",25703,""
"Mental Health During the First Year of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Review and Recommendations for Moving Forward","COVID-19 has infected millions of people and upended the lives of most humans on the planet. Researchers from across the psychological sciences have sought to document and investigate the impact of COVID-19 in myriad ways, causing an explosion of research that is broad in scope, varied in methods, and challenging to consolidate. Because policy and practice aimed at helping people live healthier and happier lives requires insight from robust patterns of evidence, this article provides a rapid and thorough summary of high-quality studies available through early 2021 examining the mental-health consequences of living through the COVID-19 pandemic. Our review of the evidence indicates that anxiety, depression, and distress increased in the early months of the pandemic. Meanwhile, suicide rates, life satisfaction, and loneliness remained largely stable throughout the first year of the pandemic. In response to these insights, we present seven recommendations (one urgent, two short-term, and four ongoing) to support mental health during the pandemic and beyond.","Aknin, De Neve, Dunn, Fancourt, Goldberg, Helliwell, Jones, Karam, Layard, Lyubomirsky, Rzepa, Saxena, Thornton, VanderWeele, Whillans, Zaki, Karadag, Ben Amor","https://doi.org/10.1177/17456916211029964","20220119","COVID-19; loneliness; mental health; psychological distress; self-harm; social connection; subjective well-being; suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-20","",25704,""
"Risk Factors and Psychological Consequences of COVID-19 Outbreak: Perspective and Experience of Iranian Healthcare Workers on the Front Lines","Frontline Healthcare workers (HCWs) caring for patients with COVID-19 have a high risk of developing mental health problems. Recognizing the risk factors and consequences of care in this group of people can lead to preventive and interventional measures to maintain and improve their mental health and ultimately improve the quality of their care. This qualitative content analysis study was conducted between September 2020 and February 2021 in Iran. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews with 22 HCWs working directly with COVID-19 patients. Data were analyzed with conventional content analysis method. Results showed that data analysis led to the production of 163 codes, 45 categories (16 risk factors and 29 consequences) and 9 themes including ""late understanding of the nature of the disease"", ""sudden changes in roles"", ""difficult and overwhelming management"" ""Care for the older adults: Double Care"", ""Crisis at the Heart of the Crisis"", ""Ethical Dilemmas"", ""Obsessive Behaviors and Thoughts: The Consequences of Mass Death Anxiety "",""Positive Outcomes of Caring for COVID-19 patients"" and ""threatening strategies"". Overall, these results suggest that caring for a patient with COVID-19 is associated with positive and negative psychological consequences. Therefore, measures such as increasing sensitivity to crisis situations, self-adjustment skills training, pre-job training and in-service training, using ""Coordinator Manager"" and ""Assistant Managers"" in crisis situations, access to an experienced psychologist, implementation of the plan ""Discharge nurse"", training family caregivers and identifying signs of job burnout due to moral conflicts can reduce or eliminate the risk factors for negative psychological consequences in HCWs.","Shamsalinia, Mahmoudian, Bahrami, Ghaffari","https://doi.org/10.1111/disa.12532","20220119","COVID-19; Iran; consequence; healthcare workers; psychological risk factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-20","",25705,""

Of the 27Ã‚Â 036 participants, 17Ã‚Â 526 (65%) were workers who did not require routine medical care, 8451 (31%) were using medical care as scheduled, and 1059 (4%) experienced interrupted medical care. The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of sickness presenteeism was significantly higher among workers who experienced interrupted medical care (3.44; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.04-3.89) than those who did not require routine medical care. In terms of symptoms, the highest aOR was observed among workers with mental health symptoms (aOR: 5.59, 95% CI: 5.04-6.20).

"Influence of COVID-19 on the next generation of nurses in the United States","Examine the affective state (anxiety, depression), life satisfaction, stress and worry, media consumption and perceptions of pursuing a career in nursing amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Nursing students worldwide have reported increased stress, fear and anxiety amidst challenges and risks associated with COVID-19. It remains unclear what impact COVID-19 will have on nursing students in the United States (US) as they prepare to enter the workforce. Cross-sectional study of undergraduate nursing students at one university in the Northeastern United States. Students (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 161) completed an online survey (July 2020) about health and life satisfaction, affective state (depression, anxiety), stress and interest in pursuing nursing. Descriptive statistical analysis described sample and quantitative data. Linear regression was used to examine whether media consumption, stress, affective states predicted interest in pursuing a nursing career. Qualitative thematic analysis was applied to the open-ended question, 'How has COVID-19 influenced your interest in pursuing a nursing career?'. The Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research (SRQR) checklist was used to evaluate methodological quality. Mean stress score was 56.6 (range 0-100), 55.6% of respondents felt unsettled about the future, and 68.2% reported feeling overwhelmed. 18.7% of students reported moderate to severe anxiety, 19.8% reported moderate to severe depression and 54.4% reported that COVID-19 influenced their interest in nursing. Six themes emerged from qualitative analysis: no change, reaffirming/confirmatory, importance of nursing, reality check, positive influence and negative influence. Universities/colleges and nursing faculty should prioritise universal mental health assessment for nursing students and enhance mental health services to support and monitor this population. Mental health services to support nursing students are warranted in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

"The impact of COVID-19 on clinical care, self-management and mental health of patients with inflammatory arthritis","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown and ongoing restrictions in the UK affected access to clinical care, self-management and mental health for many patients with inflammatory arthritis. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of lockdown on inflammatory arthritis clinical care, self-management, disease outcomes and mental health. In total, 338 people with inflammatory arthritis participated in a prospective study, completing a series of online questionnaires. The questionnaires assessed demographics, inflammatory arthritis condition and management, clinical care, quality of life and mental health. Visual analogue scales (VASs) were completed at each assessment. Linear regression, controlling for confounders, was conducted to determine factors associated with physical and mental health outcomes. More than half of participants reported worsening VAS by &gt;10 points for patient global assessment (PGA), pain, fatigue and emotional distress during the initial lockdown. Changes in clinical care were associated with worse PGA (<i>b</i> = 8.95, <i>P</i> = 0.01), pain (<i>b</i> = 7.13, <i>P</i> = 0.05), fatigue (<i>b</i> = 17.01, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.01) and emotional distress (<i>b</i> = 12.78, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.01). Emotional distress and depression were also associated with worse outcomes in PGA, pain and fatigue, whereas loneliness was not. In contrast, physical activity seemed to mitigate these effects. Loneliness did not show any associations with outcomes. Over time, these effects decreased or disappeared. Changes to clinical care owing to lockdown were associated with worse disease outcomes in patients with inflammatory arthritis.

In Spain, as a result of the pandemic due to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), this health issue has been revived and has also been the subject of parliamentary debates. This idea is not new because within the Greco-Roman medical tradition continued by the Arabs, all the great authors included in their texts chapters on general hygienic-dietary norms to lead a healthy life, their own medical genre called ""health regimen"". In Al-Andalus, the Jewish doctor Maimonides (1138-1204) was nine centuries ahead of the concept of mental health or hygiene of the soul and its disorders, topics now included in the field of psychology, psychiatry and psychosomatic medicine. Maimonides drew up a body of doctrine on mental disorders and systematized a complete management of them from a comprehensive view of the patient as a person, based on four preventive and therapeutic measures to achieve mental balance: a) a general health regime; b) mental and emotional re-education; c) measures to reduce anxiety; and d) specific antidepressant medication. These recommendations are the most original made up to then, even many of them are still valid today due to their modernity. In this historical context, Maimonides constitutes a scientific bridge between the Middle Ages and our era. SegÃƒÂºn la OrganizaciÃƒÂ³n Mundial de Salud (OMS) la salud mental es un componente fundamental del estilo de vida saludable. Actualmente, esta nociÃƒÂ³n se ha hecho universal y ha calado en la conciencia ciudadana, en la sociedad y en la agenda polÃƒÂ­tica de los programas de Salud PÃƒÂºblica. En EspaÃƒÂ±a, a consecuencia de la pandemia debida a la Enfermedad por Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), este asunto sanitario se ha reavivado y ha sido motivo tambiÃƒÂ©n de debates parlamentarios. Esta idea no es nueva pues dentro de la tradiciÃƒÂ³n mÃƒÂ©dica grecolatina, continuada por los ÃƒÂ¡rabes, todos los grandes autores incluyeron en sus textos capÃƒÂ­tulos acerca de normas higiÃƒÂ©nico-dietÃƒÂ©ticas generales para llevar una vida sana, gÃƒÂ©nero mÃƒÂ©dico propio denominado Ã¢â‚¬Å“rÃƒÂ©gimen de saludÃ¢â‚¬Â. En Al-Andalus, el mÃƒÂ©dico judÃƒÂ­o MaimÃƒÂ³nides (1138-1204) se adelantÃƒÂ³ en nueve siglos al concepto de salud mental o higiene del alma y sus trastornos, temas incluidos ahora en el campo de la psicologÃƒÂ­a, la psiquiatrÃƒÂ­a y la medicina psicosomÃƒÂ¡tica. MaimÃƒÂ³nides confeccionÃƒÂ³ un cuerpo de doctrina sobre las afecciones psÃƒÂ­quicas y sistematizÃƒÂ³ un manejo completo de las mismas desde una visiÃƒÂ³n integral del paciente como persona, basado en cuatro medidas preventivas y terapÃƒÂ©uticas para alcanzar el equilibrio psÃƒÂ­quico: a) un rÃƒÂ©gimen general de salud; b) reeducaciÃƒÂ³n mental y emocional; c) medidas para disminuir la ansiedad; y d) medicaciÃƒÂ³n especÃƒÂ­fica antidepresiva. Estas recomendaciones son las mÃƒÂ¡s originales hechas hasta entonces. Incluso muchas de ellas siguen vigentes actualmente por su modernidad. En este contexto histÃƒÂ³rico MaimÃƒÂ³nides constituye un puente cientÃƒÂ­fico entre el Medievo y nuestra era.","Herrera Carranza","https://www.google.com/search?q=[The+Maimonides+mental+health+regime+(1138-1204):+nine+centuries+ahead.]","20220119","Antidepressant medication; Healthy lifestyle; Jewish physician; Mental health; Mental hygiene; Psychosomatic medicine; Public health; Spain","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-20","",25712,""
"Monitoring of COVID-19 Pandemic-related Psychopathology using Machine Learning","The COVID-19 pandemic is believed to have a major negative impact on global mental health due to the viral disease itself as well as the associated lockdowns, social distancing, isolation, fear, and increased uncertainty. Individuals with preexisting mental illness are likely to be particularly vulnerable to these conditions and may develop outright ""COVID-19 related psychopathology"". Here, we trained a machine learning model on structured and natural text data from electronic health records to identify COVID-19 pandemic-related psychopathology among patients receiving care in the Psychiatric Services of the Central Denmark Region. Subsequently, applying this model, we found that pandemic-related psychopathology covaries with the pandemic pressure over time. These findings may aid psychiatric services in their planning during the ongoing and future pandemics. Furthermore, the results are a testament to the potential of applying machine learning to data from electronic health records.","Enevoldsen, Danielsen, Rohde, Jefsen, Nielbo, ÃƒËœstergaard","https://doi.org/10.1017/neu.2022.2","20220119","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Machine Learning; Mental Disorders; Natural Language Processing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-20","",25713,""
"Association between COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and generalized trust, depression, generalized anxiety, and fear of COVID-19","Although numerous studies have been published on the predictors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, some possible predictors remain underexplored. In this study, we explored the associations of unwillingness and indecisiveness regarding COVID-19 vaccination with generalized trust, mental health conditions such as depression and generalized anxiety, and fear of COVID-19. Data of wave 1 (from October 27 till November 6, 2020) and wave 3 (from April 23 till May 6, 2021) of a longitudinal online study conducted in Japan were used for the analyses. Unvaccinated participants were asked at wave 3 about their willingness to be vaccinated, with possible responses of willing, unwilling, or undecided. These three responses were used as the outcome variable, and multinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted with willingness to be vaccinated as the reference group. Explanatory variables included generalized trust, depression, generalized anxiety, and fear of COVID-19 both at wave 1 and 3, and sociodemographic and health-related variables. Of the 11,846 valid respondents, 209 (1.8%) answered that they had already been vaccinated against COVID-19, 7089 (59.8%) responded that they were willing to be vaccinated, 3498 (29.5%) responded that they were undecided, and 1053 (8.9%) responded that they were unwilling to be vaccinated. After adjusting for covariates, we found that: (1) participants with lower levels of generalized trust at wave 1 and 3 were more likely to be undecided or unwilling at wave 3; (2) respondents with moderately severe or severe depression at wave 1 and 3 were more likely to be undecided at wave 3; (3) participants with moderate or severe levels of generalized anxiety at wave 3 but not at wave 1 were more likely to be unwilling at wave 3; and (4) respondents with high levels of fear of COVID-19 at wave 1 and 3 were less likely to be undecided and unwilling at wave 3. Generalized trust, mental health conditions such as depression and generalized anxiety, and low level of fear of COVID-19 are associated with unwillingness or indecision regarding being vaccinated against COVID-19.","Sekizawa, Hashimoto, Denda, Ochi, So","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-12479-w","20220119","COVID-19; Depression; Fear of COVID-19; Generalized anxiety; Generalized trust; Vaccine hesitancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-20","",25714,""
"Examining COVID-19 vaccine uptake and attitudes among 2SLGBTQ+ youth experiencing homelessness","The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted 2SLGBTQ+ youth experiencing homelessness. Little is known about vaccine attitudes and uptake among this population. To address this, the objectives of this study were to explore this group's COVID-19 vaccine attitudes, and facilitators and barriers impacting vaccine uptake. 2SLGBTQ+ youth experiencing homelessness in the Greater Toronto Area were recruited to participate in online surveys assessing demographic characteristics, mental health, health service use, and COVID-19 vaccine attitudes. Descriptive statistics and statistical tests were used to analyze survey data to explore variables associated with vaccine confidence. Additionally, a select group of youth and frontline workers from youth serving organizations were invited to participate in online one-on-one interviews. An iterative thematic content approach was used to analyze interview data. Quantitative and qualitative data were merged for interpretation by use of a convergent parallel analytical design. Ninety-two youth completed surveys and 32 youth and 15 key informants participated in one-on-one interviews. Quantitative and qualitative data showed that the majority of 2SLGBTQ+ youth experiencing homelessness were confident in the COVID-19 vaccine; however, numerous youth were non-vaccine confident due to mistrust in the healthcare system, lack of targeted vaccine-related public health information, concerns about safety and side effects, and accessibility issues. Solutions to increase vaccine confidence were provided, including fostering trust, targeted public health messaging, and addressing accessibility needs. Our study highlights the need for the vaccine strategy and rollouts to prioritize 2SLGBTQ+ youth experiencing homelessness and to address the pervasive health disparities that have been exacerbated by the pandemic.","Abramovich, Pang, Kunasekaran, Moss, Kiran, Pinto","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-12537-x","20220119","2SLGBTQ+ youth; COVID-19 vaccines; Gender identity; Homelessness; Mixed-methods; Sexual orientation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-20","",25715,""
"'You just really have to assert yourself:' social work, nursing, and rehabilitation counseling student experiences of providing integrated behavioral health services before and after the immediate start of COVID-19","Educators who train healthcare students to provide behavioral health services in primary care settings frequently encounter challenges as they work to ensure that students acquire the knowledge and skills to effectively function on interprofessional practice teams. This has become increasingly important during COVID-19, as interprofessional collaborative practice is needed more than ever to address the interrelated health, mental health, and social structural issues linked to the pandemic. We used qualitative focus groups to understand the experiences of 6 interprofessional teams (comprised of graduate social work, nursing, and rehabilitation counseling students; nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°19) providing behavioral health services in primary care settings before and after the immediate start of COVID-19. To triangulate data and enrich findings, one focus group with students' faculty supervisors was also conducted; nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°5). Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Four themes highlighted student participants' need to assert themselves at the beginning of their educational experience, to communicate and learn from one another to develop positive team dynamics, to contend with role confusion and missed opportunities for collaboration, and to manage the emotional impact of COVID-19 on learning. Findings indicate that educators should work with clinical faculty and agency supervisors to orient students to ensure they have role clarity within the agency. Graduate students providing behavioral health services should also learn to work collaboratively within their scopes of practice to serve patients virtually, especially in preparation for public health emergencies.","Alessi, Caldwell, Zazzarino, Greenfield, Findley","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-022-07465-w","20220119","COVID-19; Healthcare students; Integrated behavioral health; Interprofessional collaborative practice; Interprofessional education; Primary care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-20","",25716,""

"Studentsâ€™ self-reported well-being under corona measures, lessons for the future","As education was forced to go fully online in early 2020 as a consequence of the imposed lockdowns, concerns were raised related to student well-being. This study examines student well-being at the science faculty of a large urban university in the Netherlands within the framework of Basic Psychological Need Theory, a sub-theory of Self-Determination Theory. A mixed-methods approach was adopted, combining the results of an online student survey with 16 Likert-scale questions as well as two open ended questions (2228 participants, corresponding to a response rate of 32%) with a student focus group interview. The Likert-scale questions were subjected to factor analyses and reveal problems with well-being in four areas: study, personal worries, personal well-being, and societal worries. The analyses of the answers to the open ended questions as well as the focus group data show that students are positive on the autonomy offered by the inherent flexibility of online education, e.g., as a consequence of reduced travel time. However, the psychological needs of competence and relatedness are seriously undermined during times of lockdown, mainly because of poorer student-teacher interaction, lack of structure, loneliness, and helplessness. Students state that they need more support in these areas, for example by on-campus meetings whenever possible, psychological support, improvements in online education, online social events, adequate communication, and leniency in the interpretation of regulations and deadlines. Implications are discussed.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e08733","20220101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-20","",25719,""

"Psychotic-like experiences in the lonely predict conspiratorial beliefs and are associated with the diet during COVID-19","The Covid-19 pandemic has increased the occurrence of conspiracy theories. It has been suggested that a greater endorsement of these theories may be associated with psychotic-like experiences (PLEs), as well as with social isolation. In this preregistered study, we investigated whether both PLEs and measures of social isolation (e.g., loneliness) can predict conspiratorial beliefs and, if so, which of these variables can mediate the association with conspiratorial beliefs. Furthermore, based on previous studies on schizophrenia, we explored whether the diet is associated with PLEs and conspiratorial beliefs. Participants (N=142) completed online questionnaires measuring PLEs, social isolation, mental well-being, and conspiratorial beliefs. They also submitted their daily food intake for a week using a smartphone app. We found that loneliness predicted the endorsement of conspiracy theories during the Covid-19 lockdown. Strikingly, the proneness to experience subclinical psychotic symptoms played an underlying mediating role. In addition, these subclinical symptoms were associated with lower fruit, carbohydrate and iron intakes, as well as with higher fat intake. Our results add insights into how conspiratorial beliefs can affect individualsâ€™ mental health and relationships. Moreover, these results open the avenue for potential novel intervention strategies to optimize food intake in individuals with psychotic-like experiences.","Damiano Terenzi et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0083-37E-2F4","20220118","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; loneliness; conspiratorial beliefs; psychotic-like experiences; diet; nutrition","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-20","",25721,""
"Afterword: Coping through crisis with coronamusic","The COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 was accompanied by a mental health epidemic creating an extensive demand for safe, widely accessible, and highly individualized coping strategies. Engaging with music in new and innovative ways became the potentially most frequent and effective solitary and virtually-collective leisure activity for maintaining psychological wellbeing during lockdown. Emerging research findings that interest in corona-themed repertoireâ€”coined ""coronamusic""â€”became the strongest predictor of socio-emotional coping efficacy point towards a potentially adaptive function of thematically tailored musical innovations in human coping behaviour on historical and evolutionary timescales. This afterword starts with an exemplifying overview of the musical and societal responses to the coronavirus in Denmark. Next, based on a review of the emerging research literature on the role of music for pandemic coping, a model is proposed of key structural and contextual features of the coronamusic phenomenon. This may pave the way for including musical measures in collective and individual toolboxes for managing future societal crises.","Niels Chr.

"Reflections, Resilience, and Recovery: A qualitative study of the COVID-19 impact on an international general populationâ€™s mental health and priorities for support","The impact of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on different countries and populations is well documented in quantitative studies, with some studies showing stable mental health symptoms and others showing fluctuating symptoms. However, the reasons behind why some symptoms are stable and others change are under-explored, which in turn makes identifying the types of support needed by participants themselves challenging. To address these gaps, this study thematically analysed 925 qualitative responses from five open-ended responses collected in the UCL-Penn Global COVID Study between 17 April to 31 July 2021 (wave 3). Three key themes comprised of 13 codes were reported by participants across countries and ages regarding the impact of COVID-19 on their health, both mental and physical, and livelihoods. These include: 1) Outlook on self/life, 2) Self-improvement, and 3) Loved ones (friends and family). In terms of support, while 2.91% did not require additional support, 91% wanted support beyond financial. Other unexpected new themes were also discussed regarding vulnerable populations suffering disproportionately. The pandemic has brought into sharp focus various changes in peopleâ€™s mental health, physical health, and relationships.

"Parent and child mental health during COVID-19 in Australia: The role of pet attachment","Restrictions, social isolation, and uncertainty related to the global COVID-19 pandemic have disrupted the ways that parents and children maintain family routines, health, and wellbeing. Companion animals (pets) can be a critical source of comfort during traumatic experiences, although changes to family routines, such as those caused by COVID-19, can also bring about challenges like managing undesirable pet behaviours or pet-human interactions. We aimed to examine the relationship between pet attachment and mental health for both parents and their children during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. A total of 1,034 parents living with a child under 18 years and a cat or dog completed an online cross-sectional survey. Path analysis using multivariate linear regression was conducted to examine associations between objective COVID-19 impacts, subjective worry about COVID-19, human-pet attachment, and mental health. After adjusting for core demographic factors, stronger pet-child attachment was associated with greater child anxiety (parent-reported, p<.001). Parent-pet attachment was not associated with self-reported psychological distress (p=.42), however, parents who reported a strong emotional closeness with their pet reported greater psychological distress (p=.002). Findings highlight the role of pets during times of change and uncertainty. It is possible that families are turning to animals as a source of comfort, during a time when traditional social supports are less accessible. Alternatively, strong pet attachment is likely to reflect high levels of empathy, which might increase vulnerability to psychological distress. Longitudinal evidence is required to delineate the mechanisms underpinning pet attachment and mental health.","Shannon Bennetts","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0124-DF7-4A2","20220117","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Animal Learning and Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods|Statistical Methods; covid-19; companion animals; wellbeing; human-animal interaction; mental health","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-20","",25724,""
"A hidden pandemic? An umbrella review of global evidence on mental health in the time of COVID-19","Introduction: Vast available international evidence has investigated the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. This review aims to synthesise evidence, identifying populations and characteristics associated with poor mental health. Methods: A meta-review of pooled prevalence of anxiety and depression, with subgroup analyses for the general population, healthcare workers (HCW) and COVID-19 patients; and a meta-synthesis of systematic reviews to collate evidence on associated factors and further mental disorders. Databases searched included Scopus, Embase, PsycINFO, and MEDLINE dated to May 2021. Eligibility criteria included systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses, published post-November 2019, reporting data in English on mental health outcomes during the pandemic. Results: Eighty-one systematic reviews were included, 51 of which incorporated meta-analysis. Meta-review overall anxiety prevalence was 29% (95%CI: 27â€“31%, I2: 99.83%), with subgroup prevalence as 35% (95%CI: 23â€“47%, I2: 97.4%) in COVID-19 patients, 29% in HCW (95%CI: 25â€“ 32, I2: 99.8%) and 28% in the general population (95%CI: 25â€“31%, I2: 99.9%). Meta-review overall depression prevalence was 28% (95%CI: 26â€“30%, I2: 99.7), with subgroup prevalence as 30% (95%CI: 7â€“60%, I2: 99.8%) in COVID-19 patients, 28% (95%CI: 25â€“31%, I2: 99.7%) in HCW and 27% (95%CI: 25â€“30, I2: 99.8%) in the general population. Meta-synthesis found many experienced psychological distress and PTSD/PTSS during COVID-19, but pooled prevalence ranged substantially. Fear of, proximity to, or confirmed COVID-19 infection; undergoing quarantine; and COVID-19-related news exposure were associated with adverse mental health outcomes. Amongst other factors, people who are younger, female, LGBTIQ, pregnant, parents or experiencing low social support, financial issues or socio-economic disadvantage, tended to have poorer mental health during the pandemic period. Conclusions: Despite high volumes of reviews, the diversity of findings and dearth of longitudinal studies within reviews means clear links between COVID-19 and mental health are not available, although existing evidence indicates probable associations.","Dr Marlee Bower et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0080-E4F-337","20220114","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; covid-19; umbrella review; meta-synthesis; systematic review; pandemic; meta-review; mental health","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-20","",25725,""
"Joint and independent effects of maternal prenatal depression and SARS-CoV-2 exposure on infant cognitive and socioemotional development across the first postnatal year","Here we evaluate longitudinal neurodevelopmental trajectories across the first postnatal year in infants of mothers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during pregnancy. Ninety-three pregnant mothers were recruited beginning at the first peak of the pandemic in New York City, and were oversampled for SARS-CoV-2 exposure during pregnancy (n = 36 COVID-19 exposed mothers). At 6 months postpartum, infant attentional processing was measured remotely using an online webcam-linked eye tracker developed for infant remote research in the home environment. At 12 months, infant socioemotional development was evaluated through maternal-report using validated surveys. Results indicated that interactions between maternal depressive symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 exposure during pregnancy were linked with individual differences in infantsâ€™ attentional processing at 6 months of age. Specifically, in mothers reporting positive exposure to SARS-CoV-2, higher prenatal depressive symptoms were associated with attentional patterns characterized by increased orienting to salient stimuli, longer looking times, and lower levels of maternal-reported measures of attentional control. In turn, these attentional patterns subsequently predicted socioemotional competence at 12 months, over and beyond individual contributions of prenatal depression, SARS-CoV-2 exposure, or relevant infant or family characteristics. These findings provide preliminary evidence of phenotypic adaptations in attentional processing by infants of mothers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and highlight infant attentional processing as a relevant early behavioral predictor of longitudinal developmental trajectories.","Denise Werchan et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0127-DD4-B4C","20220111","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Infancy","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-20","",25726,""
"Prevalence and correlates of depression and anxiety among Chinese international students in US colleges during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study","Previous studies showed that the COVID-19 outbreak increased the levels of depression and anxiety in heterogeneous populations. This study examines the prevalence of depression and anxiety among Chinese international students enrolled in US universities during the COVID-19 pandemic and identifies the associated factors, including habits, social and psychological support, sleep quality, and remote learning. Participants were recruited with snowball sampling through 21 Chinese international student associations in US universities. The survey consisted of demographic questions, the Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS), the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and self-constructed questions on academic performance, financial concerns, use of social media, physical exercise, and psychological support. Cut-off scores of 10 were used for both PHQ-9 and GAD-7 to determine the binary outcomes of depression and anxiety, respectively. Bivariant analyses and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the associated factors. Among 1881 participants, we found a prevalence of depression at 24.5% and that of anxiety at 20.7%. Multiple correlatesâ€”including recent exposure to traumatic event(s), pandemic-related financial concerns, workload, social support, remote learning, willingness to seek professional help, and sleep qualityâ€”were identified. It is critical for future studies to further investigate this student population and for universities to provide more flexible learning options and more access to psychological services.","Chenyang Lin et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0064-CE7-4C5","20220111","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Mental Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; college student; covid-19; risk factors; epidemiology; anxiety; international student; online survey; depression","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-20","",25727,""
"Companionship and worries in uncertain times: Australian parentsâ€™ experiences of children and pets during COVID-19","Companion animals (pets), especially cats and dogs, have featured regularly in the media and public discourse during the global COVID-19 pandemic, including increased demand for pet adoption and more time spent with existing pets. This qualitative study aimed to describe the experiences of Australian parents with a child under 18 years and a cat or dog. Within a broader survey, parents were asked open-ended questions about the benefits and challenges for their family of living with a cat or dog during COVID-19, and where relevant, about reasons for adopting a new pet. Data were collected between July and October 2020, during Australiaâ€™s â€˜second waveâ€™ of COVID-19, when some Australians were subject to strict physical distancing or â€˜stay at homeâ€™ orders. A total of 611 parents provided at least one free-text response. Inductive template analysis was conducted on all responses; 33 unique codes were identified and mapped onto a biopsychosocial model under three themes: (i) â€œTrying to Stay Healthy and Wellâ€ (biological), (ii) â€œComfort, Coping and Worriesâ€ (psychological), and â€œSpending More Time Togetherâ€ (social). Findings highlight the therapeutic role of pets for families during times of change and uncertainty, as well as the significant social impact of pandemic-related restrictions on family units. Benefits included support for the familyâ€™s physical and mental health, maintenance of family routines, distraction, comfort, and pets as an opportunity to connect with others. Challenges were numerous and diverse, such as cost and access to pet care, behavioural concerns, worries about pet and child wellbeing, and reflections about the petâ€™s mortality. These findings demonstrate the complex and varied impacts of the pandemic on families with children and pets; some families are likely to require ongoing psychological, financial, and veterinary supports.","Shannon Bennetts","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E01E7-88F-AA6","20220117","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Self-regulation; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Affect and Emotion Regulation; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Well-being; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Animal Learning and Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Interpersonal Relationships; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; children; parents; covid-19; qualitative; families","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-20","",25728,""

"Mental health disorders among students from rural areas three months after returning to school: a cross-sectional study among Polish students (12-13 yo)","Abstract: Background: All over the world, the negative impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on children and adolescentsâ€™ mental health is observed. The conducted research aims to verify whether returning to schools, to the education inside the classroom in the company of their peers, improved or undermined the studentsâ€™ mental health. Metods: The study was carried out on a sample of students inhabiting rural areas in a borderland region. The research sample was collected using purposive sampling and consisted of 552 respondents from 7th and 8th grades of primary school. An auditorium questionnaire was used to gather the research material. Results: Three months after returning to school, the students are in a bad mental condition. 61% of the respondents are satisfied with their lives, 52% of the respondents show symptoms of depression measured with the WHO-5 index, whereas 85% of them have average and high stress levels as measured with the PSSC scale. Higher levels of mental disorders was observed among females, the students inhabiting villages and evaluating their financial status as worse. Conclusions: Returning to schools failed to have a positive impact on the studentsâ€™ mental health. Disorders occurring at a large scale will have a negative influence on the studentsâ€™ performance and hinder their re-adaptation to school. Educational authorities shall immediately provide the students with support and monitor the situation in the next months.","Piotr Dlugosz","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E00D2-60E-4D5","20220114","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|School Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; the covid-19 pandemic; adolescents; rural areas; students returning to schools; mental health","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-20","",25730,""
"ENACT Study: What has helped health and social care workers maintain their mental wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic? Adaptive coping, team resilience, help-seeking behaviour and work based supports","Rapid studies have highlighted the adverse mental health impact of COVID-19 on health and social care workers (HSCWs). Complementing this work, we report on the psychosocial factors that have helped HSCWs adapt to the adversities associated with COVID-19 and protect staff wellbeing in Scotland. The ENACT study collected data from HSCWs (n= 1364) in Scotland during the third national lockdown. Using a cross-sectional design, participants completed an online survey providing quantitative data and free responses. A multi-method approach to analysis was used. The majority of HSCWs were found to have low wellbeing scores, high levels of COVID-19 stress, worry, burnout and risk perception scores and almost half of HSCWs met the clinical cut off for acute stress. Adaptive coping strategies and increased perceived team resilience helped mitigate against the adverse impact that COVID-19 stressors have on HSCWsâ€™ mental wellbeing. HSCWs were significantly more likely to seek informal support for dealing with personal or emotional problems. Barriers to formal help-seeking were identified including stigma and fears of consequence of disclosure. HSCWs most valued peer support, workplace supports, visible leadership and teamwork. Our findings illuminate the complexity of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on HSCWsâ€™ wellbeing and will inform future intervention development to increase positive adaptation amongst staff. Addressing barriers to mental health help-seeking among HSCWs is essential. The implications emphasise the importance of lessons learned across health and social care contexts, planning and preparedness for future pandemics.","Nicola Cogan et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E006D-10A-E2D","20220113","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Industrial and Organizational Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-20","",25731,""
"Psychopathology and Resilience Following Strict COVID-19 Lockdowns in Hubei, China: Examining Person- and Context-Level Predictors for Longitudinal Trajectories","In Hubei, China, where the COVID-19 epidemic first emerged, the government has enforced strict quarantine and lockdown measures. Longitudinal studies suggest that the impact of adverse events on psychological adjustment is highly heterogenous. To better understand protective and risk factors that predict longitudinal psychopathology and resilience following strict COVID-19 lockdowns, this study used unsupervised machine learning to identify half-year longitudinal trajectories (April, June, August, and October, 2020) of three mental health outcomes (depression, anxiety, and PTSD) among a sample of Hubei residents (N = 326), assessed a broad range of person- and context-level predictors, and applied LASSO logistic regression, a supervised machine learning approach, to select best predictors for trajectory memberships of resilience and chronic psychopathology. Across outcomes, most individuals remained resilient. Models with both person- and context-level predictors showed excellent predictive accuracy, except for models predicting chronic anxiety. The person-level models showed either good or excellent predictive accuracy. The context-level models showed good predictive accuracy for depression trajectories but were only fair in predicting trajectories of anxiety and PTSD. Overall, the most critical person-level predictors were worry, optimism, fear of COVID, and coping flexibility, whereas important context-level predictors included features of stressful life events, community satisfaction, and family support. This study identified clinical patterns of response to COVID-19 lockdowns and used a combination of risk and protective factors to accurately differentiate these patterns. These findings have implications for clinical risk identifications and interventions in the context of potential trauma.","Shuquan Chen et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E00C8-4AD-B6A","20220105","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; psychopathology; machine learning; trajectory; resilience; covid-19","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-20","",25732,""

The pilot adopted a non-randomised controlled design with 266 students (33% international students). Of these, 157 were in the INTERVENTION condition (students who participated in any aspect of the Sharper Minds package: app tracker or one of the short courses) and 109 were in the CONTROL condition (students who completed pre and post surveys only). Results showed a significantly greater benefit to students in the Intervention v Control on pre to post changes in % screening positive for mental health problems, and scores on measures of depression, wellbeing, and loneliness. Students in both conditions improved across semester on measures of anxiety, somatic symptoms, number of academic stressors and number of COVID-19 related stressors.

"A new typology of psychological mechanisms underlying prosocial decisions","Charitable giving, volunteering, climate-friendly choices, and most recently changing oneâ€™s lifestyle to stop the spread of the coronavirus are all examples of prosocial behavior. Prosociality can be investigated from different perspectives including the â€œwho-questionâ€ (which people are more likely to help), and the â€œwhen-questionâ€ (which situational factors stimulate helping?), but in this article we focus primarily on the â€œwhy-questionâ€ (which emotions and cognitions motivate helping?) Specifically, this article tries to organize and synthesize literature related to emotions, thoughts, and beliefs (i.e. psychological mechanisms) that motivate or demotivate human helping behavior. To do this, we present a new typology including four overarching interrelated categories, each encompassing multiple subcategories. (1) Emotions: (a) emotional reactions elicited by the need situation such as empathic concern/sympathy, (b) positive or negative attitudes toward the beneficiary or the requester, (c) incidental mood. (2) Moral principles: (a) personal responsibility, (b) fairness-concerns, (c) aversion towards causing harm. (3) Anticipated impact: (a) self-efficacy (e.g. â€œcan I make a difference?â€) and (b) response-efficacy (e.g., â€œis this cause/project efficient and worthwhile?â€). (4) Anticipated personal consequences: (a) material, (b) social and (c) emotional costs and benefits that the helper expects will follow if she helps or if she does not help. Increased knowledge about the â€œwhoâ€ (e.g. individual differences in demography or personality) and â€œwhenâ€ (situational antecedents such as characteristic of those in need, or type of solicitation) can surely help predict and even increase prosociality, but we argue that to understand the psychology of helping we need to also consider the psychological mechanisms underlying prosocial decisions (the â€œwhy-questionâ€). We compare our typology against related theoretical frameworks, and present the pros and cons with different methodological approaches of testing psychological mechanisms of helping, with the aim to help researchers and practitioners better organize and understand the many psychological factors that influence prosocial decisions.","Arvid Erlandsson et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E01B7-2C8-952","20211230","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Moral Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Cognition; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Affect and Emotion Regulation; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Impression Formation; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Self and Social Identity; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Prosocial Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Motivational Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; emotion regulation; prosocial motivation; anticipated costs and benefits; psychological mechanisms of helping; egoistic motives; moral principles; emotional reactions; impression management; emphatic concern; perceived impact; altruism","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-20","",25735,""

"Maturation-dependent vulnerability of emotion regulation as a response to COVID-19 related stress in adolescents","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic created highly unpredictable circumstances which resulted in increased levels of psychological strain. Here we investigate pandemic-related alterations in emotion regulation in adolescents assessed before and during the pandemic. We also take biological age into account in the response to the pandemic. Methods: We compared baseline data on the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) total scores of a pre-pandemic adolescent cohort (n=241) with those obtained during the second wave of the pandemic (n=266). We estimated biological age based on an ultrasonic boneage assessment procedure in a subgroup of males. We included both grammar school and vocational school students in the 9th and 10th grades and analyzed their data independently. Findings: There is a gender difference in the timing of vulnerability for pandemic-related stress in grammar school students: females are affected a year earlier than males. Vocational school male students mature faster than grammar school male students, and the timing of emotional vulnerability also precedes that of the grammar school students. Discussion: We interpret our findings in a developmental model suggesting that there might be a window of highest vulnerability in adolescent emotion regulation. The timing of the window is determined by both chronological and biological age, and it seems to be different for females and males. Application to Practice: Defining the exact temporal windows of vulnerability for different adolescent cohorts allows for the timely integration of preventive actions into adolescent care to protect mental health during future chronic stressful situations.","Patricia Gervan et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0150-1E8-D06","20211222","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; boneage; adolescence; emotion regulation; pubertal maturation; covid-19; ders","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-20","",25737,""
"Coping with COVID: Risk and Resilience Factors for Mental Health in a German Representative Panel Study","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic might affect mental health. Data from population-representative panel surveys with multiple waves including pre-COVID data investigating risk and protective factors are still rare. Methods: In a stratified random sample of the German household population (n=6,684), we conducted survey-weighted multiple linear regressions to determine the association of various psychological risk and protective factors with changes in psychological distress (PD; measured via PHQ-4) from pre-pandemic (average of 2016 and 2019) to peri-pandemic (both 2020 and 2021) time points. Control analyses on PD change between two pre-pandemic time points (2016 and 2019) were conducted. Regularized regressions were computed to inform on which factors were statistically most influential in the multicollinear setting. Results: PHQ-4 in 2020 (M=2.45) and 2021 (M=2.21) was elevated compared to 2019 (M=1.79). Several risk factors (catastrophizing, neuroticism, asking for instrumental support) and protective factors (perceived stress recovery, positive reappraisal, optimism) were identified for the peri-pandemic outcomes. Control analyses revealed that in pre-pandemic times, neuroticism and optimism were predominantly related to PD changes. Regularized regression mostly confirmed the results and highlighted perceived stress recovery as most consistent influential protective factor across peri-pandemic outcomes. Conclusions: We identified several psychological risk and protective factors related to PD outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Comparison to pre-pandemic data stress the relevance of longitudinal assessments to potentially reconcile contradictory findings. Implications and suggestions for targeted prevention and intervention programs during highly stressful times such as pandemics are discussed.","Antje Riepenhausen et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0112-40A-88D","20211220","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; psychological distress; covid-19; resilience; protective factors; risk factors; mental health","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-20","",25738,""
"Perceived need of psychological support for taboo obsessions in new parents: A cross-sectional survey","Previous research has shown that many new parents experience intrusive thoughts about intentionally harming their child, also known as â€œtaboo obsessionsâ€. These thoughts can for some parents lead to increased anxiety, depression and have a negative impact on parental function and quality of life. Taboo obsessions can be stigmatizing and many parents who could benefit from psychological support do not seek help. One way to increase access to psychological interventions for new parents could be to deliver the treatment online. Our research group has developed and evaluated an internet-delivered intervention targeting taboo obsessions in individuals with a diagnosis obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), with promising results. It is conceivable that the intervention could be helpful to a large proportion of parents from the general population who struggle with taboo obsessions (i.e. not only individuals with OCD). In the current study, 594 new parents filled out an online survey about taboo obsessions and the perceived need for psychological support. Fifty six percent reported currently experiencing or had previously experienced taboo obsessions. About half (54%) responded that the taboo obsessions had a negative impact on their self-image. Additionally, 18-19% reported that the intrusive thoughts were difficult to control and/or had a negative impact on the relationship to the child. Importantly, 51% responded that they would absolutely or probably like to try online treatments for these intrusive thoughts. Keeping the limitations of an online survey in mind, the results suggest that an online intervention targeting taboo obsessions in new parents could be well received.","Klara Lauri et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E019D-A56-4A6","20211216","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; parenthood; online intervention.; psychological support; taboo obsessions","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-20","",25739,""
"Gay, Bisexual and other Men who have Sex with Men (GBMSM) remote mental health help-seeking during Covid-19","Gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) experience far worse mental health (MH) than wider society. This disparity was exacerbated by additional â€˜unique to sexual minority statusâ€™ COVID-19 stressors. This sequential, mixed-methods study examined MH help-seeking among GBMSM in the UK and Ireland during the first COVID-19 lockdown. Quantitative survey data (n=1,368), analysed with logistic regression, suggested GBMSM experiencing moderate-to-severe anxiety and those with a past MH diagnosis were most likely to seek MH support. Thematic analysis of qualitative interview (n=18) data identified multiple barriers and enablers to GBMSM seeking MH help, who focused on GBMSM-facing organisations and population-wide online resources. Finally, the behaviour change wheel was used to generate theoretically informed recommendations to promote MH help-seeking among GBMSM in Scotland.

"Adapting to Crisis: A Binational Study on the Impact of Flexibility on Latent Profiles of Coping with COVID-19","Introduction. The high level of uncertainty brought by the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the general populationâ€™s well-being and ability to cope with daily challenges. Studies indicate that flexibility, defined as the ability to employ and adapt a variety of emotional, cognitive, and behavioral strategies in accordance with changing contextual demands, may significantly contribute to coping with long-term stressors such as COVID-19. Objectives. We aimed to investigate which facets of flexibility predict different latent coping profiles in Israel and Germany. Methods. 2330 Israelis and 743 Germans completed online questionnaires measuring cognitive, emotional and trauma-related regulatory flexibility, and cognitive, emotional, and behavioral coping with COVID-19. Results. Analyses revealed three distinct coping profiles in each country (high, medium and low). These profiles differed in both anxiety and depression symptoms with the low coping group experiencing clinically relevant symptoms both in Israel and in Germany. Additionally, cognitive flexibility and trauma-related regulatory flexibility, but not emotion regulatory flexibility, emerged as significant predictors of coping in both countries. Conclusions. Training cognitive and trauma-related regulatory flexibility may help individuals to better cope with psychosocial stressors such as COVID-19. Such trainings could be selectively administered to less flexible subpopulations, as well as adapted to the specific population characteristics.","Alla Hemi et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E009A-B96-47D","20211223","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-20","",25741,""
"The impact of diet and lifestyle on wellbeing during COVID-19-lockdown","A healthy diet and lifestyle may protect against adverse mental health outcomes, which is especially crucial during stressful times, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This preregistered longitudinal online study explored whether diet and lifestyle (physical activity, sleep, and social interactions) could predict wellbeing and mood during a light lockdown in Germany. Participants (N = 117, 72 males; 28 <U+F0B1> 9 years old) answered mental health and lifestyle questionnaires (social connections, sleep, activity) followed by submitting one week of food and mood-lifestyle diary (food intake, positive and negative mood, mental wellbeing, sleep quality, physical activity level, quantity and quality of social interactions) via a smartphone app. We used multivariate linear and mixed-effects models to predict mood and wellbeing by using dietary components and lifestyle factors. Inter-individual analyses revealed that sleep and social interaction significantly impacted mood and wellbeing. Interestingly, fruit and vegetable intake predicted wellbeing, even when controlling for all lifestyle factors. Fruit and vegetable intake also significantly predicted daily fluctuations in wellbeing within individuals next to sleep, physical activity, and social interactions. We observed gender differences in fruit and vegetable intake and anxiety levels. Our results emphasize the importance of diet contributing to individual wellbeing, even in the challenging times of a pandemic.","Anne Muth et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0080-72E-D9D","20211217","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Prevention; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; activity; diet; ema; wellbeing; gender; covid-19; lifestyle","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-20","",25742,""
