"COVID-19 illness, SARS-CoV2 infection, and subsequent suicidal ideation in the French nationwide population-based EpiCov cohort : a propensity score analysis of more than 50,000 individuals","Symptomatic COVID-19 appears to be associated with suicidal ideation but longitudinal evidence is still scarce. SARS-CoV2-induced neurological damages might underline this association, but findings are inconsistent. We therefore investigated the association between COVID-19 disease and subsequent suicidal ideation in the general population, using both self-reported symptoms and serology as well as inverse probability weighting to draw as near as possible to the direct association. Using data from the nationwide French EpiCov cohort, COVID-19 disease was assessed through 1) COVID-19 illness (self-reported symptoms of sudden loss of taste/smell or fever alongside cough, shortness of breath or chest oppression, between February and November 2020), and 2) SARS-CoV2 infection (Spike protein ELISA test screening in dried-blood-spot samples). Suicidal ideation was self-reported between December 2020 and July 2021. Inverse probability weighting with propensity scores was used as an adjustment strategy, leading to balanced sociodemographic and health-related factors between the exposed and non-exposed groups of both COVID-19 disease measures. Then, modified Poisson regression models were used to investigate the association of COVID-19 illness and SARS-CoV2 infection with subsequent suicidal ideation. Among 52,050 participants from the EpiCov cohort, 1.68% [1.54%-1.82%] reported suicidal ideation in the first half of 2021, 9.57% [9.24%-9.90%] had a SARS-CoV2 infection in 2020 and 13.23% [12.86%-13.61%] reported COVID-19 symptoms in 2020. COVID-19 illness in 2020 was associated with higher risks of subsequent suicidal ideation in the first half of 2021 (Relative Riskipw [CI95%]= 1.43 [1.20-1.69]) while SARS-CoV2 infection in 2020 was not (RRipw = 0.88 [0.69-1.12]). If COVID-19 illness was associated with subsequent suicidal ideation, the exact role of SARS-CoV2 infection with respect to suicide risk has yet to be clarified. Psychological support should be offered to persons recovering from symptomatic COVID-19 in order to minimize suicidal ideation risk. Moreover, if such psychological support is to be implemented, serology status alone does not seem a relevant criterion to define persons who suffered from COVID-19 to prioritize.","Camille Davisse-Paturet; Massimiliano Orri; Stephane Legleye; Aline-Marie Florence; Jean-Baptiste Hazo; Josiane WARSZAWSKI; Bruno Falissard; Marie-Claude Geoffroy; Maria Melchior; Alexandra Rouquette","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.08.02.22278311","20220803","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-04","",35562,""
"Investigating clients' experiences of walk and talk counselling","Background Aim Method Findings Limitations Implications Conclusion The use of â€œwalk and talkâ€ counselling has recently increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic, concurrent with an increased awareness of the benefits of the outdoors, nature and exercise on mental health. Walk and talk counselling is relatively new and seemingly easy to incorporate for everyday counsellors. However, there is limited previous research on this form of counselling.This study aimed to investigate how the client experiences walk and talk counselling in a natural outdoor environment.To evaluate the client's lived experience of walk and talk counselling, online semi-structured interviews with five adult participants in the United Kingdom (UK) were analysed using the interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) method.The general outlook on walk and talk was positive. There was a feeling of informality, and a relational equalising element, but these aspects did not appear to detract from the professional relationship. There was an appreciation of nature, although there was an element of not noticing it. Timing was more fluid, and there were positive and negative aspects of the outdoor walking.A small sample size limits the wider application of these findings.Further research is required to support further guidelines and training for practitioners. Implications for practice include the consideration of client preferences and a more fluid approach to contracting, a need for increased awareness of physical and psychological safety and a consideration of the relational dynamic when walking outdoors.Walk and talk is a viable alternative to indoor counselling. It proved useful in a pandemic and for clients who would not consider indoor counselling.

"Impact Of COVID-19 Pandemic On Mental Health In Pakistan: A Systematic Review","Epidemics and pandemics ravage human population in different ways. Recent COVID-19 has engulfed the whole world and casted significant social and psychological impacts on individuals around the globe. This review article includes literature from January 2020 to November 2020 on the psychological impact of corona virus pandemic on individuals in Pakistan. Literature on psychological impact was searched via electronic databases and reputable websites including Google Scholar, PubMed, Elsevier, Science Direct, Scopus and Springer by using the searching keywords: COVID-19 and psychological problems, COVID-19 and mental health, impact of corona/novel corona virus and COVID-19 and medical personnel or health care professionals in Pakistan. Total of 12 articles were selected for review. The results of study highlighted the psychological impacts of COVID-19 on students, health workers, slum community and general public who were more likely to develop the stress, anxiety, and depression, post traumatic and additional indicators of mental distress like psychological distress associated with economic recession. It was concluded that Covid-19 should not be solely treated as a life-threatening virus and a risk for physical health, but the mental health services should also be promoted to safeguard the psychological impact of the virus on Pakistani population in general, and students and healthcare providers in particular.","Saeed, Bareera, Batool, Syeda Shahida, Batool, Syeda Azra, Saeed, Hadia, Khan, Ayesha","https://www.google.com/search?q=Impact+Of+COVID-19+Pandemic+On+Mental+Health+In+Pakistan:+A+Systematic+Review","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Webology; 19(3):2453-2470, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-04","",35564,""

"GuantaÂ´namo Detention in the Time of COVID-19","A nation should not be judged by how it treats its highest citizens, but its lowest ones. "" -Nelson Mandela Introduction The novel coronavirus (""COVID-19"") breathed new life into decades-old calls to close the controversial military prison in Guantanamo Bay as many, including members of Congress, expressed doubts about the prison's ability to protect detainees in the event of a COVID-19 outbreak.1 Less than two weeks after the World Health Organization (""WHO"") declared COVID-19 a global pandemic,2 the highly contagious and often fatal virus reached the remote military installation in southeastern Cuba that is home to the prison for alleged terrorists responsible for the attacks on September 11, 2001.3 The COVID-19 pandemic has brought new attention to what many familiar with Guantanamo Bay have known for years: the military prison lacks the infrastructure, expertise, and equipment to manage and address emergent health issues, including a serious viral outbreak. [...]Part II will introduce the seemingly contradictory provision of the National Defense Authorization Act (""NDAA"") for Fiscal Year 2020, which while requiring that detainees receive evaluation and treatment at the standard of care acceptable within the medical community-something that is not available at the military prison for COVID-19-also prohibits the transport of detainees for any reason, including medical emergency.5 Part III of this article will discuss the state of pre-pandemic medical care. While the adequacy of medical care at the military prison has been the subject of significant criticism since the prison was first opened, Part III of this article will address four specific issues that complicate detainee medical care during the COVID-19 pandemic: (1) the age and health of detainees puts them at greater risk for severe illness should they contract COVID-19;(2) the military prison lacks the necessary equipment and personnel to meet the standard of care established for COVID-19;(3) domestic law prohibits the transfer of detainees to the United States for medical treatment;and (4) the prophylactic isolation required to protect against a COVID-19 outbreak, which includes limited access to legal counsel, will worsen detainees' existing mental health conditions and jeopardize detainees' legal rights. Prison staff consists of approximately 1,800 military and civilian personnel, including approximately sixty medical providers.18 The prison hospital complex is comprised of a $18.2 million-dollar hospital and $2.9 million-dollar psychiatric facility.19 The most recent numbers available from Fiscal Year 2019 quote the medical group budget at four million dollars, or approximately $100,000 per year per detainee.20 While that may, at first blush, appear like absurdly generous funding, when the prison was built it was not intended for long-term detention but rather, it was intended to be temporary and was outfitted with expeditionary-type healthcare infrastructure, which shows signs of deterioration and requires frequent repairs.21 Because the prison hospital was neither intended nor designed to be operational for nearly two decades, its medical capabilities are, perhaps understandably, limited in equipment, diagnostic capabilities, and expertise.","Morgan, Annie W.","https://www.google.com/search?q=GuantaÂ´namo+Detention+in+the+Time+of+COVID-19","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of National Security Law & Policy; 12(3):509-536, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-04","",35567,""
"Rethinking Business Model for Drug Discovery, Post-COVID","Motivation: The COVED pandemic underscores the need for fair access to health care. The unequal access to needed but patented, expensive medicines will exacerbate existing disparities among disadvantaged populations. For example, cancer gene therapy costs range from $373,000 for a single dose of CAR-T therapy Yescarta to $2.1 million for Zolgensma. Premise: In this paper, we propose a peer-to-peer business model for drug discovery that democratizes the drug discovery process and reduces drug prices by cutting the intermediaries between biomedical researchers and future patients. Note that in this market microstructure, the underrepresented group can take advantage of medical advances by selling their data for research. Approach: We devise a market microstructure in which a group of project managers, who are usually ""star"" scientists or CEOs of biotech firms, will select individuals at disease risks and researchers, raise funds by selling non-fungible tokens (NFTs) based on their future patents, and control risks by the rating system, due diligence, and financial engineering. Employing a signaling game-theoretic mechanism, our analysis not only elucidates how the stakeholders strategically interact in this market using deception, adverse selection, and moral hazards, but also how to tame their interactions to improve the overall performance. In particular, we suggest and rigorously evaluate an embodiment built on a scalable implementation of NFTs. Results: Using extensive simulations, we show that in the NFT megafund, both senior and junior tranche investors get their principals fully repaid 99.9 percent of the time. Conclusion: This market micro-structure can help reduce health disparity in the following three ways. First, by participating in the drug discovery process, the underrepresented population can accelerate drug discovery for diseases unique to themselves. Historically, such diseases are understudied due to a lack of funding and resources. Second, cutting out the middleman can significantly reduce drug-development costs, which will increase access to medicine. Finally, retail investors can also benefit from investing in drug discovery because the risk associated with the NFT is managed down to the level of debt. Consistency: As a disruptive technology, blockchain has created a lot of challenges and uncertainties for the economy and society alike. This research provides a framework to realize the potential of blockchain and non-fungible tokens to democratize the drug discovery process and reduce health disparity, while controlling their risks using rating system, due diligence, and financial engineering, which is consistent with the purpose of this journal.","Mishra, Bud, Qi, Qianru","https://www.google.com/search?q=Rethinking+Business+Model+for+Drug+Discovery,+Post-COVID","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Review of Business; 42(2):1-20, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-04","",35568,""
"THE EFFECTS OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND MENTAL WELL-BEING IN OLDER ADOLESCENTS IN COLLEGE","Purpose: The coronavirus and associated stay-at-home orders and closures of schools, workplaces and many businesses has had a profound influence on the health and wellbeing of our global population. The effect that these unprecedented and historic measures has had on physical activity levels and mental well-being in adolescents has yet to be measured. The aim of this study was to measure physical activity levels and mental well-being in older adolescents before and after the coronavirus pandemic reached the U.S. Methods: Using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire and the WHO Well-being Index, physical activity and mental well-being were measured in late February and again in early May in 66, 1st year college students (17-20 years of age) at a small liberal arts university in Portland, Oregon. Results: Moderate and vigorous physical activity levels decreased by an average of 86 minutes (SDÂ±110) a week and mental well-being scores decreased by 12.7 points (SDÂ±22) on a scale of 100. A moderate correlation (r=.42) was found between a decrease in physical activity levels and a decrease in mental well-being. In addition, students of color experienced greater decreases in physical activity and mental well-being scores. Gym and recreational center closures, canceling of spring sports and fear of leaving their residence were the most common reasons given for decreased physical activity levels. Lack of social interaction with friends and classmates, decreased physical activity levels and anxiety associated with the pandemic were most common reasons given for decreased well-being scores. Conclusions: These results provide evidence of the significant impact that the pandemic has had on both physical and mental health in older adolescents. Potential barriers during this pandemic suggest target strategies may include developing in-home virtual physical activity programming for adolescents as well as additional mental health support using virtual platforms. Health services that target physical and mental health in this environment should be prioritized.","Lafrenz, Andrew Phd M. P.

"The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men in China: Difference by HIV status","Population-based measures and public health response to stem the spread of the coronavirus may have caused unintended isolation and increased the risk of psychiatric illnesses. The objective of this study is to assess psychological distress among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) in China during the COVID-19 pandemic and examine whether these mental health outcomes differ by HIV status. Data were derived from a cross-sectional survey on the impact of COVID-19 on users of Blued, the largest gay social networking app in July 2020. All active users on Blued were invited to complete a survey regarding sexual behaviors, HIV prevention and treatment service utilization, and various health and mental health outcomes. Among all participants (nÂ =Â 1205), over half (53.2%) of the participants screened mild to severe psychological distress: 34.9% screened mild, 11.6% screened moderate, and 6.6% screened severe psychological distress. Of all participants, 20.9% met the criteria for anxiety and 19.6% for depression. Psychological distress was associated with younger age having a degree below college, being unemployed, and having lower income. MSM with HIV were more likely to report depression or anxiety compared to HIV negative/unknown status MSM after adjusting for study covariates (AORÂ =Â 1.80, 95%CI 1.01â€“3.26;AORÂ =Â 2.04, 95%CI 1.11â€“3.67, respectively). MSM in China experience a high burden of psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Increases in symptoms of depression and anxiety in adults during the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic are limited to those with less resources: Results from the Lifelines Cohort Study","Background The COVID-19 pandemic may have a differential impact on mental health based on an individual's capital, i.e. resources available to maintain and enhance health. We assessed trajectories of depression and anxiety symptoms, and their association with different elements of capital. Methods Data on 65,854 individuals (mean baseline ageÂ =Â 50Â·4 (SDÂ =Â 12Â·0) years) from the Lifelines COVID-19 cohort were used. Baseline mental health symptoms were on average measured 4.7 (SDÂ =Â 1Â·1) years before the first COVID-19 measurement wave, and subsequent waves were (bi)weekly (March 30-August 05, 2020). Mental health symptom trajectories were estimated using a two-part Latent Class Growth Analysis. Class membership was predicted by economic (education, income, and occupation) and person capital (neuroticism, poor health condition, and obesity) Findings Most individuals were unlikely to report symptoms of depression (80Â·6%) or anxiety (75Â·9%), but stable-high classes were identified for both conditions (1Â·6% and 6Â·7%, respectively). The stable-high depression class saw the greatest increase in symptoms after COVID, and the stable-high anxiety class reported an increase in the probability of reporting symptoms after COVID. At the first COVID-measurement, the mean number of symptoms increased compared to baseline (depression:4Â·7 vs 4Â·1;anxiety:4Â·3 vs 4Â·2);the probability of reporting symptoms also increased (depression:0Â·96 vs 0Â·65;anxiety:0Â·92 vs 0Â·70). Membership in these classes was generally predicted by less capital, especially person capital;odds ratios for person capital ranged from 1Â·10-2Â·22 for depression and 1Â·08-1Â·51 for anxiety.

"â€œCatch Them While You Can!â€ Delivering Preventive Services to Adolescents and Young Adults While Addressing Transportation Barriers","Purpose: Adolescent and young adult (AYA) health care access for preventive services allows for screening and treatment of common adolescent comorbidities. AYA living in areas of poverty experience transportation access barriers and health disparities for these common comorbidities. The objective of this study is to explore the relationship between neighborhood poverty and preventive service needs among adolescents who utilized an institutionally sponsored commercial ride sharing service (ISCRSS) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: An ISCRSS using Lyft was launched in an urban academic adolescent clinic as a quality improvement project for 21 months, 10/1/19 â€“ 6/30/21. Collected rider data included demographics, insurance, visit types, visit diagnoses, and pick-up/drop-off locations. 1024 rides were categorized into 6 visit types. We analyzed annual well and acute care visits exclusively (n=537) given the practice philosophy to deliver as many services as possible based on need during visits, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. The mean neighborhood poverty rate for pick-up/drop-off locations of 23.7% (S.D. 8.63, median=25.4%) was greater than the 2019 10.5% federal poverty rate. Neighborhoods above the federal poverty rate were subsequently subdivided into low and high poverty categories using the median split. Preventive services received were obtained via secondary chart review and included screening and treatment for STIs, mental health, substance use, obesity, hypertension, family planning, immunizations and female reproductive health. Bivariate analyses assessed patient characteristics, neighborhood poverty level, visit types, and preventive services received for each visit. Linear regression was used to evaluate the number of preventive services received by gender and visit type. Results: Of the 537 clinical visits, 81.4% were acute care. There was a significant difference between number of preventive services received by visit type with an average of 2.9 (SD 1.3) preventive services per visit for annual visits and 1.5 (SD 1) for acute visits, (p&lt;0.001). Mean age of AYA receiving annual well visits was 18.7 years (SD 2.7) and 20.0 years (SD 2.8) for acute visits, (p&lt;0.001). For both visit types, most AYA were female (78%) and had public insurance (88%). Number of preventive services received also differed by insurance, 78% of publicly insured vs 65% of privately insured received 1-2 preventive services per visit (p=0.031). Of the preventive services offered, obesity (92.45%, p&lt;0.001), mental health (80.32%, p=0.024), and immunizations (81.24%, p=0.001) were greater in acute visits compared to annual well visits. Linear regression models indicated female patients received 0.640 more services [B=0.640, SEB=0.111, p&lt;0.001] than males and acute visits received 1.44 fewer services [B= -1.442, SEB= 0.12, p &lt;0.001] than annual well visits. There was no significant effect for neighborhood poverty level on the type of visit nor the mean number of preventive services received. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that AYA using an ISCRSS for transportation support to clinical care are leveraging well and acute care visits to obtain preventive services. As the pandemic continues carefully thinking through ways to optimize preventive services while you can, may be critical for youth residing in impoverished communities with low transportation access.

"Technological Determinants of Health: Factors Associated With Equitable Utilization Among Adolescents and Young Adults receiving Sexual Health Services","Purpose: As clinics limited face-face appointments during the COVID-19 pandemic, youth at risk of sexually transmitted infections (STI) were vulnerable to disruptions in medical care. While utilization of telehealth platforms has the potential to address pandemic related disruptions in care, and are likely to be maintained in a post-pandemic world, there are inequities in access and utilization of telehealth. The goal of this presentation is to explore telehealth acceptability and digital inequities (device access, internet access, and digital literacy) affecting utilization of telehealth for sexual health services among adolescents and young adults (AYA). Methods: The setting was a nine-clinic system that provides free preventive primary care and reproductive health services to &gt;10,000 Medicaid, low-income, and uninsured AYA annually. Majority (97.9%) of patients fall below the 250% Federal Poverty Level threshold and 96% belong to racial and ethnic minority groups. We surveyed youth aged 18 â€“ 24 who requested an appointment for a sexual health related concern. A 70 question survey, compiled using psychometrically validated instruments, was administered via email, text link, or telephone survey (if expressed inability to access the survey electronically). Sexual behavior and demographic information were collected. The constructs of interest included attitudes, intentions, barriers, and facilitators for telehealth. Results: A total of 347 AYA responded to the survey, with 250 completing the entire survey. A majority of the population identified as female (89%), non-Hispanic (58%), and Black (52%). 37% of the respondents had scheduled their planned visit as a video or telephone visit. Overall respondents reported favorable attitudes towards telehealth with 69% agreeing that it could save them time, and 59% agreeing that they could be satisfied with a telehealth visit. A minority of respondents agreed that they had concerns about privacy (8%), difficulty with using technology (12%), and did not like the lack of physical contact (39%). Nearly all respondents reported having access to a computer, tablet, or smartphone (99.6%) and to the internet (99.2%);however 37% reported that they could not always trust the equipment to work. While 96% of respondents were willing/very willing to have an in-person visit if they were experiencing sexual health symptoms, ~ 80% of respondents were willing/ very willing to discuss sexual behaviors via telephone or video visit, and ~ 36% were willing/ very willing to have an examination via video. Race, education, ethnicity, and insurance status were not associated with telehealth utilization. Individuals who used telemedicine services had significantly more positive attitudes towards telehealth than those who did not, as assessed by a questionnaire of beliefs and attitudes about telehealth, d =.50, p &lt;.001. Conclusions: Utilization of telehealth is affected by attitudes towards telehealth. Minimizing concerns for privacy, improving patient experience and comfort with using technology, and addressing negative attitudes towards the lack of physical contact may improve utilization. These findings will lay ground-work for subsequent research focused on action-oriented steps to develop innovative interventions that will improve health care access for STI-related outcomes, and health equity among AYA.

"â€œA Lifeline for Parents and Their Childrenâ€: 1:1 Peer Mentoring for Parents of Gender Diverse Youth","Purpose: Compared to cisgender peers, gender diverse youth (GDY) face significant mental health disparities. Parent affirmation reduces these disparities, but there are few evidence-based support programs for parents of GDY and none centered on 1:1 parent peer support, which has shown promise in other pediatric settings. This study aimed to evaluate a 1:1 peer mentor program for parents of GDY, the Parent Outreach Program (POP). Methods: We created anonymous online surveys consisting of open-ended questions about the POP distributed via email to program mentors (parents providing support) and mentees (parents receiving support). Participants were asked why they became involved, benefits and challenges, and how this program compared to others they had participated in. Open-ended responses were coded by two authors using two iteratively developed codebooks (one each for mentors and mentees);codes were adjudicated to consensus and key themes were identified for both participant types. Results: In total, 20 participants (6 mentors, 14 mentees) completed parallel surveys. Themes identified for mentors included feeling giving back was important, their mentoring experience, challenges, and personal growth resulting from being a mentor. Mentors wanted to help other families, â€œ[POP was] rewarding in knowing that by helping the parents you can ultimately help the kidsâ€. They shared logistical challenges like â€œcoordinating schedulesâ€ as well as the potential for conversations to be triggering;â€œSometimes it brings up a memory of my own family that evokes an emotionâ€. Mentors also noted their participation was a positive experience: â€œ[POP] offers us the opportunity to grow in our knowledge and feelings in regard to our own childâ€. Themes identified for mentees included the importance of finding community through the POP, receiving education, relating to their mentors, practical considerations, and qualities of a good mentor. Parent mentees shared relief in finding a â€œsense of communityâ€;as one mentee said, â€œIt was a lifeline to some sanityâ€. They also noted that the POP gave them specialized information and that they connected with mentors based on shared experiences: â€œWe craved parents with a true understanding of the many feelings, changes, activitiesâ€¦â€. They addressed practical considerations like the intimacy of 1:1 support and that recommendations from a provider mattered to them: â€œThis [program] is more intimate and focused on our stories;â€ â€œWhen the social worker offered it, I had no doubt.â€ Mentees stressed that mentors â€œbeing non-judgmental, willing to listenâ€ was critical. All mentees noted that they would recommend POP to other parents. Conclusions: Both parent mentors and mentees shared that 1:1 peer support was valuable and allowed mentors to give back and experience personal growth, while providing community and resources to mentees who were struggling to understand and support their GDYâ€™s journey. The POP also provides an alternative to large support groups given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This program and others offering 1:1 parent peer support may fill an important gap in supporting parents of GDY, ultimately improving mental health outcomes for their young people.

"A Pilot Intervention to Reduce Adolescent Sexual and Mental Health Disparities by Increasing Access to Telemedicine and Mobile Care (AccessKCTeen)","Purpose: In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, marginalized adolescents face new and exacerbated barriers to accessing sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and mental health (MH) care. While telemedicine has adapted to increase access to SRH/MH services, it is less likely to be used by those with limited familiarity or no previous connection to care. We assessed the impact of a novel intervention (AccessKCTeen) that leverages peer outreach leaders and community events on confidence in accessing SRH/MH care and telemedicine. Methods: We engaged and trained teen peer leaders to stimulate healthcare-seeking behaviors by sharing SRH/MH information from our virtual toolkit and mobilizing their peer networks to attend our AccessKCTeen health outreach events. We partnered with community organizations to host events where we demonstrated telemedicine via a mobile van, shared local resources for SRH/MH care, and distributed free over-the-counter emergency contraception (EC), condoms, and pregnancy tests. All services were offered in English and Spanish. Teens completed three surveys: (1) prior to the engaging with AccessKCTeen (demographics, healthcare needs and trust and confidence to access care);(2) immediately post-intervention (health service uptake [e.g., EC, condoms, pregnancy test], satisfaction, healthcare trust, confidence to access care);and (3) one-month after the event (follow-up SRH/MH care utilization). Study staff documented teen engagement and feedback via field notes. Results: We trained five peer leaders. During three community health events, we enrolled 63 teens (mean age 15.9 years;67% female at birth, 27% Genderfluid/Non-Binary/Trans, 27% Hispanic, 30% Black, 45% White, 38% heterosexual). Most (68%) reported no previous vaginal/penile sex. In past week, the majority reported 1 or more days feeling anxious (62%)/depressed (50%)/lonely (59%)/hopeful (71%). Many (44%) had forgone needed care in the previous year, and few (32 %) had previously used telemedicine. Most reported improved understanding of telemedicine after the demonstration. Teens reported these benefits of telemedicine: privacy, ease of use, and increased access to SRH and MH care. Participants felt MH care is â€œdesperately neededâ€ but carries stigma and had friends or classmates with MH concerns. Participants voiced they â€œneed factsâ€ and accurate information on SRH, that education on â€œabstinence is not enoughâ€, and frequently did not know that EC was available without prescription or the timeframe of effectiveness. Most teens discussed the SRH items directly with the AcessKCTeen. Post-intervention: 82% were satisfied with the intervention and 86% would recommend it to friend. Compared to baseline, more participants reported confidence to access telemedicine (58% vs. 78%) and in-person care: (67% vs. 72%) and trusted â€œdoctors and nurses completelyâ€ (70% vs. 79%). Many accepted condoms (27%), pregnancy tests (16%) and EC (27%, 4 of whom were male). Recruitment and follow-up with participants and peer leaders is ongoing Conclusions: As COVID-19 continues to negatively impact SRH/MH care-seeking, the AccessKCTeen pilot offers critical insight on novel methods to increase access to SRH/MH care for marginalized adolescents.

"â€œThe Future Looks Brighter Since the Pandemicâ€ Characteristics of Optimistic Teens in Switzerland","Purpose: There is a growing interest in the research and healthcare communities for youth mental health in times of COVID-19. In this line, there are also several calls to pay special attention to the future and the post-pandemic life. The aim of this research was to determine the characteristics of adolescents who reported an optimistic view of their future. Methods: In an online survey on the mental health of adolescents (N=1197;mean age: 16.5) in Switzerland and the Liechtenstein carried out in the spring/summer of 2021, we asked them how they thought their future looked since the beginning of the pandemic, with four possible answers: better (n=183), the same (n=505), worse (n=334), I donâ€™t know (n=175). We divided the sample into two groups: those envisaging a better future (BF) and the other three groups were combined into Other Options. First, we compared the two groups on sociodemographic, and physical and mental health variables using chi2 for categorical variables and studentâ€™s t for continuous ones. Results are given as odds ratios (OR). All variables significant at the bivariate level (p&lt;.05) controlling for age and gender, were included in a backward logistic regression. Results are presented as adjusted odds ratios (aOR). Results: At the bivariate level, BF teens reported a significantly higher socioeconomic status (OR: 2.97), better perceived physical health (OR: 3.18), better physical (OR: 3.63) and mental (OR: 7.64) health since the beginning of the pandemic, better emotional wellbeing (OR: 1.87), and better self-esteem (OR: 2.17). They were also significantly less inclined to report having a chronic condition (OR: 0.51) or feeling anxious (OR: 0.49) or depressed (OR: 0.31). No differences were found for age, gender, family structure, sport practice or substance use. At the multivariate level, the only variables that remained in the backward regression were having a better mental (aOR: 5.03) and physical (aOR: 1.98) health since the beginning of the pandemic, reporting an above average socioeconomic status (aOR: 2.53), and being less likely to be depressed (aOR: 0.42). Conclusions: A minority of adolescents think that their future looks better since the beginning of the pandemic. These youths also consider that both their physical and mental health is better and are less likely to be depressed. Additionally, they have an above average socioeconomic status. Interestingly, this phenomenon is independent from age, gender, family structure or substance use. Overall, they seem to be the â€œoptimisticâ€ group that thinks that good things can come out of the pandemic, and the fact that they belong to a more privileged and sure socioeconomic status probably can explain it. Whether these youths were already the optimistic group before the pandemic remains to be studied. In the same line, it will be interesting to analyze if they really are doing better once the pandemic will be over. If this is the case, they could open the way to find new approaches to engage and motivate young people regarding their future.

"Improving Quality of Care for Incarcerated Youth with Opioid Misuse and Opioid Use Disorder","Purpose: Opioid-related morbidity and mortality have risen in many settings. In particular, the prevalence of opioid misuse in incarcerated youth exceeds that of the general adolescent population and overdose mortality within 2 weeks of release is 129 times higher. In 2016, 1 out of 10 adolescent deaths were opioid-related. In King County, WA, since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of opioid-related overdose in youth under the age of 20 increased twofold from 10 in 2019 to 21 in 2020. Despite such trends, most incarcerated individuals who could benefit from treatment do not receive it. Our goal was to implement a quality improvement (QI) project to evaluate the prevalence of opioid misuse in adolescents and improve protocols to support youth with opioid use disorder (OUD) at a juvenile detention center in King County, WA. Methods: From March 2020-April 2021, providers at the Clark Children and Family Justice Center (CFJC) implemented a QI project to improve quality of care for youth with opioid misuse and OUD. We conducted a chart review to determine prevalence of opioid misuse among youth. We reviewed the change in percentage of youth referred for substance misuse after the implementation of 2 change interventions: provider buprenorphine waiver training and the development of an opioid use management and referral protocol. Providers completed buprenorphine waiver training in June 2020. We developed and initiated protocols in September 2020 to screen adolescents for opioid use and withdrawal, support buprenorphine induction and maintenance, provide youth with overdose prevention training and naloxone kit, and improve care coordination to ensure a smooth transition of care for youth with OUD returning to their communities. This project was reviewed by the University of Washington IRB and determined to be â€œnot human subjects researchâ€ as defined by federal and state regulations. Results: The prevalence of opioid misuse of youth ages 12-17 at CFJC from September 2020-April 2021 was 16.9% in comparison to 3.6% in the general population in 2016. From March-May 2020, prior to providers completing buprenorphine waiver training, only 60% of youth who reported substance misuse were referred to the CFJC-Health Clinic for consultation by the next available clinic day. From June-August 2020, after providers completed buprenorphine waiver training, 81% of youth who reported substance misuse were referred for consultation. From Sept 2020-April 2021, after implementation of a referral and management protocol for opioid use and withdrawal, almost all (90%) of youth reporting misuse were referred. Conclusions: Similar to previous literature, we found that the prevalence of opioid misuse among adolescents at CFJC was significantly higher than in the general population. Our findings demonstrate that two change interventions of provider buprenorphine training and the development of protocols to facilitate the assessment and management of opioid misuse and OUD increased the rate of youth who received treatment for OUD at CFJC. Further refinement of these guidelines is needed to ensure that all youth admitted to CFJC with opioid misuse and OUD receive timely consultation and support to decrease the rate of opioid-related morbidity and mortality in confined youth.

"Children's Hospitalsâ€™ Identification and Investment in Substance Use Services: Implications for Racial Health Disparities","Purpose: Childrenâ€™s Hospitals are uniquely positioned to address the intergenerational transmission of substance use disorders because they work with both parents and children. This studyâ€™s goal was to explore whether Childrenâ€™s Hospitals differentially identify substance use programs as a critical health need and offer services in areas with specific racial minority populations. Thus far, no study has focused on racial disparities among Childrenâ€™s Hospitals and their employment of substance use interventions. Methods: We conducted this study using data from the CHNAs of all nonprofit members of the Childrenâ€™s Hospital Association (N = 234). The 2017 County Health Rankings database was used to gather data on community characteristics (â€œCounty Health Rankings,â€ 2017). We will control for drug overdose rates since opioid use affects races at different rates (Khatri et al., 2021). In addition, we will control for relevant socioecononomic variables. Results: It was hypothesized that substance use interventions would still be more prevalent in White communities after placing such controls. We found that as the percentage of Asian-Americans in communities increased, hospitals were less likely to identify substance use as a health need (OR:.868;95% CI;.769-.979) and to invest in a substance use intervention (OR:.860;95% CI;.757-.978). As the percentage of Whites in communities increased, hospitals had greater odds of investing in a substance use intervention (OR: 1.043;95% CI;1.005-1.083) even though they were not significantly more or less likely to identify substance use as a health need (OR: 1.027;95% CI;.995-1.060). No significant differences were found for hospitals as the percentage of Hispanics and Blacks increased in communities. Conclusions: The results suggest that Childrenâ€™s Hospitals are disproportionately investing in White communities while neglecting Asian-American populations even after controlling for socioeconomic status and drug overdose mortality rates. More studies need to be conducted on racial disparities in substance use treatment among Children's Hospitals. The relationship between racial disparities and substance use interventions might be of particular interest now because substance use disorders are rising among non-White Americans in light of COVID-19 and services are not aligned with this growing need (Khatri et al., 2021).

"The Protective Effect of Close Follow-up During the Pandemic on Adolescents With an Eating Disorder","Purpose: Emerging evidence suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has a significant impact on adolescents suffering from eating disorders (EDs). A study from our clinic during the beginning of the pandemic showed depression to be the highest predictor for disordered eating behavior in adolescents with EDs. The current study aimed to re-evaluate the effect of the continuing pandemic in the same group of patients after a year. Methods: The original sample included 38 adolescents with an ED aged 12-18 years. Initial data collection occurred between March 2020 and June 2020 and included a survey developed by the researchers aiming to evaluate the effects of COVID-19 on ED behavior, well-being and quality of life (QoL). Additionally, the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the State Anxiety Index were completed. Close medical and psychiatric follow-up continued for these patients. Among this sample 37 (97.4%) adolescents agreed to participate in the second study. All surveys used in the first study were re-asked between May and June 2021. To evaluate the predictors of ED behavior, the relationship between the EDE-Q-global scale score and other variables related to ED was examined. Results: A majority of participants were female (n= 35, 94.6%) and the mean age was 17.46 Â± 1.31 years. AN-R type was the most common diagnosis (n=25, 67.5%). Similar to the first study when asked whether they felt the pandemic affected their ED, %37.8 reported feeling an improvement (vs %42.1 in the first study p=0.581) and %24.3 felt it was worse (vs 21.1% in the first study, p=0.581). Sixty-two% reported none or rare conflict with parents due to eating (vs 71% in the first study, p=0.308), 43.2% reported often or always complying with their meal plan (vs 39.5% in the first study, p=0.831). When adolescents were asked about their well-being during the COVID-19 period;89.2% (71.1% in the first study) stated that they felt more mature when compared to the first study (z=-2.28, p&lt;.05). When questioned about their â€˜â€™overall QoLâ€™â€™ and â€œhealth-related QoL, considering the impact of EDâ€™â€™ during the pandemic results did not differ between the first and second evaluation (p=0.508). When asked if the pandemic negatively affected access to ED healthcare 52.6% in the first study vs. 27% in the second study felt it did (p=0.007). EDE-Q scores and BDI scores were not significantly different between the two studies (p=0.880, p=0.828 respectively). A statistically significant increase was observed in anxiety score (p=0.007). According to the Pearson correlation analysis a positive, moderately significant relationship between the EDE-Q total scores and anxiety scores was observed (r=.630, p&lt;.05). Conclusions: Contrary to what we were anticipating, the results did not show a worsening of ED behavior, more than one-third reported an improvement in ED symptomatology. Additionally, EDE-Q scores did not increase. While in the first study depression was the highest predictor for disordered eating this changed to anxiety.

"Parental Perceptions of the Impact of Summer Media Habits on Adolescent Physical Health","Purpose: Adolescent interactive media use increased dramatically during the Covid-19 pandemic, both for remote learning and socializing. Pandemic lockdown and media use contributed to a spike in mental health issues, but less is known about physical consequences of prolonged media use or the individual characteristics and media use habits that predict these physical outcomes. With many restrictions lifted in summer 2021, changes in adolescentsâ€™ media use habits and health effects can help predict the â€œnew normal.â€ Methods: A sample of 415 parents of adolescents in grades 9-12 was recruited by Alchemer using existing online panels as part of a nationwide online survey of parents of school-aged children (N = 1,447). Quota sampling was used to obtain a diverse sample. Parents completed a 15-minute anonymous survey about their childâ€™s summer media use and physical complaints including eye strain, neck or back pain, headaches, and fatigue. Other questions assessed habits of media use, including simultaneous use of multiple screens (â€œmultitaskingâ€) and nighttime media use. Parents provided the number of behavioral health diagnoses of their child including ADHD, depression, anxiety, learning disabilities, and autism spectrum disorder. We conducted logistic regressions to examine associations among individual characteristics, media use patterns, and physical symptoms. Results: Most adolescents used screen media more during the summer of 2021 than during the 2020-2021 school year (65.5%) or the summer of 2020 (53.8%). 71.3% of parents reported that their child experienced at least one physical symptom â€œsometimesâ€ or more frequently following a typical day of media use. After controlling for demographic variables, â€œmultitaskingâ€ frequency was linked to experiencing eye strain (OR = 1.01, CI = 1.00, 1.02), back or neck pain (OR = 1.02, CI = 1.01,1.03), headaches (OR = 1.02, CI = 1.01,1.03), and fatigue (OR = 1.02, CI = 1.01, 1.03). The later that adolescents stopped using media at night, the more likely they were to experience fatigue (OR =1.10, CI = 1.01, 1.20). Using media to view short videos was related to a lower odds of experiencing back or neck pain (OR =.55, CI =.32,.93). Finally, the greater the number of behavioral health diagnoses the higher the likelihood that an adolescent would experience back or neck pain (OR = 1.45, CI = 1.15, 1.82), headaches (OR = 1.59, CI = 1.26, 2.01), or fatigue (OR = 1.91, CI = 1.48, 2.47). Conclusions: â€œMultitaskingâ€ was consistently associated with physical symptoms, although the association was small. Late night media use likely reduces and interferes with sleep, thereby contributing to fatigue. Behavioral health conditions may predispose adolescents to certain use habits, including physical positioning, that could increase physical symptoms associated with screen use. Until further research clarifies mechanisms linking media use to physical symptoms, encouraging the use of one screen at a time and earlier cessation of use may help reduce these problems.

"The Feasibility and Acceptability of Behavioral Activation in an Adolescent Clinical Setting","Purpose: During the COVID-19 pandemic, estimates of adolescent depression prevalence have significantly increased. Although 80% of youth with mental health problems do not access mental health (MH) services, most interact regularly with pediatricians, suggesting primary care is a promising setting for youth MH service delivery. Behavioral activation (BA) is a straightforward intervention focusing on increasing engagement in meaningful activities and has been shown to be effective in adolescent populations. This study examines the feasibility and acceptability of implementing BA delivered by nurses to adolescents with mild to moderate depressive symptoms in an ambulatory setting. Methods: We examined the feasibility and acceptability of BA to a sociodemographic-diverse adolescent population. To examine feasibility, we retrospectively analyzed the percentage of patients presenting with mild to moderate depressive symptoms on the patient health questionnaire-9 during a random four week period. We then conducted qualitative interviews with four parent-adolescent dyads, and two additional adolescents. A semi-structured interview guide was iteratively developed to assess perceived acceptability of BA and barriers and facilitators to engaging in the intervention. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and coded by authors JDT and JF. A thematic analysis was completed to identify whether the program as designed was acceptable to the targeted population. Results: A records review found that out of 122 unique patients presenting for any clinic visit during the four week period, 44 (35%) met criteria for mild to moderate depressive symptoms. Of those who met criteria, youth were 17.45 years old (range = 12-22) with 61% identified as female. Results of the qualitative interviews suggest that participants perceived BA to be appropriate;themes emerged suggesting that both parents and youth noted nurse-delivered BA was similar to other types of therapies they had engaged with in other settings and that participants experienced nursesâ€™ as able to protect confidentiality and someone they could be â€œvulnerableâ€ with. Participants were mixed in how feasible they felt regular visits to the pediatricianâ€™s office was, with some noting that transportation and time were major barriers for engaging in treatment. All participants noted that telehealth options (including meeting with a nurse provider over the phone or through web conferencing) were appropriate and would facilitate treatment access. Participants also noted that time, transportation and cost were significant barriers to engaging in valued activities (a central mechanism of BA), and several parents and youth noted that these barriers were exacerbated during the pandemic. Conclusions: Our data highlights the implementation potential for delivering BA by nurses in an adolescent ambulatory setting. Qualitative themes suggest this approach (especially delivered via telehealth) is feasible and acceptable for youth with mild to moderate depressive symptoms.

"From Research to Legislation: a Qualitative Case Study of Massachusettsâ€™ 2018 CARE Act Expanding Emergency Department Initiation of Medication for Opioid Use Disorder","Purpose: Many individuals with opioid use disorder or opioid overdose do not receive the recommended life-saving medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD), particularly adolescents and young adults. During the COVID-19 pandemic, opioid overdoses have substantially increased and existing health disparities in treatment access have worsened. Initiating treatment with MOUD for individuals presenting with opioid overdose to the Emergency Department (ED) has been demonstrated to increase access and improve treatment retention, decrease opioid use, and is cost-effective. ED MOUD induction programs now exist throughout the US, though Massachusetts was the first state to pass legislation in 2018 mandating that all acute-care hospitals that provide emergency services must be able to provide opioid agonist MOUD for individuals presenting with opioid overdose. We sought to characterize the formulation and policymaking process for this groundbreaking legislation, with particular attention to the role of research, personal stories, economic and public health considerations, and whether and how the specific needs of youth were addressed. Methods: We conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews between August and November 2019 with 10 key stakeholders from Massachusetts involved in the policymaking process from multiple sectors including state government, hospitals, physicians, and related recovery and behavioral health organizations. Two coders analyzed transcripts using a hybrid inductive-deductive approach based on themes identified using an iterative process. The study was deemed exempt as non-human subjects research by the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health IRB. Results: Key themes identified regarding factors in the policymaking process included the pressing need for action amidst an opioid overdose crisis and the strong role of research. Stakeholders agreed that the evidence was unequivocal that ED inductions save lives: â€œThe fact that there's clear research and data that makes MAT evidence-based was criticalâ€¦if you're objective and you're really concerned about the people coming into your hospital and your ED and you look at the research, it's clear.â€ Additional themes including multiple stakeholders coming together to collaborate throughout the process, overcoming financing and feasibility concerns including the necessity of budget-neutral legislation, processes taken to move towards feasible implementation, and a complete lack of youth consideration during the policymaking and initial implementation planning process. Conclusions: These study results suggest that rather than personal stories, research supporting the effectiveness of ED MOUD induction was the driving factor in passing the Massachusetts legislation, and that the success of this legislation is attributable to diverse stakeholders collaborating towards a common goal of increasing access to evidence-based treatment in an attempt to respond to the opioid epidemic. The unique needs of youth were not addressed in this policymaking process, and should be considered in future implementation and policymaking. Policymakers and advocates in other states may look towards this legislative process in Massachusetts as a model for implementing similar legislation as states grapple with worsening opioid-related morbidity and mortality in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

"The Opioid Epidemic","An opioid epidemic has been happening across the world since the 1990s and continues impact individuals, families, communities and societies around the globe. The epidemic has evolved from heroin misuse to use of synthetic opioids that are easily manufactured and are readily available. Reasons for the continuing opioid epidemic are complex, and include factors related to mental health, addiction, chronic pain relief and now, the COVID-19 pandemic. Women have been disproportionally affected by the opioid epidemic and the physical and biosocial effects of opioid use specific to women is an important consideration for healthcare providers. Recent data show that the effects of the opioid epidemic on rates of opioid use disorder, overdoses, and the economy continues to rise, despite global efforts to understand drivers and effective prevention and intervention strategies, programs and policies.","Cook, Jocelynn L.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpobgyn.2022.07.003","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Best Practice & Research Clinical Obstetrics & Gynaecology;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-04","",35586,""

"SYMPTOM SCREENING WITH TARGETED EARLY PALLIATIVE CARE (STEP) VERSUS USUAL CARE FOR PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED CANCER: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL","Introduction To direct scant specialized palliative care (PC) resources to patients in greatest need, we developed the STEP intervention (Symptom screening with Targeted Early Palliative care). STEP entails symptom screening with ESAS-r at each oncology visit and triggered alerts (for moderatehigh symptoms) to a nurse who calls the patient to offer a PC clinic visit. Methods Consenting adults with advanced cancer, ECOG 0-2, attending medical oncology clinics at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, were randomized to STEP or usual care. Participants completed quality of life (FACTG7), depression (PHQ-9), symptom control (ESASr-CS), and satisfaction with care (FAMCARE-P16) measures at baseline, 2, 4, and 6 months. The primary outcome was FACT-G7 at 6 months. Results From August 2019 to March 2020, 33 patients were randomized to STEP and 36 to usual care. The trial was subsequently permanently halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Groups were balanced at baseline except gender, with more females in the STEP arm (Table 1). In the STEP arm, 20 participants triggered a nurse 's call, of whom 13 had =1 PC clinic visit. At 6 months, all outcomes tended to be better in the STEP arm compared to usual care, particularly depression and satisfaction with care;however, results were not statistically significant (Table 2, Figure 1).

"How university students changed their habits and developed mental disorders in the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Japan: Three case reports","Background Since the COVID-19 pandemic reached Japan in 2020, the country has faced an unprecedented increase in suicide rate and school refusal among adolescents, as well as increased rates of depression and anxiety among young people. However, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescents in terms of changes in habits, the development of mental disorders, social isolation, and suicidal ideation remain largely unclear. Case Presentation We examined three cases of university students who changed their habits during the COVID-19 pandemic and developed mental disorders. All three cases had similar habitual changes, experienced loneliness, and developed depression and circadian rhythm sleep?wake disorder. Their habitual changes were delayed sleep and wake times, delayed first mealtime, a tendency to eat before sleeping, decreased social contact, increased digital media usage, and a tendency to use digital media before going to bed. We established a model of increasing mental health difficulties, school refusal, and suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion This report suggests possible approaches for preventing a decline in mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic among university students.","Nagaoka, Maiko, Kubo, Hiroe, Tashiro, Kuniko, Kinoshita, Maiko, Inoue, Hiroko, Soejima, Hirofumi, Fujise, Noboru","https://doi.org/10.1002/pcn5.29","","Database: Wiley; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences Reports; 1(3):e29, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-04","",35589,""
"Depressed, tension and anger mood in the university student population during COVID-19 pandemic: association with sleep quality and sleepiness","Introduction: To verify the association among the mood state variables (total mood, depression, tension, and anger domains), sleep quality and the sleepiness of the university students during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Objective: To estimate whether mood is associated with the sleep quality and sleepiness in the university student during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Methods: Two hundred and four university students of both sexes, with a mean age of 23.72Â±5.95 years, registered from the 2nd to the 7th period of both shifts (day and night classes) in three health courses of Brazilian private universities were participated of this study. Sleep quality was measured by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), sleepiness by Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and mood state was measured by Brazil Mood Scale (BRAMS) before classes (day = 7h00 and night = 19h00). The Kolmogorov- Smirnov test was applied to verify the normality of the data. Spearman correlation coefficient was used to calculate the correlation between the following variables. The a-level for all analysis was set at 0.05. Results: The results showed there was a significant positive association among poor sleep quality (PSQI&gt;5) and the total mood state (r=0.53;p&lt;0.01), depression mood domain (r=0.42;p&lt;0.01), tension mood domain (r=0.38;p&lt;0.001), and anger mood domain (r=0.28;p=0.02). In addition, there was a significant association among sleepiness (ESS&gt;9) and the total mood state (r=0.59;p&lt;0.01), depression mood domain (r=0.40;p&lt;0.01), and the anger mood domain (r=0.25;p=0.05). Depressed, high levels of tension and anger mood were associated with poor sleep quality (PSQI&gt;5) and increased sleepiness (ESS&gt;9). Conclusion: Therefore, university students were poor sleep quality, high levels of sleepiness, depression, tension, and anger mood before classes in the day-night shifts. The sleep quality and the sleepiness presented positive moderate correlation with the total mood state. In addition, the sleep quality and sleepiness presented positive weak correlation with depressed, stress and anger mood domains. In this context, it is important to highlight that it is necessary to improve the quality of sleep, alertness, and mood state of the university students during the COVID-19 pandemic to increase their academic performance and positive mood.","Viegas, F.; Assis, A.

"Chronotype, food structure and anthropometric profile of university students during the Covid-19 pandemic","Introduction: The pandemic imposed the need for social distancing with a consequent modification of the work and study routines, which in turn led to numerous changes. Circadian desynchronization, changes in food consumption from omission of meals to nutritionally insufficient food intake, especially during the gym, where students report little time for self-care. Objective: To identify the chronotype, anthropometric profile and dietary structure of students at a public university located in the Midwest region of Brazil during the Covid-19 pandemic. Methods: Cross-sectional study with sample comes from the project mental health, nutritional care and standard of sleep in the university community during the covid-19 pandemic, carried out with university students who answered the online questionnaire to identify the chronotype Morningness- Eveningness Questionnaire, validated version for Brazilian population, and self-reported questions about food structure and anthropometric profile. Results: 106 students participated in the study, 33% (95%CI 23.6-41.5) often had less than three meals a day, 30% (95%CI 21.7-38.3) omitted breakfast and 22% (95%CI 12.5-31.9) do not have meals in appropriate places, 30.2% (95%CI 21.7-39.6) reported discomfort after meals, 40.6% (95%CI 32.1-50.9) have excess weight and 71.1% (95%CI 63.2-80.2) had weight gain in the last three months.

"The application value of orthopedics' operating room nursing model based on evidence-based nursing and PDCA circulation during the COVID-19 outbreak","Background: The Coronavirus pandemic has resulted in an extreme challenge for humanity in recent times, like the challenges faced during World War II. Its origin has been pointed out, and the speculation made on its source directly points towards Wuhan in China. Since then, it has spread across the globe. The pandemic has resulted in more than one million deaths, which is a considerable challenge for humanity. Objective: With the pandemic of COVID-19, prevention of patient infection is crucial. This research focused on the orthopedic operating room nursing model effect based on evidence-based nursing and PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-act) cycle during the COVID-19 outbreak. Materials and Methods: From February 2020 to May 2020, 146 patients were admitted and received orthopedic surgery at Xuanwu Chunshu Hospital, Beijing, China, these admissions were grouped into control and intervention groups, which was based on the treatment provided. Satisfaction, time to bed and hospitalization, postoperative incision infection, and the occurrence of deep venous thrombosis of lower extremities, pain degree score, surgical treatment effect, anxiety, and depression scores were compared for all the admissions between the control and intervention groups. Results: In the control group, nursing satisfaction was less than in the intervention group. The time of getting out of bed and hospitalization was less in the intervention group;The total incidence of postoperative incision infection and lower limb deep vein thrombosis in the intervention group decreased. In the first postoperative day, the pain level in the intervention group was less than the control group. The effectiveness rate in the observation group is higher than that of the control group. Anxiety and depression scores of both groups tended to decrease with time and there was an interactive effect between grouping and time, where these differences were found to be statistically significant (P-value&lt;0.05). Conclusion: The clinical application of the orthopedics operating room nursing model based on evidence-based nursing and PDCA cycle is remarkable and worth implementing during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Tao, J.

"Negative changes in sleep patterns are observed in patients admitted by COVID 19","Introduction: Sleep is the main determinant of human wellbeing, mental and physical health. Sleep effectiveness can be reported through its quality and depth. Based on this principle, individuals infected by the SARS - CoV-2 virus from the family of coronavirus viruses, develop tissue inflammation and cell damage, causing an increase in inflammatory cytokines in the organism of the infected. There are several common causes of sleep disorders in hospitalized patients, including medical conditions and underlying psychological problems. There are also several modifiable factors that promote sleep disturbances in critically ill patients, such as noise, light, interactions with patient care, medications, mechanical ventilation and very commonly pain. The lack of sleep, therefore, can negatively compromise immunity, increasing the chances of disease onset. There is also the influence of sleep on emotional processing, with a role in maintaining mood and emotional state. Sleep deprivation also has a strong negative impact on daily behavior and, consequently, on daily mental health. Objective: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the sleep characteristics of patients during hospitalization, with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID. Methods: This is a quantitative, descriptive study, carried out from July to September 2020 in patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 infection through the RT-PCR test of nasopharyngeal swabs, aged = 18 years, of both sexes, admitted to the hospital's infirmary in the north of Rio Grande do Sul. The evaluation methods used were the sleep diary and a free application (Sleep As Android) available for smartphones. Results: Thirty patients were evaluated, the majority of whom were male (53%) and the average age was 52 years. Only 1 patient was previously healthy and the main associated comorbidities were hypertension and obesity. Less than 50% of individuals used sleeping pills. However, C-reactive protein levels were altered in most patients. As for the outcomes related to sleep characteristics, significant correlations were observed between increased nighttime awakenings and prolonged hospital stay. In addition, patients diagnosed with depression (23%) had a greater total sleep deficit in a hospital setting. Conclusion: Patients with COVID admitted to hospital nurse units destined for a pandemic have important changes in sleep which are directly related to their lower quality.","Schrammel, B.

"Sleep and alimentation: actions for improving quality of life in times of COVID 19","Introduction: Sleep is characterized as a condition of physical and mental rest, in which the person ignores everything going on around him. There is a scientifically proven association between sleep deprivation and unhealthy eating habits, increasing cases of emotional and uncontrolled eating leading to malnutrition. In addition, a bad night's sleep has been associated with worsening mental health, especially in times of pandemic. Objective: In light of the above, this study aimed to report the experience and stimulate reflection about the results of a poll shared on the social network Instagram with the objective of analyzing the quality of sleep of students at a public higher education institution during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Methods: This is an experience report of the extension group â€œSleep and Food in times of Pandemicâ€, composed of students of nursing, nutrition, medicine and mathematics of a public institution of higher education. The group, through its profile on the social network Instagram, shared a sleep satisfaction scale, where users reported in posts according to the condition of their sleep on a scale between good and bad. The scale was made available publicly and online, so the answers were freely accessible to everyone who followed the group's profile. Results: The project had a large significant reach of participants, since the present was observed through the social media of we can mention Instagram e Facebook, that is, an average of 600 posts observed, of these, 34.5% of students reported having a good night's sleep during the pandemic, while 65.5% responded by pointing out a bad night's sleep. Sleep deprivation is inversely related to the regulation of the circadian cycle, is associated with neuroendocrine and metabolic functions, such as reduced leptin and increased ghrelin, increasing appetite and food intake.In parallel to this, individuals in this stressful situation tend to consume foods that are pleasing to the palate, which usually contain higher amounts of sugar and/or fat, because they serve as comfort for the stress they are going through, but may contribute to the risk of developing obesity, insulin resistance, and cardiovascular disease. Conclusion: Some protective factors can help in this change, such as maintaining a daily routine, practicing physical activity, following a dietary pattern and taking care of sleep hygiene. Finally, we emphasize the need for more studies with a more rigid methodological content.","Santos, R. M.; Silva, T. R.; Carvalho, A. G. D. S.; Vieira JÃºnior, D. N.; Dos Santos, A.

"Sleep quality and anxiety in mothers and their children during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional survey","Introduction: Sleep disorders and anxiety are common complaints during childhood. Mothers' anxiety and depression symptoms might also affect children's sleep quality in a negative way. Considering that both sleep and anxiety disorders might be affected by environmental factors, the social distancing and other circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic might increase the prevalence of anxiety and sleep complaints among mothers and their children. Objective: To analyse the correlation between anxiety and sleep quality in mothers and children from 2 to 10 years old. Methods: Mothers of children from 2 to 10 years old were invited to participate. The participants filled an online survey through Google forms, including a socio-demographic survey, anxiety and sleep questionnaires, both of their own (as a self-report) and of their children. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) were used to analyse symptoms on the mothers, while Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL - both 1/2-5 and 6-18 years old versions) were used to analyse the children. The questionnaire was made available from August 2020 to January 2021. Data analysis was based on a Spearman correlation matrix and statistical significance level was set at 5%. Results: A total of 179 mothers were included in this study. Self-reported sleep quality decreased during the pandemic in 55% of the mothers. In relation to children, 40% of mothers reported that they noticed worsening of their sleep quality and 63% reported increased anxiety symptoms. Positive statistic significant correlations were observed between maternal sleep quality (PSQI) and maternal anxiety symptoms (DASS-21) (rho: 0.578, p&lt;0.001), and between both mothers (PSQI) and children (CSHQ) sleep quality (rho: 0.318, p&lt;0.001). A correlation between maternal sleep quality and anxiety symptoms in the children (CBCL) was observed only for children from 6-10 years old (rho:0,399, p=0.001), but not for those from 2-5 years old. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has been a challenge to both maternal and children sleep and behavior. During this period, decreased sleep quality in the mothers was correlated with increased anxiety in both mothers and children, as well as with decreased sleep quality in the children.","Ribeiro, S.

"Evaluation of medical student's sleep quality in covid-19 pandemic","Introduction: Sleep quality is influenced by several aspects, including factors related to the environment as well as psychological causes. In this context, the pandemic caused by the new SARS-Cov2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) had a large influence on the population's mental health, increasing levels of anxiety and stress, consequently reflected on the sleep quality. This is so also true for medical students;as a result of the scenario generated by the pandemic, in-person classes were replaced by distance education, which, added to the chaotic situation of fear, anxiety, frustration and social isolation, is interfering negatively in students' lives, and in their sleep. Objective: To analyze the sleep quality of medical students at a medical school in the interior of SÃ£o Paulo state during the covid-19 pandemic. Methods: This is a crosssectional study that invited 544 students from De six years of the course, from a medical school in the interior of the state of SÃ£o Paulo, to answer the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and a questionnaire on aspects that may influence sleep. The REDCap platform was used to send, via email, the link to the questionnaires, which were available from September 28th to October 5th, 2020. Results: Of the 544 students invited, 375 answered the questionnaires. The mean score of PSQI was 8.63 (SD=3.16), with 82.4% (309 out of 375) of students having a poor sleep quality (PSQI&gt;5). We observed an association between the quality of sleep given by the PSQI and the student's perception of anxiety (P&lt;0.001), stress (P&lt;0.001) and adaptation to distance education (P&lt;0.001). The results for the seven components of the PSQI were analyzed for three study groups (1-2-year student, 3-4-year student and 5-6-year student) and associations were observed between the three studied groups and sleep duration, with students in the last two years sleeping less (&lt;5/5-6h) than the remaining students, and with daytime dysfunction, with students in the first two years showing the highest percentage (75.5%). Conclusion: Sleep quality is poor in medical students, being associated with student's perception of anxiety, stress and difficulties in adapting to distance education. Active interventions should be implemented to improve sleep hygiene in medical students.","Ribeiro, P. E. P.; Catenaccio, L. A.; Angeli, T.; Garcia, A. M.; Honorato, V. E. S. P.; Silva, M. M.

"THE STUDENTS' EXPERIENCE OF EMERGENCY REMOTE EDUCATION DURING THE COVID - 19 PANDEMIC","The measures taken to contain the Covid 19 pandemic have affected the way it is studied in many countries around the world. Faculties did not have time to devise a strategy for delivering their courses because of the sudden changeover, and faculty had to find their own ways of delivering courses, many of them proving to be inadequately trained because they did not know how to use the online tools for the changeover. The latter was certainly felt by the students as well, so in this paper we focus on how the students of the Faculty of Arts at the University of Ljubljana experienced the changes in the way of studying. The results of the survey show that students' assessment of the appropriateness of different teaching methods differed depending on various factors, including the conditions students had at home to study. The conditions at home influenced students' attitudes towards distance learning, their assessment of their competence for distance learning, as well as their motivation to study and their feeling of being overwhelmed. Thus, more study difficulties, negative attitudes and motivation problems were observed among students who were not provided with adequate study conditions. Nevertheless, the results of the study show that distance learning has a potential that can only be used if all those involved in the process are provided with the right conditions. We conclude this paper with four recommendations that should be considered when introducing this type of study.","Radovan, M.; Radovan, D.

"THE RISK PERCEPTION DURING COVID-19 IN A PSYCHIATRIC POPULATION: A CROSSSECTIONAL OBSERVATIONAL STUDY","SCOPO DEL LAVORO: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a syndrome caused by a new Coronavirus strain, diagnosed for the first time in China and subsequently spread throughout the world. For this reason, on January 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a state of pandemic. In Italy, the first case of COVID-19 was reported on February 2020. Since then, the Italian Government imposed some restrictions, such as social distancing, in some cases confinement, that have contributed to generate a great psychological distress and forced people to seek new strategies to cope to the emergency. The American Psychological Association (APA) defines the perception of risk as an â€œindividual's subjective assessment of the level of risk associated with a particular hazardâ€. The risk perception has a strong impact on changing people's choices in the face of events and it can be divided into a rational part and a heuristic part guided by emotions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the perception of risk in three groups of psychiatric patients (depressed, bipolar and schizophrenic) in order to address which categories of patients were most vulnerable during an emergency situation and to evaluate future choices on public health and emergency planning. MATERIALI E METODI: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted on an outpatient setting between January 2021 and February 2021, which was during of Phase 2 of the Italian COVID-19 lockdown. Patients were previously tested to check the clinical stability through Drug Attitude Inventory (DAI), Quality of Life Index (QLF), Insight Scale (IS) and Short Form-12 Health Survey (SF-12), Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) for schizophrenic patients, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (MADRS) for depressed patients and MADRS plus Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) for bipolar patients. In addition, we used a questionnaire proposed by Lanciano et al., (2020) composed by 10 items to assess the perception of risk, risk-related variables and emotional states during COVID-19 emergency. RISULTATI: There were no statistical differences among the three groups of patients, thus the suggesting an homogeneity of the sample. Results showed that patients were more concerned about economic, psychologic and interpersonal consequences of COVID-19 pandemic, than about their own health. Positive and anxiety related emotions were the most frequent. In the multiple regression analysis, the likelihood of COVID resolution was positively correlated with the diagnosis of schizophrenia, the increased perceived effectiveness, and the presence of positive emotions. The perception of knowledge of the COVID phenomenon positively influenced both the institutional-economy risk and the psychological risk. Finally, positive emotions and uncertainty positively influenced the interpersonal risk. CONCLUSIONI: Our study highlight the need to give more attention to support psychiatric patients during emergency situations to reduce the perceived isolation. to prevent them from engaging in risky behavior.","Natale, A.; Birgillito, A.; Martinez, M.; Bonelli, M.; Rodolico, A.; Concerto, C.; Signorelli, M.

"Sleep, screen time and emotional disorders: implications for undergraduates","Introduction: Chronic or acute sleep deprivation accentuates emotional disorders such as anxiety and depression. For adolescents the exhaustive study journey, as well as the use of mobile devices, may be preponderant factor to reduce sleep duration. Objective: The aim of this study was to verify the relationship between sleep, screen time on mobile phone and symptoms common to anxiety and depression in higher education students. Methods: Data were collected between July and December 2019, period prior to COVID-19. The study sample consisted of 39 students from three undergraduate courses: Biological Sciences (CB;F=13;M=3;age=21+1.7);Computer Science (LC;F=0;M=13;age=21.5+1.9) and;Agronomic Engineering (EA;F=4;M=7;age=22.1+2.8). Depression level and anxiety were measured through the Depression Inventory (BDI) and Anxiety (BAI) by Beck, respectively. Munich Chronotype Questionnaire (MCTQ) was used to evaluate sleep habits, and Screen Time app to measured screen time on mobile phones. For the statistical study, the software program IBM SPSS, version 23, with two-way Anova with Tukey's post-hoc, and Spearman's correlation test were used. For the statistical study, the softwar IBM SPSS, version 23, with Anova two-way with Tukey posthoc, and correlation test of Spearman were used. Results: During weekdays, students of the EA slept earlier when compared to the other two courses (p= 0.001), but not on free days (p=0.498). Correlation analyses suggest that there is a negative correlation between sleep duration and depressive symptoms on weekdays (r = -0.488;p=0.004). This relationship was also observed between sleep duration and anxiety on weekdays (r = -0.323;p=0.045). Anxiety symptoms were positively associated with total cell phone use time on free days (r = 0.668;p=0.001) and the amount of unlocks on free days (r = 0.354;p=0.027). Conclusion: The shorter the sleep time, the greater the emotional disorders - anxiety and depression -, mainly on weekdays. Screen time on the mobile phone can be a marker for anxiety in the studied group. Just as there are behavioral differences in sleep rhythm between weekdays and free days, the same look should be taken to the analysis of the behavior of the use of cell phones.","Mota, N.

"TELEPHONE COUNSELLING IN COPING WITH THE COVID-19 LOCKDOWN CONSEQUENCES: PRELIMINARY DATA","SCOPO DEL LAVORO: Stressful effects of COVID-19 lockdown measures adopted to restrict population movements to help curb the epidemic impacted on people's daily lives. Biella is Northern Italy province. For decades this province has had suicide rates higher than the Piedmonts and Italian average. In two most recent decades a positive correlation between financial stressors, 2008 economic crisis related, and suicide has been found. As the current economic crisis COVID-19 related is expected to exacerbate again the vulnerability to suicide of this province, during the first lockdown the Crisis Center for Suicide Prevention of Biella set up a telephone counselling service. We aimed to evaluate whether it represented a suitable and useful tool for suicidal crisis prevention. MATERIALI E METODI: We evaluated whether some techniques such as â€œemotional stabilizationâ€, represented a suitable and useful tool for suicidal crisis prevention. Suitability and usefulness were assessed, based on caller feedback obtained during the first and last interviews using the so-called â€œthermometer of emotionsâ€: callers were asked to describe (a) the intensity of their emotions with respect to stress, anxiety, depressed mood, anger, and sleep and (b) the need to manage these emotions. Callers were also asked to provide feedback regarding their overall satisfaction with the service on a scale from 0 to 10. The phones were attended by two psychologists and each intervention usually consisted of four phases: (i) psychoeducation, (ii) emotional stabilization, (iii) identification and reinforcement of personal resources, (iv) ending the telephone counselling session. RISULTATI: A total of 199 telephone counselling sessions were made involving 47 callers, about 87% of whom never had any previous contact with a mental health service. Ten callers went on to urgent outpatient psychiatric visit, while three cases required a network intervention involving their general practitioner and social services, guaranteeing a multidisciplinary continuity of care. During the telephone counselling sessions, callers described different conditions including fear of financial loss, family conflicts, agitation, depression, and suicide ideation. Through the use of the â€œthermometer of emotionsâ€, callers who have undergone telephone interviews and interventions, have gradually provided lower scores both in the emotions intensity and in the need of managing them (data in elaboration). All callers reported a high level of satisfaction with the telephone counselling service (average rating of 9.5 out of 10). The phone service was closed in June 2020. CONCLUSIONI: The most innovative element of this project was that it proposed interventions for the emotional stabilization, something that is usually used in face- to-face sessions. Using the right protocols, it proved to offer continuity care and reduce pressure on hospital emergency departments while delivering good outcomes and patient satisfaction. Therefore, the COVID-19 pandemic provided an opportunity to overcome normative, technological, and cultural barriers regarding the use of remote healthcare services.","Macchiarulo, E.; Branca, F.; Mallardi, A.; Costanza, A.; Amerio, A.; Aguglia, A.; Serafini, G.; Amore, M.; Merli, R.","https://www.google.com/search?q=TELEPHONE+COUNSELLING+IN+COPING+WITH+THE+COVID-19+LOCKDOWN+CONSEQUENCES:+PRELIMINARY+DATA","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Psychopathology; 28:19, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-04","",35601,""
"Changes in sleep and diet of adolescent during COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction: In addition to the challenges commonly observed in adolescence, it is noteworthy that the COVID-19 pandemic may have caused even more changes in the routine of young people. It is known that lack of physical activity, inadequate nutrition and excessive use of screens can impair sleep quality, which can cause poor school performance and even compromise physical and mental health. Objective: To evaluate whether there was any change in the diet and sleep of adolescent schoolchildren during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This is an observational, prospective field study, in which students were subjectively evaluated with an online anamnesis. We evaluated 75 students (63% girls), with an average of 15.9 (Â±1.0) years old, which were studying at the first (36%), second (23%) or third year (41%) of high school (HS) from a private school in Americana-SP. Results: When asked about changes during the COVID-19 pandemic, 52 (69%) students said that they had noticed changes in diet. Of these, 15 (29%) indicated increased consumption of ultra-processed foods with higher caloric density, 13 (25%) indicated feeling less hungry and consequently eating less, 12 (23%) improved the quality of food and 9 (17%) increased food consumption compared to before the pandemic. As for sleep, 42 students (56%) observed changes during the pandemic, with 8 (19%) students noticing that they are sleeping less, 7 (17%) are sleeping more, 7 (17%) observed that sleep is unregulated and 7 (17%) that sleep is affected by anxiety and insomnia. The 2nd year HS students were the ones who most observed changes in sleep (71%) and diet (82%) during pandemic, followed by 3rd year students (55% changes in sleep and 71% in diet). When asked about the quality of sleep, 14 (33%) students said they do not sleep well because they sleep for a short time and have â€œunregulatedâ€ sleep, seven (17%) said they sleep well only sometimes, four (10%) said they did not sleep well because of anxiety, two (5%) because of insomnia and one student (2%) said that he didn't sleep well because he woke up several times during the night. When we evaluated the usual time for going to bed and waking up before and after the pandemic, it was noted that most students went to sleep and woke up later in the pandemic. Conclusion: It is concluded that there were changes in sleep and diet habits during the pandemic, with changes in sleep reflecting a lower sleep quality, while positive and negative changes were reported in diet.","Junqueira, L.

"THE EFFECTS OF RELIGIOSITY AND SPIRITUAL WELL-BEING ON PERCEIVED STRESS DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC","The human being is endowed with a strong conservation factor. Created in the image of the Divinity, in extreme conditions it can activate positive spiritual forces in order to overcome the difficult moments in its existence. Spiritual well-being refers to our willingness to find the meaning and purpose of human existence, a habit of questioning everything and understanding  things that cannot be easily explained or understood. The present study aims to investigate the relationship between spiritual well-being (SWB) and religiosity as protective factors during the pandemic years of 2020-2021. In order to do so, we conducted an online survey in order to measure the perceived impact and stress of the covid-19 pandemic on young people's life. 719 Romanian students, with a mean age of 28 years (SD = 10.36), filled in a demographic questionnaire, Paloutzian & Ellison's Spiritual Well-Being Scale and Huber's Centrality of Religiosity Scale. The results showed that the people who attended the church more frequently, who prayed a lot, who could communicate with their priest, who have high levels of spiritual well-being and have the religiosity as a central value, perceive a less impact of the pandemic, and felt lower levels of stress during these years. We consider these results to be important for the combined efforts of psychologist and priests to support people's mental health, and is one of the few studies on spiritual well-being on Orthodox population during this Pandemic context.","Himcinschi, M.; Buzgar, R.; Pintea, S.","https://www.google.com/search?q=THE+EFFECTS+OF+RELIGIOSITY+AND+SPIRITUAL+WELL-BEING+ON+PERCEIVED+STRESS+DURING+COVID-19+PANDEMIC","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND THEOLOGY; 18(4):19-32, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-04","",35603,""
"Brazilian version of bedtime procrastination scale validated during social isolation due to COVID-19","Introduction: The prevalence of sleep disorders has increased over time, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic, and among them, insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea are the most common. However, some individual behaviors are also related to decreased sleep quality and its possible consequences. In this regard, bedtime procrastination plays an important role in decreasing the quality of sleep, which may be related to the onset of diseases such as depression, obesity and cognitive deficit. Thus, the Bedtime Procrastination Scale (BPS) was developed to measure various aspects of this phenomenon. Objective: To develop a Brazilian Portuguese version of the Bedtime Procrastination Scale and examine its psychometric properties. Methods: The data was obtained from online surveys using the Brazilian adaptation of the BPS. The validation followed the steps of preparation, translation, reconciliation of translations, back-translation, review, pre-test and validation. Exploratory Factor Analysis with the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Technique was used to extract the factors. To assess the factorability of the generated matrix, the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) and Bartlett's Sphericity tests were used. KMO values above 0.8 and statistical significance (p = 0.05) of the Bartlett Sphericity Test were considered adequate. Eigenvalues above 1 were used to demarcate the number of factors to be extracted. Varimax rotation was used to improve the interpretation of the extracted factors and subsequently, each item selected to represent the underlying construct were those with a factor load = 0.4. Results: In a sample of 495 volunteers (Age = 31.61 (12.03), 65.9% female), the BPS was applied, with results ranging from 9 to 45. The students scored 32 (9) and the teachers 29 (10). The KaiserMeyer-Olkin test (KMO) (0.914) and Bartlett's sphericity (p &lt;0.001) indicated the adequacy of the factorial matrix. As for the consistency of the extracted factors, there was greater precision and reliability in factor 1 (Cronbach's a 0.9). Conclusion: This research validated the Bedtime Procrastination Scale to Brazilian Portuguese. It showed that during the COVID-19 pandemic social isolation, the student and teacher body procrastinated the bedtime even without labor activities for the next day.","GonÃ§alves, V. L. S.; Luz, M.

"Managing Pandemic-induced Mental Health Concerns in the Philippines: A Strong Case for Building Public Trust and Confidence","Using an online survey among Filipinos jointly conducted by YouGov and the Institute of Global Health Innovation at the Imperial College London from 31 March to 30 September 2020, this paper examines the state of mental health in the Philippines during the height of the pandemic and its link to public trust in and confidence toward the government and relevant authorities. The analysis reveals that young adults, women, part-time employees, unemployed, and persons with comorbidities have faced elevated risks of psychological distress during the pandemic. Empirical results further indicate that having strong and capable governance, setting clear directions and guidelines, and effectively motivating compliant behaviors on safety protocols allay fears and concerns among these groups, and thus are instrumental to preventing potential cases of depressive and anxiety disorders.","Gaspar, R.

"Online workshop proposal on sleep hygiene during the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction: Inadequate sleep habits can compromise the quality of sleep and performance in activities of daily living of the individual, even more, considering the COVID-19 pandemic, which significantly interfered in the sleep and mental health of the population. Objective: To encourage the perception of habits that negatively influence the sleep quality of young people during social isolation in times of COVID-19. Methods: A workshop was proposed through the Youtube platform, during a scientific event on â€œMental Healthâ€. Two speech therapists organized a workshop with the theme â€œSleep care practicesâ€. The theme was divided into three parts. First, the basic concepts in sleep, the notion of sleep phase distribution, and consequences of sleep deprivation were addressed. The second part included the explanation and stimulation for self-application of the Mini Sleep Questionnaire (MSQ) from the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). This MSQ questionnaire was selected because, in addition to being self-administered, it assesses the frequency of sleep-related complaints and the ESS Scale subjectively assesses excessive daytime sleepiness. Finally, the third and last part consisted of reflections on sleep hygiene, with tips on how to improve these behaviors and habits. Results: The interactive proposal based on practice in brainstorming, aimed to generate reflections to participants, seeking to highlight inappropriate points in their routines, in order to enable a new planning of behaviors related to habits that influence the various aspects of sleep hygiene.

"Are anxiety and depression related to poor sleep quality in university professors during the COVID-19 pandemic?","Introduction: University professors present several mental health-related symptoms, such as sleep disorders, anxiety and depression. During the COVID-19 pandemic, health practitioners and researchers observed a surge in depressive and anxious symptoms and worse sleep quality. Objective: To analyze factors associated with poor sleep quality among university professors during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A virtual questionnaire via Google FormsÂ® platform was sent to professors via university working groups and e-mail lists. The instrument comprised questions about gender, age, self-isolation and specific questionnaires: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI);State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI);Mental Health Index (MHI-5);Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) and International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). All of the participants signed an Informed Consent Term, and the research was approved by the Ethics Committee in Research (no. 4.036.797). The data were analyzed using IBM Statistical Packages for the Social SciencesÂ® version 26.0 and a descriptive level criterion of 5% (p&lt;0.05) was adopted. Results: A total of 96 participants participated in the study. Half of the participants (n=48) had poor sleep quality in the study. Using bivariate analysis, state-anxiety (p=0.014) and depressive symptoms (p=0.038) were the only factors associated with poor sleep quality. 52.1% of the sample had medium to high anxiety risk (STAI-S), and among them, 62.0% had poor sleep quality. 41.7% of the university professors had depressive symptoms, and from those, 62.5% were not sleeping well. In a binary logistic regression model, professors with depressive symptoms had a 2.39 times higher risk of poor sleep quality (p=0.040/ 95% CI: 1.04-5.50);and those with state-anxiety had a 2.78 times higher risk of poor sleep quality (p=0.015/ 95% CI: 1.22-6.37). Conclusion: In this study, the presence of state-anxiety or depressive symptoms were risk factors associated with the higher incidence of poor sleep quality among university professors.","Abreu, J.

"Well-Being Among Respiratory Therapists in an Academic Medical Center During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Recent studies have revealed high rates of burnout among respiratory therapists (RTs), which has implications for patient care and outcomes as well as for the health care workforce. We sought to better understand RT well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study was to determine rates and identify determinants of well-being, including burnout and professional fulfillment, among RTs in ICUs. We conducted a mixed-methods study comprised of a survey administered quarterly from July 2020-May 2021 to critical-care health care professionals and semi-structured interviews from April-May 2021 with 10 ICU RTs within a single health center. We performed multivariable analyses to compare RT well-being to other professional groups and to evaluate changes in well-being over time. We analyzed qualitative interview data using thematic analysis, followed by mapping themes to the Maslow needs hierarchy. One hundred and eight RTs responded to at least one quarterly survey. Eighty-two (75%) experienced burnout; 39 (36%) experienced professional fulfillment, and 62 (58%) reported symptoms of depression. Compared to clinicians of other professions in multivariable analyses, RTs were significantly more likely to experience burnout (odds ratio 2.32 [95% CI 1.41-3.81]) and depression (odds ratio 2.73 [95% CI 1.65-4.51]) and less likely to experience fulfillment (odds ratio 0.51 [95% CI 0.31-0.85]). We found that staffing challenges, safety concerns, workplace conflict, and lack of work-life balance led to burnout. Patient care, use of specialized skills, appreciation and a sense of community at work, and purpose fostered professional fulfillment. Themes identified were mapped to Maslow's hierarchy of needs; met needs led to professional fulfillment, and unmet needs led to burnout. ICU RTs experienced burnout during the pandemic at rates higher than other professions. To address RT needs, institutions should design and implement strategies to reduce burnout across all levels.","Roberts, Silvestri, Klaiman, Gutsche, Jablonski, Fuchs, Kerlin, Mikkelsen","https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.10094","20220803","ICU; burnout; critical care medicine; respiratory care; wellness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-04","",35610,""
"Burnout Among Respiratory Therapists Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic","Burnout is a major challenge in health care and is associated with poor overall well-being, increased medical errors, worse patient outcomes, and low job satisfaction. There is scant literature focused on the respiratory therapist's (RT) experience of burnout, and a thorough exploration of RTs' perception of factors associated with burnout has not been reported. The aim of this qualitative study was to understand the factors associated with burnout as experienced by RTs amid the COVID-19 pandemic. We performed a post hoc, qualitative analysis of free-text responses from a survey of burnout prevalence in RTs. There were 1,114 total and 220 free-text responses. Five overarching themes emerged from the analysis: staffing, workload, physical/emotional consequences, lack of effective leadership, and lack of respect. Respondents discussed feelings of anxiety, depression, and compassion fatigue as well as concerns that lack of adequate staffing, high workload assignments, and inadequate support from leadership contributed to feelings of burnout. Specific instances of higher patient acuity, surge in critically ill patients, rapidly evolving changes in treatment recommendations, and minimal training and preparation for an extended scope of practice were reported as stressors that led to burnout. Some respondents stated that they felt a lack of respect for both the RT profession and the contribution of RTs to patient care. Themes associated with burnout in RTs included staffing, workload, physical and emotional exhaustion, lack of effective leadership, and lack of respect. These results provide potential targets for interventions to combat burnout among RTs.","Strickland, Roberts, Smith, Hoerr, Burr, Hinkson, Rehder, Miller","https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.10144","20220803","COVID-19; burnout; leadership; respiratory care practitioner; respiratory therapist; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-04","",35611,""
"Predictors of burnout in female nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic","The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictors of burnout in female nurses during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. It also sought to evaluate the relationship between each of the variables studied (anxiety, depression, sociodemographic and COVID-19 variables) and the dimensions of the burnout. One of the groups of health care workers worst affected by the COVID-19 crisis has been women working as nursing staff, due to the high percentage they account for at a global level and their direct contact with infected patients. This was a cross-sectional, quantitative study. Four hundred forty-four Spanish female nurses from hospital and primary health care centres took part in the study. The data were obtained in 2020 by means of an online survey. Symptoms of depression are a common predictor variable to all the dimensions of burnout, whereas symptoms of anxiety predict emotional exhaustion and depersonalization. Age and years of experience in the job predict depersonalization, whereas the probability of contracting the infection is a predictor variable of emotional exhaustion and personal accomplishment. Predictor variables should be considered in the creation of prevention and intervention plans to reduce the levels of burnout in female nurses.","LuceÃƒÂ±o-Moreno, Talavera-Velasco, MartÃƒÂ­n-GarcÃƒÂ­a","https://doi.org/10.1111/ijn.13084","20220803","COVID-19; anxiety; burnout; depression; nurses; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-04","",35612,""
"ENDOGENOUS FUNGAL ENDOPHTHALMITIS FOLLOWING COVID-19 INFECTION: CASE REPORT AND REVIEW OF LITERATURE","To describe a case of endogenous endophthalmitis (EE) following severe COVID-19 disease, review patient outcomes with EE following COVID-19 infection, review evidence regarding risk factors for developing EE. Review of health records, imaging, intravitreal injection, and pars plana vitrectomy for bilateral fungal EE following severe COVID-19 disease. Literature review on outcomes in EE following COVID-19 disease. 63 year-old male with diabetes and hypertension was admitted to hospital for severe COVID-19 disease for 3 months. His stay required ICU admission, intubation, high-dose corticosteroids, tocilizumab, and was complicated by bacteremia, empyema, and fungal esophagitis. He developed floaters and bilateral vision loss (visual acuity 20/40 OD, CF OS) with vitritis 2.5 months into his stay that did not respond to intravitreal voriconazole. Pars plana vitrectomy was performed for both eyes, resulting in visual acuity of 20/40 OD, 20/30 OS. Vitreous cultures were positive for candida albicans. EE following COVID-19 disease has been reported in 22 patients to date, and outcomes are poor, with 40%+ of eyes legally blind (20/200 or worse). Although influenced by availability of imaging modalities and degree of training of the evaluating physician, misdiagnosis can affect Ã‚Â¼ of cases, delaying treatment. Age, male gender, and diabetes increase risk of severe COVID-19, which requires prolonged hospitalization, invasive catheretization, and immunosuppression, which in turn increases risk of nosocomial infection. Low threshold for suspecting endogenous endophthalmitis in patients presenting with floaters and decreased vision following severe COVID-19 disease is necessary to ensure prompt recognition and treatment.","Zaslavsky, Grewal, Cruz-Pimentel, Qian, Derzko-Dzulynsky, Yan","https://doi.org/10.1097/ICB.0000000000001306","20220803","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-04","",35613,""

"Child emotional and behavioral difficulties and parent stress during COVID-19 lockdown in Sri Lankan families","Understanding parents' and children's mental health issues would help design population-specific intervention programs. The present study explored parents' perceived stress and child emotions and behavior during the COVID-19 lockdown among Sri Lankan families. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among Sri Lankan parents of children aged 11 to 17 years. Validated instruments (Perceived Stress Scale-PSS and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire-SDQ) evaluated parental stress, child emotions, and hyperactivity/inattention. Multiple linear regression assessed the predictors of mental health issues, including the interaction between age and gender. Three hundred fifty-five parents responded to the survey (mothers:76%). One-third of parents experienced difficulties with their children during the pandemic. Emotions and hyperactivity-inattention problems measured via the SDQ scale were high among 38% of children, while the perceived stress was high in 79.2% of parents. Overall, child emotions and hyperactivity-inattention increased with decreasing age, increasing parent stress, having middle-income compared to high-income, and having a family member/close relative tested positive for COVID-19. Hyperactivity-inattention (29.3%) was more than the emotional problems (22%) among children. The emotional problems were reported more with increasing parent stress, while child hyperactivity-inattention alone was reported more with decreasing age, middle-income compared to high-income families, and increasing parent stress. Also, the interaction effect of age and gender indicated that higher age was related to greater parent-reported hyperactivity-inattention problems in males. The findings highlight how the COVID-19 crisis and social isolation have contributed to increased parental stress and child emotional and hyperactivity-inattention problems. In addition to cautioning the healthcare workers, socio-culturally appropriate preventive and supportive mental health programs may help deal with further waves of COVID-19 or any other adverse circumstances.","Athapathu, Navaratnam, Doluweera, Liyanage","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0271757","20220803","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-04","",35615,""
"When Pandemic Interferes with Work: Psychological Capital and Mental Health of Social Workers during COVID-19","The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is not only limited to physical health but also extends to various aspects of everyday life. The present study proposes that the prolonged pandemic can lead to pandemic-work conflict (PWC). The article examines how the pandemic interferes with work, the association between PWC and mental health, and the underlying mechanism of this process. A total of 303 full-time social workers in Hong Kong responded to measures on PWC, psychological capital (PsyCap), and anxiety and depressive symptoms. Data were collected between February and April 2020, when the COVID-19 outbreak was beginning to worsen; 15.8 percent and 14.9 percent of the participants reported mild to severe anxiety and depression, respectively. Time-based PWC was positively associated and strain-based PWC was negatively associated with PsyCap, which was in turn negatively associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms. PsyCap was a significant mediator of these relationships. The findings suggest that the relationship between strain-based PWC and psychological distress can be explained by PsyCap, whereby the depletion of psychological resources may contribute to anxiety and depressive symptoms. Positive psychological resources may be an intervening point for promoting mental health among the social services workforce.","Ho, Chui, Chan","https://doi.org/10.1093/sw/swac035","20220803","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; mental health; psychological capital","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-04","",35616,""
"Residential substance use treatment outcomes for pregnant and postpartum women: Distinct patterns for women enrolled before versus during the COVID-19 pandemic","Substance use among pregnant and postpartum women (PPW) is a serious public health concern. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated substance use among the general population including pregnant women, and disrupted operations for substance use treatment centers. Little is known about the outcomes of substance use treatment for PPW before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data from a longitudinal program evaluation were analyzed to examine outcomes among 136 PPW participating in a residential SUD treatment program, and to explore differences in treatment outcomes for women who enrolled in services before versus during the COVID-19 pandemic. Analyses were used to test the significance of change from treatment intake to 6-month post-intake on assessments of substance use, mental health symptoms, and functioning collected to evaluate the Healthy Families Program (HFP), a comprehensive program for PPW located within a gender-specific SUD treatment facility in the United States. Results indicated that from treatment intake to follow-up assessment, clients self-reported statistically significant improvements in family functioning and daily functioning as well as reduced days of substance use. Notably, the rate of treatment intakes declined during the COVID-19 pandemic. In separate analyses by subgroup, mental health indicators showed improvements only for clients engaged in treatment before the COVID-19 pandemic and not for clients served during the COVID-19 pandemic, but substance use decreased significantly for both pre-pandemic and pandemic enrollees. Specialized treatment considerations and implications for PPW are discussed, including a need for added emphasis on co-occurring mental health symptoms and family system stress during a pandemic, and the role of nurses in identifying and addressing these concerns. Additionally, potential relapse prevention efforts during COVID-19 for PPW with substance use disorders are examined. The present research continues to highlight the importance of specialized treatment programming for PPW with SUDs as well as the potential need for additional recovery support mechanisms to be utilized during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Chou, Noel, Williams, Spruell, Nixon, Riedel, Zaarur","https://doi.org/10.1111/jnu.12803","20220803","COVID-19; pregnant women; substance use disorders; substance use treatment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-04","",35617,""

"Distress symptoms during the COVID-19 lockdown: A study with the general population of the United Arab Emirates","Since the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) government has taken a series of preventive measures to control the spread of the Coronavirus. Dealing with the unforeseen challenges caused by the pandemic has had a profound impact on people all around the world. Pharmacists played an important public health role during the COVID-19 pandemic, and they were the first point of contact with the public and the first source of information, providing accurate and reliable management and preventive measures. The aim of this study was to analyse the distress symptoms and the associated factors among a sample of the UAE population. This was an observational cross-sectional study conducted over the period of September to October 2020. A bilingual online self-administered questionnaire was distributed among individuals aged 15 years and above. Data was analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). Most of the students in the sample found online learning less effective than in-class learning. Among these, 49.9% and 62.8 % reported that they had normal sleep and eating habits, respectively. In all the sample, most of the participants (96%) were adherent to preventive measures. Higher levels of distress during the COVID-19 lockdown were found among females, individuals younger than 35 years old, those who neglected personal hygiene and who had worse quality of family gatherings and relationships. This study identified factors associated with distress symptoms experienced by people during the lockdown and perceived attitudes regarding online learning, preventive measures and changes in people's behaviours and family environment. Knowledge about how lockdown has affected the lives of the populations can be used to design public health interventions aimed at promoting the health and well-being of the communities.","Abduelkarem, Samorinha, Sharif, Hamrouni, Hassanein","https://doi.org/10.18549/PharmPract.2022.2.2659","20220803","COVID-19 pandemic; Distress symptoms; Mental health; Online learning; United Arab Emirates","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-04","",35622,""

A cross-lagged effects model was performed to examine the association between these variables. Lack of emotional support and lack of socialization in June 2020 increased isolation in December 2020. Besides, MTD and hikikomori interacted with each other. Interestingly, although hikikomori tendency increased depressive tendencies, SRB itself did not have a significant path on any mental health-related variables. Poor interpersonal relationships, rather than SRB per se, are suggested to be a risk factor for increased isolation among office workers in the COVID-19 pandemic. Appropriate early interventions such as interpersonal or emotional support may prevent the transition to pathological hikikomori. The association between MTD and hikikomori seems to reveal the interesting possibility that MTD is a gateway to increased risk of hikikomori, and that hikikomori is a gateway to MTD as well. Future research is required to elucidate the relationship between hikikomori and MTD.","Kubo, Katsuki, Horie, Yamakawa, Tateno, Shinfuku, Sartorius, Sakamoto, Kato","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-022-03446-8","20220803","COVID-19 pandemic; Hikikomori (pathological social withdrawal); Modern-type depression (MTD); Office workers; Self-restraint behavior","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-04","",35623,""
"Adverse Childhood Experiences and Depressive Symptoms Trajectories Among Middle-Aged and Elderly - China, 2011-2018","Previous studies in western populations have found consistent relationships between adverse childhood experiences and the development of mood and anxiety disorders, especially depressive symptoms in adolescence and adulthood. This study used a longitudinal design and analytic method to model depressive symptom trajectories from 2011 to 2018 among the middle-aged and elderly in China. This study also investigated the association between adverse childhood experiences and adulthood depressive symptoms in the Chinese population. Future public policy could consider early prevention and intervention on adverse childhood experiences to prevent adult depressive symptoms. Besides, it is essential to create safe, stable, and nurturing environments for children's development.","Li, Lin, Pei","https://doi.org/10.46234/ccdcw2022.129","20220803","COVID-19; booster; vaccine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-04","",35624,""
"Pandemic Perils and Promise: Implementation of a Virtual Parenting Intervention during COVID-19 among Children with Early Neurological Conditions","In this study, we examined feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a telepsychological positive parenting intervention (I-InTERACT-North, Internet-basedInteracting Together Everyday: Recovery After Childhood Traumatic Brain Injury) during the COVID-19 pandemic among Canadian families of children at-risk for neurodevelopmental challenges given congenital or neonatal conditions. I-InTERACT-North was developed to improve behavioral and emotional outcomes in children with neurological conditions by utilizing and adapting parenting strategies from several established family-focused programmes. A pragmatic prospective pre-post single-site pilot study design was used to assess feasibility, acceptabilty, and preliminary efficacy of I-InTERACT North during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thirty-five families of children ages three to nine years were referred between March 2020 and January 2021. Eighteen families enrolled, and 12 (67% adherence) completed the programme. Parents reported strong therapeutic alliance and programme acceptability with barriers due to competing time demands. Therapists reported high acceptability but perceived parental burnout. Parenting confidence (<i>d</i> =Ã‚Â 0.70), and child behavior (<i>d</i> =Ã‚Â 1.30) improved following the intervention. Results demonstrate the programme's value to families during the pandemic, while underscoring unique participation barriers.

"Optimizing chronic pain management through patient engagement with quality of life measures: a randomized controlled trial","Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) represents a new approach for guiding chronic pain management because it is patient-centered and more likely to be understood and accepted by patients. To assess the value and utility of an eHealth intervention for patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP) that was primarily based on HRQOL measures and to measure the clinical outcomes associated with its use. A randomized controlled trial was conducted within the Pain Registry for Epidemiological, Clinical, and Interventional Studies and Innovation (PRECISION Pain Research Registry) using participants screened from November 2019 through February 2021. A total of 331 registry participants within the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia met the eligibility criteria, which included having CLBP and HRQOL deficits. Almost three-fourths of the participants were enrolled after onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The participants were randomized to an eHealth intervention for HRQOL or wait list control. The primary outcome measures involved HRQOL based on the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), including the SPADE cluster (Sleep disturbance, Pain interference with activities, Anxiety, Depression, and low Energy/fatigue) and each of its five component scales. Secondary outcome measures involved low back pain intensity and back-related functioning. Changes over time for each outcome measure reported by participants in each treatment group were compared utilizing the student's <i>t</i>-test for statistical significance and Cohen's <i>d</i> statistic for clinical importance. Outcomes were reported as between-group differences in change scores and the <i>d</i> statistic, with positive values favoring the experimental treatment group. There were no significant differences between the experimental and control treatment groups for changes over time in any primary outcome measure. The <i>d</i> statistic (95% confidence interval) for the difference between the experimental and control treatment groups on the SPADE cluster was 0.04 (-0.18-0.25). The corresponding <i>d</i> statistics for the SPADE scales ranged fromÃ‚Â -0.06 (-0.27 to 0.16) for anxiety to 0.11 (-0.10 to 0.33) for sleep disturbance. There were also no significant or clinically important differences between the experimental and control treatment groups on the secondary outcome measures. Additionally, in subgroup analyses involving participants treated by osteopathic vs allopathic physicians, no significant interaction effects were observed. The eHealth intervention studied herein did not achieve statistically significant or clinically important improvements in any of the primary or secondary outcome measures. However, the validity and generalizability of the findings may have been limited by the unforeseen onset and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic shortly after beginning the trial.","Licciardone, McDonald, Yablon, Ngo, Cunanan Garza, Aryal","https://doi.org/10.1515/jom-2021-0296","20220802","chronic low back pain; quality of life; randomized controlled trial","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-04","",35626,""
"Cluster analysis unveils a severe persistent respiratory impairment phenotype 3-months after severe COVID-19","The mid-term respiratory sequelae in survivors of severe COVID-19 appear highly heterogeneous. In addition, factors associated with respiratory sequelae are not known. In this monocentric prospective study, we performed a multidisciplinary assessment for respiratory and muscular impairment and psychological distress 3Ã‚Â months after severe COVID-19. We analysed factors associated with severe persistent respiratory impairment, amongst demographic, COVID-19 severity, and 3-month assessment. Patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia requiringÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°4L/min were included for a systematic 3-month visit, including respiratory assessment (symptoms, lung function, CT scan), muscular evaluation (body composition, physical function and activity, disability), psychopathological evaluation (anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder-PTSD) and quality of life. A cluster analysis was performed to identify subgroups of patients based on objective functional measurements: D<sub>LCO</sub>, total lung capacity and 6-min walking distance (6MWD). Sixty-two patients were analysed, 39% had dyspnea on exercise (mMRCÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°2), 72% had D<sub>LCO</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°80%, 90% had CT-scan abnormalities; 40% had sarcopenia/pre-sarcopenia and 31% had symptoms of PTSD. Cluster analysis identified a group of patients (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°18, 30.5%) with a severe persistent (SP) respiratory impairment (D<sub>LCO</sub> 48Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°12%, 6MWD 299Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°141Ã‚Â m). This SP cluster was characterized by older age, severe respiratory symptoms, but also sarcopenia/pre-sarcopenia, symptoms of PTSD and markedly impaired quality of life. It was not associated with initial COVID-19 severity or management. We identified a phenotype of patients with severe persistent respiratory and muscular impairment and psychological distress 3Ã‚Â months after severe COVID-19.

"The TROLLEY Study: assessing travel, health, and equity impacts of a new light rail transit investment during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted life in extraordinary ways impacting health and daily mobility. Public transit provides a strategy to improve individual and population health through increased active travel and reduced vehicle dependency, while ensuring equitable access to jobs, healthcare, education, and mitigating climate change. However, health safety concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic eroded ridership, which could have longstanding negative consequences. Research is needed to understand how mobility and health change as the pandemic recedes and how transit investments impact health and equity outcomes. The TROLLEY (TRansit Opportunities for HeaLth, Livability, Exercise and EquitY) study will prospectively investigate a diverse cohort of university employees after the opening of a new light rail transit (LRT) line and the easing of campus COVID-19 restrictions. Participants are current staff who live eitherÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°1 mile, 1-2 miles, orÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã‚Â 2 miles from LRT, with equal distribution across economic and racial/ethnic strata. The primary aim is to assess change in physical activity, travel mode, and vehicle miles travelled using accelerometer and GPS devices. Equity outcomes include household transportation and health-related expenditures. Change in health outcomes, including depressive symptoms, stress, quality of life, body mass index and behavior change constructs related to transit use will be assessed via self-report. Pre-pandemic variables will be retrospectively collected. Participants will be measured at 3 times over 2Ã‚Â years of follow up. Longitudinal changes in outcomes will be assessed using multilevel mixed effects models. Analyses will evaluate whether proximity to LRT, sociodemographic, and environmental factors modify change in outcomes over time. The TROLLEY study will utilize rigorous methods to advance our understanding of health, well-being, and equity-oriented outcomes of new LRT infrastructure through the COVID-19 recovery period, in a sample of demographically diverse adult workers whose employment location is accessed by new transit. Results will inform land use, transportation and health investments, and workplace interventions. Findings have the potential to elevate LRT as a public health priority and provide insight on how to ensure public transit meets the needs of vulnerable users and is more resilient in the face of future health pandemics.

"Development and Implementation of a Virtual Clinical Skills Examination in General Psychiatry","During the COVID-19 pandemic, psychiatry programs have administered the Clinical Skills Evaluation (CSE) through videoconferencing. The authors evaluated the feasibility and appropriateness of administering virtual CSEs. Virtual CSEs were administered to 11 general psychiatry residents on March 16, 2021. Teleconference software was used to connect faculty at work sites, residents at a simulation center, and volunteer patients at home. Before and after the CSE, residents and faculty were surveyed with Likert scale questions to evaluate their perceptions and experience. All virtual CSEs were completed successfully. Nine residents (82%) and 12 faculty (92%) responded to both surveys. Most participants (range, 67-83%) indicated that the virtual CSE was appropriate for assessing patient health and resident skills. Most participants (range, 56-100%) reported that the opening and closing of the interview, informational and affective cues, and rapport were adequately assessed. All participants agreed that suicidal and homicidal risks could be adequately assessed. Most faculty and residents (76%) believed that unique skills were required for telehealth interviews. Before the CSE, more faculty than residents believed that they received adequate training for the virtual CSE (P=.02); afterward, most participants thought that training was adequate (P=.46). More faculty than residents reported increased convenience with virtual assessments (both surveys, P&lt;.01). Virtual CSEs were deemed feasible and appropriate. Further research is needed to identify the specific skills required to perform a virtual CSE and to clarify the potential limitations and benefits of this format.","Gentry, Murray, Altchuler, McKean, Joyce, Hilty","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40596-022-01691-4","20220802","COVID-19; Graduate medical education; Patient simulation; Telehealth; Telepsychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-04","",35629,""
"Resilience Enhancement Online Training for Nurses (REsOluTioN): Protocol for a Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial","Globally, nurses are facing increased pressure to provide high-quality complex patient care within environments with scarce resources in terms of staffing, infrastructure, or financial reward. The strain and demand on the psychological health and well-being of nurses during COVID-19 has been substantial, with many experiencing burnout; as such, interventions to enhance resilience within the workplace are required. A face-to-face resilience enhancement training program for nurses that was effective in improving resilience levels was translated into a 4-week online training program, Resilience Enhancement Online Training for Nurses (REsOluTioN), to enable greater accessibility for nurses. This study aims to compare levels of resilience, psychological health, and well-being in nurses before and after the online resilience training compared to a wait list control group. It will also explore participants' engagement with the trial and their acceptability of the online training. This is a two-arm, parallel, randomized controlled trial with a 6-week follow-up period. Up to 100 registered nonagency nurses working at a National Health Service hospital trust in South England will be recruited. Four cohorts will run, and participants will be randomized into a wait list control group or to REsOluTioN. Pre- and postonline surveys will collect study outcome measure data. In the REsOluTioN arm, data will be collected on the perceived usefulness of the online training via an online survey. Institutional and health research authority approvals have been obtained. REsOluTioN will aim to empower nurses to maintain and enhance their resilience while working under challenging clinical conditions. The online training will be interactive with input from mentors, health care leaders, and peers to promote engagement and enhanced communication, and will create a forum where nurses can express their views and concerns, without hierarchical infrastructures inhibiting them. This can increase self-knowledge and learning around workplace resilience coping strategies and provide a safe space to validate feelings through mentorship and peer support. Findings will be reported in accordance with the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) guidelines. The trial is now finished and was conducted between August 2021 and May 2022. The REsOluTioN trial will enable preliminary data to be gathered to indicate the online training's effectiveness in enhancing nurses' resilience in the workplace, with the potential for larger scale follow-up studies to identify its value to nurses working across a range of health care settings.

"Starting From Scratch: Toward A New Measure of Student Social-Emotional Competence","This Research Brief reports on a pilot test toward developing a new measure of student social- emotional competence informed by the five-factor model proposed by the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL 5). Current measures of the CASEL 5 are limited by development approaches that may contribute to confirmation bias. Our development approach â€œstarted from scratchâ€ by creating a fresh item pool and then subjecting this pool to content validation via expert reviewers (N = 4). We administered the 47 best pilot items to a sample of elementary teachers (N = 19) who rated all students in their classes (N = 415). We then evaluated the structural validity of responses to the pilot items via EFA in search of simple structure. Ultimately, results yielded a 14-item, two-factor measurement model that was more parsimonious than the CASEL 5. Scores from this new measure showed relatively normal distributions and theoretically consistent correlations with other measures of student well-being and mental health. Limitations to generalizability and next steps for research are discussed.","Stephanie A.
