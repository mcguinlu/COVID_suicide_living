"Acceptability of Telemedicine Features to Promote Its Uptake in Practice: A Survey of Community Telemental Health Providers","Understanding what motivates mental health providers to use telemedicine (i e , telemental health) is critical for optimizing its uptake, especially during unprecedented times (e g , the COVID-19 pandemic)  Drawing from the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), this report examined the characteristics of telemental health providers and how the acceptability of telemedicine features contributes to their intention to use the technology more often in practice  Telemental health providers (N = 177) completed an online survey between March and May 2019  Most providers (75%) spent less than 25% of their work-week using telemedicine, but 70% reported an intention to use telemedicine more in the future  The belief that telemedicine affords greater access to patients, work-life balance, flexibility in providing care, and the opportunity to be at the forefront of innovative care were significant predictors of intentions to use the technology more in the future  Other significant predictors included needing assistance to coordinate insurance reimbursements, manage a successful telemedicine practice, and integrate the telemedicine program with other health IT software  Findings have important implications for increasing the frequency of telemedicine use among telemental health providers  Future research and practice should leverage providers&rsquo;positive beliefs about telemedicine acceptability and consider their needs to enhance its uptake","Bunnell, Brian E.; Barrera, Janelle F.; Paige, Samantha R.; Turner, Dylan, Welch, Brandon M.","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17228525","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health;17(22):8525, 2020.; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health;17(22):8525, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-20","",7283,""

"IMPLICATIONS OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AND RISK FACTOR MANAGEMENT","COVID-19 and our public health responses to the pandemic may have far-reaching implications for cardiovascular risk affecting the general population and not just survivors of COVID-19. In this narrative review, we discuss how the pandemic may impact general cardiovascular risk for years to come, and explore the mitigating potential of telehealth interventions. From a health care perspective, the shift away from in-person office visits may have led many to defer routine risk factor management and may have had unforeseen effects on continuity of care and adherence. Fear of COVID-19 has led some patients to forego care for acute cardiovascular events. Curtailment of routine outpatient laboratory testing has likely delayed intensification of risk-factor modifying medical therapy, and drug shortages and mis-information may have negatively impacted adherence to antihypertensive, glucose-lowering, and lipid-lowering agents. From a societal perspective, the unprecedented curtailment of social and economic activities has led to income loss, unemployment, social isolation, decreased physical activity, and increased frequency of depression and anxiety, all of which are known to be associated with worse cardiovascular risk-factor control and outcomes. We must embrace and evaluate measures to mitigate these potential harms to avoid an epidemic of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the coming years that could dwarf the initial health impacts of COVID-19.","Lau, McAlister","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjca.2020.11.001","20201119","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-20","",7319,""
"Real-time suicide mortality data from police reports in Queensland, Australia, during the COVID-19 pandemic: an interrupted time-series analysis","Deaths by suicide can increase during infectious disease outbreaks. This study analysed suspected suicide rates in 2020 relative to 2015-19 to assess any early effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in Queensland, Australia. We analysed data from the interim Queensland Suicide Register (iQSR), a state-wide real-time suicide surveillance system, using an interrupted time-series design. The data source for the iQSR is the Form 1 police report of a death to a coroner. Two QSR staff independently classed the probability of a death by suicide as possible, probable, or beyond reasonable doubt. The analysis included the probable or beyond reasonable doubt categories as suspected suicides. The primary outcome was the monthly suspected suicide rate. We applied Poisson and negative binomial regressions to assess whether Queensland's Public Health Emergency Declaration on Jan 29, 2020, affected suspected suicides from Feb 1 to Aug 31, 2020. Secondary outcomes included absolute or relative changes in police-reported motives of recent unemployment, financial problems, domestic violence, and relationship breakdown. 3793 suspected suicides were recorded with an unadjusted monthly rate of 14Ã‚Â·85 deaths per 100Ã¢â‚¬Ë†000 people (from Jan 1, 2015, to Jan 1, 2020) before the declaration, and 443 suspected suicides were recorded with an unadjusted monthly rate of 14Ã‚Â·07 deaths per 100Ã¢â‚¬Ë†000 people (Feb 1, 2020, onwards) after the declaration. An interrupted time-series Poisson regression model unadjusted (rate ratio [RR] 0Ã‚Â·94, 95% CI 0Ã‚Â·82-1Ã‚Â·06) and adjusted for overdispersion, seasonality, and pre-exposure trends (RR 1Ã‚Â·02, 95% CI 0Ã‚Â·83-1Ã‚Â·25) indicated no evidence of a change in suspected suicide rates. We found no absolute or relative increases in the motives for suspected suicides, including recent unemployment, financial problems, relationship breakdown, or domestic violence from February to August, 2020, compared with the pre-exposure period. There does not yet appear to be an overall change in the suspected suicide rate in the 7 months since Queensland declared a public health emergency. Despite this, COVID-19 has contributed to some suspected suicides in Queensland. Ongoing community spread and increasing death rates of COVID-19, and its impact on national economies and mental health, reinforces the need for governments to maintain the monitoring and reporting of suicide mortality in real time.

"Correlates of Mental Health Symptoms Among US Adults During COVID-19, March-April 2020","An understanding of mental health symptoms during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is critical to ensure that health policies adequately address the mental health needs of people in the United States. The objective of this study was to examine mental health symptoms among US adults in an early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a cross-sectional study in late March 2020 with a national sample of 963 US adults using an online research platform. Participants self-reported state of residence, psychosocial characteristics, and levels of anxiety, depression, anger, cognitive function, and fatigue in the context of COVID-19 using validated patient-reported outcomes scales in the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System measures. We used analysis of variance and multivariate linear regression to evaluate correlates of mental health symptoms. Overall, participants reported high levels of anxiety (mean [SD], 57.2 [9.3]) and depression (mean [SD], 54.2 [9.5]). Levels of anger, anxiety, cognitive function, depression, and fatigue were significantly higher among the Millennial Generation and Generation X (vs Baby Boomers), those with not enough or enough (vs more than enough) financial resources, females vs males), those with self-reported disability (vs no self-reported disability), and those with inadequate (vs adequate) health literacy. In adjusted models, being in Generation X and the Millennial Generation (vs Baby Boomer), having not enough or enough vs more than enough) financial resources, and having inadequate (vs adequate) health literacy were most strongly correlated with worse mental health symptoms. Results suggest that mental health symptoms during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic were prevalent nationally, regardless of state of residence and especially among young, psychosocially vulnerable groups.","Reading Turchioe, Grossman, Myers, Pathak, Creber","https://doi.org/10.1177/0033354920970179","20201119","health disparities; mental health and well-being; prevention; psychosocial factors; public health assessment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-20","",7321,""
"Congressional Budget Responses to the Pandemic: Fund Health Care, Not Warfare","The coronavirus outbreak is not the first crisis to affect a large swath of the nation's population: the Great Depression, World War II, and the HIV epidemic did so previously. Of the national responses to each of these examples, perhaps the most relevant would be the Manhattan Project model, as proposed by Senator Edward J. Markey (D, MA) and Peter L. Slavin, MD, of Mass General Hospital.<sup>1</sup> In 1943 the government diverted tens of billions of dollars from civilian programs to the project to build the atomic bomb. What the COVID-19 pandemic requires is the reverse: the diversion of a substantial chunk of the more than $700 billion appropriated for the Pentagon's military budget to the biomedical, public health programs desperately needed to limit the current coronavirus outbreak and prevent future pandemics. Congress needs to recognize the actual challenges to our national security and thereby sustain our people's health and promote a prosperous and just economy.

"Social Estrangement and Psychological Distress before and during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Patterns of Change in Canadian Workers","This article argues that the COVID-19 pandemic and associated social distancing measures intended to slow the rate of transmission of the virus resulted in greater subjective isolation and community distrust, in turn adversely impacting psychological distress. To support this argument, we examine data from the Canadian Quality of Work and Economic Life Study, two national surveys of Canadian workers-one from late September 2019 (N = 2,477) and the second from mid-March 2020 (N = 2,446). Analyses show that subjective isolation and community distrust increased between the two surveys, which led to a substantial rise in psychological distress. Increases in subjective isolation were stronger in older respondents, resulting in a greater escalation in psychological distress. These findings support a Durkheimian perspective on the harm to social integration and mental health caused by periods of rapid social change but also illustrate how a life course context can differentiate individual vulnerability to disintegrative social forces.","Bierman, Schieman","https://doi.org/10.1177/0022146520970190","20201119","COVID-19; life course perspective; mental health; psychological distress; social integration","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-20","",7323,""

Cross-sectional and quantitative analyses. Structural equation modelling was performed using survey data obtained during the period between 1 April - 25 May 2020. In a sample of 421 nurses from 39 Spanish provinces. Results confirmed that: 1) All the stressors have a significant, direct and negative relationship with nursesÃ‚Â´ psychological distress; 2) Emotion-focused strategies is negatively related to nursesÃ‚Â´ psychological distress directly and indirectly through resilience; and 3) Problem-focused strategies is positively related to nursesÃ‚Â´ psychological distress and negatively and indirectly through emotion-focused strategies. This study identifies an important mediation sequence of stressors on psychological distress through the simultaneous concurrent effect of Problem-focused -Emotion-focused strategies and resilience. It shows that enacting the two coping mechanisms and resilience resources is important to achieve an adaptive effect on nursesÃ‚Â´ mental health. Nurses with insufficient preparation and those with high levels of fear of contagion do not enact proper coping strategies. Thus, these nurses need special consideration due to their risk of higher vulnerability.","Lorente, Vera, PeirÃƒÂ³","https://doi.org/10.1111/jan.14695","20201119","Coping; Nurses; Resilience and Psychological Distress; Stressors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-20","",7325,""
"The reliability and success of peritoneal dialysis during the COVID-19 pandemic","We evaluated the symptoms, changes in laboratory findings during the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, and the effect of depression in patients with peritoneal dialysis (PD). This is an observational and cross-sectional study. All patients were asked to fill the clinical assessment form and Beck depression and anxiety inventory. Also, the last two laboratory evaluations during this period were examined. A total of 123 patients performing PD were included. None of the patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. In the total study population, parathyroid hormone (PTH), serum albumin, phosphorus and ferritin levels significantly elevated at the end of 97Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 31Ã‚Â days. PTH and phosphorus levels remained stable in remote monitoring automated PD (RM-APD) group (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.4 and pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.5), they tended to increase in continuous ambulatory PD group and significantly increased in automated PD group (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.09 and pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.01 for PTH and pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.06 and pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.001 for phosphorus, respectively). Moderate to severe depression was associated with dyspnoea, weight gain more than 5Ã‚Â kg, fatigue, palpitation and increased anxiety. PD is a reliable and successful form of dialysis and can be safely administered even if hospital access is restricted. Also, RM-APD may be a better choice because of providing more stable bone-mineral metabolism. Moreover, evaluating depression and anxiety is essential for the accurate clinical assessment.","Yeter, Gok Oguz, Akcay, Karaer, Yasar, Duranay, Ayli, Guz","https://doi.org/10.1111/sdi.12940","20201119","Beck inventory; COVID-19; depression; peritoneal dialysis; remote patient management","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-20","",7326,""

Ninety-two percent (92%) of communities have their public areas and facilities disinfected daily, and 95.4% of communities have conducted health education about COVID-19. Factors including gender, education level, chronic illness, the frequency of going out, achieving information about COVID-19 by community and newspaper, and confirmed cases in the community, show association with community residents' anxiety and depression. The vast majority of Chinese residents have little anxiety and depression, and most communities have adopted standardized control measures following the government's regulations and policy, which plays a vital role in the control of COVID-19 and improving residents' anxiety and depression.","Li, Ye, Du, Wei, He","https://doi.org/10.21037/atm-20-6687","20201119","COVID-19; anxiety; community; coronavirus; depression; impact factors; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-20","",7328,""
"Reduced Sleep in the Week Prior to Diagnosis of COVID-19 is Associated with the Severity of COVID-19","The rapid outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a major health concern, in response to which widespread risk factor research is being carried out. To discover how physical activity and lifestyle affect the epidemic as well as the disease severity and prognosis of COVID-19 patients. This multicenter, retrospective cohort study included 203 adults infected with COVID-19 and 228 uninfected adults in three Chinese provinces, with 164 (80.7%) of the infected participants and 188 (82.5%) of the uninfected participants answering a doctor-administered telephone questionnaire on lifestyle. The binary logistic regression model and the ordinal logit model were used to observe relevance. Comparing sick and non-sick patients, we found that irregular exercise (<i>P</i>=0.004), sedentary lifestyle (<i>P</i>=0.010), and overexertion (<i>P</i>&lt;0.001) may be associated with the susceptibility to COVID-19. In symptomatic patients, using the recommended status as a reference, risk of severe infection increased with decreased sleep status, being 6.729 (95% CI=2.138-21.181) times higher for potentially appropriate sleep (<i>P</i>=0.001) and peaking at 8.612 (95% CI=1.913-38.760) times higher for lack of sleep (<i>P</i>=0.005). Reduction in average daily sleep time significantly increased the likely severity (<i>P</i>=0.002). Through further examination of damage of external lung organs, we found that lack of sleep affected not only disease severity but also prognosis. Based on these findings, the public should prioritize a healthy lifestyle and get adequate sleep in response to the outbreak. The study of life habits may bring new ideas for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.","Huang, Niu, Zhao, Bao, Li","https://doi.org/10.2147/NSS.S263488","20201119","COVID-19; damage of external lung organs; disease severity; sleep status","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-20","",7329,""
"Trainee Wellness and Safety in the Context of COVID-19: The Experience of One Institution","The COVID-19 pandemic has had significant ramifications for provider well-being. During these unprecedented and challenging times, one institution's Department of Surgery put in place several important initiatives for promoting the well-being of trainees as they were redeployed to provide care to COVID-19 patients. In this article, the authors describe these initiatives, which fall into 3 broad categories: redeploying faculty and trainees, ensuring provider safety, and promoting trainee wellness.The redeployment initiatives are the following: reframing the team mindset, creating a culture of grace and forgiveness, establishing a multidisciplinary wellness committee, promoting centralized leadership, providing clear communication, coordinating between departments and programs, implementing phased restructuring of the department's services, establishing scheduling flexibility and redundancy, adhering to training regulations, designating a trainee ombudsperson, assessing physical health risks for high-risk individuals, and planning for structured deimplementation.Initiatives specific to promoting provider safety are appointing a trainee safety advocate, guaranteeing personal protective equipment and relevant information about these materials, providing guidance regarding safe practices at home, and offering alternative housing options when necessary.Finally, the initiatives put in place to directly promote trainee wellness are establishing an environment of psychological safety, providing mental health resources, maintaining the educational missions, solidifying a sense of community by showing appreciation, being attentive to childcare, and using social media to promote community morale.The initiatives to carry out the department's strategy presented in this article, which were well received by both faculty and trainee members of the authors' community, may be employed in other departments and even outside the context of COVID-19. The authors hope that colleagues at other institutions and departments, independent of specialty, will find the initiatives described here helpful during, and perhaps after, the pandemic as they develop their own institution-specific strategies to promote trainee wellness.","Kemp, Rivard, Anderson, Audu, Barrett, Fry, Lane, Vu, Young, Englesbe, Sandhu, Coleman","https://doi.org/10.1097/ACM.0000000000003853","20201119","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-20","",7330,""

"The influence of concern about COVID-19 on mental health in the Republic of Georgia: a cross-sectional study","Early evidence indicates increased mental health burden arising from COVID-19 and related control measures. The study aim was to examine concern about COVID-19 and its association with symptoms of mental disorders in the Republic of Georgia. A cross-sectional internet-based survey of adults in Georgia using non-probabilistic sampling was used. Questionnaire topics were: (i) demographic and socio-economic characteristics; (ii) level of burden caused by common causes of COVID-19 related concerns; (iii) strategies used in response to concerns about COVID-19; and (iv) symptoms of mental disorders of anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9), PTSD (ITQ) and adjustment disorder (ADNM8). Descriptive and multivariate analyses were conducted. There were 2088 respondents. High levels of symptoms for mental disorders were observed for anxiety (23.9% women, 21.0% men), depression (30.3% women, 25.27% men), PTSD (11.8% women, and 12.5% men), and adjustment disorder (40.7% women, 31.0% men). Factors significantly associated with increased COVID-19 concern included bad/very bad household economic situation, larger household size, current NCD, symptoms of anxiety, adjustment disorder and PTSD. Response strategies significantly associated with reduced mental disorder symptoms included meditation and relaxation exercises, physical exercise, positive thinking, planning for the future, TV/radio, housework/DIY, and working. Drinking alcohol was associated with a greater probability of increased mental disorder symptoms. High levels of mental disorders were recorded, and they were strongly associated with increased concern about COVID-19. A number of response strategies were identified which may help protect against worse mental health and these could be supported by innovations in mental health care in Georgia.","Makhashvili, Javakhishvili, Sturua, Pilauri, Fuhr, Roberts","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-020-00641-9","20201119","COVID-19; Georgia; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-20","",7332,""
"Psychosocial factors associated with postpartum psychological distress during the Covid-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study","Trauma, natural and man-made catastrophic events can be predictors of postpartum psychological distress. In a public health response due to coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, the Italian government imposed a lockdown from March 9 to May 3. This extraordinary situation may have been challenging for maternal psychological health. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of depressive and post-traumatic stress symptoms in women giving birth during the Covid-19 pandemic and its associations with quarantine measures, obstetrical factors, and relational attachment style. Women who gave birth in a high-volume obstetric/gynaecological medical centre located in an epidemic area during the Covid-19 pandemic (March 8 to June 15) were asked to complete an online survey about their childbirth experience and the perceived effect of the pandemic. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and the Relationship Questionnaire (RQ) were administered to assess levels of postpartum depressive and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and relational style of attachment, respectively. Multivariate analysis was applied to identify associations between quarantine measures, childbirth experience, attachment style, and EPDS and IES-R scores. The survey was completed by 163 women (response rate 60.8%). The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 44.2% (EPDS cut-off scoreÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°11) and the PTSS rate was 42.9% (IES-R cut-off scoreÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°24). Dismissive and fearful avoidant attachment styles were significantly associated with the risk of depression and PTSS, respectively. Perceived pain during birth was a risk factor for postpartum depression. Perceived support provided by healthcare staff was a protective factor against depression and PTSS. Another protective factor against PTSS was quiet on the ward due to the absence of hospital visitors. This study reports a high prevalence of postpartum depressive and PTSS in women who gave birth during the Covid-19 pandemic. Postnatal psychological distress seemed to be associated more with the prenatal experience and other individual factors than with the pandemic hospital restrictions. Early detection during pregnancy of an insecure attachment style is fundamental to provide targeted preventive and therapeutic psychological interventions.","Ostacoli, Cosma, Bevilacqua, Berchialla, Bovetti, Carosso, Malandrone, Carletto, Benedetto","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-020-03399-5","20201119","COVID-19; Depression; Mental health; PTSD; Pandemic; Postpartum; Pregnancy; Quarantine; SARS-Cov-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-20","",7333,""
"Predicting spatial and temporal responses to non-pharmaceutical interventions on COVID-19 growth rates across 58 counties in New York State: A prospective event-based modeling study on county-level sociological predictors","Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been implemented in the New York State since the COVID-19 outbreak on March 1, 2020 to control the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Socioeconomic heterogeneity across counties closely manifests differences in the post-NPIs growth rate of incidence, which is a crucial indicator to guide future infectious control policy making. Few studies, however, examined the geospatial and sociological variations in the epidemic growth across different time points of NPIs. To guide a more effective reopening plan while controlling the transmission, the current study aims at 1) identifying hotspots of the growth rate of COVID-19 incidence among the 57 counties and New York City in NYS over time, and 2) examining the association of COVID-19 growth rates after eight critical NPIs time points and most relevant county-level sociological predictors. County-level COVID-19 incidence rates were retrieved from the Social Explorer Website between March 7, 2020 to June 22, 2020. 5-day moving average growth rates of COVID-19 incidence were calculated for 16 selected time points, including the dates of eight NPIs and their respective 14-day-lag-behind time points. A total of 36 county-level indicators were extracted from multiple public datasets. Geospatial mapping and heatmap were used to analyze spatial and temporal heterogeneity of county-level COVID-19 outbreak over selected NPIs-related dates. Generalized mixed effect least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, controlling for the 5-day moving average growth rates of COVID-19 testing rates, was employed to identify significant county-level predictors related to the changes of county-level COVID-19 growth rates over time. COVID-19 infection increased and peaked by the end of March (ÃŽÂ·=22.50%). Growth rates of COVID-19 decreased by 50.48% after implementing NPIs such as closures of schools, non-essential businesses, parks, and subways. There was a geospatial shift in the region with the highest growth rates from New York metropolitan area towards Western and Northern regions over time. Proportions of population aged 45 years and above (ÃŽÂ²=3.25 [0.17-6.32]), living alone at residential houses (ÃŽÂ²=3.31 [0.39--6.22]), and proportion of crowd residential houses (ÃŽÂ²=6.15 [2.15-10.14]) were positively associated with the growth rate of COVID-19 infection. In contrast, living alone at rental houses (ÃŽÂ²=-2.47 [-4.83--0.12]) and rate of mental health providers (ÃŽÂ²=-1.11 [-1.95--0.28]) were negatively associated with COVID-19 growth rate across all 16 time points. There are geospatial differences in COVID-19 incidence after implementing different NPIs. Socioeconomic, racial/ethnic, and healthcare resource disparities at the structural and historical levels across counties need to be considered in infection control policymaking to narrow the unequal health impact on vulnerable populations effectively.","Xiao","https://doi.org/10.2196/22578","20201118","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-20","",7334,""

Objective. We sought to assess the nature of COVID-19's mental health impact among a sample of undergraduates who were experiencing the pandemic, as it occurred in real-time. 140 college students completed 6x daily smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) of anxiety and optimism related to COVID-19 as well as other generic mental health variables. Participants completed &gt;23,750 surveys. Greater than 75% of these surveys indicated at least some level of anxiety about COVID-19. On average, the proportion of responses each day at the highest levels of anxiety about COVID-19 was 7 times greater than the proportion of responses at the highest levels of non-COVID specific anxiety. Structural change analyses indicated a significant downward trend in COVID-19 anxiety after the first week of June, but even at the lowest point, &gt;15% of the participants in the sample still endorsed high levels of COVID-19 anxiety each day. Participants felt more anxious about COVID-19 on days when the number of new cases and deaths due to COVID-19 were higher. When participants felt anxious about COVID-19, they also felt sad, anxious (in general), and had a greater desire to drink and use drugs. Participants felt more optimistic about COVID-19 when they received more support from others and from their university.

"Prevalence and associated factors of depression and anxiety among nurses during the outbreak of COVID-19 in China: A cross-sectional study","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a public health emergency of international concern and has caused traumatic experience for nurses worldwide. However, the prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms in nurses, and how psychosocial factors influence nurses in this public crisis are unknown. To determine the effect of COVID-19 on the mental health of nurses and the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms among nurses in China during the outbreak. A cross-sectional study. A total of 3,228 nurses in Sichuan Province and Wuhan City were selected by convenience sampling. All participants were invited to complete the questionnaire through WeChat from January 27 to February 3, 2020. A self-reported questionnaire combining depression and anxiety scale was used to collect data anonymously. Binary and multivariate logistic regression was applied to measure the odds of psychosocial factors of anxiety and depression and perceived health, respectively. The total incidence of depression (34.3%) and anxiety (18.1%) during the COVID-19 outbreak was lower than that during the SARS outbreak; however, the rate of depression in our study (47.1%) was high and similar in a recent study (50.4%) about the health care workers exposed to COVID-19 in China. The results indicated that COVID-19-related stress, relationship quality with family, and demographic characteristics were associated with depression, anxiety, and perceived health status. Furthermore, the prevalence of depression was similar between nurses working in low-risk COVID-19 wards was as high as working in high-risk COVID-19 wards (OR, 1.078; 95% CI, 0.784-1.481). Our study revealed the high prevalence of depression and anxiety among nurses during the outbreak of COVID-19. COVID-19 factors and psychosocial factors were associated with mental health of nurses.

Sociodemographic data, exposure to COVID-19, perception of psychological care needs, depression, anxiety, somatization, and post-traumatic symptoms were concurrently assessed. The majority of the sample (71%) suffered from somatization and 55% of distress. Female care workers experienced higher levels of anxiety (d = 0.50) and somatization symptoms (d = 0.82) and stated they needed psychological care more than men (p &lt; .001). Younger participants (aged &lt;40 years-old) reported higher levels of somatization, depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic symptoms (effects size range from d = 0.22 to d = 0.31). Working in a high infected area (red-zones) and directly with COVID-19 patients (front-line) affected the psychological health of participants to a smaller degree. Health-care workers who lost one of their patients reported higher levels of depression (d = 0.22), anxiety (d = 0.19), post-traumatic symptoms (d = 0.30), and psychological care needs than those who did not have the same experience (p &lt; .01). Health-care workers who perceived the need for psychological support scored above the clinical alarming level (cut-off scores) in all the psychological scales, ranging from 76% to 88%. Psychological distress (p &lt; .01), anxiety (p &lt; .05), depression (p &lt; .05), and being women (p &lt; .01) contribute to explain the need for psychological care and accounted for 32% of the variance in this sample.

"Flip the clinic: a digital health approach to youth mental health service delivery","Mental health service demand is projected to rapidly increase as a direct and indirect result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Given that young people are disproportionately disadvantaged by mental illness and will face further challenges from COVID-19, it is crucial that the appropriate mental health care be delivered to them as early as possible. Integrating digital health solutions into mental health service delivery pathways has the potential to greatly increase efficiencies, allowing for the provision of 'right care, first time'. We propose an innovative digital health solution for demand management intended for use by primary youth mental health services, comprised of: 1) a youth mental health model of care (i.e. BMC Youth Model); and 2) a health information technology specifically designed to deliver this model of care (e.g. the InnoWell Platform), as well as an operational protocol of how this solution could be applied to primary youth mental health service delivery processes. By 'flipping' conventional service delivery models of majority in-clinic and minority online-delivered care to a model where online-delivered care is the default, this digital health solution offers a scalable way of delivering quality youth mental health care, both in response to public health crises (such as COVID-19) and ongoingly into the future.","Davenport, Cheng, Iorfino, Hamilton, Castaldi, Burton, Scott, Hickie","https://doi.org/10.2196/24578","20201118","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-20","",7338,""
"Predictive Factors for Impaired Mental Health among Medical Students during the Early Stage of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Morocco","The COVID-19 pandemic has great consequences on mental health. We aimed to assess medical students' psychological condition and influencing factors as a baseline evidence for interventions promoting their mental wellbeing. We conducted an online survey from April 8 to April 18, 2020 to examine the mental health of medical students by the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire, seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, seven-item Insomnia Severity Index, and six-item Kessler psychological distress scale. Factors associated with mental health outcomes were identified by multivariable logistic regression analysis. Five hundred forty-nine students completed the survey; 341 (62.3%), 410 (74.6%), 344 (62.6%), and 379 (69%) reported anxiety, depression, insomnia, and distress, respectively. Female students, living in high COVID-19 prevalence locations, more than 25 days confinement, psychiatric consult history, and being in a preclinical level of studies had higher median scores and severe symptom levels. Multivariable logistic regression showed female gender as a risk factor for severe symptoms of anxiety (odds ratio [OR]: 1.653; 95% CI: 1.020-2.679; <i>P</i> = 0.042), depression (OR: 2.167; 95% CI: 1.435-3.271; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), insomnia (OR: 1.830; 95% CI: 1.176-2.847; <i>P</i> = 0.007), and distress (OR: 1.994; 95% CI: 1.338-2.972; <i>P</i> = 0.001); preclinical level of enrollment as a risk factor for depression (OR: 0.679; 95% CI: 0.521-0.885; <i>P</i> = 0.004), insomnia (OR: 0.720; 95% CI: 0.545-0.949; <i>P</i> = 0.02), and distress (OR: 0.650; 95% CI: 0.499-0.847; <i>P</i> = 0.001), whereas living in high COVID-19 prevalence locations was a risk factor for severe anxiety (OR: 1.628; 95% CI: 1.090-2.432; <i>P</i> = 0.017) and depression (OR: 1.438; 95% CI: 1.002-2.097; <i>P</i> = 0.05). Currently, medical students experience high levels of mental health symptoms, especially female students, those at a preclinical level and living in regions with a high prevalence of COVID-19 cases.

We sought to capture the patient perceptions of the COVID-19 implications and the worldwide imposed treatment modifications. A patient survey was conducted in 16 European countries, using a new COVID-19-related questionnaire, developed by ENGAGe and the Hospital Anxiety &amp; Depression Scale questionnaire (HADS). The survey was promoted by national patient advocacy groups and charitable organisations. We collected 1388 forms; 592 online and 796 hard-copy (May, 2020). We excluded 137 due to missing data. Median patients' age was 55Ã‚Â years (range: 18-89), 54.7% had ovarian cancer and 15.5% were preoperative. Even though 73.2% of patients named cancer as a risk factor for COVID-19, only 17.5% were more afraid of COVID-19 than their cancer condition, with advanced age (&gt;70Ã‚Â years) as the only significant risk factor for that. Overall, 71% were concerned about cancer progression if their treatment/follow-up was cancelled/postponed. Most patients (64%) had their care continued as planned, but 72.3% (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 892) said that they received no information around overall COVID-19 infection rates of patients and staff, testing or measures taken in their treating hospital. Mean HADS Anxiety and Depression Scores were 8.8 (range: 5.3-12) and 8.1 (range: 3.8-13.4), respectively. Multivariate analysis identified high HADS-depression scores, having experienced modifications of care due to the pandemic and concern about not being able to visit their doctor as independent predictors of patients' anxiety. Gynaecological cancer patients expressed significant anxiety about progression of their disease due to modifications of care related to the COVID-19 pandemic and wished to pursue their treatment as planned despite the associated risks.

"A room with a green view: the importance of nearby nature for mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic and its global response have resulted in unprecedented and rapid changes to most people's day-to-day lives. To slow the spread of the virus, governments have implemented the practice of physical distancing (&quot;social distancing&quot;), which includes isolation within the home with limited time spent outdoors. During this extraordinary time, nature around the home may play a key role in mitigating against adverse mental health outcomes due to the pandemic and the measures taken to address it. To assess whether this is the case, we conducted an online questionnaire survey (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 3,000) in Tokyo, Japan, to quantify the association between five mental health outcomes (depression, life satisfaction, subjective happiness, self-esteem, and loneliness) and two measures of nature experiences (frequency of greenspace use and green view through windows from home). Accounting for sociodemographic and lifestyle variables, we found that the frequency of greenspace use and the existence of green window views from within the home was associated with increased levels of self-esteem, life satisfaction, and subjective happiness and decreased levels of depression, anxiety, and loneliness. Our findings suggest that a regular dose of nature can contribute to the improvement of a wide range of mental health outcomes. With the recent escalation in the prevalence of mental health disorders, and the possible negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on public mental health, our findings have major implications for policy, suggesting that urban nature has great potential to be used as a &quot;nature-based solution&quot; for improved public health.","Soga, Evans, Tsuchiya, Fukano","https://doi.org/10.1002/eap.2248","20201118","ecosystem services; global change; nature-based intervention; nature-based solution; personalized ecology; public health; urban greenspace; urbanization","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-20","",7341,""
"Life with chronic pain during COVID-19 lockdown: the case of patients with small fibre neuropathy and chronic migraine","We aimed at investigating the impact of COVID-19-related distress on patients with chronic pain, highlighting the effects of changes in individual habits and public health care reconfiguration on physical and psychological health. During the pandemic, 80 participants (25 patients with small fibre neuropathy (SFN), 42 patients with chronic migraine (CM) and 13 patients' healthy family members (HFM)) were asked to evaluate their COVID-19 complains, changes in habits and clinical management, behaviour, mood, loneliness, quality of life (QoL), physical and mental health and coping strategies. Data were analysed by Spearman rho correlations and Mann-Whitney U tests. Patients had lower QoL, lower physical health and higher catastrophizing attitude towards pain than HFM. During the pandemic, SFN patients referred greater decline in clinical symptoms, worries about contagion and discomfort for disease management changes than CM patients. In the SFN group, the higher levels of disability were associated with suffering from changes in neurologist-patient relationship. CM patients complained of agitation/anxiety that was related to feelings of loneliness, depressive mood and catastrophism. Despite similar complains of change in habits and worries about COVID-19 pandemic, SFN and CM patients had distinct reactions. In SFN patients, pandemic distress impacted on physical health with worsening of clinical conditions, especially suffering from changes in their care. In CM patients, pandemic distress affected behaviour, mainly with psychological frailty. This suggests the need to customize public health care for patients with distinct chronic pain conditions.","Consonni, Telesca, Grazzi, Cazzato, Lauria","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10072-020-04890-9","20201118","COVID-19 distress; Catastrophism; Chronic migraine; Chronic pain; Quality of life; Small fibre neuropathy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-20","",7342,""
"Effect of the COVID-19 Lockdown on Disease Recognition and Utilization of Healthcare Services in the Older Population in German: A Cross-sectional Study","There is little evidence about the utilization of healthcare services and disease recognition in the older population, which was urged to self-isolate during the COVID-19 lockdowns. We aimed to describe the utilization of physician consultations, specialist referrals, hospital admissions, and the recognition of incident diseases in Germany for this age group during the COVID-19 lockdown. Cross-sectional observational study. 1,095 general practitioners' (GPs) and 960 specialist practices in Germany. 2.45 million older patients aged 65 or older. The number of documented physician consultations, specialist referrals, hospital admissions, and incident diagnoses during the imposed lockdown in 2020 was descriptively analyzed and compared to 2019. Physician consultations decrease slightly in February (-2%), increase before the imposed lockdown in March (+9%), and decline in April (-18%) and May (-14%) 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019. Volumes of hospital admissions decrease earlier and more intensely than physician consultations (-39% vs. -6% respectively). Overall, 15%, 16%, and 18% fewer incident diagnoses were documented by GPs, neurologists, and diabetologists respectively in 2020. Diabetes, dementia, depression, cancer, and stroke were diagnosed less frequently during the lockdown (-17% to -26%), meaning that the decrease in the recognition of diseases was greater than the decrease in physician consultations. The data suggest that organizational changes were adopted quickly by practice management, but also raise concerns about the maintenance of routine care. Prospective studies should evaluate the long-term effects of lockdowns on patient-related outcomes.","Michalowsky, Hoffmann, Bohlken, Kostev","https://doi.org/10.1093/ageing/afaa260","20201118","Covid-19; healthcare utilization; lockdown; older people; recognition","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-20","",7343,""
"REAC Cervicobrachial Neuromodulation Treatment of Depression, Anxiety, and Stress During the COVID-19 Pandemic","In addition to the effects of coronavirus infection, the Covid-19 pandemic has induced widespread psychosocial distress, which has triggered the onset of anxious and depressive states, reactive to the socio-relational and economic situation induced by the pandemic. Some of our participants showed depressive and anxious attitudes even in the absence of real pictures of depression and anxiety. This phenomenon, combined with mechanisms of emulation and conditioning, can trigger a vicious cycle within interpersonal relationships and promote the administration of unnecessary treatments. Various approaches have been proposed to help populations suffering from psychosocial problems induced by the Covid-19 pandemic, but there is an objective difficulty in treating a large population. To contain and reduce this widespread psychosocial unease, in this study we used two radio electric asymmetric conveyer (REAC) technology neuromodulation treatments, neuro postural optimization (NPO) and neuropsychophysical optimization-cervicobrachial (NPPO-CB), aimed at optimizing an individual's response to the effects of environmental stressors. These treatments are quick and easy to administer; therefore, they can be administered to a large cohort of participants in a short time. To evaluate the effects of the REAC NPO and NPPO-CB treatments, the DASS-21 psychometric test was used because it has already been used to test depression, anxiety, and stress during the Covid-19 pandemic. The results of the study confirm the usefulness of REAC NPO and NPPO-CB treatments in helping participants to have better coping strategies for the environmental pressures and reduce the neuropsychological and behavioral effects induced by the Covid-19 pandemic. The results obtained in this study are consistent with previous clinical studies confirming the usefulness of the treatments to face neuropsychological and behavioral effects induced by exposome pressure.","Pinheiro Barcessat, Nolli Bittencourt, Duarte Ferreira, de Souza Neri, Coelho Pereira, Bechelli, Rinaldi","https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S275730","20201119","DASS-21; behavioral disorders; coronavirus; noninvasive neurostimulation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-20","",7344,""
"Impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on urban park visitation: a global analysis","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in over 33 million confirmed cases and over 1 million deaths globally, as of 1 October 2020. During the lockdown and restrictions placed on public activities and gatherings, green spaces have become one of the only sources of resilience amidst the coronavirus pandemic, in part because of their positive effects on psychological, physical and social cohesion and spiritual wellness. This study analyzes the impacts of COVID-19 and government response policies to the pandemic on park visitation at global, regional and national levels and assesses the importance of parks during this global pandemic. The data we collected primarily from Google's Community Mobility Reports and the Oxford Coronavirus Government Response Tracker. The results for most countries included in the analysis show that park visitation has increased since February 16th, 2020 compared to visitor numbers prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Restrictions on social gathering, movement, and the closure of workplace and indoor recreational places, are correlated with more visits to parks. Stay-at-home restrictions and government stringency index are negatively associated with park visits at a global scale. Demand from residents for parks and outdoor green spaces has increased since the outbreak began, and highlights the important role and benefits provided by parks, especially urban and community parks, under the COVID-19 pandemic. We provide recommendations for park managers and other decision-makers in terms of park management and planning during health crises, as well as for park design and development. In particular, parks could be utilized during pandemics to increase the physical and mental health and social well-being of individuals.","Geng, Innes, Wu, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11676-020-01249-w","20201119","COVID-19; COVID-19 response policies; Parks visitation; Stepwise regression analysis; Urban parks","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-20","",7345,""
"Characteristics and well-being of urban informal home care providers during COVID-19 pandemic: a population-based study","Globally, the COVID-19 pandemic has overwhelmed many healthcare systems, which has hampered access to routine clinical care during lockdowns. Informal home care, care provided by non-healthcare professionals, increases the community's healthcare capacity during pandemics. There is, however, limited research about the characteristics of informal home care providers and the challenges they face during such public health emergencies. A random, cross-sectional, population-based, RDD, telephone survey study was conducted to examine patterns of home care, characteristics of informal home care providers and the challenges experienced by these care providers during this pandemic. Data were collected from 22 March to 1 April 2020 in Hong Kong, China. A population representative study sample of Chinese-speaking adults (n=765) was interviewed. The study examined the characteristics of informal home care providers and self-reported health requirements of those who needed care. The study also examined providers' self-perceived knowledge to provide routine home care as well as COVID-19 risk reduction care. Respondents were asked of their mental health status related to COVID-19. Of the respondents, 25.1% of 765 provided informal home care during the studied COVID-19 pandemic period. Among the informal home care providers, 18.4% of respondents took leave from school/work during the epidemic to provide care for the sick, fragile elderly and small children. Care providers tended to be younger aged, female and housewives. Approximately half of care providers reported additional mental strain and 37.2% reported of challenges in daily living during epidemic. Although most informal home care providers felt competent to provide routine care, 49.5% felt inadequately prepared to cope with the additional health risks of COVID-19. During public health emergencies, heavy reliance on informal home healthcare providers necessitates better understanding of their specific needs and increased government services to support informal home care.","Chan, Lo, Huang, Kim, Hung, Hung, Wong, Wong, Gobat","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-041191","20201118","primary care; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-20","",7346,""
"CovEMERALD: Assessing the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of remotely delivered Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing following Covid-19 related critical illness: A structured summary of a study protocol for a randomised controlled trial","Primary Objective: To determine the feasibility of delivering a protocolised, remote, online, Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing (EMDR) intervention, within 12-weeks of hospital discharge, for adult survivors of Covid-19 related critical illness. Secondary objectives: To investigate whether remotely delivered EMDR can improve psychological outcome following Covid-19 related critical illness, specifically Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), anxiety and depression. This is a single centre, randomised controlled cohort feasibility trial. Participants will be recruited following discharge from the Intensive Care Unit at University Hospital Southampton, United Kingdom. Eligible patients will have received mechanical ventilation for a minimum of 24 hours, tested Covid-19 positive by polymerase chain reaction, will be over the age of 18 years and have the capacity to provide informed consent. Patients will be excluded if they have pre-existing cognitive impairment, pre-existing psychotic diagnosis or are not expected to survive post-hospital discharge. Group one: patients in the control arm will receive their standard package of prescribed care, following discharge home from hospital. If they experience any adverse physical or psychological health-conditions, they will access care through the usual available channels. Group two: patients randomly allocated to the intervention arm will receive their standard package of prescribed care, following discharge home from hospital. In addition, they will be referred to the Intensive Psychological Therapies Service in Poole, United Kingdom. They will receive an online appointment within 12-weeks of discharge home from hospital. They will receive a maximum of eight, weekly sessions of EMDR, delivered by a trained psychological therapist, following the Recent Traumatic Episode Protocol (R-TEP). Appendices 1 and 2 of the attached trial protocol contain a detailed description of the R-TEP intervention, written in accordance with the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist and guide. The primary outcome from this trial will be feasibility. Feasibility will be determined by recruitment rates, expressed as a percentage of eligible patients approached, completion of the EMDR intervention, completion of final assessment at 6-months, incidence of attributable adverse events and protocol adherence by the psychological therapists. Secondary, exploratory outcomes will be assessed by comparison between the control and intervention groups at 6-months post-hospital discharge. Psychometric evaluation will consist of the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. In addition, we will assess health-related quality of life using the EQ5D-5L, physical activity using wrist worn activity monitors and nutritional state using the Council of Nutrition Appetite Questionnaire. Consenting participants will be randomly allocated to intervention or usual care using an internet-based system (ALEA<sup>TM</sup>). Participants will be randomly assigned, on a 1:1 ratio, to receive either standard care (control) or the standard care plus online EMDR R-TEP (Intervention) BLINDING (MASKING): Due to the nature of the intervention, participants cannot be blinded to group allocation. 6-month patient reported outcome measures will be completed using an online, electronic case report form. Group allocation will be masked during data analysis. This is a feasibility study, the results of which will be used to power a definitive study if appropriate. We anticipate a 25% mortality /loss to follow-up. A total of 26 patients will be recruited to this study, 13 patients in each arm. CovEMERALD opened to recruitment on 23<sup>rd</sup> September 2020 with an anticipated recruitment period of 6-months.

"The Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Health Care Workers' Anxiety Levels: Protocol for a Meta-Analysis","The COVID-19 pandemic has been declared a public health emergency of international concern; this has caused excessive anxiety among health care workers. In addition, publication bias and low-quality publications have become widespread, which can result in the dissemination of unreliable findings. This paper presents the protocol for a meta-analysis with the following two aims: (1) to examine the prevalence of anxiety among health care workers and determine whether it has increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and (2) to investigate whether there has been an increase in publication bias. All related studies that were published/released from 2015 to 2020 will be searched in electronic databases (Web of Science, PubMed, PsyArXiv, and medRxiv). The risk of bias in individual studies will be assessed using the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) checklist. The heterogeneity of the studies will be assessed using the I<sup>2</sup> statistic. The effect size (prevalence rates of anxiety) and a 95% CI for each paper will also be calculated. We will use a moderator analysis to test for the effect of COVID-19 on health care workers' anxiety levels and detect publication bias in COVID-19 studies. We will also assess publication bias using the funnel plot and Egger regression. In case of publication bias, if studies have no homogeneity, the trim-and-fill procedure will be applied to adjust for missing studies. Database searches will commence in November 2020. The meta-analysis will be completed within 2 months of the start date. This meta-analysis aims to provide comprehensive evidence about whether COVID-19 increases the prevalence of anxiety among health care workers and whether there has been an increase in publication bias and a deterioration in the quality of publications due to the pandemic. The results of this meta-analysis can provide evidence to help health managers to make informed decisions related to anxiety prevention in health care workers.

"Examining temporal interactions between loneliness and depressive symptoms and the mediating role of emotion regulation difficulties among UK residents during the COVID-19 lockdown: Longitudinal results from the COVID-19 Psychological Wellbeing Study","Background Longitudinal studies examining the temporal association between mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 outbreak are needed. It is important to determine how relationships between mental health outcomes, specifically loneliness and depressive symptoms, manifest over a brief timeframe and in a pandemic context. Method Data was gathered over 4 months (March â€“ June 2020) using an online survey with three repeated measures at monthly intervals (N = 1958; 69.8% females; Age 18-87 years, M = 37.01, SD = 12.81). Associations between loneliness, depression symptoms, and emotion regulation difficulty were tested using Pearsonâ€™s product moment correlations, and descriptive statistics were calculated for all study variables. Cross-lagged structural equation modelling was used to examine the temporal relationships between variables. Results The longitudinal association between loneliness and depressive symptoms was reciprocal. Loneliness predicted higher depressive symptoms one month later, and depressive symptoms predicted higher loneliness one month later. The relationship was not mediated by emotion regulation difficulties. Emotion regulation difficulties and depressive symptoms were also reciprocally related over time. Limitations Limitations include the reliance on self-report data and the non-representative sample. There was no pre-pandemic assessment limiting the conclusions that can be drawn regarding the mental health impact of the COVID-19 crisis. Conclusions Loneliness should be considered an important feature of case conceptualisation for depression during this time. Clinical efforts to improve mental health during the pandemic could focus on interventions that target either loneliness, depression, or both. Potential approaches include increasing physical activity or low-intensity cognitive therapies delivered remotely.","Jenny Groarke et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460ED-01F-78B","20201120","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; loneliness; longitudinal studies; emotional regulation; covid-19; mental health; united kingdom; depression","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-20","",7350,""
