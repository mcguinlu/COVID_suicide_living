"An integrated multidisciplinary model of COVID-19 recovery care","BACKGROUND: In January 2020, the WHO declared the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak a public health emergency;by March 11, a pandemic was declared  To date in Ireland, over 3300 patients have been admitted to acute hospitals as a result of infection with COVID-19  AIMS: This article aims to describe the establishment of a COVID Recovery Service, a multidisciplinary service for comprehensive follow-up of patients with a hospital diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia  METHODS: A hybrid model of virtual and in-person clinics was established, supported by a multidisciplinary team consisting of respiratory, critical care, infectious diseases, psychiatry, and psychology services  This model identifies patients who need enhanced follow-up following COVID-19 pneumonia and aims to support patients with complications of COVID-19 and those who require integrated community care  RESULTS: We describe a post-COVID-19 service structure together with detailed protocols for multidisciplinary follow-up  One hundred seventy-four patients were discharged from Beaumont Hospital after COVID-19 pneumonia  Sixty-seven percent were male with a median age (IQR) of 66 5 (51-97)  Twenty-two percent were admitted to the ICU for mechanical ventilation, 11% had non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen, and 67% did not have specialist respiratory support  Early data suggests that 48% of these patients will require medium to long-term specialist follow-up  CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the implementation of an integrated multidisciplinary approach to patients with COVID-19, identifying those with increased physical and mental healthcare needs  Our initial experience suggests that significant physical, psychological, and cognitive impairments may persist despite clinical resolution of the infection","O'Brien, H.; Tracey, M.

"Impact of COVID-19-related stress and lockdown on mental health among people living with HIV in Argentina","The spread of SARS-CoV-2, causative agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has necessitated widespread lockdown to mitigate the pandemic. This study examines the influence of resilience on the impact of COVID-related stress and enforced lockdown on mental health, drug use and treatment adherence among people living with HIV (PLWH) in Argentina. PLWH residing predominantly in Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area and urban regions of Argentina were identified from a private clinic electronic database. Participants completed an anonymous online survey to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on economic disruption, resilience, mental health outcomes (depression, anxiety, stress, loneliness), adherence to HIV treatment, and substance use. We performed ordinary least squares and logistic regressions to test whether resilient coping buffered the impact of economic disruption on mental health and drug use during quarantine. 1336 PLWH aged 18-82 were enrolled. The impact of economic disruption on mental health ÃŽâ€F(1,1321)=8.86, p=.003 and loneliness ÃŽâ€F(1,1326)=5.77, p=.016 was buffered by resilience. A three-way interaction between resilient buffering, stress, and sex was significant ÃŽâ€F(1,1325)=4.76, p=.029. Participants reported less than excellent adherence to medication (33%), disruption to mental health services (11%), and disruption to substance abuse treatment (1.3%) during lockdown. The impact of COVID-stress and lockdown on emotional distress appeared mitigated by resilience coping strategies and the buffering impact of resilience on perceived stress was greater among women. Results highlight PLWH's capacity to adhere to treatment in challenging circumstances and the importance of developing resilience skills for better coping with stress and adversity.","Ballivian, Alcaide, Cecchini, Jones, Abbamonte, Cassetti","https://doi.org/10.1097/QAI.0000000000002493","20200908","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-09","",4481,""

Participants (Mage = 15.67, SD = 1.37) identified as female (56.2%), male (38.7%), or trans/non-binary individuals (TNBI; 5.1%). Results: A large portion of adolescents met clinical cut-off for depression (51.2%), anxiety (40%) and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (45%). High rates of ADHD, ODD, and social phobia symptoms (ranging from 9%-20%) were also reported. Adolescents were mainly concerned with the health of family members and vulnerable populations, as well as the increased family stress at home during COVID-19. Rates of substance use were higher than expected with over 50% of youth engaging in some form of substance use, and almost 20% engaging in regular substance use. Rates of experiencing and perpetrating psychological violence at home were higher than physical violence and were close to rates in high-risk populations. TNBI and females reported higher rates of mental health problems, and violence at home compared to males. Conclusions: Increased rates of mental health problems, substance use, and violence in the home necessitate targeted supports that encourage positive coping amidst the additional stresses of COVID-19.","Stephanie Craig et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4619F-B69-698","20200909","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Clinical Child Psychology","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-09","",4486,""
"Application of the Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemic-6 (SAVE-6) and Coronavirus Anxiety scales (CAS) to measure cancer patient anxiety in response to the COVID-19","This study investigated the usefulness of the 6-item Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics (SAVE-6) scale and the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) as tools to assess anxiety related to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in cancer patients. A total of 221 patients with cancer responded to an anonymous online questionnaire between July 15 and August 15, 2020. The functional impairment of the patients was assessed using the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS), and the SAVE-6 and CAS were also applied. Among these 221 cancer patients, 110 (49.8%) had SAVE-6 scores =15 and 21 (9.5%) had CAS scores =5. Within the study population, 104 (47.1%) and 29 (13.1%) patients had WSAS scores =11 (moderate to severe functional impairment) and =21 (severe functional impairment), respectively. The correlations between the SAVE-6 and WSAS (p < 0.001) and CAS (p < 0.001) scores were statistically significant. The cut-off for the SAVE-6 was 15 points, while that for the WSAS was 11. Our results suggested that the SAVE-6 and CAS could be used to evaluate moderate and severe degrees of functional impairment related to mental health, respectively, in cancer patients during viral epidemics.","Myung Hee Ahn et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460E4-66C-75C","20200909","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; covid-19; anxiety; mental health; cancer","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-09","",4487,""
"Changing living arrangements, family dynamics and stress during lockdown: evidence from four birth cohorts in the UK","On 23 March 2020 the UK went into lockdown in an unprecedented step to attempt to limit the spread of coronavirus. Since then, many families have found themselves spending an unprecedented amount of time together, with some facing the additional challenge of adapting to changes in who they are living with as some families have found themselves unexpectedly brought back together. School and university closures, the move to remote working, furlough or the loss of employment have all meant that many adult children who had previously left the parental home have returned. Other individuals have moved to provide care and support for a family member or friend who has been â€˜shieldingâ€™, and conversely some vulnerable and/or older people have moved in with a younger relative or friend. This paper provides an overview of the changes in living arrangements during the Covid-19 pandemic, drawing upon recently available data from five large scale nationally representative surveys, including the second wave of Understanding Society Covid-19 Study, conducted in May 2020 and the special Covid-19 surveys conducted with the participants of the 1958, 1970, 2000-01 British birth cohorts and Next Steps (born in 1989-90). The paper then goes on to explore the impact of the unexpected changes in living arrangements and mental health, as measured by self-reported stress and interpersonal conflict. Data from the Understanding Society May Covid-19 survey shows that for most of the respondents (95.5%) their living arrangements during the three months since 1st March 2020 had not changed. Just over 2% had changed their address and a further 1.5% reported other people had moved in, whilst under 1% reporting people moving out. However, the likelihood of having changed living arrangements varied significantly by age with one in seven of those aged 20-24 reporting a change in living arrangements. Young people aged 16-29 accounted for over half (57%) of all respondents reporting that they had moved themselves. By contrast, respondents in mid-life (45-59) and early later life (60-74) accounted for the majority of respondents reporting other people had moved in or out. Analysis of the cohort data confirmed this picture with nearly a quarter (24%) of the Millennium Cohort Study, currently aged 19 reporting a change in the people they were living with as a result of covid-19, compared to under one in ten of the 1958 cohort, now aged 62. Logistic regression models were used to assess the odds of reporting increased stress and conflict increase amongst those respondents who had experienced a change in living arrangement change compared to those who had not. The results provide strong evidence that those individuals whose living arrangements have changed as a result of the covoid-19 pandemic have a higher likelihood of reported increased stress and family conflict than those whose living arrangements remained unchanged. This has important implications for public health and wider policy as prolonged periods of stress can lead to serious health problems and policy makers need to be mindful that services may need to flex to take these new, albeit for many temporary, forms of living into account.","Maria Evamdrou et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4614F-108-619","20200909","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics; stress; cohort; living arrangements; covid-19; pandemic; family relationships","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-09","",4488,""
