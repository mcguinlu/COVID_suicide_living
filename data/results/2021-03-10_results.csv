"Mental health status of health sector and community services employees during the COVID-19 pandemic","This study was conducted to evaluate the depression, anxiety and stress status of health sector and community service workers who were actively working during the pandemic period. This is a descriptive study. A total of 735 people consisting of 426 health sector employees and 309 service sector employees, constituted the study sample. In this study, the data were collected using the personal information form and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21). A regression model was established to test the effect of socio-demographic characteristics on depression, anxiety, and stress levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. While there was no difference in working a second job across different sectors (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.450), the household income (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and the increase in expenditures during the COVID-19 pandemic (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) were different across the sectors. The scores of the overall scale and its sub-dimensions were significantly different across the sectors (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). The DASS-21 scores were higher in the participants, who started to smoke more and who had their sleep duration decreased (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). There is a statistically significant difference between social media use and the DASS-21 score (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). There is a significant difference across all DASS-21 subgroups by the daily working hours in the health sector (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Our study provides significant findings regarding the mental health of individuals who continued working during the pandemic. To implement effective mental health interventions to risk groups and affected people in the COVID-19 pandemic, the recommendations of leading organizations, including WHO and ILO, should be implemented effectively concerning occupational health.","Kabasakal, Ãƒâ€“zpulat, Akca, Ãƒâ€“zcebe","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00420-021-01678-y","20210309","COVID-19; Community services employee; Health sector employee; Mental health; Occupational health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-10","",11694,""
"Long-term relapse rates after cognitive behaviour therapy for anxiety and depressive disorders among older adults: A follow-up study during COVID-19","This study assessed the long-term symptom relapse rates among older adults previously treated with cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for anxiety and/or depression during COVID-19. Participants were 37 older adults (MÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 75 years, SDÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 5; 65% female) previously treated with CBT for anxiety and/or unipolar depression who were re-assessed an average of 5.6Ã‚Â years later, during the first Australian COVID-19 lockdown. On average, there was no significant group-level change in anxiety, depression or quality of life. When assessing change in symptoms based on clinical cut-off points on self-report measures, results suggest only 17%-22% showed a relapse of symptoms by the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings suggest that CBT may be protective in coping with life stressors many years after treatment ends. However, results warrant replication to attribute continued symptom improvement to CBT given the lack of control group.","Johnco, Chen, Muir, Strutt, Dawes, Siette, Dias, Hillebrandt, Maurice, Wuthrich","https://doi.org/10.1111/ajag.12928","20210309","COVID-19; anxiety; cognitive behavioral therapy; depression; frail older adults; geriatrics; treatment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-10","",11695,""
"Prevalence and correlates of suicidal ideation among the general population in China during the COVID-19 pandemic","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a major threat to the public. However, the comprehensive profile of suicidal ideation among the general population has not been systematically investigated in a large sample in the age of COVID-19. A national online cross-sectional survey was conducted between February 28, 2020 and March 11, 2020 in a representative sample of Chinese adults aged 18Ã‚Â years and older. Suicidal ideation was assessed using item 9 of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. The prevalence of suicidal ideation and its risk factors was evaluated. A total of 56,679 participants (27,149 males and 29,530 females) were included. The overall prevalence of suicidal ideation was 16.4%, including 10.9% seldom, 4.1% often, and 1.4% always suicidal ideation. The prevalence of suicidal ideation was higher in males (19.1%) and individuals aged 18-24Ã‚Â years (24.7%) than in females (14.0%) and those aged 45Ã‚Â years and older (11.9%). Suicidal ideation was more prevalent in individuals with suspected or confirmed infection (63.0%), frontline workers (19.2%), and people with pre-existing mental disorders (41.6%). Experience of quarantine, unemployed, and increased psychological stress during the pandemic were associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation and its severity. However, paying more attention to and gaining a better understanding of COVID-19-related knowledge, especially information about psychological interventions, could reduce the risk. The estimated prevalence of suicidal ideation among the general population in China during COVID-19 was significant. The findings will be important for improving suicide prevention strategies during COVID-19.","Shi, Que, Lu, Gong, Liu, Wang, Ran, Ravindran, Ravindran, Fazel, Bao, Shi, Lu","https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.5","20210309","COVID-19; China; prevalence; risk factors; suicidal ideation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-10","",11696,""

"A US Population Health Survey on the Impact of COVID-19 Using the EQ-5D-5L","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in negative impacts on the economy, population health, and health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL). To assess the impact of COVID-19 on US population HRQoL using the EQ-5D-5L. We surveyed respondents on physical and mental health, demographics, socioeconomics, brief medical history, current COVID-19 status, sleep, dietary, financial, and spending changes. Results were compared to online and face-to-face US population norms. Predictors of EQ-5D-5L utility were analyzed using both standard and post-lasso OLS regressions. Robustness of regression coefficients against unmeasured confounding was analyzed using the E-Value sensitivity analysis. Amazon MTurk workers (n=2776) in the USA. EQ-5D-5L utility and VAS scores by age group. We received n=2746 responses. Subjects 18-24 years reported lower mean (SD) health utility (0.752 (0.281)) compared with both online (0.844 (0.184), p=0.001) and face-to-face norms (0.919 (0.127), p&lt;0.001). Among ages 25-34, utility was worse compared to face-to-face norms only (0.825 (0.235) vs. 0.911 (0.111), p&lt;0.001). For ages 35-64, utility was better during pandemic compared to online norms (0.845 (0.195) vs. 0.794 (0.247), p&lt;0.001). At age 65+, utility values (0.827 (0.213)) were similar across all samples. VAS scores were worse for all age groups (p&lt;0.005) except ages 45-54. Increasing age and income were correlated with increased utility, while being Asian, American Indian or Alaska Native, Hispanic, married, living alone, having history of chronic illness or self-reported depression, experiencing COVID-19-like symptoms, having a family member diagnosed with COVID-19, fear of COVID-19, being underweight, and living in California were associated with worse utility scores. Results were robust to unmeasured confounding. HRQoL decreased during the pandemic compared to US population norms, especially for ages 18-24. The mental health impact of COVID-19 is significant and falls primarily on younger adults whose health outcomes may have been overlooked based on policy initiatives to date.","Hay, Gong, Jiao, Zawadzki, Zawadzki, Pickard, Xie, Crawford, Gu","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-021-06674-z","20210309","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-10","",11699,""
"Worry, Severity, Controllability, and Preventive Behaviours of COVID-19 and Their Associations with Mental Health of Turkish Healthcare Workers Working at a Pandemic Hospital","Previous research suggests that psychological and behavioural factors such as worry, severity, controllability, and preventive behaviours are associated with mental health and well-being. Less is known about simultaneous effects of those factors in predicting mental health and well-being. This study aimed to present the prevalence of mental health problems and identify the predictors of mental health and subjective well-being of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants included 245 healthcare workers (<i>M</i><sub> <i>age</i> </sub> Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°33.16Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°7.33; 50.61% females) from a pandemic hospital in Turkey. Healthcare workers reported mild/severe depression, anxiety, and stress. Females tended to be more vulnerable to developing psychiatric symptoms. Worry, severity, and controllability significantly predicted depression, anxiety, stress, and subjective well-being while preventive behaviours only predicted subjective well-being. These findings suggest the importance of assessing healthcare workers' experiences of mental health and subjective well-being and their associated factors to assist mental health providers tailor assessments and treatment during a pandemic.","YÃ„Â±ldÃ„Â±rÃ„Â±m, Ãƒâ€“zaslan","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-021-00515-0","20210309","Controllability; Mental health problems; Preventive behaviours; Severity; Subjective well-being; Worry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-10","",11700,""
"Mental distress during the COVID-19 pandemic: Its association with public perceptions toward government's pandemic responses and lifestyle changes","In order to propose better mental health interventions under the pandemic threat, the present study aimed to investigate whether depression and anxiety are associated to Chinese adults' perceptions of government's pandemic responses and the personal lifestyle changes imposed by those responses during the COVID-19 pandemic. We used a telephone survey with random sampling and obtained a probability community sample of 616 adults (39.1% men; <i>M</i><sub>age</sub>Ã‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°41.7, <i>SD</i><sub>age</sub>Ã‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°16.3) in Macao, China in April 2020. The prevalence of 8.8% probable depression and 12.0% probable anxiety was observed in this sample. Positive perceptions toward government's pandemic responses were found to be negatively associated with probable depression and probable anxiety (ORuÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.36 and .41, <i>p</i>Ã‚Â &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05). Three lifestyle-changing stressors (i.e., increased family conflict, friendship deterioration, and weight gain), were commonly reported (29.9, 27.5, and 43.0% respectively), and displayed positive associations with probable depression (ORuÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.67 to 1.87, <i>p</i>Ã‚Â &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05) and probable anxiety (ORuÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.54 to 2.10, <i>p</i>Ã‚Â &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05). Our findings suggest protective effects of perceived trust and satisfaction regarding government's pandemic responses against mental distress and the potential mental health threats from three pandemic-specific lifestyle-changing stressors. These findings can inform clinicians and policymakers to better prepare for the mental health impacts of the current and future pandemics.","Chen, Yu, Su, Tong, Wu","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-01547-4","20210309","Mental distress; Pandemic; Perception; Public satisfaction; Trust; Weight gain","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-10","",11701,""
"Violence Against Women During COVID-19 Pandemic","The objectives of this study were to correlate several factors - including depression, anxiety, stress and self-esteem levels in both men and women - with the occurrence of domestic violence against women (VAW) during quarantine. This cross-sectional study was carried out in April 2020, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic when lockdown procedures were implemented; 86 married couples participated in this study amounting to 172 responses in total. A different questionnaire was set for women and men; the couple filled out their respective questionnaire simultaneously, but privately where one did not see the answers of the other. Inclusion criteria included married couples of all ages that are living together during the lockdown of COVID-19. The results of this study showed that a higher total abuse score was found in 39 females (45.3%; CI: 0.34 - 0.56). Being a Muslim female (Beta =24.80) and females having higher anxiety (Beta=0.97) were significantly associated with higher total abuse scores, whereas higher stress score in female (Beta=-0.61) was significantly associated with lower total abuse scores. In conclusion, this study focuses on VAW as a serious problem while demonstrating its further emergence during quarantine. This study also focused on the effects brought on by lockdown policies, including social and economic factors, and their implications in the increase of VAW during this pandemic.","Akel, Berro, Rahme, Haddad, Obeid, Hallit","https://doi.org/10.1177/0886260521997953","20210309","Lebanon; covid-19; lockdown; quarantine; violence against women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-10","",11702,""
"Life on pause: An analysis of UK fertility patients' coping mechanisms after the cancellation of fertility treatment due to COVID-19","In March 2020, fertility clinics across the UK began cancelling all assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatment, with the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) stopping all ART treatment from going ahead beyond the 15th April 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This article examines the coping mechanisms adopted by fertility patients during this time, focussing on the emotional support received from online fertility forums and fertility clinics during the indeterminate wait for treatment to resume. The study draws upon an online survey which assessed the mental health and wellbeing of 124 female fertility patients whose ART treatment was cancelled due to the Coronavirus pandemic. The findings indicate a potential for improved communication between fertility clinics and patients in order to reduce psychological stress and isolation during the postponement of ART treatment, alongside better utilisation of online platforms as mechanisms for support. This article adds to the growing body of knowledge concerned with the implications of denying reproductive rights to the infertility community during a global pandemic. It also contributes to sociological discussions on the support mechanisms available to those navigating infertility and the wider social management of uncertainty.","Tippett","https://doi.org/10.1177/1359105321999711","20210309","COVID-19; emotions; in vitro fertilisation; infertility; mental health; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-10","",11703,""
"A Systematic Review of the Evidence on Inflammation in Depressive Illness and Symptoms, in Chronic and End Stage Kidney Disease","Background Depressive illness and symptoms are known to be common in physical health problems and are present in at least a third of people with chronic kidney disease and end stage renal failure (CKD/ESKD). Depressive illness and symptoms in CKD/ESKD complicates care, is associated with a shorter life expectancy, and may arise in response to inflammation. Methods We undertook a systematic review of studies including measures of depression and inflammatory markers in CKD/ESKD. The protocol was pre-registered with PROSPERO: CRD42019141305. Data base searches were completed in 2019 and repeated in May 2020. We assessed study quality, and undertook a narrative synthesis as well as meta-analyses of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, examining associations between depressive states and inflammatory markers. Results There was significant heterogeneity in study quality, comorbidities, samples, depression measures, and study design, as well as in the specific measured inflammatory markers. Overall, there is some evidence for associations of IL6 and CRP with depressive illness and symptoms, with inconclusive or contradictory evidence for other inflammatory markers. There were few intervention studies. Studies of samples with physical comorbidity and higher rated quality were more likely to show positive associations. There were few longitudinal studies. Conclusions There is some evidence of inflammation being an important correlate of depressive illness and symptoms in the presence of physical health comorbidities. Better research designs are needed including a range of inflammatory markers.","Simone Jayakumar et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46199-F32-628","20210310","PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-10","",11704,""
