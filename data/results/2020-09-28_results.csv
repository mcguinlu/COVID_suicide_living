"Comparison of mental health service activity before and shortly after UK social distancing responses to the COVID-19 pandemic: February-March 2020","This study sought to provide an early description of mental health service activity before and after national implementation of social distancing for COVID-19. A time series analysis was carried out of daily service-level activity on data from a large mental healthcare provider in southeast London, from 01.02.2020 to 31.03.2020, comparing activity before and after 16.03.2020: i) inpatient admissions, discharges and numbers, ii) contact numbers and daily caseloads (Liaison, Home Treatment Teams, Community Mental Health Teams); iii) numbers of deaths for past and present patients. Daily face-to-face contact numbers fell for liaison, home treatment and community services with incomplete compensatory rises in non-face-to-face contacts. Daily caseloads fell for all services, apart from working age and child/adolescent community teams. Inpatient numbers fell 13.6% after 16th March, and daily numbers of deaths increased by 61.8%.","Jonathan M Blackburn; Nur Diana Anuar; Ti-Myen Tan; Andrew JM Nel; Muneerah Smith; Kavithambigai Ellan","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.26.20202150""","20200928","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-28","",5233,""

"Containment, Contact Tracing and Asymptomatic Transmission of Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19): A Modelling Study","When a novel infectious disease emerges, enhanced contact tracing and isolation are implemented to prevent a major epidemic, and indeed, they have been successful for the control of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which have been greatly reduced without causing a global pandemic  Considering that asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infections are substantial for the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the feasibility of preventing the major epidemic has been questioned  Using a two-type branching process model, the present study assesses the feasibility of containing COVID-19 by computing the probability of a major epidemic  We show that if there is a substantial number of asymptomatic transmissions, cutting chains of transmission by means of contact tracing and case isolation would be very challenging without additional interventions, and in particular, untraced cases contribute to lowering the feasibility of containment  Even if isolation of symptomatic cases is conducted swiftly after symptom onset, only secondary transmissions after the symptom onset can be prevented","Kinoshita, Ryo; Anzai, Asami; Jung, Sung-mok; Linton, Natalie M; Miyama, Takeshi; Kobayashi, Tetsuro; Hayashi, Katsuma; Suzuki, Ayako; Yang, Yichi; Akhmetzhanov, Andrei R; Nishiura, Hiroshi","https://www.google.com/search?q=Containment,+Contact+Tracing+and+Asymptomatic+Transmission+of+Novel+Coronavirus+Disease+(COVID-19):+A+Modelling+Study","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Journal of Clinical Medicine;9(10):3125, 2020.; Publication details: Journal of Clinical Medicine;9(10):3125, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-28","",5236,""

"Reward Responsiveness, Optimism, and Social and Mental Functioning in Children Aged 6-7: Protocol of a Cross-Sectional Pilot Study","BACKGROUND: There is evidence that reward responsiveness and optimism are associated with mental and social functioning in adolescence and adulthood, but it is unknown if this is also the case for young children  Part of the reason for this gap in the literature is that the instruments that are used to assess reward responsiveness and optimism in adolescents and adults are usually not suitable for young children  OBJECTIVE: Two behavioral tasks to assess reward learning, a questionnaire on reward responsiveness, and a questionnaire on optimism/pessimism will be tested on their feasibility and reliability in children aged 6-7  Depending on their feasibility and reliability, these instruments will also be used to investigate if reward responsiveness and optimism are associated with mental and social functioning in young children  METHODS: For this cross-sectional pilot study, we adapted a number of tasks and questionnaires to the needs of 6-7-year-old children, by simplification of items, oral rather than written assessment, and reducing the number of conditions and items  We will approach teachers and, with their help, aim to include 70 children aged 6-7 to assess the feasibility and reliability of the tasks and questionnaires  Feasibility measures that will be reported are the proportion of children completing the task/questionnaire, the proportion of children that were able to explain the instructions in their own words to the researcher, and the proportion of children that correctly answered the control questions  The reliability of the scales will be assessed by computing Cronbach a and item-total score correlations and the reliability of the tasks by correlations between different consecutive blocks of trials  Ethics approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of the Department of Pedagogy and Educational Sciences  RESULTS: Data collection was originally planned in March and April 2020, but has been postponed due to Corona virus regulations  We expect to collect the data in the first half of 2021  The findings will be disseminated in preprints and peer-reviewed publications  CONCLUSIONS: The development of feasible and reliable instruments for assessing reward responsiveness and optimism in young children is expected to benefit future research on underlying mechanisms of mental and social functioning in young children  If the instruments assessed in this study are usable with young children, it would be particularly interesting to include them in cohort studies because this would enable investigating not only concurrent associations, but also prospective associations between reward responsiveness and optimism early in life and mental and social functioning later in life  If, as we hypothesize, reward responsiveness and optimism are not only associated with (prospective) mental and social functioning in adults and adolescents but also in young children, this could provide a way of identifying vulnerable children already at an early stage  INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): PRR1-10 2196/18902","Vrijen, C.; Ackermans, M.

"Diagnosis of physical and mental health conditions in primary care during the COVID-19 pandemic: a retrospective cohort study","To date, research on the indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health of the population and the health-care system is scarce. We aimed to investigate the indirect effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on general practice health-care usage, and the subsequent diagnoses of common physical and mental health conditions in a deprived UK population. We did a retrospective cohort study using routinely collected primary care data that was recorded in the Salford Integrated Record between Jan 1, 2010, and May 31, 2020. We extracted the weekly number of clinical codes entered into patient records overall, and for six high-level categories: symptoms and observations, diagnoses, prescriptions, operations and procedures, laboratory tests, and other diagnostic procedures. Negative binomial regression models were applied to monthly counts of first diagnoses of common conditions (common mental health problems, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and cancer), and corresponding first prescriptions of medications indicative of these conditions. We used these models to predict the expected numbers of first diagnoses and first prescriptions between March 1 and May 31, 2020, which were then compared with the observed numbers for the same time period. Between March 1 and May 31, 2020, 1073 first diagnoses of common mental health problems were reported compared with 2147 expected cases (95% CI 1821 to 2489) based on preceding years, representing a 50Ã‚Â·0% reduction (95% CI 41Ã‚Â·1 to 56Ã‚Â·9). Compared with expected numbers, 456 fewer diagnoses of circulatory system diseases (43Ã‚Â·3% reduction, 95% CI 29Ã‚Â·6 to 53Ã‚Â·5), and 135 fewer type 2 diabetes diagnoses (49Ã‚Â·0% reduction, 23Ã‚Â·8 to 63Ã‚Â·1) were observed. The number of first prescriptions of associated medications was also lower than expected for the same time period. However, the gap between observed and expected cancer diagnoses (31 fewer; 16Ã‚Â·0% reduction, -18Ã‚Â·1 to 36Ã‚Â·6) during this time period was not statistically significant. In this deprived urban population, diagnoses of common conditions decreased substantially between March and May 2020, suggesting a large number of patients have undiagnosed conditions. A rebound in future workload could be imminent as COVID-19 restrictions ease and patients with undiagnosed conditions or delayed diagnosis present to primary and secondary health-care services. Such services should prioritise the diagnosis and treatment of these patients to mitigate potential indirect harms to protect public health.

"Living with arthritis: a &quot;training camp&quot; for coping with stressful events? A survey on resilience of arthritis patients following the COVID-19 pandemic","Resilience is defined as &quot;the capacity of individuals to cope successfully with significant change or adversity&quot;. The challenge posed by the COVID-19 pandemic may potentially represent an overwhelmingly stressful event for patients with chronic diseases. Aim of our study was to investigate the levels of resilience in individuals with inflammatory arthritis living in Emilia Romagna, the third hardest-hit Italian region during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. To this purpose, we developed a survey consisting of four different sections assessing demographic characteristics, the 14-item resilience scale (RS14) and questionnaires evaluating depression and anxiety. Consecutive patients with inflammatory arthritis were recruited over a short time frame immediately after the end of national lockdown and compared with control individuals from the general population. One hundred twenty-two patients and 173 controls were included. Levels of resilience, as measured by RS14 score, were significantly higher in patients with inflammatory arthritis (82.6 Ã‚Â± 14.0 vs 79.0 Ã‚Â± 12.8, p = 0.018). After stratification for gender, the difference in RS14 score was maintained in women (p = 0.045), but not in men (p = 0.252). High resilience, defined as having a RS14 score &gt; 90, was significantly more prevalent in patients than in controls (30% vs 16%, p = 0.009). In arthritis patients, no significant differences in RS14 were observed after stratification for specific diagnosis, age, or disease duration and activity. Our findings suggest that patients with inflammatory arthritis may be more resilient than the general population towards unexpected stressful events such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Key Points Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Living with inflammatory arthritis may foster resilience. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ After COVID-19, patients with inflammatory arthritis were more resilient than the general population.","Ciaffi, Brusi, Lisi, Mancarella, D'Onghia, Quaranta, Bruni, Spinella, Giuggioli, Landini, Ferri, Meliconi, Ursini","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10067-020-05411-x","20200926","Anxiety; Arthritis; COVID-19; Depression; Resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-28","",5284,""
"COVID-19 Care in India: Evolving Paradigms from Public Health to Critical Care","Covid-19 pandemic in India has rapidly grown though we have a low case fatality rate, high recovery rate and large population is asymptomatic or presymptomatic. Public health measures to close the tap across the country need hypervigilance and follow simple dictum of aggressive testing, tracing and isolation. The covid cases need an early diagnosis with treat and care model. Most can be managed with home isolation under telemedicine supervision with oxygen saturation screening by a simple six minute walk test. Hospitalised cases have emerging evidence in different therapies from antivirals, steroids, immunologic to heparins but high flow oxygen, prone position and supportive care remains the cornerstone in critical care with nursing and nutrition. Vaccine research is ongoing but currently only social vaccine can mitigate the pandemic. Covid appropriate behaviour of Masking, sanitisation and physical distancing with immune modulating behaviour like adequate sleep, digital detox for two hour and clean well ventilated environment is the key with breathing exercises including yoga and positive mental health and avoidance of crowds the only vaccine to live with covid -19 today.","Joshi","https://www.google.com/search?q=COVID-19+Care+in+India:+Evolving+Paradigms+from+Public+Health+to+Critical+Care.","20200926","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-28","",5285,""
"Effects of lockdown on health of patients with severe atopic dermatitis treated with dupilumab","use of dupilumab as treatment for severe adult atopic dermatitis (AD) increased over time since its introduction in September 2018, due to its established efficacy. AD is one of the most common chronic inflammatory skin disease affecting up to 14.3% of adults, with 63,3% of these cases first appearing before 18 years of age. Patients' disease burden is important with high rate of discomfort, less confidence in daily life activities and psycho-social distress. The introduction of dupilumab changed the natural history of this disease, drastically improving AD manifestations and therefore quality of life.","Ferrucci, Tavecchio, Favale, Angileri, Riva, Romagnuolo, Beretta, Marzano","https://doi.org/10.1111/jdv.16955","20200926","Covid-19; atopic dermatitis; depression; dupilumab; lockdown","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-28","",5286,""
"Challenges to peer support in low- and middle-income countries during COVID-19","A recent editorial urged those working in global mental health to &quot;change the conversation&quot; on coronavirus disease (Covid-19) by putting more focus on the needs of people with severe mental health conditions. UPSIDES (Using Peer Support In Developing Empowering mental health Services) is a six-country consortium carrying out implementation research on peer support for people with severe mental health conditions in high- (Germany, Israel), lower middle- (India) and low-income (Tanzania, Uganda) settings. This commentary briefly outlines some of the key challenges faced by UPSIDES sites in low- and middle-income countries as a result of Covid-19, sharing early lessons that may also apply to other services seeking to address the needs of people with severe mental health conditions in similar contexts. The key take-away from experiences in India, Tanzania and Uganda is that inequalities in terms of access to mobile technologies, as well as to secure employment and benefits, put peer support workers in particularly vulnerable situations precisely when they and their peers are also at their most isolated. Establishing more resilient peer support services requires attention to the already precarious situation of people with severe mental health conditions in low-resource settings, even before a crisis like Covid-19 occurs. While it is essential to maintain contact with peer support workers and peers to whatever extent is possible remotely, alternatives to face-to-face delivery of psychosocial interventions are not always straightforward to implement and can make it more difficult to observe individuals' reactions, talk about emotional issues and offer appropriate support. In environments where mental health care was already heavily medicalized and mostly limited to medications issued by psychiatric institutions, Covid-19 threatens burgeoning efforts to pursue a more holistic and person-centered model of care for people with severe mental health conditions. As countries emerge from lockdown, those working in global mental health will need to redouble their efforts not only to make up for lost time and help individuals cope with the added stressors of Covid-19 in their communities, but also to regain lost ground in mental health care reform and in broader conversations about mental health in low-resource settings.","Mpango, Kalha, Shamba, Ramesh, Ngakongwa, Kulkarni, Korde, Nakku, Ryan","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-020-00622-y","20200926","Covid-19; Global mental health; Peer support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-28","",5287,""
"Social capital and public health: responding to the COVID-19 pandemic","As countries continue to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, the importance of ensuring that fair and equal access to healthcare for all is more urgent than ever. Policies that promote social capital building along all levels of society may offer an important avenue for improved healthcare delivery and health systems strengthening in the COVID-19 response. In reference to the established and emerging literature on social capital and health, we explore the role of social capital in the COVID-19 health policy response. We analyse current research with respect to mental health, public health policy compliance, and the provision of care for vulnerable populations, and highlight how considerations of bonding, bridging, and linking capital can contribute to health systems strengthening in the context of the COVID-19 response and recovery effort. This article argues that considerations of social capital - including virtual community building, fostering solidarity between high-risk and low-risk groups, and trust building between decision-makers, healthcare workers, and the public - offer a powerful frame of reference for understanding how response and recovery programs can be best implemented to effectively ensure the inclusive provision of COVID-19 health services.","Wong, Kohler","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-020-00615-x","20200926","COVID-19; Health access; Health policy; Mental health; Social capital","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-28","",5288,""
"The Recommended and Excessive Preventive Behaviors during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Community-Based Online Survey in China","COVID-19 presents unprecedented challenges to the global public health response. Preventive behaviors and keeping social distance are regarded as compelling ways to prevent COVID-19. This study focused on the sociological and psychological factors associated with proper and excessive preventive behaviors of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. For the sample, we collected the data of 4788 participants who were surveyed between 4 April and 15 April 2020 from eight provinces in China. This study designed a self-filled questionnaire that included demographic information, six components of the Health Belief Model, and target preventive behaviors. Descriptive analysis, Chi-square test, logistic regression analysis, Mantel-Haenszel hierarchical analysis, and propensity score matching were employed in this study. The results showed that 54.7% of the participants had adequate basic prevention, 63.6% of the participants had adequate advanced prevention, and 5.8% of the participants practiced excessive prevention. The elder participants were less likely to engage in proper preventive behaviors. Perceived susceptibility, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, cues to action, and knowledge levels were associated with preventive behaviors. Excessive preventive behaviors in high-risk groups with suspected symptoms were associated with their extreme psychological condition, while the support from the community and family plays an important role in avoiding these behaviors.","Ye, Wang, Feng, Wu, Li, Long, Feng, Tang","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17196953","20200926","COVID-19; health belief model; mental health; preventive behaviors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-28","",5289,""
