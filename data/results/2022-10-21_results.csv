"Suicidal behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic: A finding of an Indo-Nigerian online survey","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has a significant impact on the mental health and is associated with high suicidal behavior. This study is an effort to scrutinize suicidal behavior among general population in two countries, namely India and Nigeria. METHODS: This was an online survey conducted on 536 adult participants (272 from India and 264 from Nigeria) over a period of six months. It was conducted using a snowball sampling method. The participation in the survey was entirely voluntary. Current suicidality was measured among the participants. Data were collected in two countries only. RESULTS: Feeling of hopelessness over the past one month was reported by more than one-fifth of Indian as well as Nigerian participants. The differences in suicidal behavior of Indian and Nigerian participants were not statistically significant. Intention to hurt self and passive death wishes in the Indian population was higher than Nigerian participants, which can be explained by significantly higher medical morbidity and past psychiatric illness history in the Indian participants. Suicide attempt was reported in 1.1% of Indian participants and 1.51% of Nigerian participants in the past one month. On the other hand, 5.88% of the Indian participants and 2.65% of the Nigerian participants had suicidal ideation in the past month. CONCLUSION: High suicidal behavior has been reported during the COVID-19 pandemic among the participants from India and Nigeria.

"Loss and Grief in the Context of Dementia Caregiving","As a universal human reaction to perceived and/or actual loss, grief is becoming increasingly pervasive at all levels of society. Among the broad spectrum of loss experiences, those associated with dementia are perhaps of the most complex. The shift toward considering loss and grief within the context of dementia caregiving is promising. However, pre-loss grief is understudied, and interventions are lacking. Only few studies have evaluated the effectiveness of pre-loss psychosocial grief interventions for dementia caregivers. Preliminary findings from an ongoing clinical trial testing the effects of an 8-week, group-based online video intervention with dementia caregivers indicate that compared to precoronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, the experience of loss and separation was exacerbated by loss of control and severe physical contact restrictions in long-term care facilities. Finding effective grief interventions that can be translated into clinical and community-based environments is necessary to alleviate dementia caregivers' emotional distress and improve their quality of life.

"Accounting for Dilution of SARS-CoV-2 in Wastewater Samples Using Physico-Chemical Markers","Most sewer networks collect domestic wastewater and a variable proportion of extraneous water, such as rainwater, through surface runoff and industrial discharges. Accounting for wastewater dilution is essential to properly quantify wastewater particle loads, whether these are molecular fragments of SARS-CoV-2, or other substances of interest such as illicit drugs or microplastics. This paper presents a novel method for obtaining real-time estimates of wastewater dilution and total daily volume through wastewater treatment works, namely when flow data is not available or unreliable. The approach considers the levels of several physico-chemical markers (ammonia, electrical conductivity, and orthophosphate) in the wastewater against their dry-weather levels. Using high-resolution data from the national Wastewater Surveillance Programme of Wales, we illustrate how the method is robust to spikes in markers and can recover peaks in wastewater flow measurements that may have been capped by hydraulic relief valves. We show the method proves effective in normalising SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in wastewater samples and discuss other applications for this method, looking at wastewater surveillance as a vital tool to monitor both human and environmental health.","Wilde, Henry, Perry, William Bernard, Jones, Owen, Kille, Peter, Weightman, Andrew, Jones, Davey L.; Cross, Gareth, Durance, Isabelle","https://doi.org/10.3390/w14182885","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Water; 14(18):2885, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-21","",39471,""
"Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder among Funeral Directors after the First Wave of COVID-19 in Belgium","(1) Background: Studies have shown that healthcare workers have an increased chance of developing post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, funeral directors have not yet been studied, despite facing many of the same possible causes of PTSS as healthcare workers. (2) Methods: An online survey was spread to directors of funeral home organization DELA in Belgium (n = 287). The validated scale PCL-5 was used to assess PTSS. Additionally, fear of being infected, fear of infecting family or friends and demographic factors (age, gender, living situations, work experience) were asked. Respondents were asked to indicate if they thought of the COVID-19 period when completing the PCL-5. In addition, with a self-made question, respondents were also asked to compare their current stress-levels with those before COVID-19. (3) Results: 107 respondents were included in the study. Thirteen respondents were above the threshold for possible PTSD-diagnosis, but only four fulfilled the criteria of completing the PCL-5 with COVID-19 in mind. PTSS-scores were significantly associated with a fear of being infected (p = 0.006). Almost a majority (49.5%) of the respondents felt more stress during the period of completing the survey than the period before COVID-19, though 33.6% felt no change. (4) Conclusions: Though the PTSS-symptom rates were lower than for healthcare workers, this study does show that there should be attention for the mental health of funeral directors in the aftermath of COVID-19.

"Waiting Lists for Psychotherapy and Provider Attitudes Toward Low-Intensity Treatments as Potential Interventions: Survey Study","Background: Common mental disorders, including depression and anxiety, are leading causes of disability worldwide. Digital mental health interventions, such as web-based self-help and other low-intensity treatments (LITs) that are not digital (eg, bibliotherapy), have the potential to reach many individuals by circumventing common barriers present in traditional mental health care. It is unclear how often LITs are used in clinical practice, or whether providers would be interested in their use for treatment waiting lists. Objective: The aims of this study were to (1) describe current practices for treatment waiting lists, (2) describe providersâ€™ attitudes toward digital and nondigital LITs for patients on a waiting list, and (3) explore providersâ€™ willingness to use digital and nondigital LITs and their decisions to learn about them. Methods: We surveyed 141 practicing mental health care providers (eg, therapists and psychologists) and provided an opportunity for them to learn about LITs. Results: Most participants reported keeping a waiting list. Few participants reported currently recommending digital or nondigital LITs, though most were willing to use at least one for patients on their waiting list. Attitudes toward digital and nondigital LITs were neutral to positive. Guided digital and nondigital LITs were generally perceived to be more effective but less accessible, and unguided interventions were perceived to be less effective but more accessible. Most participants selected to access additional information on LITs, with the most popular being web-based self-help. Conclusions: Results suggest providers are currently not recommending LITs for patients on treatment waiting lists but would be willing to recommend them. Future work should explore barriers and facilitators to implementing digital and nondigital LITs for patients on treatment waiting lists.","Peipert, Allison, Krendl, Anne C.; Lorenzo-Luaces, Lorenzo","https://doi.org/10.2196/39787","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: JMIR Formative Research; 6(9), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-21","",39474,""
"Resilience in Web-Based Mental Health Communities: Building a Resilience Dictionary With Semiautomatic Text Analysis","Background: Resilience is an accepted strengths-based concept that responds to change, adversity, and crises. This concept underpins both personal and community-based preventive approaches to mental health issues and shapes digital interventions. Online mental health peer-support forums have played a prominent role in enhancing resilience by providing accessible places for sharing lived experiences of mental issues and finding support. However, little research has been conducted on whether and how resilience is realized, hindering service providersâ€™ ability to optimize resilience outcomes. Objective: This study aimed to create a resilience dictionary that reflects the characteristics and realization of resilience within online mental health peer-support forums. The findings can be used to guide further analysis and improve resilience outcomes in mental health forums through targeted moderation and management. Methods: A semiautomatic approach to creating a resilience dictionary was proposed using topic modeling and qualitative content analysis. We present a systematic 4-phase analysis pipeline that preprocesses raw forum posts, discovers core themes, conceptualizes resilience indicators, and generates a resilience dictionary. Our approach was applied to a mental health forum run by SANE (Schizophrenia: A National Emergency) Australia, with 70,179 forum posts between 2018 and 2020 by 2357 users being analyzed. Results: The resilience dictionary and taxonomy developed in this study, reveal how resilience indicators (ie, â€œsocial capital,â€ â€œbelonging,â€ â€œlearning,â€ â€œadaptive capacity,â€ and â€œself-efficacyâ€) are characterized by themes commonly discussed in the forums;each themeâ€™s top 10 most relevant descriptive terms and their synonyms;and the relatedness of resilience, reflecting a taxonomy of indicators that are more comprehensive (or compound) and more likely to facilitate the realization of others. The study showed that the resilience indicators â€œlearning,â€ â€œbelonging,â€ and â€œsocial capitalâ€ were more commonly realized, and â€œbelongingâ€ and â€œlearningâ€ served as foundations for â€œsocial capitalâ€ and â€œadaptive capacityâ€ across the 2-year study period. Conclusions: This study presents a resilience dictionary that improves our understanding of how aspects of resilience are realized in web-based mental health forums. The dictionary provides novel guidance on how to improve training to support and enhance automated systems for moderating mental health forum discussions.","Yong-Bin, Kang, McCosker, Anthony, Kamstra, Peter, Farmer, Jane","https://doi.org/10.2196/39013","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: JMIR Formative Research; 6(9), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-21","",39475,""
"Success4life Youth Empowerment for Promoting Well-being and Boosting Mental Health: Protocol for an Experimental Study","Background: There is an increasingly alarming worsening of mental health among the youth. There remain significant unmet needs for developing innovative, evidence-based technologyâ€“enhanced, positive psychology interventions (PPIs) all-inclusive in targeting psychological distress and risk factors related to high-risk behavior commonly encountered in adolescents. Objective: We aim to assess the effectiveness of a hybrid (incorporating both synchronous and asynchronous learning) and holistic (targeting social and emotional learning and tackling risk factors unique for this age group) PPI, â€œsuccess4life youth empowerment,â€ in improving well-being in the youth. Methods: Studentsâ€™ well-being will be assessed by the 5-item World Health Organization Well-Being Index, and hope will be assessed by the 6-item Childrenâ€™s Hope Scale at week 0, week 8, and week 10, month 6, and month 12. Any improvement in well-being and hope will be measured, estimating the difference in postintervention (week 8 and week 10) and preintervention (week 0) scores by determining the P value and effect size using appropriate statistical tests. Results: This study includes 2 phases: pilot phase 1, delivered by the creators of the succcess4life youth empowerment modules and platform, and phase 2, which will consist of the estimation of scalability through the recruitment of trainers. We hope to start student recruitment by 2022 and aim to complete the results for phase 1 pilot testing by 2023.

"Assessing the Impact of Conversational Artificial Intelligence in the Treatment of Stress and Anxiety in Aging Adults: Randomized Controlled Trial","Background: While mental health applications are increasingly becoming available for large populations of users, there is a lack of controlled trials on the impacts of such applications. Artificial intelligence (AI)-empowered agents have been evaluated when assisting adults with cognitive impairments;however, few applications are available for aging adults who are still actively working. These adults often have high stress levels related to changes in their work places, and related symptoms eventually affect their quality of life. Objective: We aimed to evaluate the contribution of TEO (Therapy Empowerment Opportunity), a mobile personal health care agent with conversational AI. TEO promotes mental health and well-being by engaging patients in conversations to recollect the details of events that increased their anxiety and by providing therapeutic exercises and suggestions. Methods: The study was based on a protocolized intervention for stress and anxiety management. Participants with stress symptoms and mild-to-moderate anxiety received an 8-week cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention delivered remotely. A group of participants also interacted with the agent TEO. The participants were active workers aged over 55 years. The experimental groups were as follows: group 1, traditional therapy;group 2, traditional therapy and mobile health (mHealth) agent;group 3, mHealth agent;and group 4, no treatment (assigned to a waiting list). Symptoms related to stress (anxiety, physical disease, and depression) were assessed prior to treatment (T1), at the end (T2), and 3 months after treatment (T3), using standardized psychological questionnaires. Moreover, the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 and General Anxiety Disorders-7 scales were administered before the intervention (T1), at mid-term (T2), at the end of the intervention (T3), and after 3 months (T4). At the end of the intervention, participants in groups 1, 2, and 3 filled in a satisfaction questionnaire. Results: Despite randomization, statistically significant differences between groups were present at T1. Group 4 showed lower levels of anxiety and depression compared with group 1, and lower levels of stress compared with group 2. Comparisons between groups at T2 and T3 did not show significant differences in outcomes. Analyses conducted within groups showed significant differences between times in group 2, with greater improvements in the levels of stress and scores related to overall well-being. A general worsening trend between T2 and T3 was detected in all groups, with a significant increase in stress levels in group 2. Group 2 reported higher levels of perceived usefulness and satisfaction. Conclusions: No statistically significant differences could be observed between participants who used the mHealth app alone or within the traditional CBT setting. However, the results indicated significant differences within the groups that received treatment and a stable tendency toward improvement, which was limited to individual perceptions of stress-related symptoms.

"Effects of Serious Games on Depression in Older Adults: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials","Background: Depression is a severe psychological concern that negatively affects health in older adults. Serious games applied in various fields are considered appropriate interventions, especially in mental health care. However, there is a lack of evidence regarding the effects of serious games on depression in older adults. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the characteristics and effectiveness of serious games for depression in older adults. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials were conducted. In total, 5 electronic databases (PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library) were searched to identify relevant studies published until July 6, 2021. A total of 2 reviewers independently conducted study selection, data extraction, and quality appraisals. The risk of bias in the included studies was assessed using the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist. For the meta-analysis, the effect size was calculated as the standardized mean difference (SMD) by using a random effects model. Results: A total of 17 studies with 1280 older adults were included in the systematic review, and 15 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Serious game interventions were classified into 3 types: physical activity (PA), cognitive function, and both PA and cognitive function. The meta-analysis demonstrated that serious games reduced depression in older adults (SMD -0.54, 95% CI -0.79 to -0.29;P&lt;.001). Serious games had a more significant effect size in community or home settings (SMD -0.61, 95% CI -0.95 to -0.26;P&lt;.001) than in hospital settings (SMD -0.46, 95% CI -0.85 to -0.08;P=.02);however, the difference between groups was not significant. Among the types of games, games for PA (SMD -0.60, 95% CI -0.95 to -0.25;P&lt;.001) and games for both (SMD -0.73, 95% CI -1.29 to -0.17;P=.01) had a significant effect on reducing depression in older adults. However, no significant correlations were observed between the duration or number of serious games and depression. Conclusions: Serious games were beneficial in reducing depression in older adults. Regardless of the study setting, serious games appeared to reduce depression. Particularly, serious games including PA had a significant impact on reducing depression. Furthermore, high-quality randomized controlled trials are needed to establish substantial evidence for the effectiveness of serious games on depression in older adults.

"Telehealth-Supported Decision-making Psychiatric Care for Suicidal Ideation: Longitudinal Observational Study","Background: Suicide is a leading cause of death in the United States, and suicidal ideation (SI) is a significant precursor and risk factor for suicide. Objective: This study aimed to examine the impact of a telepsychiatric care platform on changes in SI over time and remission, as well as to investigate the relationship between various demographic and medical factors on SI and SI remission. Methods: Participants included 8581 US-based adults (8366 in the treatment group and 215 in the control group) seeking treatment for depression, anxiety, or both. The treatment group included patients who had completed at least 12 weeks of treatment and had received a prescription for at least one psychiatric medication during the study period. Providers prescribed psychiatric medications for each patient during their first session and received regular data on participants. They also received decision support at treatment onset via the digital platform, which leveraged an empirically derived proprietary precision-prescribing algorithm to give providers real-time care guidelines. Participants in the control group consisted of individuals who completed the initial enrollment data and completed surveys at baseline and 12 weeks but did not receive care. Results: Greater feelings of hopelessness, anhedonia, and feeling bad about oneself were most significantly correlated (r=0.24-0.37) with SI at baseline. Sleep issues and feeling tired or having low energy, although significant, had lower correlations with SI (r=0.13-0.14). In terms of demographic variables, advancing age and education were associated with less SI at baseline (r=-0.16) and 12 weeks (r=-0.10) but less improvement over time (r=-0.12 and -0.11, respectively). Although not different at baseline, the SI expression was evident in 34.4% (74/215) of the participants in the control group and 12.32% (1031/8366) of the participants in the treatment group at 12 weeks. Although the participants in the treatment group improved over time regardless of various demographic variables, participants in the control group with less education worsened over time, after controlling for age and depression severity. A model incorporating the treatment group, age, sex, and 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire scores was 77% accurate in its classification of complete remission. Those in the treatment group were 4.3 times more likely (odds ratio 4.31, 95% CI 2.88-6.44) to have complete SI remission than those in the control group. Female participants and those with advanced education beyond high school were approximately 1.4 times more likely (odds ratio 1.38, 95% CI 1.18-1.62) to remit than their counterparts. Conclusions: The results highlight the efficacy of an antidepressant intervention in reducing SI, in this case administered via a telehealth platform and with decision support, as well as the importance of considering covariates, or subpopulations, when considering SI. Further research and refinement, ideally via randomized controlled trials, are needed.","O'Callaghan, Erin, Mahrer, Nicole, Belanger, Heather G.; Sullivan, Scott, Lee, Christine, Gupta, Carina T.; Winsberg, MirÃ¨ne","https://doi.org/10.2196/37746","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: JMIR Formative Research; 6(9), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-21","",39479,""
"Examining the Effectiveness of Web-Based Interventions to Enhance Resilience in Health Care Professionals: Systematic Review","Background: Internationally, the impact of continued exposure to workplace environmental and psychological stressors on health care professionalsâ€™ mental health is associated with increased depression, substance misuse, sleep disorders, and posttraumatic stress. This can lead to staff burnout, poor quality health care, and reduced patient safety outcomes. Strategies to improve the psychological health and well-being of health care staff have been highlighted as a critical priority worldwide. The concept of resilience for health care professionals as a tool for negotiating workplace adversity has gained increasing prominence. Objective: This systematic review aims to examine the effectiveness of web-based interventions to enhance resilience in health care professionals. Methods: We searched the PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Ovid SP databases for relevant records published after 1990 until July 2021. We included studies that focused on internet-delivered interventions aiming at enhancing resilience. Study quality was assessed with the Risk of Bias 2 tool for randomized controlled trial designs and Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tool for other study designs. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews;CRD42021253190). PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines were followed. Results: A total of 8 studies, conducted between 2014 and 2020 and involving 1573 health care workers, were included in the review. In total, 4 randomized controlled trial designs and 4 pre- and postdesign studies were conducted across a range of international settings and health care disciplines. All of these studies aimed to evaluate the impact of web-based interventions on resilience or related symptoms in health care professionals involved in patient-facing care. Interventions included various web-based formats and therapeutic approaches over variable time frames. One randomized controlled trial directly measured resilience, whereas the remaining 3 used proxy measures to measure psychological concepts linked to resilience. Three pretest and posttest studies directly measured resilience, whereas the fourth study used a proxy resilience measure. Owing to the heterogeneity of outcome measures and intervention designs, meta-analysis was not possible, and qualitative data synthesis was undertaken. All studies found that resilience or proxy resilience levels were enhanced in health care workers following the implementation of web-based interventions. The overall risk of bias of all 8 studies was low. Conclusions: The findings indicate that web-based interventions designed to enhance resilience may be effective in clinical practice settings and have the potential to provide support to frontline staff experiencing prolonged workplace stress across a range of health care professional groups. However, the heterogeneity of included studies means that findings should be interpreted with caution;more web-based interventions need rigorous testing to further develop the evidence base.

"The needs of medical professionals in performing their duties during the COVID-19 pandemic: A qualitative research study","Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic situation is a huge global medical and public health issue that has affected people's physical health and mental wellbeing. Under the current circumstances, medical professionals are at risk of stress, anxiety, and subsequent mental health problems. Methods: The present study aimed to explore the needs of medical professionals in terms of promoting their mental health while performing their duties during the COVID-19 pandemic. The purposive sampling method was used to select 43 medical professionals in the following five groups: physicians, dentists, pharmacists, nurses, and medical technicians, who were frontline health workers or had the risk of contracting infection from infected patients in Thai hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic. The data were collected using a semi-structured online interview. The informants were asked to talk about the need for mental health promotion of medical professionals while performing their duties during the COVID-19 pandemic for approximately 60 minutes. Content analysis and a reliability test were conducted according to the qualitative research process. Results: The research results consisted of three main themes: 1) physical safety welfare, composed of COVID-19 prevention and COVID-19 treatment;2) sources of mental support, comprising emotional support and electronic or media support;and 3) support from central professional agencies, including rewards and recognition and occupational protection. Conclusion: The medical professionals in this study suggested that the mental health promotion during the COVID-19 pandemic should cover the physical, mental, and social dimensions. Thus, a mental healthcare approach for medical professionals should be developed by focusing on social support.

"Mi van a maszk mÃ¶gÃ¶tt? A maszkviselÃ©s szociÃ¡lis reprezentÃ¡ciÃ³ja","Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, a preventive and widely mandatory use of face masks was a dominant segment of the infection prevention and control of the epidemic. Covering about 60â€“70% of the facial surface, face masks dramatically affect social interactions - especially emotion recognition, expression and mentalization. Difficulties in communication in the doctor-patient relationship become of paramount importance to the effectiveness of the healing work. This becomes even more critical when the patient suffers from a disorder characterized by a mentalization deficit. In our study, we use the theory of social representations to examine the contents with which mask wearing has become part of our everyday knowledge. Objectives: We aimed to explore the social representations of mask wearing considering its impact on interpersonal communication, in groups where the effectiveness of mutual understanding is critical. Methods: In our study, carried out during the second and third waves of the coronavirus epidemic in Hungary, we gave a free association task to the target word â€žmask-wearing"" in a group of medical doctors, and hospitalized somatic and psychiatric patients and healthy controls (total of 81 subjects, mean age 43.1 [13.83] years), then used the obtained associations to form semantic categories and to map the structure of social representations within the groups using a rank-frequency method. Results: The positive experience of safety and the negative experience of physiological discomfort caused by the facemasks were consistently central to the social representations of mask-wearing in all study groups. Differences were found between groups in terms of more mature elaborative categories, as well as anxiety, aggression, helplessness, damaged dependency needs, and forced conformity. Conclusions: The analysis of the social representations revealed ambivalent meanings of the mask wearing. Although there were significant differences in the structure of mask-related social representations, the mask was recognized as an ""inconvenient but necessary"" health protection measure in most of the groups studied. Based on the results, each group may be at risk in a different way or deal differently with the pandemic based on their specific representations.

"KrÃ³nikus lÃ©gzoszervi betegek Ã©lmÃ©nyvilÃ¡gÃ¡nak vizsgÃ¡lata a COVIDâ€“19-vilÃ¡gjÃ¡rvÃ¡ny idejÃ©n interpretatÃ­v fenomenolÃ³giai analÃ­zissel","Background: During a coronavirus pandemic, respiratory patients may be more vulnerable to mental health problems in addition to their physical vulnerability. Due to the specific nature of their illness, they are more likely to have pre-existing experience of crisis situations, serious existential issues and coping with them. Despite a growing body of literature based on quantitative research, there is still a lack of insight into the subjective experiences of those affected. Aim: Our aims were to explore and deepen our understanding of the experiences of chronic respiratory patients at risk of pandemic COVID-19. Our research questions were: 1. How do the interviewees relate to their underlying respiratory condition? 2. What does it mean to experience vulnerability? 3. How do the initial experiences of the underlying disease affect the experience of vulnerability to pandemic disease? Methods: We used interpretative phenomenological analysis. The study involved 8 participants: 7 women and one man, aged 29â€“60, with one of the following diagnoses: asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis. Results: Three main themes emerged from the analysis of the semi-structured interviews: 1. respiratory illness as a defining experience in everyday life, 2. the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the self and identity organisation, and 3. adaptation to experiencing vulnerability. Breathlessness is the most frightening feature of progressive lung disease, and can be linked to fear and anxiety in different ways. The potentially contagious nature of COVID-19 draws a sharp line between the endangered Self and the dangerous Other, and represents a critical life situation for the satisfaction of social needs and desires. In coping with them, we observe essentially self-defense mechanisms and emotion-focused strategies. Conclusions: The current pandemic is having a widespread and powerful impact on the lives of affected patients. Because of the nature of the coronavirus, which primarily affects the airways, those affected consider themselves to be at risk. Experiencing vulnerability fundamentally determines their lives: their decisions, their connection to the world, organization of identity, coping and their belief in the security of the world. Identifying their experiences and difficulties is of particular importance for the development of strategies to mitigate the psychosocial impact of the epidemic.

"Resilience: Key Factors Associated With Resilience of Older People in Botswana","This study aims to determine key factors that predict resilience in older people. A cross-sectional design and quantitative methods were used for this study. Four districts were selected in Botswana using cluster random sampling. Data on resilience from 378 older adults aged 60 years+ [Mean Age (SD) = 71.1(9.0)] was collected using snowballing technique. Data on socio-demographics, protective and risk factors were also collected from urban and rural areas. CHAID (Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection) analysis was used to predict the strengths of the relationships among resilience and all predictor variables because the data were skewed. Five major predictor variables reached significance to be included in the model: depression, QOL, social impairment, education, and whether participants paid for services or accessed free services, along with high self-esteem (p &lt; .001), security, and self-efficacy (p &lt; .05). The presence of depression symptoms (<U+03C7>2 = 23.7, p = .001, df = 1) and self-esteem (<U+03C7>2 = 39.6, p &lt; .001) had the greatest influence on resilience. Older people with no depression symptoms but had low QOL still had social impairment (<U+03C7>2 = 3.9, p &lt; .05). Older people with no depression symptoms had moderate to high QOL but had low resilience as a result of paying for services (<U+03C7>2 = 7.4, p &lt; .02). Both protective and risk factors had a significant influence on resilience. Knowledge about the predictors of resilience in older people may assist stakeholders devise effective intervention, especially now with COVID-19 ravaging the country. Additionally, policies and programs inclined to assist older people may be established and implemented.","Magen, Mhaka-Mutepfa, Shaibu, Sheila","https://doi.org/10.1177/21582440221127145","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sage Open; 12(3), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-21","",39485,""
"Job Insecurity, Financial Threat, and Mental Health in the COVID-19 Context: The Moderating Role of the Support Network","The aim of this study is two-fold. Firstly, to analyze the relations between the perceptions of job insecurity and financial threat and general mental health during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. And secondly, to identify the potential moderating effect of the support network. We carried out a cross-sectional study on a non-probabilistic sample aimed at a general Chilean adult population to analyze this. The results show that both job insecurity (ÃŸ = -.183;p &lt; .001) and financial threat (ÃŸ = -.309;p &lt; .001) are associated with a decline in general mental health. Likewise, the results indicated a positive relationship between support network and general mental health in the two models analyzed (ÃŸs = 0.322 and 0.182;ps &lt; 0.001 and = 0.012, respectively), as well as a moderating effect of support network on the relationship between job insecurity and decreased general mental health (ÃŸ = .232;p &lt; .001). The theoretical and applied scope of these findings are analyzed, and their challenges and limitations are discussed.","Carlos-MarÃ­a, Alcover, Salgado, Sergio, Nazar, Gabriela, RamÃ­rez-Vielma, RaÃºl, GonzÃ¡lez-Suhr, Carolina","https://doi.org/10.1177/21582440221121048","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sage Open; 12(3), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-21","",39486,""

"The Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Family Well-Being: A Literature Review","Background: COVID-19 has changed family life, including employment status, financial security, the mental health of individual family members, children's education, family well-being, and family resilience. The aim of this study is to analyze the previous studies in relation to family well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A literature review was conducted on PubMed, Medline, Web of Science, and Scopus for studies using a cross-sectional or quasi-experimental design published from their inception to October 15, 2020, using the keywords â€œCOVID-19,â€ â€œpandemic,â€ â€œcoronavirus,â€ â€œfamily,â€ â€œwelfare,â€ â€œwell-being,â€ and â€œresilience.â€ A manual search on Google Scholar was used to find relevant articles based on the eligibility criteria in this study. The presented conceptual framework is based on the family stress model to link the inherent pandemic hardships and the family well-being. Results: The results show that family income loss/economic difficulties, job loss, worsening mental health, and illness were reported in some families during the COVID-19 pandemic. Family life has been influenced since the early stage of the pandemic by the implementation of physical distancing, quarantine, and staying at home to curb the spread of coronavirus. During the pandemic, it is important to maintain family well-being by staying connected with communication, managing conflict, and making quality time within family. Conclusion: The government should take action to mitigate the social, economic, and health impacts of the pandemic on families, especially those who are vulnerable to losing household income. Promoting family resilience through shared beliefs and close relationships within families is needed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"â€˜Feel like going crazyâ€™: Mental health discourses in an online support group for mothers during COVID-19","COVID-19 has become a mental health pandemic. The impact on vulnerable demographic groups has been particularly severe. This paper focuses on women in employment in Hong Kong who have had to balance remote work and online schooling for over 2 years. Using semi-ethnography and theme-oriented discourse analysis, we examine 200 threads that concern membersâ€™ mental health on a popular Facebook support group for mothers. We demonstrate that mental health messages are typically framed as â€˜troubles talkâ€™. Other support group members actively align with a trouble-teller through â€˜caring responsesâ€™, namely expressions of empathy and sympathy. These are realized through assessments of the trouble-tellerâ€™s experience, reports of similar experiences;expressions of compassion and advice-giving. Mental health talk online is heavily mitigated, nevertheless the medium provides a space for expressing mental health troubles and providing informal psychosocial support. We advocate the importance of microanalytic discourse studies for mental health research to get insights into peopleâ€™s lived experiences during the pandemic.

"Longitudinal associations of social support, everyday social interactions, and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic","Main effect models contend that perceived social support benefits mental health in the presence and the absence of stressful events, whereas stress-buffering models contend that perceived social support benefits mental health especially when individuals are facing stressful events. We tested these models of how perceived social support impacts mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic and evaluated whether characteristics of everyday social interactions statistically mediated this association â€“ namely, (a) received support, the visible and deliberate assistance provided by others, and (b) pleasantness, the extent to which an interaction is positive, flows easily, and leads individuals to feel understood and validated. 591 United States adults completed a 3-week ecological momentary assessment protocol sampling characteristics of their everyday social interactions that was used to evaluate between-person average values and within-person daily fluctuations in everyday social interaction characteristics. Global measures of perceived social support and pandemic-related stressors were assessed at baseline. Psychiatric symptoms of depression and anxiety were assessed at baseline, at the end of each day of ecological momentary assessment, and at 3-week follow-up. Consistent with a main effect model, higher baseline perceived social support predicted decreases in psychiatric symptoms at 3-week follow-up (ÃŸ = -.09, p = .001). Contrary to a stress-buffering model, we did not find an interaction of pandemic-stressors Ã— perceived social support. The main effect of perceived social support on mental health was mediated by the pleasantness of everyday social interactions, but not by received support in everyday social interactions. We found evidence for both main effects and stress-buffering effects of within-person fluctuations in interaction pleasantness on daily changes in mental health. Results suggest the importance of everyday social interaction characteristics, especially their pleasantness, in linking perceived social support and mental health.

"Influence of Evidence-Based Nursing on Psychological Status, Neurological Function, and Life Quality of Patients with Acute Poststroke Depression","Objective. This research sets out to elucidate the influence of evidence-based nursing (EBN) on psychological status (PSY), neurological function, and quality of life (QoL) of patients with acute poststroke depression (PSD). Methods. One hundred and fifty stroke patients who received treatment in the Characteristic Medical Center of PLA Rocket Force between December 2019 and December 2021 were enrolled, including 100 cases (Group A) treated with comprehensive EBN and 50 patients (Group B) with routine nursing. Anxiety and depression (Self-Rating Anxiety Scale [SAS] and Self-Rating Depression Scale [SDS] scores), neurological function (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] and Scandinavian Stroke Scale [SSS] scores), QoL (Generic Quality Of Life Inventory-74 [GQOLI-74] score), and complication rate of both groups were evaluated, as well as total effective rate and nursing satisfaction. Results. Group A outperformed Group B with lower scores of NIHSS, SSS, SAS, and SDS and higher GOOLI-74 scores. Besides, lower complication rate and higher total effective rate and nursing satisfaction were determined in Group A. Conclusions. EBN can better improve the PSY of patients with acute PSD, restore their neurological function, and effectively improve their QoL.

"Construction and Analysis of Emotion Recognition and Psychotherapy System of College Students under Convolutional Neural Network and Interactive Technology","This studyâ€™s aim is to effectively establish a psychological intervention and treatment system for college students and discover and correct their psychological problems encountered in a timely manner. From the perspectives of pedagogy and psychology, the college students majoring in physical education are selected as the research objects, and an interactive college student emotion recognition and psychological intervention system is established based on convolutional neural network (CNN). The system takes face recognition as the data source, adopts feature recognition algorithms to effectively classify the different students, and designs a psychological intervention platform based on interactive technology, and it is compared with existing systems and models to further verify its effectiveness. The results show that the deep learning CNN has better ability to recognize student emotions than backpropagation neural network (BPNN) and decision tree (DT) algorithm. The recognition accuracy (ACC) can be as high as 89.32%. Support vector machine (SVM) algorithm is adopted to classify the emotions, and the recognition ACC is increased by 20%. When the systemâ€™s K value is 5 and d value is 8, the ACC of the model can reach 92.35%. The use of this system for psychotherapy has a significant effect, and 45% of the students are very satisfied with the human-computer interaction of the system. This study aims to guess the psychology of students through emotion recognition and reduce human participation based on the human-computer interaction, which can provide a new research idea for college psychotherapy. At present, the mental health problems of college students cannot be ignored;especially every year, there will be news reports of college studentsâ€™ extreme behaviors due to depression and other psychological problems. An interactive college student emotion recognition and psychological intervention system based on convolutional neural network (CNN) is established. This system uses face recognition as the basic support technology and uses feature recognition algorithms to effectively classify different students. An interaction technology-based psychological intervention platform is designed and compared with existing systems and models to further verify the effectiveness of the proposed system. The results show that deep learning has better student emotion recognition ability than backpropagation neural network (BPNN) and decision tree algorithm. The recognition accuracy is up to 89.32%. Support vector machine algorithm is employed to classify emotions, and the recognition acceptability rate increases by 20%. When K is 5 and d is 8, the acceptability rate of the model can reach 92.35%. The effect of this system in psychotherapy is remarkable, and 45% of students are very satisfied with the human-computer interaction of this system. This work aims to speculate studentsâ€™ psychology through emotion recognition, reduce peopleâ€™s participation via human-computer interaction, and provide a new research idea for university psychotherapy.","Chen, Minwei, Liang, Xiaojun, Xu, Yi","https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/5993839","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience : CIN; 2022, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-21","",39492,""

"Antidepressant Effect of Ketamine on Inflammation-Mediated Cytokine Dysregulation in Adults with Treatment-Resistant Depression: Rapid Systematic Review","Background. Major depressive disorder (MDD) and treatment-resistant depression (TRD) represent a global source of societal and health burden. To advise proper management of inflammation-related depression among TRD patients, it is important to identify therapeutic clinical treatments. A key factor is related to proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin- (IL-) 1ÃŸ, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) a which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of depressive symptoms in MDD patients. Ketamine may provide an anti-inflammatory therapeutic strategy by targeting proinflammatory pathways associated with depressive disorders, which may be exacerbated in the ageing population with TRD. Objective. Despite a burgeoning body of literature demonstrating that inflammation is linked to TRD, there is still a lack of comprehensive research on the relationship between proinflammatory biomarkers and ketamineâ€™s antidepressant effect on TRD patients. Method. The Cochrane Library and PubMed/MEDLINE databases were systematically searched from inception up to February 1, 2022, adopting broad inclusion criteria to assess clinical topics related to the impact of ketamine on inflammatory cytokines in TRD patients. The present work is in compliance with the World Health Organization Rapid Review Guide. Results. Five out of the seven studies examined in this review show that ketamine infusion may reduce depressive symptoms with a quick start of effect on TRD patients. Based on the Montgomery-Ã…sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) scores, the overall response rate for ketamine was 56%;that is, 56% of those treated with ketamine had MADRS/HAM-D scores decreased by at least 50%. Conclusions. While the anti-inflammatory effects of ketamine modulate specific proinflammatory cytokines, its rapid antidepressant effect on TRD patients remains inconsistent. However, our study findings can provide a reliable basis for future research on how to improve systemic inflammatory immune disorders and mental health. We suggest that ketamine infusion may be part of a comprehensive treatment approach in TRD patients with elevated levels of depression-specific inflammatory biomarkers.","Sukhram, Shiryn D.; Yilmaz, Grozdena, Gu, Jianying","https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/1061274","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity; 2022, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-21","",39494,""
"Women's Experiences of Symptoms of Suspected or Confirmed COVID-19 Illness During the Pandemic","To explore experiences of symptoms of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 illness among women using the CovidWatcher mobile citizen science app. Convergent parallel mixed-methods design. Twenty-eight self-identified women consented for follow-up after using CovidWatcher. Participants' ages ranged from 18 to 83 years old. We collected data via semistructured, virtual interviews and surveys: the COVID-19 Exposure and Family Impact Survey and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System measures. We used directed content analysis to develop codes, categories, themes, and subthemes from the qualitative data and summarized survey data with descriptive statistics. We derived five themes related to symptom experiences: (a) Physical Symptoms, (b) Mental Health Symptoms, (c) Symptom Intensity, (d) Symptom Burden, and (e) Symptom Trajectories. Subthemes reflected more nuanced experiences of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 disease. For those without COVID-19, anxiety and mental health symptoms were still present. Of those who attested to one of the PROMIS-measured symptoms, all but one had at least mild severity in one of their reported symptoms. This study demonstrates the cross-cutting impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals who identify as women. Future research and clinical practice guidelines should focus on alleviating physical and mental health symptoms related to the ongoing pandemic, regardless of COVID-19 diagnosis. Furthermore, clinicians should consider how patients can use symptom reconciliation apps and tracking systems.","South, Bakken, Koleck, Barcelona, Elhadad, Dreisbach","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nwh.2022.09.005","20221020","COVID-19; CovidWatcher; SARS-CoV-2; anxiety; fatigue; mental health; novel coronavirus; pandemic; symptoms; womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-21","",39495,""
"Have restrictions on human mobility impacted suicide rates during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan?","During the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan, various measures have been implemented to prevent the spread of infection, including restrictions on human mobility. A dynamic fluctuation in the number of suicides has been observed during this period. The question is whether the increase/decrease in suicides during the pandemic is related to changes in human mobility. To answer the same, we estimated incidence rate ratios (IRR) of suicide for changes in human mobility using the relative number of suicides by month from March 2020 to September 2021, based on the same months in 2019 as reference. The IRR of suicide during the pandemic were significantly lower in the months when mobility decreased-in both the previous and current month-than in the months when mobility was stable; the IRR of suicide were statistically higher in the months with increased mobility compared with the stable months. The burden from a decrease in one's mobility, which might lead to an increase in suicide, may not occur immediately, as seen in the delayed effects of unemployment. It may be important to investigate people's mental health and stress levels after pandemic restrictions were relaxed. The findings may help practitioners and families consider the timing of intervention.","Anzai, Kikuchi, Fukui, Ito, Takahashi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2022.114898","20221020","COVID-19, Japan; Human mobility; Restriction; Suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-21","",39496,""
"Machine Learning Techniques to Explore Clinical Presentations of COVID-19 Disease Severity and to Test the Association with Unhealthy Opioid Use (UOU): Retrospective Cross-sectional Cohort Study","The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated health inequities in the United States. People with unhealthy opioid use (UOU) may face disproportionate challenges with COVID-19 precautions, and the pandemic has disrupted access to opioids and UOU treatments. Unhealthy opioid use impairs the immunological, cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, and neurological systems and may increase severity of outcomes for COVID-19. To apply machine learning techniques in order to explore clinical presentations of hospitalized patients with UOU and COVID-19 and to test the association between UOU and COVID-19 disease severity. This retrospective, cross-sectional cohort study was conducted based on data from 4,110 electronic health record patient encounters at an academic health center in Chicago between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2020. Inclusion criteria were unplanned admissions for patients Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years of age; encounters were counted as COVID-19-positive if there was a positive test for COVID-19 or two COVID-19 ICD-10 codes recorded in the encounter. Using a predefined cutoff with optimal sensitivity and specificity to identify UOU, we ran a machine learning UOU classifier on the data for patients with COVID-19 to estimate the subcohort of patients with UOU. Topic modeling was used to explore and compare the clinical presentations documented for two subgroups: encounters with UOU and COVID-19 and those with no-UOU and COVID-19. Mixed effects logistic regression accounted for multiple encounters for some patients and tested the association between UOU and COVID-19 outcome severity. Severity was measured with three utilization metrics: low - unplanned admission, medium - unplanned admission and receiving mechanical ventilation, and high - unplanned admission with in-hospital death. All models controlled for age, sex, race/ethnicity, insurance status, and body mass index (BMI). Topic modeling yielded ten topics per subgroup and highlighted unique comorbidities associated with UOU and COVID-19 (e.g., HIV) and no-UOU and COVID-19 (e.g., diabetes). In regression analysis, each incremental increase in the classifier's predicted probability of UOU was associated with 1.16 higher odds of COVID-19 outcome severity (odds ratio 1.16, 95% CI 1.04-1.29, P=.009). Among patients hospitalized with COVID-19, UOU is an independent risk factor associated with greater outcome severity, including in-hospital death. Social determinants of health and opioid-related overdose are unique comorbidities in the clinical presentation of the UOU patient subgroup. Additional research is needed on the role of COVID-19 therapeutics and inpatient management of acute COVID-19 pneumonia for patients with UOU. Further research is needed to test associations between expanded evidence-based harm reduction strategies for UOU and vaccination rates, hospitalizations, and risks for overdose and death among people with UOU and COVID-19. Machine learning techniques may offer more exhaustive means for cohort discovery and a novel mixed methods approach to population health.","Thompson, Sharma, Smith, Bhalla, Erondu, Hazra, Ilyas, Pachwicewicz, Sheth, Chhabra, Karnik, Afshar","https://doi.org/10.2196/38158","20221020","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-21","",39497,""
"Substance Use From Social Distancing and Isolation By US Nativity During the Time of Covid-19: Cross-Sectional Study","The Covid-19 pandemic had many unprecedented secondary outcomes resulting in various mental health issues leading to substance use coping behaviors. The extent of substance use changes in a US sample by nativity have not been previously described. Our aim was to design an online survey to assess the social distancing and isolation issues exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic to describe substance use as coping behaviors by comparing substance use changes prior to and during the pandemic. A comprehensive 116-item survey to understand the impact of Covid-19 and social distancing on physical and psychosocial mental health and chronic diseases was designed. Approximately 10,000 online surveys were distributed by Qualtrics LLC between 13 May 2021 and 09 January 2022 across the US (i.e., continental US, Hawaii, Alaska, and territories) to adults 18 and older. We oversampled low income and rural adults among non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic/Latino adults, and foreign-born participants. Of the 5,938 surveys returned, 5,413 surveys were used after Qualtrics proprietary expert review fraud detection, and detailed assessments of completion rate and timing to complete the survey. Participant demographics, substance use coping behaviors, and substance use prior to and during the pandemic are described by the overall US resident sample, followed by US born and foreign-born self-report. Substance use included tobacco use, e-cigarettes/vaping, alcohol use, marijuana use, and other illicit substance use. Marginal homogeneity based on Stuart-Maxwell test was used to assess changes in self-reported substance use prior to and during the pandemic. The sample was mostly White (2182/5413, 40.3%), women (3369/5406, 62.3%) that identified as straight/heterosexual (4805/5406, 89.3%), reported making Ã¢â€°Â¥$75,000 (1405/5355, 26.2%) and had vocational/technical training (1746/5404, 32.3%). Significant changes were found in alcohol use self-reports the overall sample. Significant changes were also observed among US born and foreign-born samples. Similarities were observed between US born and foreign-born participants on increased alcohol use from: (1) no alcohol use prior to the pandemic to using alcohol once to several times a month; and (2) once to several times per week to everyday to several times per day. While significant changes were observed from no prior alcohol use to some level of increased use, the inverse was observed as well and more pronounced among foreign-born participants. That is, there was a 5.1% overall change in some level of alcohol use prior to the pandemic to no alcohol use during the pandemic among foreign born, compared to the 4.3% change among US born. To better prepare for the inadvertent effects of public health policies meant to protect individuals, we must understand the mental health burdens that can precipitate into substance use coping mechanisms that not only have a deleterious effect on physical and mental health but exacerbate morbidity and mortality to disease like Covid-19.","Montiel Ishino, Villalobos, Williams","https://doi.org/10.2196/38163","20221020","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-21","",39498,""
"[Factors associated with the development of stress, anxiety and depression in the context of COVID-19 pandemic in Peruvian healthcare facilities]","To describe the sociodemographic characteristics and determine the factors associated with psychological manifestations of depression, anxiety, and stress in healthcare workers in the context of COVID-19 pandemic in health facilities in Peru during the month of May 2020. An analytical cross-sectional study was conducted out in healthcare workers of hospital establishments in Peru. To evaluate the outcome of interest, we administered a structured questionnaire that asked about type of healthcare personnel; sociodemographic characteristics; Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7); Patient Health Questionnaire scale (PHQ-9); and the Revised Stressor Impact scale (IES-R). We used generalized linear Poisson models, with a logarithmic link function and robust variance. Out of 258 respondents, 254 completed the survey; 61.8% were women; the most common work area was emergency department or hospitalization (inpatient) services (62.2%). The median PHQ-9 score was 4 points (IQR: 2-7); for the GAD-7, it was 6 points (IQR: 4-8), and for the IES-R, 16 points (IQR: 8-24). The multivariate analysis showed that being a physician was associated with less anxiety (PR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.62-0.94), whereas living alone was associated with a greater risk of depression (PR: 1.46; 95% CI: 1.11-1.92). Healthcare personnel are at risk of manifesting psychological alterations, mainly associated with the female gender, non-medical personnel and living alone.

"Visit Types in Primary Care with Telehealth Use during COVID-19: Systematic Review","Telehealth was rapidly incorporated into primary care during COVID-19. However, there is limited evidence on which primary care visits had utilised Telehealth. The objective of the study was to conduct a systematic review to assess 1/ what visit types in primary care have been reported with use of Telehealth during COVID-19, 2/ for each visit type identified in primary care, under what circumstances Telehealth is suitable, and 3/ benefits and drawbacks reported using Telehealth in primary care during COVID-19. Systematic review using narrative synthesis. Studies were obtained from four databases (OVID (MEDLINE), CINAHL Complete, PDQ-Evidence, and ProQuest) and grey literature (NSW Health, RACGP, and WHO guidelines). Three independent reviewers screened studies featuring Telehealth use during COVID-19 in primary care. Levels of evidence were assessed according to Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). Critical appraisal was conducted using Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Benefits and drawbacks of Telehealth were assessed according to the National Quality Forum Telehealth Framework. PROSPERO registration: CRD42022312202. PRISMA-compliant: See Appendix 1 for the completed checklist of preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Nineteen studies, predominately cross-sectional surveys/interviews (68%, 13/19), were included. Seven primary care visit types were identified: chronic condition management (89%, 17/19), existing patients (89%, 17/19), medication management (89%, 17/19), new patients (84%, 16/19), mental health/behavioural management (79%, 15/19), post-test results follow-up (74%, 14/19), and post-discharge follow-up (37%, 7/19). Benefits and drawbacks of Telehealth were reported across all visit types, with chronic condition management being one of the visits reporting the greatest use due to a pre-existing patient-provider relationship, established diagnosis, and lack of complex physical examinations. Both patients and clinicians reported benefits of Telehealth, including improved convenience, focused discussions, and continuity of care despite social distancing. Reported drawbacks include technical barriers, impersonal interactions, and semi-established reimbursement models. Telehealth was used for different visit types during COVID-19 in primary care, with a majority for chronic condition management, existing patients, and medication management. Further research is required to validate our findings and explore the long-term impact of hybrid models of care for different visits in primary care.","Ward, Vagholkar, Sakur, Khatri, Lau","https://doi.org/10.2196/40469","20221020","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-21","",39500,""
"Belongingness challenged: Exploring the impact on older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic","The sense of belonging is a fundamental human need. Enacting it through face-to-face social activities was no longer possible during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we investigate how the sense of belonging, and how it is enacted, changed longitudinally amongst older adults in the UK. In addition, we examine the interplay of the sense of belonging and resilience over time. We employed a longitudinal qualitative research design to explore the experiences of older adults during one year of the COVID-19 pandemic (April 2020-April 2021). The analysis was undertaken with constructivist grounded theory. Before the pandemic older adults were free to engage in social relationships with family and friends, often enacted within social activity groups where they felt valued and gained positive experiences. During the pandemic face to face enactment of belongingness was reduced; adjustments needed to be made to maintain the sense of belonging. The experience of older adults was heterogeneous. We examine three themes. First, how belongingness was enacted prior to the pandemic. Examples include: family holidays, visiting each other, sports activities, eating with friends and family, and visiting cultural events. Second, how participants adapted and maintained their social involvement. Examples include: distanced face-to-face activities; and learning new technology. Third, for some, a belongingness gap emerged and persisted. There was an irretrievable loss of family members or friends, the closure of social groups, or withdrawal from groups as priorities changed. As a consequence, of challenged belongingness, participants expressed increased loneliness, anxiety, social isolation, frustration and, feelings of depression. For many, the disrupted sense of belonging no longer fostered resilience, and some previously resilient participants were no longer resilient.","Derrer-Merk, Ferson, Mannis, Bentall, Bennett","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0276561","20221020","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-21","",39501,""
"Prevalence of depression in Uganda: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Depression is one of the most studied mental health disorders, with varying prevalence rates reported across study populations in Uganda. A systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out to determine the pooled prevalence of depression and the prevalence of depression across different study populations in the country. Papers for the review were retrieved from PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, African Journal OnLine, and Google Scholar databases. All included papers were observational studies regarding depression prevalence in Uganda, published before September 2021. The Joanna Briggs Institute Checklist for Prevalence Studies was used to evaluate the risk of bias and quality of the included papers, and depression pooled prevalence was determined using a random-effects meta-analysis. A total of 127 studies comprising 123,859 individuals were identified. Most studies were conducted among individuals living with HIV (n = 43; 33.9%), and the most frequently used instrument for assessing depression was the Depression sub-section of the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (n = 34). The pooled prevalence of depression was 30.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 26.7-34.1, I2 = 99.80, p&lt;0.001). The prevalence of depression was higher during the COVID-19 pandemic than during the pre-pandemic period (48.1% vs. 29.3%, p = 0.021). Refugees had the highest prevalence of depression (67.6%; eight studies), followed by war victims (36.0%; 12 studies), individuals living with HIV (28.2%; 43 studies), postpartum or pregnant mothers (26.9%; seven studies), university students (26.9%; four studies), children and adolescents (23.6%; 10 studies), and caregivers of patients (18.5%; six studies). Significantly high levels of heterogeneity among the studies included. Almost one in three individuals in Uganda has depression, with the refugee population being disproportionately affected.

"Erectile dysfunction after COVID-19 recovery: A follow-up study","Several studies confirm multiple complications after COVID-19 infection, including men's sexual health, which is caused by both physical and psychological factors. However, studies focusing on long-term effects among recovered patients are still lacking. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the erectile function at three months after COVID-19 recovery along with its predicting factors. We enrolled all COVID-19 male patients, who were hospitalized from May to July 2021, and declared to be sexually active within the previous two weeks. Demographic data, mental health status, and erectile function were collected at baseline and prospectively recollected three months after hospital discharge. To determine changes between baseline and the follow-up, a generalized linear mixed effect model (GLMM) was used. Also, logistic regression analysis was used to identify the associating factors of erectile dysfunction (ED) at three months. One hundred fifty-three men with COVID-19 participated. Using GLMM, ED prevalence at three months after recovery was 50.3%, which was significantly lower compared with ED prevalence at baseline (64.7%, P = 0.002). Declination of prevalence of major depression and anxiety disorder was found, but only major depression reached statistical significance (major depression 13.7% vs. 1.4%, P &lt; 0.001, anxiety disorder 5.2% vs. 2.8% P = 0.22). Logistic regression, adjusted for BMI, medical comorbidities, and self-reported normal morning erection, showed a significant association between ED at three months and age above 40 years and diagnosis of major depression with adjusted OR of 2.65, 95% CI 1.17-6.01, P = 0.02 and 8.93, 95% CI 2.28-34.9, P = 0.002, respectively.

The mean age of 3,907 participants was 59.6Ã‚Â±18.6y and 63.8% were female. Mean age and the prevalence of diagnosed DE and shortened tear break-up time decreased from 2019 to 2021. The prevalence of eye fatigue, blurring and photophobia decreased in 2020. The prevalence of diagnosed DE did not increase among first-visit patients during the pandemic compared with 2019, despite many survey results suggesting that DE may have worsened due to frequent masking, increased screen time, mental stress, and depression under quarantine and social infection control. It might be considered however, that many elderly DE patients might have refrained from consulting an ophthalmologist and possibly delayed treatment of DE during the pandemic.","Ayaki, Negishi","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0276435","20221020","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-21","",39504,""
"Experiences of Using the Digital Support Tool MeeToo: Mixed Methods Study","Digital peer support is an increasingly used form of mental health support for young people. However, there is a need for more research on the impact of digital peer support and why it has an impact. The aim of this research is to examine young people's experiences of using a digital peer support tool: MeeToo. After the time of writing, MeeToo has changed their name to Tellmi. MeeToo is an anonymous, fully moderated peer support tool for young people aged 11-25 years. There were two research questions: (1) What impacts did using MeeToo have on young people? (2) Why did using MeeToo have these impacts on young people? A mixed methods study was conducted. It involved secondary analysis of routinely collected feedback questionnaires, which were completed at two time points (T1 and T2) 2-3 months apart. Questionnaires asked about young people's (N=876) experience of using MeeToo, mental health empowerment, and well-being. Primary data were collected from semistructured interviews with 10 young people. Overall, 398 (45.4%) of 876 young people completed the T1 questionnaire, 559 (63.8%) completed the T2 questionnaire, and 81 (9.2%) completed both. Descriptive statistics from the cross-sectional analysis of the questionnaires identified a range of positive impacts of using MeeToo, which included making it easier to talk about difficult things, being part of a supportive community, providing new ways to help oneself, feeling better, and feeling less alone. Subgroup analysis (paired-sample t test) of 58 young females who had completed both T1 and T2 questionnaires showed a small but statistically significant increase in levels of patient activation, one of the subscales of the mental health empowerment scale: time 1 mean=1.83 (95% CI 1.72-1.95), time 2 mean=2.00 (95% CI 1.89-2.11), t<sub>59</sub>=2.15, and P=.04. Anonymity and the MeeToo sense of community were identified from interviews as possible reasons for why using MeeToo had these impacts. Anonymity helped to create a safe space in which users could express their feelings, thoughts, and experiences freely without the fear of being judged by others. The MeeToo sense of community was described as a valuable form of social connectedness, which in turn had a positive impact on young people's mental health and made them feel less isolated and alone. The findings of this research showed a range of positive impacts and possible processes for young people using MeeToo. Future research is needed to examine how these impacts and processes can be sustained.","Ravaccia, Johnson, Morgan, Lereya, Edbrooke-Childs","https://doi.org/10.2196/37424","20221020","COVID-19; mHealth; mental health; peer support; well-being; young people","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-21","",39505,""
"Evaluation of a Web-based Information Platform for Youths on Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic","During the corona pandemic, youths were confronted with substantial challenges and in urgent need of information on how to prevent mental health problems. This experimental pre-post-follow-up study examined the efficacy and reception of an innovative website ( www.corona-und-du.info ) containing evidence-based information for youths on how to overcome psychological distress during the pandemic. 34 youths aged 11-18 years were presented domains of the website in the laboratory. Standardized questionnaires were applied to assess changes in knowledge, the reception of the website, and changes in behavioral intention to seek psychological help.

"The effects of anxiety about their parents getting COVID-19 infection on children's mental health","Although the effects of COVID-19 on children's physical health are relatively less serious, it is known that pandemic has serious effects on children's mental health. Anxiety and related symptoms increase among children during this period. The main purpose of this study is to measure children's anxiety about their parents and themselves with structured scales. Children who applied to the pediatric outpatient clinic were included in the study. Participants were asked questions about their parents' and their own concerns about getting COVID-19. Psychiatric symptoms of the participants were evaluated with the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale, and Anxiety Sensitivity Index for Children. Increased social phobia, separation anxiety, generalized anxiety, total anxiety, total internalizing disorder scores, increased anxiety sensitivity, and increased coronavirus anxiety were detected among children who have increased subjective anxiety for themselves about getting COVID-19. In addition, increased social phobia, depression, separation anxiety, generalized anxiety, total anxiety, total internalizing disorder scores, and anxiety sensitivity were also detected among children who have increased subjective anxiety for their parents about getting COVID-19. In logistic regression, panic, separation anxiety, and generalized anxiety scores significantly predicted children's anxiety for their parents, and separation anxiety and generalized anxiety were shown to predict anxiety for themselves. Children who have increased subjective anxiety about their parents and themselves also have increased anxiety, anxiety sensitivity, and coronavirus anxiety scores. This is the first study which determines that children who are worried about their parents and themselves have higher levels of anxiety, depression symptoms, and anxiety sensitivity. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚Â Although COVID19 pandemic's negative effects on the mental health of children and adolescents has been investigated and consistently demonstrated, the children's anxiety about their parents getting infection were less researched. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢Ã‚Â Children's anxiety about their parents getting SARS-Cov-2 infection was investigated with the questionnaires. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ The scale scores of the children who expressed their anxiety with open-ended questions were statistically significantly higher.","Terin, AÃƒÂ§Ã„Â±kel, YÃ„Â±lmaz, Ã…Å¾enel","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00431-022-04660-z","20221020","Anxiety; COVID-19; Child; Parents; Sensitivity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-21","",39507,""
"AÃŽÂ² Deposits in the Neocortex of Adult and Infant Hypoxic Brains, Including in Cases of COVID-19","The brain of a 58-year-old woman was included as a civilian control in an ongoing autopsy study of military traumatic brain injury (TBI). The woman died due to a polysubstance drug overdose, with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) serving as a contributing factor. Immunohistochemical stains for ÃŽÂ²-amyloid (AÃŽÂ²), routinely performed for the TBI study, revealed numerous, unusual neocortical AÃŽÂ² deposits. We investigated the autopsied brains of 10 additional young patients (&lt;60Ã¢â‚¬â€°years old) who died of COVID-19, and found similar AÃŽÂ² deposits in all, using two different AÃŽÂ² antibodies across three different medical centers. The deposits failed to stain with Thioflavin-S. To investigate whether or not these deposits formed uniquely to COVID-19, we applied AÃŽÂ² immunostains to the autopsied brains of COVID-19-negative adults who died with acute respiratory distress syndrome and infants with severe cardiac anomalies, and also biopsy samples from patients with subacute cerebral infarcts. Cortical AÃŽÂ² deposits were also found in these cases, suggesting a link to hypoxia. The fate of these deposits and their effects on function are unknown, but it is possible that they contribute to the neurocognitive sequelae observed in some COVID-19 patients. Our findings may also have broader implications concerning hypoxia and its role in AÃŽÂ² deposition in the brain.","Priemer, Rhodes, Karlovich, Perl, Goldman","https://doi.org/10.1093/jnen/nlac095","20221020","Acute respiratory distress syndrome; COVID-19; Hypoxia; SARS-CoV-2; ÃŽÂ²-amyloid","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-21","",39508,""
"Randomized Controlled Trials of Digital Mental Health Interventions on Patients with Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder: A Systematic Review","<b><i>Background:</i></b> This systematic review aimed to examine the study protocol of Digital Mental Health Interventions (DMHIs) and to review the effect of DMHIs among patients with Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder (SSD). <b><i>Methods:</i></b> This review followed the guideline of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, and PsycINFO electronic databases to identify randomized clinical trials without any limit on the publication year.

"[The Number of Deliberate Self-Poisoning Suicide Attempts in the First Year of the Covid-19 Epidemic in Budapest and Pest County]","In contrast to most other countries, in Hungary, suicide rates increased significantly in the first year (March to December 2020) of the COVID-19 epidemic. Worldwide, the burden of emergency health care tended to decrease in the first period of the pandemic. The main goal of the present research was to assess how the number of suicidal deliberate self-poisoning has changed in the first two years of the pandemic compared to the trend of the previous years (before March 2020) in the capital of Hungary, Budapest, and in Pest County (population approx. 3 million). In our retrospective cross-sectional study, we analyzed the results of emergency psychiatric evaluations of patients admitted to the PÃƒÂ©terfy Hospital Emergency Department and Clinical Toxicology due to self-intoxication. From the data stored in the hospital's electronic health care system, we recorded two variables: suicidal self-poisoning, that is, suicide attempt, and the gender of the patient. Interrupted time series analysis was used, which relied on negative binomial regression estimates. In addition, the leveling in the trends was examined by changepoint detection. In males, suicide attempts decreased by 16.6% compared to the pre-pandemic period (p&lt;0.001). A similar and significant decrease was observed in females and the overall population. The trend change took place in August 2020 for women and the total population, and in October for men. It is suggested that people who have undergone a non-violent drug self-poisoning suicide attempt are less likely to call for help, such as an ambulance. Alternatively, fewer had attempted suicide because they did not want to be hospitalized. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the change in the examined trend (August and October) coincides with the beginning of the second wave of the epidemic in Hungary.","SzilÃƒÂ¡gyi, BÃƒÂ¡lint, Hajduska-DÃƒÂ©r, BÃƒÂ©rdi","https://www.google.com/search?q=[The+Number+of+Deliberate+Self-Poisoning+Suicide+Attempts+in+the+First+Year+of+the+Covid-19+Epidemic+in+Budapest+and+Pest+County].","20221020","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-21","",39510,""
"Predictors of psychological distress during self-isolation","Global pandemics, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, are predicted to increase in prevalence in the future. Transmission suppression techniques such as social distancing and stay-at-home restrictions have introduced an abundance of additional stressors while simultaneously reducing our capacity to cope with stress, thus increasing the collective burden of the pandemic. Numerous psychosocial factors have been identified to protect against distress in difficult circumstances. However, it is unknown whether these factors will continue to be protective in the pandemic context. The aim of the current study was to determine whether locus of control (LOC), coping style or self-compassion were debilitating or protective factors towards psychological well-being (depression, anxiety, stress and positive and negative affect) during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the current study, Australian adults (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 176) completed a longitudinal online survey (two time points, 2Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks apart) incorporating measures of demographics, locus of control, coping, self-compassion (measured at T1), depression, anxiety, stress and positive and negative affect (measured at T1 and T2) throughout June-August 2020, during the height of lockdown in Australia. Multiple regression analyses suggested that avoidant coping was predictive of increases in stress and negative affect across time points. Additionally, self-compassion was predictive of increased positive affect across time points. These results suggest that the pandemic context represents a unique stressor, demanding a distinctive set of strategies and psychosocial characteristics to cope. Interventions targeted at reducing avoidant coping behaviours and promoting self-compassion may contribute to improvements in psychological well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as future pandemics.","Kent, Kilby","https://doi.org/10.1111/papt.12432","20221020","coping; locus of control; psychological distress; self-compassion; self-isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-21","",39511,""
"The impact of COVID-19 on farmers' mental health: a case study of the UK","In this paper, we use a UK case study to explore how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the mental health (emotional, psychological, social wellbeing) of farmers. We outline the drivers of poor farming mental health, the manifold impacts of the pandemic at a time of policy and environmental change, and identify lessons that can be learned to develop resilience in farming communities against future shocks. We undertook a survey answered by 207 farmers across the UK, focusing on drivers of poor mental health and the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. We also conducted 22 in-depth interviews with individuals in England, Scotland and Wales who provide mental health support to farmers. These explored how and why the COVID-19 pandemic affected the mental health of farmers. These interviews were supplemented by 93 survey responses from a similar group of support providers (UK-wide). We found that the pandemic exacerbated underlying drivers of poor mental health and wellbeing in farming communities. 67% of farmers surveyed reported feeling more stressed, 63% felt more anxious, 38% felt more depressed, and 12% felt more suicidal. The primary drivers of poor mental health identified by farmers during the pandemic were decreased social contact, issues with the general public on private land, and moving online for social events. Support providers also highlighted relationship and financial issues, illness, and government inspections as drivers of poor mental health. Some farmers, conversely, outlined positive impacts of the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic is just one of many potential stressors associated with poor farming mental health and its impacts are likely to be long lasting and delayed. Multiple stressors affecting farmers at the same time can create a tipping point. Therefore, there is a need for long-term support and ongoing evaluation of the drivers of poor mental health in farming families.","Rose, Shortland, Hall, Hurley, Little, Nye, Lobley","https://doi.org/10.1080/1059924X.2022.2137616","20221020","COVID-19; agriculture; farmer; mental health; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-21","",39512,""
"Mental health of autistic adults during the COVID-19 pandemic: The impact of perceived stress, intolerance of uncertainty, and coping style","More and more research shows us that autistic individuals are at risk of experiencing mental health problems in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, little is known about why this is the case. At two timepoints during the pandemic, we asked 149 autistic and 147 non-autistic adults about feelings of anxiety, depression, and stress, and about characteristics that may explain why some (autistic) people have a larger chance of developing anxiety and depression during this pandemic. In our study, autistic adults experienced more anxiety and depression than non-autistic adults. Across autistic and non-autistic individuals, the people who experienced more stress at timepoint 1 experienced more anxiety and depression 4Ã¢â‚¬â€°months later. This was especially the case for those individuals who use maladaptive coping styles, such as denial or venting, and for those who have difficulties dealing with uncertain situations. Our findings show the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of autistic adults. Interventions to support autistic adults during and after the pandemic are needed, and they may want to focus on the negative impact of stress and teach autistic (and non-autistic) adults more adaptive ways to cope with stressful circumstances.","Evers, Gijbels, Maljaars, Rumball, Spain, HappÃƒÂ©, Noens","https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613221119749","20221020","adults; anxiety; autism; coping; depression; intolerance of uncertainty COVID-19 pandemic; perceived stress; questionnaire","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-21","",39513,""

"Mental health issues in parents of children with autism spectrum disorder: A multi-time-point study related to COVID-19 pandemic","Given the unpredictability and challenges brought about by the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, this study aimed to investigate the impact trend of the prolonged pandemic on the mental health of parents of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The 8112 participants included parents of children with ASD and parents of typically developing (TD) children at two sites (Heilongjiang and Fujian province, China). The parents completed a set of self-report questionnaires covering demographic characteristics, influences related to COVID-19, COVID-19 concerns and perceived behaviors, as well as the Connor-Davidson resilience scale (CD-RISC), self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), and self-rating depression scale (SDS) by means of an online survey platform. Data were collected by three cross-sectional surveys carried out in April 2020 (Time 1), October 2020 (Time 2), and October 2021 (Time 3). The results of quantitative and qualitative comparisons showed that: (i) parents of children with ASD had lower levels of resilience, and more symptoms of anxiety and depression than parents of TD children at each time point (all PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05); and (ii) there were significant time-cumulative changes in resilience, anxiety, and depression among all participants (all PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). The logistic regression analyzes after adjusting for demographic characteristics revealed that the following factors were significantly associated with poor resilience and a higher rate of anxiety and depression in parents of children with ASD: time-point, the effect of COVID-19 on children's emotions and parents' emotions, changes in relationships, changes in physical exercise, changes in daily diet during the COVID-19 pandemic, and COVID-19-related psychological distress. In conclusions, the parents did not report improvements in resilience, anxiety, or depression symptoms from Time 1 to Time 2 or 3, indicating that cumulative mental health issues increased when, surprisingly, the COVID-19 restrictions were eased. The psychological harm resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic is far-reaching, especially among parents of children with ASD.","Wang, Zhang, Shang, Liang, Liu, Han, Xia, Zou, Sun","https://doi.org/10.1002/aur.2836","20221020","COVID-19; autism spectrum disorder; mental health; multi-time-point study; parents","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-21","",39515,""
"Narratives of hospital health care professionals during the pandemic in the Northern Philippines: A phenomenological study","Hospital health care professionals (HCPs) play a vital and crucial role in saving the lives of patients afflicted with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). As the incidence of the disease keeps increasing, health care workers in hospitals face difficulties in discharging their duties. This study aimed to describe the lived experiences of HCPs. Particularly, it determined their challenges, motivations and coping strategies to craft grassroots policies for the enhancement of health care delivery in the Northern Philippines. Employing a phenomenological study design, 24 study participants were purposively selected and their narratives were elicited through focus group discussion. Responses were transcribed verbatim. After data analyses, the challenges, coping strategies and motivations of HCPs were identified. Results revealed that HCPs experienced a lot of challenges. Some of these were brought by the rapid changes in their environment as HCPs. Moreover, there was lack of comprehensive strategies that made them unprepared along with a lack of human and material resources. Furthermore, they experienced physical fatigue because of overwhelming workload, anxiety, fear and discrimination that led to depression. Despite these difficulties, they remain resilient because of religious coping, being true to their duty as HCPs and the support they receive from their fellows. Thus, the study recommends that protocols to ensue should centre on adequate pandemic preparedness and capacitation of HCPs.","Capili, Luis, Asuncion, Luyun, Canapi, Rimban","https://doi.org/10.4102/jamba.v14i1.1284","20221020","COVID-19; Philippines; coping strategies; disaster preparedness; hospital health care professionals (HCPs); lived experience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-21","",39516,""

"Using PhotoVoice to understand mindfulness in health care practitioners","The disruptions of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have placed added stress on health care practitioners' (HCPs) mental health. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have been reported to increase the awareness of burnout and promote self-care practices that enhance mental well-being. To gain insight into the use of mindfulness through the lens of PhotoVoice on how HCPs reflected on their stressors and sense of self whilst working as frontline workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study was conducted online with HCPs working in South Africa during the first wave of COVID-19. A four-week MBI intervention was implemented using Zoom. An exploratory qualitative analysis was conducted using a PhotoVoice methodology. Interpretative phenomenological analysis was used to generate themes. Fifty-five HCPs consented to participate in this study. The major themes identified were operating on autopilot, feeling a sense of overwhelm because of COVID-19, using faith to cope and being able to attain a sense of self-compassion by the end of the intervention. Using visual representations, HCPs were able to share the development of their reperceived lived experiences of increased self-compassion as they navigated the dilemmas and disruptions of the pandemic. A brief online MBI was impactful enough to show a reappraisal of the stressors of COVID-19, such that HCPs felt calmer, more competent and more compassionate. PhotoVoice methodology is recommended for future studies and mindfulness courses. It facilitates a deeper understanding of the practice of imbuing mindfulness and its impact on stressors and the self.","Osman, Singaram","https://doi.org/10.4102/hsag.v27i0.1942","20221020","COVID-19; PhotoVoice; health professionals; mindfulness; self-care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-21","",39518,""
"A Case-Control Study of Distinguishing Between Stroke Mimics and True Strokes","This study was conducted with the primary aim to distinguish patients with a true stroke versus a stroke mimic based on clinical features and imaging. We conducted a retrospective case-control study on 116 adult patients who received alteplase (tPA) to treat acute stroke at our hospital. We further analyzed 79 patients with a normal computed tomography angiography (CTA). Based on their magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, they were divided into cases (stroke mimics) and controls (true strokes). Data were collected retrospectively by reviewing individual medical charts on the electronic medical record (EMR), including age, gender, history of stroke, seizure, hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, hyperlipidemia, presenting NIH Stroke Scale/Score, hemorrhagic conversion, history of migraine, history of depression, sidedness of symptoms and aphasia. Data were categorized to separate those who were later diagnosed to be stroke mimics by being-postictal, encephalopathic, in acute migraine, suffered post-stroke recrudescence (PSR) due to metabolic insult, or had conversion disorder when symptoms could not be attributed to any medical condition or mental illness. Of the 79 study subjects, 48 (60%) were stroke mimics. The mean age of the cohort was 68.67 years, and 46.8% of the study subjects were females. Based on the multivariate logistic regression analysis, factors associated with being a stroke mimic were older age, history of migraine, and a history of prior stroke. In conclusion, increased attention to history and clinical examination as the first step can aid in the proper diagnosis of strokes versus stroke mimics. Identifying stroke mimics early could help expedite hospital workup and prevent inadvertent investigations, reducing hospital occupancy during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We could potentially avoid the administration of tPA to such patients, reducing both the cost and adverse effects of it. Every stroke can cause neurological deficits, but every deficit need not be a stroke.","Gogtay, Singh, Varma, Soni, Subedi, Sommer, Abraham, George","https://doi.org/10.55729/2000-9666.1076","20221020","Alteplase; Migraine; NIH Stroke score; Stroke mimics; True stroke","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-21","",39519,""
"Impact of Covid-19 on Medical Students around the Globe","The Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has caused an unexpected disturbance in healthcare systems as well as medical education worldwide. This article aims to provide an overview of the circumstances experienced by medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic. As this disease can cause life-threatening conditions, it has presented challenges to medical educators and students as they must adapt to changes in their medical education to ensure lectures are given safely as well as effectively. Many medical students feel the sudden change in their education system impacted their training negatively; 74% of students surveyed by members of McGill University reported a decrease in the quality of their education since the start of COVID-19. As well as a negative impact on medical education, this pandemic has caused unprecedented psychological stress on numerous people around the world, especially individuals in the medical field. 48% of medical students at a Canadian university reported feeling more depressed since the onset of COVID-19. The sudden changes, isolation, and worries about health have impacted students' mental health drastically. On the other hand, some students have reported that this pandemic has made a positive impact on their mental health as they had more time to focus on their mental well-being and they felt an overall reduction in pressure and stress.

As of January 2022, the region had an estimated 10.4 million cumulative cases and more than 233,000 deaths, which add up to the burden on the fragile healthcare system, which continues to face a shortage of staff and resources. In addition, the progression of the pandemic further threatens the supply of healthcare workers in Africa due to the increased risk of infection and death, where more than 10,000 healthcare workers in 40 countries have been infected with the virus. This is amid low vaccination coverage, with only 27% of healthcare workers in Africa being fully vaccinated against the disease. Despite the delayed start and slow progression of the pandemic in Africa, there are increasing concerns over the challenges on the African healthcare workers such as economic insecurity and stressful working conditions, which are associated with limited access to personal protective equipment and other vital resources such as ventilators. In addition, the pandemic further predisposes African healthcare workers to social stigma, burnout, insomnia, depression, and fear of safety in their families. The aim of this study is to highlight the challenges faced by African healthcare workers, provide recommendations for change, and emphasize the need to prioritize their physical and mental well-being.","Nchasi, Okonji, Jena, Ahmad, Soomro, Kolawole, Nawaz, Essar, Aborode","https://doi.org/10.1002/hsr2.893","20221020","Africa; COVIDÃ¢â‚¬Â19; healthcare workers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-21","",39521,""
"Dynamic changes in mental health status related to the COVID-19 pandemic among health care workers and inpatients in China","Exposure to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can cause severe mental health problems, the dynamics of which remain unclear. This study evaluated the mental status of frontline health care workers (FHWs) and suspected infected patients (SIPs) during different periods of the COVID-19 outbreak. Demographic and psychological data were collected through a cross-sectional survey of 409 participants in a hospital from 20 January to 7 August 2020. COVID-19 outbreaks were divided into three periods owing to the time, place, and scale, including the national outbreak period (a nationwide pandemic period from 20 January to 8 April 2020), sporadic period (a stable period from 9 April to 10 June), and local epidemic period (a local pandemic in Beijing from 11 June to 7 August 2020). Acute psychological disorders (APDs), including symptoms of anxiety and depression, were assessed using the Zung Self-Rating Anxiety/Depression Scale (SAS/SDS). A total of 206 FHWs and 203 SIPs completed the electronic questionnaire. Overall, the prevalence rates of anxiety and depression among SIPs were 3.9 and 19.4%, respectively, while significantly higher prevalence rates (17.7 and 25.1%) were found among FHWs, <i>P</i>-value &lt; 0.05. Psychological status among SIPs did not differ significantly across the three periods. The FHWs were more vulnerable, as their SAS and SDS scores and almost all the dimension scores were significantly higher during the local epidemic period than during the national outbreak and sporadic periods (all <i>P</i>-values &lt; 0.001). The prevalence of anxiety (34.41%) and depression (41.94%) was significantly higher during the local epidemic period (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). Logistic and linear mixed models showed that age, sex, and doctor-patient ratio especially, independently influenced most dimension scores of SAS and SDS among FHWs (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Compared to the COVID-19 epidemic at the national level, the local epidemic had a greater influence on FHWs' mental health. More attention should be given to the workload of FHWs.","Tong, Zhang, Wang, Du, Chang, Cui, Duan","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.956068","20221020","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; healthcare workers; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-21","",39522,""
"Working from home, work-time control and mental health: Results from the Brazilian longitudinal study of adult health (ELSA-Brasil)","This cross-sectional study investigated the association between work-time control (WTC), independently and in combination with hours worked (HW), and four mental health outcomes among 2,318 participants of the Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil) who worked from home during the COVID-19 pandemic. WTC was assessed by the WTC Scale, and mental health outcomes included depression, anxiety, stress (measured by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale, DASS-21), and self-rated mental health. Logistic regression models were used to determine odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Among women, long HW were associated with stress (OR = 1.56; 95% CI = 1.11-2.20) and poor self-rated mental health (OR = 1.64; 95% CI = 1.13-2.38), whereas they were protective against anxiety among men (OR = 0.59; 95% CI = 0.37-0.93). In both sexes, weak WTC was associated with all mental health outcomes. Among women, the long HW/weak WTC combination was associated with all mental health outcomes, and short HW/weak WTC was associated with anxiety and stress. Among men, long HW/strong WTC was protective against depression and stress, while short HW/strong WTC and short HW/weak WTC was associated with all mental health outcomes. In both sexes, weak WTC, independently and in combination with HW, was associated with all mental health outcomes. WTC can improve working conditions, protect against mental distress, and fosterwork-life balance for those who work from home.","Griep, Almeida, Barreto, Brunoni, Duncan, Giatti, Mill, Molina, Moreno, PatrÃƒÂ£o, Schmidt, da Fonseca","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.993317","20221020","COVID-19; mental healthÃ¢â‚¬â€related quality of life; stress; work from home; work-time control","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-21","",39523,""
"The relationship between physical exercise and mobile phone addiction among Chinese college students: Testing mediation and moderation effects","During the COVID-19 pandemic, suspensions of activities and long periods of self-isolation led to a sharp increase in excessive use of mobile phones, which sparked public concern about mobile phone addiction (MPA). In recent years, more and more attention has been paid to physical exercise as a protective effect of MPA. However, more studies are needed to reveal this relationship and the exact mechanisms, based on which this study tested the mediating and moderating roles of self-control, rumination, psychological distress, and loneliness between physical exercise and MPA. In this cross-sectional study, primary data was collected by questionnaire from 1,843 college students (19.75Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.3) from five universities in Sichuan Province in Mainland China. Mobile Phone Addiction Tendency Scale (MPATS), Physical Activity Rating Scale-3 (PARS-3), Self-Control Scale (SCS), Ruminative Response Scale (RRS), Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21), and UCLA Loneliness Scale (UCLA-20) were investigated. The mediating models were examined using SPSS PROCESS macro 3.3 software, in which the mediation variables were self-control, rumination, and psychological distress, and the moderation was loneliness. Gender, major, and grade were included as control variables. Self-control, rumination, and psychological distress played a simple mediating role between physical exercise and MPA. Moreover, not only self-control and rumination but also self-control and psychological distress played the chain mediating roles between physical exercise and MPA. The chain pathways were moderated by loneliness. Specifically, the effect was more substantial among college students with higher loneliness. The conclusions corroborate and clarify that self-control, rumination, and psychological distress mediated the association between physical exercise and MPA, and the mediation effects were moderated <i>via</i> loneliness. This present study advanced our understanding of how and when college students' physical exercise was related to MPA. It also illustrates that educators and parents should pay more attention to college students' physical exercise.","Zeng, Chen, Zhou, Zhang, Chen, Sun","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1000109","20221020","Mobile phone addiction; college students; loneliness; physical exercise; psychological distress; rumination; self-control","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-21","",39524,""
"The impact of teleworking in psychologists during COVID-19: Burnout, depression, anxiety, and stress","The COVID-19 pandemic has forced mental health professionals to adapt quickly. The pandemic has created multiple new tasks for the psychologist. In addition to the various stressors closely linked to the COVID-19 pandemic, psychologists were forced to make their services more flexible. Teleworking was a way of continuing to work. This study aimed to identify the impact of working pattern on the levels of burnout, depression, anxiety, and stress. This was a cross-sectional study based on an online questionnaire applied to eighty-three Portuguese psychologists. Data were collected from May 9 to June 8, 2020, a period comprising the declaration of a national calamity and then state of emergency, and the subsequent ease of lockdown measures. The Copenhagen Burnout Inventory Scale and Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale were used. Univariate multiple linear regression models were estimated for each mental health outcome. Significant differences were found between psychologists working in the workplace and in teleworking at the personal burnout, work-related burnout, client-related burnout, depression, and stress. In multiple linear regression, teleworking, not working, and being unmarried was significantly associated with higher levels of depression. Teleworking was significantly associated with higher stress scores and client-related and work burnout. This exceptional time of sudden, mandatory, and high-intensity teleworking, required rapid adaptation, giving rise to new stressors that might have been responsible for burnout levels in psychologists.","SerrÃƒÂ£o, Rodrigues, Teixeira, Castro, Duarte","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.984691","20221021","COVID-19; burnout; cross-sectional analysis; depression; telework; Humans; COVID-19; Pandemics; Teleworking; Depression; Cross-Sectional Studies; Communicable Disease Control; Burnout, Professional; Anxiety","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-21","",39525,""
"Psychological well-being in times of COVID-19: Associated factors and levels in the general population","The COVID-19 pandemic and living under social distancing restrictions have been hypothesized to impact well-being and mental health in the general population. This study investigated the general Norwegian adult population's well-being after implementing and lifting strict social distancing restrictions. The study was conducted through digital surveys; during the implementation of strict social distancing restrictions in March 2020 (T1) and 3 months later, when the preponderance of strict distancing restrictions was discontinued (T2). Well-being was measured at T2. Four thousand nine hundred twenty-one individuals participated, and a sensitivity analysis was conducted to ensure that the sample reflects the true Norwegian adult population. Hierarchical regression analyses show that contemporaneous employment status and positive metacognitions at T2 were associated with higher well-being. Negative metacognitions and the use of unhelpful coping strategies at T2 had a contemporaneous association with lower mental well-being. Negative metacognitions at T1 were associated with lower well-being scores, while positive metacognitions at T1 were positively associated with higher well-being. An indirect association between social distancing and lower well-being was found through heightened depressive symptoms. These results contribute to understanding how social distancing restrictions relate to general well-being, which may further contribute to designing proper strategies to strengthen mental health and well-being during challenging and unavoidable societal conditions.","Ebling, Ebrahimi, Johnson, Skjerdingstad, Hoffart","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.860863","20221021","COVID-19; mental health; metacognitions; social distancing; well-being; Adult; Humans; COVID-19; Pandemics; Physical Distancing; Mental Health; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-21","",39526,""
"Changes in the utilisation of acute hospital care in Ireland during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020","Reduced and delayed presentations for non-COVID-19 illness during the COVID-19 pandemic have implications for population health and health systems. The aim of this study is to quantify and characterise changes in acute hospital healthcare utilisation in Ireland during the first wave of COVID-19 to inform healthcare system planning and recovery. A retrospective, population-based, observational study was conducted using two national datasets, Patient Experience Time (PET) and Hospital In-Patient Enquiry (HIPE). The study period was 6th January to 5th July 2020. Comparison between time periods pre- and post-onset of the COVID-19 pandemic within 2020 showed there were 81,712 fewer Emergency Department (ED) presentations (-18.8%), 19,692 fewer admissions from ED (-17.4%) and 210,357 fewer non-COVID-19 hospital admissions (-35.0%) than expected based on pre-COVID-19 activity. Reductions were greatest at the peak of population-level restrictions, at extremes of age and for elective admissions. In the period immediately following the first wave, acute hospital healthcare utilisation remained below pre-COVID-19 levels, however, there were increases in emergency alcohol-related admissions (Rate Ratio 1.22, 95% CI 1.03, 1.43, p-value 0.016), admissions with self-harm (Rate Ratio 1.39, 95% CI 1.01, 1.91, p-value 0.043) and mental health admissions (Rate Ratio 1.28, 95% CI 1.03, 1.60, p-value 0.028). While public health implications of delayed and lost care will only become fully apparent over time, recovery planning must begin immediately. In the short-term, backlogs in care need to be managed and population health impacts of COVID-19 and associated restrictions, particularly in relation to mental health and alcohol, need to be addressed through strong public health and health system responses. In the long-term, COVID-19 highlights health system weakness and is an opportunity to progress health system reform to deliver a universal, high-quality, sustainable and resilient health system, capable of meeting population health needs and responding to future pandemics.","Marron, Burke, Kavanagh","https://doi.org/10.12688/hrbopenres.13307.3","20221020","COVID-19; alcohol; health services; health systems; healthcare utilisation; mental health; public health; secondary care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-21","",39527,""

"Double distress: women healthcare providers and moral distress during COVID-19","<b>Background:</b> COVID-19 pandemic has led to heightened moral distress among healthcare providers. Despite evidence of gendered differences in experiences, there is limited feminist analysis of moral distress.<b>Objectives:</b> To identify types of moral distress among women healthcare providers during the COVID-19 pandemic; to explore how feminist political economy might be integrated into the study of moral distress.<b>Research Design:</b> This research draws on interviews and focus groups, the transcripts of which were analyzed using framework analysis.<b>Research Participants and Context:</b> 88 healthcare providers, based in British Columbia Canada, participated virtually.<b>Ethical Considerations:</b> The study received ethical approval from Simon Fraser University.<b>Findings:</b> Healthcare providers experienced moral dilemmas related to ability to provide quality and compassionate care while maintaining COVID-19 protocols. Moral constraints were exacerbated by staffing shortages and lack of access to PPE. Moral conflicts emerged when women tried to engage decision-makers to improve care, and moral uncertainty resulted from lack of clear and consistent information. At home, women experienced moral constraints related to inability to support children's education and wellbeing. Moral conflicts related to lack of flexible work environments and moral dilemmas developed between unpaid care responsibilities and COVID-19 risks. Women healthcare providers resisted moral residue and structural constraints by organizing for better working conditions, childcare, and access to PPE, engaging mental health support and drawing on professional pride.<b>Discussion:</b> COVID-19 has led to new and heightened experiences of moral distress among HCP in response to both paid and unpaid care work. While many of the experiences of moral distress at work were not explicitly gendered, implicit gender norms structured moral events. Women HCP had to take it upon themselves to organize, seek out resources, and resist moral residue.<b>Conclusion:</b> A feminist political economy lens illuminates how women healthcare providers faced and resisted a double layering of moral distress during the pandemic.","Smith, Korzuchowski, Memmott, Oveisi, Tan, Morgan","https://doi.org/10.1177/09697330221114329","20221019","COVID-19; gender; healthcare; mental health; moral distress; women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-21","",39529,""

We aimed to assess the posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression among medical staff 2Ã‚Â years after COVID-19 pandemic in Wuhan, China. We conducted a multicenter study in five general hospitals in Wuhan, China. PTSD was assessed using the PTSD Checklist-5. Depression was measured by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Multivariate adjusted logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association among demographic variables, depressive indicators, and PTSD. In a sample of 1795 medical staff, 295 (16.40%) participants reported PTSD and 329 (18.30%) reported depression. After multivariate adjusted logistic regression analyses, participants involved in COVID-19 clinical work, unsafe working environment, poor doctor-patient relationship, unhealth status, work dissatisfaction, and low family support were at a high risk for PTSD and depression 2Ã‚Â years after the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. Although it has been more than 2Ã‚Â years after the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, the mental health of medical staff remains a concern.

This is an ecological study of 11,435 suicide attempts assisted by CBPMESP calls from January 2017 to December 2021. Three seasonal auto-regressive integrated moving average with exogenous (SARIMAX) models were adjusted considering total population, only men, and only women. The total occurrences of suicide attempts were stationary in the prepandemic period but had an increased growth pattern after the pandemic began. This trend was higher among men, due to (1) lower assistance of suicide attempts during early pandemic than in the prepandemic period and (2) significant increased assistance after the beginning of vaccination against COVID-19, followed by a decrease, but with a tendency to increase, in the long-term pandemic. Our results indicate a growth in the long-term suicide attempts during COVID-19. The beginning of vaccination was not considered significant in the reduction of CBPMESP attendances.

The four major themes that emerged from the emerging codes are the impact of war on mental health, the impact of COVID-19 on mental health, the healthcare system, and the lack of awareness about mental health. These themes reveal how the civil war and COVID-19 contributed to Yemenis' mental health issues and resulting psychological disorders. Yemenis' mental health and well-being are under several threats; thus, the government and other relevant authorities must take urgent measures to lessen the impact of mental illness on society.","Zaid, Fadel, Taresh, Mohammed, Fitriana","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-022-03617-7","20221020","COVID-19; Mental health; Psychological disorders; Psychologists; War; Yemen","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-21","",39535,""
"Decoy Nanozymes Enable Multitarget Blockade of Proinflammatory Cascades for the Treatment of Multi-Drug-Resistant Bacterial Sepsis","Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction characterized by severe systemic inflammatory response to infection. Effective treatment of bacterial sepsis remains a paramount clinical challenge, due to its astonishingly rapid progression and the prevalence of bacterial drug resistance. Here, we present a decoy nanozyme-enabled intervention strategy for multitarget blockade of proinflammatory cascades to treat multi-drug-resistant (MDR) bacterial sepsis. The decoy nanozymes (named MCeC@M<i>ÃŽÂ¦</i>) consist mesoporous silica nanoparticle cores loaded with CeO<sub>2</sub> nanocatalyst and Ce6 photosensitizer and biomimetic shells of macrophage membrane. By acting as macrophage decoys, MCeC@M<i>ÃŽÂ¦</i> allow targeted photodynamic eradication of MDR bacteria and realize simultaneous endotoxin/proinflammatory cytokine neutralization. Meanwhile, MCeC@M<i>ÃŽÂ¦</i> possess intriguing superoxide dismutase and catalase-like activities as well as hydroxyl radical antioxidant capacity and enable catalytic scavenging of multiple reactive oxygen species (ROS). These unique capabilities make MCeC@M<i>ÃŽÂ¦</i> to collaboratively address the issues of bacterial infection, endotoxin/proinflammatory cytokine secretion, and ROS burst, fully cutting off the path of proinflammatory cascades to reverse the progression of bacterial sepsis. <i>In vivo</i> experiments demonstrate that MCeC@M<i>ÃŽÂ¦</i> considerably attenuate systemic hyperinflammation and rapidly rescue organ damage within 1 day to confer higher survival rates (&gt;75%) to mice with progressive MDR <i>Escherichia coli</i> bacteremia. The proposed decoy nanozyme-enabled multitarget collaborative intervention strategy offers a powerful modality for bacterial sepsis management and opens up possibilities for the treatment of cytokine storm in the COVID-19 pandemic and immune-mediated inflammation diseases.","Du, Zhang, Zhou, Wang, Zhang, Zhang, Qu, Li, Liu, Zhao, Tu, Li","https://doi.org/10.34133/2022/9767643","20221020","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-21","",39536,""
"Factor Structure of the 10-item CES-D Scale Among Patients with Persistent COVID-19","The presence of persistent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) might be associated with significant levels of psychological distress that would meet the threshold for clinical relevance. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) version 10 has been widely used in assessing psychological distress among general and clinical populations from different cultural backgrounds. To our knowledge, however, researchers have not yet validated these findings among patients with persistent COVID-19. A cross-sectional validation study was conducted with 100 patients from the EXER-COVID project (69.8% women; mean (Ã‚Â±standard deviation) ages 47.4Ã‚Â±9.5 years). Confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) were performed on the 10-item CES-D to test four model fits: (a) unidimensional model, (b) two-factor correlated model, (c) three-factor correlated model, and (d) second-order factor model. The Diagonal Weighted Least Squares (DWLS) estimator was used, as it is commonly applied to latent variable models with ordered categorical variables. The reliability indices of the CES-D 10 items in patients with persistent COVID-19 were as follows: depressive affect factor ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mml:msub><mml:mi>ÃŽÂ±</mml:mi> <mml:mi>Ord</mml:mi></mml:msub> <mml:mo>=</mml:mo></mml:math> 0.82; <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mml:msub><mml:mi>Ãâ€°</mml:mi> <mml:mrow><mml:mi>u</mml:mi> <mml:mo>-</mml:mo> <mml:mi>cat</mml:mi></mml:mrow> </mml:msub> </mml:math> =0.78), somatic retardation factor ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mml:msub><mml:mi>ÃŽÂ±</mml:mi> <mml:mi>Ord</mml:mi></mml:msub> <mml:mo>=</mml:mo></mml:math> 0.78; <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mml:msub><mml:mi>Ãâ€°</mml:mi> <mml:mrow><mml:mi>u</mml:mi> <mml:mo>-</mml:mo> <mml:mi>cat</mml:mi></mml:mrow> </mml:msub> </mml:math> =0.56), and positive affect factor ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mml:msub><mml:mi>ÃŽÂ±</mml:mi> <mml:mi>Ord</mml:mi></mml:msub> <mml:mo>=</mml:mo></mml:math> 0.56; <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mml:msub><mml:mi>Ãâ€°</mml:mi> <mml:mrow><mml:mi>u</mml:mi> <mml:mo>-</mml:mo> <mml:mi>cat</mml:mi></mml:mrow> </mml:msub> </mml:math> =0.55). The second-order model fit showed good Omega reliability ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mml:msub><mml:mi>Ãâ€°</mml:mi> <mml:mi>ho</mml:mi></mml:msub> <mml:mo>=</mml:mo></mml:math> 0.87). Regarding CFAs, the unidimensional-factor model shows poor goodness of fit, especially residuals analysis [RMSEA= 0.081 (CI95%= 0.040-0.119), SRMR= 0.101]. The two-factor correlated model, three-factor correlated model, and second-order factor model showed an adequate goodness of fit, and the chi-squared difference test ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mml:mo>Ã¢Ë†â€ </mml:mo> <mml:msup><mml:mi>X</mml:mi> <mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup> </mml:math> ) did not show significant differences between goodness of fit for these models ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mml:mo>Ã¢Ë†â€ </mml:mo> <mml:msup><mml:mi>X</mml:mi> <mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup> <mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:mn>4.1128</mml:mn></mml:math> ; p =0.127). Several indices showed a good fit with the three-factor correlated model: GFI=0.974, CFI= 0.990, RNI =0.990 and IFI =0.990, which were all above 0.95, the traditional cut-off establishing adequate fit. On the other hand, RMSEA =0.049 (CI95% = 0.000-0.095), where an RMSEA &lt;0.06 to 0.08 indicates an adequate fit. Item loadings on the factors were statistically significant ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mml:msub><mml:mi>ÃŽÂ»</mml:mi> <mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:msub> <mml:mo>Ã¢â€°Â¥</mml:mo> <mml:mn>0.449</mml:mn></mml:math> ; p's &lt;0.001), indicating that the items loaded correctly on the corresponding factors and relationship between factors ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mml:mi>Ãâ€¢</mml:mi> <mml:mo>Ã¢â€°Â¥</mml:mo> <mml:mn>0.382</mml:mn></mml:math> ; p's Ã¢â€°Â¤0.001 CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide validity and reliability to CES-D 10 items in a persistent COVID-19 Spanish patient sample. The validation and reliability of this short screening tool allows us to increase the chance of obtaining complete data in a particular patient profile with increased fatigue and brain fog that limit patients' capacity to complete questionnaires.

"Mental health outcomes and workplace quality of life among South African pharmacists during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study","The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of healthcare workers is gaining attention globally. This study assessed the quality-of-working life (QoWL) and prevalence of, and risk factors for anxiety, depression and stress among South African pharmacists. An online survey, after stratification by province, was sent to 3435 (targetÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2454) randomly selected pharmacists between 14 April to 18 May 2021. Sociodemographic data were collected and mental health was assessed using the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, Perceived Stress Scale and a modified Work-Related Quality-of-Life tool. Prevalence of anxiety, depression, stress and QoWL was estimated. A multivariate logistic regression analysis identified factors associated with mental health outcomes. A total of 953/2454 pharmacists (38.8%) responded. Of these, 56.5% were 40Ã‚Â years or younger, 78.5% were female, 45.4% were White race and 44.5% were practicing in a community pharmacy setting. Pharmacists demonstrated symptoms of anxiety (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°605, 66.1%), depression (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°561, 62.9%), stress (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°642, 73.8%) and low QoWL (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°409, 51.3%). Significant risk factors (aOR; 95%CI) for anxiety, depression and stress were female gender (1.96;1.36-2.83,1.84;1.27-2.67,1.58;1.05-2.38, history of mental health conditions (2.50; 1.52-4.13, 3.68; 2.19-6.19, 3.34;1.85-6.03) and significant COVID-19 mitigation changes to pharmacy practice (2.70; 1.36-5.38, 4.23; 2.06-8.70, 3.14;1.44-6.82), respectively. Practice changes were also associated with a low QoWL (5.19; 2.40-11.8). Compared to their Black/African colleagues, Indian pharmacists were at higher risk for anxiety (1.82; 1.03-3.23) and stress symptoms (2.28; 1.21-4.32), while risk for depression was significant amongst White pharmacists (1.86; 1.05-3.32). Pharmacists living apart from family were at significant risk for anxiety (1.66; 1.15-2.41), depression (1.52; 1.06-2.18) and low QoWL (1.60; 1.10-2.34). COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant negative impact on the mental health of South African pharmacists. Interventions to support the psychological well-being and improve QoWL of pharmacists are needed.","Dhindayal, Letsoalo, Gengiah","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40545-022-00463-7","20221018","COVID-19; Mental health; Pharmacists; Quality-of-working life; South Africa","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-21","",39538,""
"Characteristics of events in which police responded to overdoses: an examination of incident reports in Rhode Island","Narrow or non-existent Good Samaritan Law protections and harsh drug selling statutes in the USA have been shown to deter bystanders from seeking medical assistance for overdoses. Additionally, little is known about the actions that police take when responding to overdose events. The objectives of this study were to assess the prevalence and correlates of naloxone administration by police, as well as to examine overdose events where arrests were made and those in which the person who overdosed was described as combative. We analyzed incident reports of police responding to an overdose between September 1, 2019, and August 31, 2020 (i.e., 6Ã‚Â months prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic), from a city in Rhode Island. We examined characteristics of incidents, as well as individual characteristics of the person who overdosed. Correlates of police naloxone administration were assessed using Wilcoxon rank sum tests and Fisher's exact tests, and we examined incidents where arrests occurred and incidents in which the person who overdosed was described as combative descriptively. Among the 211 incidents in which police responded to an overdose during the study period, we found that police administered naloxone in approximately 10% of incidents. In most incidents, police were the last group of first responders to arrive on scene (59%), and most often, naloxone was administered by others (65%). Police were significantly more likely to administer naloxone when they were the first professionals to arrive, when naloxone had not been administered by others, and when the overdose occurred in public or in a vehicle. Arrests at overdose events were rarely reported (1%), and people who overdosed were rarely (1%) documented in incident reports as being 'combative.' Considering these findings, ideally, all jurisdictions should have sufficient first responder staffing and resources to ensure a rapid response to overdose events, with police rarely or never dispatched to respond to overdoses. However, until this ideal can be achieved, any available responders should be dispatched concurrently, with police instructed to resume patrol once other professional responders arrive on scene; additionally, warrant searches of persons on scene should be prohibited.","Macmadu, Yolken, Frueh, Toussaint, Newman, Jacka, Collins, Marshall","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12954-022-00698-2","20221020","Arrests; Naloxone; Overdose; Police; Humans; Narcotic Antagonists; Police; Rhode Island; Pandemics; COVID-19; Drug Overdose; Naloxone","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-21","",39539,""
"Social isolation and the brain in the pandemic era","Intense sociality has been a catalyst for human culture and civilization, and our social relationships at a personal level play a pivotal role in our health and well-being. These relationships are, however, sensitive to the time we invest in them. To understand how and why this should be, we first outline the evolutionary background in primate sociality from which our human social world has emerged. We then review defining features of that human sociality, putting forward a framework within which one can understand the consequences of mass social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic, including mental health deterioration, stress, sleep disturbance and substance misuse. We outline recent research on the neural basis of prolonged social isolation, highlighting especially higher-order neural circuits such as the default mode network. Our survey of studies covers the negative effects of prolonged social deprivation and the multifaceted drivers of day-to-day pandemic experiences.","Bzdok, Dunbar","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-022-01453-0","20221020","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-21","",39540,""

"Older Adultsâ€™ Perspectives on Emergency Department Costs during COVID-19","Objectives: COVID-19 has strained the household finances of many Americans already experiencing increasing healthcare expenses. Concerns about the cost of care may deter patients from seeking even urgent care from the emergency department (ED). This study examines predictors of older Americansâ€™ concerns of ED visit costs, and how cost concerns may have influenced their ED use in the early stages of the pandemic. Study Design: This was a cross-sectional survey study using a nationally representative sample of US adults aged 50-80 years (N=2,074) in June 2020. Methods: Multivariate logistic regressions assessed the relationship between sociodemographic, insurance, and health factors with cost concerns for emergency department care. Results: Of the respondents, 80% were concerned (45% very, 35% somewhat) about costs of an ED visit and 18% were not confident in their ability to afford an ED visit. Of the entire sample, 7% had avoided ED care due to cost concerns in the past two years. Of those who may have needed ED care, 22% had avoided care. Predictors of cost-related ED avoidance included: aged 50 to 54 years (4.57 aOR [95%CI 1.44-14.54]), uninsured (2.93 aOR [95%CI 1.35-6.52]), poor-fair mental health (2.82 aOR [95%CI 1.62-4.89]), and income <$30K (2.30 aOR [95%CI 1.19-4.46]). Conclusions: During the early COVID-19 pandemic, most older US adults expressed concerns about the financial impact of ED use. Further research should examine how insurance design could alleviate the perceived financial burden of ED use and prevent cost-related care avoidance, especially for those at higher risk in future pandemic surges.","Rachel E Solnick et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E004D-4FB-B6D","20221020","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Health Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics; covid-19; cost of care; health care costs; emergency department; older adults; uninsured; health insurance; affordability","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-21","",39544,""
