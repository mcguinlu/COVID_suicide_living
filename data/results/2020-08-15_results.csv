"An Observational Study of the Impact of COVID-19 and the Transition to Telehealth on Community Mental Health Center Providers","The COVID-19 pandemic has swiftly and remarkably altered community mental health service delivery and evidence-based practice (EBP) implementation. This study reports provider perspectives on the impact that COVID-19 had on their work and EBP implementation. Providers (<i>n</i> = 93) completed online surveys with quantitative measures and open-ended items targeting their responses and/or reactions to COVID-19, and to the transition to providing services via telehealth. Perceptions of personal risk and rumination around COVID-19 were low, while telehealth was viewed positively by providers. Three major themes emerged regarding the major impacts of COVID-19 on work: 1) the altered nature of interactions between patient/client and provider, 2) changes in provider expectations regarding productivity, and 3) challenges maintaining work-life balance. In regard to the major impacts of COVID-19 on EBP implementation, three themes emerged: 1) increased difficulty delivering certain therapies via telehealth, 2) potential limitations to session confidentiality, and 3) challenge of engaging children in telehealth. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, community mental health providers continued to engage with clients and implement EBPs while navigating a number of changes related to the transition to telehealth. This study highlights the need for further work on what supports providers need to effectively engage with clients and deliver EBPs via telehealth and has implications for how telehealth is sustained or de-implemented in response to COVID-19.","Sklar, Reeder, Carandang, Ehrhart, Aarons","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-48767/v1","20200814","COVID-19; EBP implementation; community mental health; provider perspectives; telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-15","",3881,""
"Association Between Current Physical Activity and Current Perceived Anxiety and Mood in the Initial Phase of COVID-19 Confinement","The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a world pandemic due to COVID-19, and several enacted measures such as compulsory confinement may have collateral consequences on both physical and mental health. We aimed to investigate associations between current physical activity (PA) and current perceived anxiety and mood among a sample of Spanish adults confined due to COVID-19 restrictions of movement. Using an online survey, we collected data on the Spanish adult population regarding health habits during the first days of enacted confinement. A total of 2250 participants (54.8% women) aged 35.3 (SD 13.6) completed the survey, which included questions about sociodemographic characteristics (i.e. age, gender, civil status, education, and occupation), health habits (i.e. prior PA, alcohol consumption, smoking, screen exposure, and sleep hours) and COVID-19 confinement context (i.e. number of isolation days, solitude, and exposure to COVID-19). Physical Activity Vital Sign (PAVS) short form was used to estimate weekly minutes of PA, whereas a single-item question was used to assess both current perceived anxiety and mood. We conducted weighted binomial logistic regressions to check associations between current adherence to WHO guidelines of PA and current perceived anxiety and mood of confined adults. Significant inverse associations between overall adherence to PA and current perceived anxiety in the final adjusted model (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.54-0.79) as well as in several subgroup analyses such as younger women were observed. In addition, a borderline significant inverse association was found between current PA and current perceived worse mood when fully adjusted (OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.68-1.00); this association was significantly stronger in women than men. The results of the present study indicate that current PA adherence to WHO guidelines in the initial phase of COVID-19 confinement associates with both lower current perceived anxiety and lower current perceived worse mood among a sample of Spanish adults.","LÃƒÂ³pez-Bueno, Calatayud, Ezzatvar, CasajÃƒÂºs, Smith, Andersen, LÃƒÂ³pez-SÃƒÂ¡nchez","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00729","20200814","COVID-19; Spain; adults; mental health; physical activity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-15","",3882,""
"What Happened to Patients With Obsessive Compulsive Disorder During the COVID-19 Pandemic? A Multicentre Report From Tertiary Clinics in Northern Italy","After the outbreak of Coronavirus disease was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, this resulted in extraordinary public health measures to control the infection, such as entire countries being placed under quarantine. The psychopathological consequences of the pandemic and quarantine were anticipated to be of particular relevance, especially in patients with psychiatric disorders such as Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Aim of the present report was to describe the impact of COVID-19 pandemics within a sample of Italian patients affected by OCD. Sociodemographic and clinical variables of a sample of 123 OCD outpatients, currently attending three OCD tertiary clinics in Northern Italy, were assessed through telephone and in-person interviews. Patients showing a clinical worsening of OCD represented more than one third of the sample and reported a significant emergence of new obsessions and compulsions phenotypes along with a significant exacerbation of past ones. Moreover, they were more frequently found to experience suicidal ideation, increased Internet checking, sleep disturbances, avoidance behaviors, and work difficulties. A significantly increased need of therapy adjustment and family accommodation was also observed. Further research is warranted to clarify the potential risk and related consequences of the current COVID-19 pandemic on OCD patients.","Benatti, Albert, Maina, Fiorillo, Celebre, Girone, Fineberg, Bramante, Rigardetto, Dell'Osso","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00720","20200814","COVID-19; Internet-checking; avoidance; obsessive compulsive disorder; suicidal ideation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-15","",3883,""
"Evidence for the Effectiveness of Remdesivir (GS-5734), a Nucleoside-Analog Antiviral Drug in the Inhibition of <i>I</i><sub>K(M)</sub> or <i>I</i><sub>K(DR)</sub> and in the Stimulation of <i>I</i><sub>MEP</sub>","Remdesivir (RDV, GS-5734), a broad-spectrum antiviral drug in the class of nucleotide analogs, has been particularly tailored for treatment of coronavirus infections. However, to which extent RDV is able to modify various types of membrane ion currents remains largely uncertain. In this study, we hence intended to explore the possible perturbations of RDV on ionic currents endogenous in pituitary GH<sub>3</sub> cells and Jurkat T-lymphocytes. The whole-cell current recordings of ours disclosed that upon membrane depolarization in GH<sub>3</sub> cells the exposure to RDV concentration-dependently depressed the peak or late components of <i>I</i><sub>K(DR)</sub> elicitation with effective IC<sub>50</sub> values of 10.1 or 2.8 ÃŽÂ¼M, respectively; meanwhile, the value of dissociation constant of RDV-induced blockage of <i>I</i><sub>K(DR)</sub> on the basis of the first-order reaction was yielded to be 3.04 ÃŽÂ¼M. Upon the existence of RDV, the steady-state inactivation curve of <i>I</i><sub>K(DR)</sub> was established in the RDV presence; moreover, the recovery became slowed. However, RDV-induced blockage of <i>I</i><sub>K(DR)</sub> failed to be overcome by further addition of either ÃŽÂ±,ÃŽÂ²-methylene ATP or cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine. The RDV addition also lessened the strength of M-type K<sup>+</sup> current with the IC<sub>50</sub> value of 2.5 ÃŽÂ¼M. The magnitude of voltage hysteresis of <i>I</i><sub>K(M)</sub> elicited by long-lasting triangular ramp pulse was diminished by adding RDV. Membrane electroporation-induced current in response to large hyperpolarization was enhanced, with an EC<sub>50</sub> value of 5.8 ÃŽÂ¼M. Likewise, in Jurkat T-lymphocytes, adding RDV declined <i>I</i><sub>K(DR)</sub> amplitude concomitantly with the raised rate of current inactivation applied by step depolarization. Therefore, in terms of the RDV molecule, there appears to be an unintended activity of the prodrug on ion channels. Its inhibition of both <i>I</i><sub>K(DR)</sub> and <i>I</i><sub>K(M)</sub> occurring in a non-genomic fashion might provide additional but important mechanisms through which <i>in vivo</i> cellular functions are seriously perturbed.","Chang, Liu, Gao, Lee, Lee, Wu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2020.01091","20200814","M-type K+ current; delayed-rectifier K+ current; electroporation-induced current; lymphocyte; pituitary cell; remdesivir (GS-5734); voltage hysteresis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-15","",3884,""

"E-mental health mindfulness-based and skills-based 'CoPE It' intervention to reduce psychological distress in times of COVID-19: study protocol for a bicentre longitudinal study","The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic poses immense challenges for national and international healthcare systems. Especially in times of social isolation and governmental restrictions, mental health should not be neglected. Innovative approaches are required to support psychologically burdened people. The e-mental health intervention 'CoPE It' has been developed to offer manualised and evidence-based psychotherapeutic support adapted to COVID-19-related issues in order to overcome psychological distress. In our study, we aim to assess the efficacy of the e-mental health intervention 'CoPE It' in terms of reducing distress (primary outcome), depression and anxiety symptoms as well as improving self-efficacy, quality of life and mindfulness (secondary outcomes). Furthermore, we want to evaluate the programme's usability, feasibility and participants' satisfaction with 'CoPE It' (tertiary outcome). The e-mental health intervention 'CoPE It' consists of four 30Ã¢â‚¬â€°min modules, conducted every other day, involving psychotherapeutic techniques of mindfulness-based stress reduction and cognitive-behavioural therapy. The widely applied and previously established content has been adapted to the context of the COVID-19 pandemic by experts in psychosomatic medicine and stress prevention. In our longitudinal study, adult participants-with adequate German language and computer skills, and who have provided informed consent-will be recruited via emergency support hotlines in Germany. Flyers will be distributed, and online channels will be used. Participants will complete a baseline assessment (T0), a postintervention assessment (T1) and assessments 1 and 3Ã¢â‚¬â€°months later (T2 and T3, respectively). We will perform repeated measures analysis of covariance, mixed linear models, standard analyses of variance and regression, and correlation coefficients. In case of binary outcome variables, either mixed logistic regression or Ãâ€¡Ã‚Â² tests will be used. The Ethics Committees of the University of Duisburg-Essen (20-9243-BO) and University of TÃƒÂ¼bingen (469/2020BO) approved the study. Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and conference presentations.

"Clinical and CT characteristics of healthcare workers with COVID-19: A single-centered, retrospective study","A large number of healthcare workers have been infected with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). We aimed to investigate their clinical and chest computed tomography (CT) characteristics.The clinical, laboratory test and CT features of 43 medical and hospital staff with confirmed COVID-19 (MP group, 26-70 years old) were retrospectively analyzed, and compared to 43 non-medical related patients (non-MP group, 26-71 years old). Follow-up CT characteristics were analyzed to assess the disease progression in the period of hospitalization.At admission, the main complaints of the MP group, including fever (81.4%), fatigue (48.8%) and cough (41.9%), were similar to the non-MP group. The C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and lactate dehydrogenase levels were higher in the non-MP group than the MP group (17.5Ã¢â‚¬Å Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬Å 22.4Ã¢â‚¬Å mg/L, 20.2Ã¢â‚¬Å Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬Å 23.4Ã¢â‚¬Å mm/H and 219Ã¢â‚¬Å Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬Å 66U/L, respectively, PÃ¢â‚¬Å &lt;Ã¢â‚¬Å .05). Ground-grass opacities, consolidation, interstitial thickening were common CT features of both groups. The severity of opacities on initial CT were less in the MP group (5.3Ã¢â‚¬Å Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬Å 3.9 scores) than in the non-MP group (9.1Ã¢â‚¬Å Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬Å 4.8 scores, PÃ¢â‚¬Å &lt;Ã¢â‚¬Å .05). Before regular treatments, the sum score of the opacities showed weak to moderate correlations with duration, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and lactate dehydrogenase levels (R ranged from 0.341-0.651, PÃ¢â‚¬Å &lt;Ã¢â‚¬Å .05). In the study time window, the duration from illness onset to when the most obvious pulmonary opacities were observed, according to CT findings, were similar in the MP group (13.3Ã¢â‚¬Å Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬Å 6.6 days) and the non-MP group (13.8Ã¢â‚¬Å Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬Å 5.1 days, PÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å .69). Mild to moderate anxiety and depression were observed in both groups.Despite greater knowledge of how to protect themselves than the general population, healthcare workers are also susceptible to COVID-19 infection. Occupational exposure is a very important factor. Healthcare workers have a higher vigilance about the infection in the early stage of the disease.","Xiong, Zhang, Sun, Zhu","https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000021396","20200814","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-15","",3888,""
