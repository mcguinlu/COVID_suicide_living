"ATTEMPT OF POSTHOMICIDAL SUICIDE OF A PATIENT WITH PSYCHOTIC DEPRESSION AFTER HAVING CORONAVIRAL INFECTION (CLINICAL CASE)","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a deterioration in mental health and an increase in suicidal activity among the population. The most vulnerable groups were the elderly and lonely people, patients with mental and somatoneurological diseases, who lost their jobs, relatives and friends, who found themselves in a difficult life situation. The article describes an attempt of post-homicidal suicide of an elderly 69-year-old man who had recovered from a coronavirus infection with a severe depressive episode and psychotic symptoms congruent to affective disorder. He wanted to kill his wife and himself by self-immolation, and only by a happy coincidence of circumstances this was avoided. The development of his depression was facilitated by polysegmental pneumonia with 40% lung damage, acute respiratory distress syndrome and comorbid somatoneurological pathology, fear of death from infection, persistent sleep disturbances, negative media exposure and misconceptions about COVID-19, manifestations of self-stigmatization (stigma), character traits (sensitive features). Pathological conclusions arose in him against the background of a lowered mood, which can be attributed to the holotim (affectogenic) delusion of contempt of those who had had coronavirus infection (he considered himself, along with his wife, ""lepers"", carrying the threat of infection to the people around them and therefore unworthy of life). The combined use of antidepressants and antipsychotics contributed to the complete reduction of psychotic depression with a critical assessment of what happened. The described case of a post-homicidal suicide attempt deserves attention due to the rather rare occurrence of self-immolation as a post-homicidal suicide, planned by an elderly man in a sober state and declared insane by a forensic psychiatric examination. Careful consideration should be given to the mental health of older people who have had COVID -19 and to warn family members of vulnerable individuals who are at potential risk of (post-homicidal) suicide due to their illness and anxiety.","Golenkov, A.

"WHEN BIO and NANO MEET: DEVELOPMENT and PRODUCTION of DIAGNOSTIC TESTS in the FIGHT AGAINST COVID-19","In December 2019, a beta-coronavirus called SARS-Cov 2 emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan, causing an outbreak of unusual and severe bilateral pneumonia. The virus managed to spread rapidly, expanding westward with a high contagion rate, unleashing the most important pandemic of the last hundred years. This generated a collapse not only in health systems but also in international trade, cutting the supply chain of medical supplies. The first official case registered in our country occurred at the beginning of March 2020. Faced with this scenario, our laboratory presented a proposal to the National Executive Power for the development and manufacture of molecular diagnostic tests and columns for RNA purification, two critical inputs necessary to meet the growing demand of the national diagnostic network. Thanks to the financing of the CorporaciÃ³n Andina de Fomento (CAF), we established a public-private consortium between IIB-UNSAM, the UNQ molecular biology laboratory, and the companies Productos Bio-LÃ³gicos SA and Chemtest SA who contributed their human and technical resources, and administrative capacities to carry out the task. The consortium with the collaboration of different dependencies of the National State brought from China the critical supplies for the development and production of 700,000 manual and automated RNA purification kits that were distributed throughout the country. Also, an isothermal amplification method of viral genetic material followed by detection of nucleic acid by lateral flow immunochromatographic assay (NALFIA) was developed. The kit, called ELA-CHEMSTRIP, combines bio and nano components developed and manufactured entirely in the country, allowing the detection of the viral genetic material present in a swab sample with a detection limit, sensitivity, and diagnostic specificity equivalent to RT-PCR but without the need for sophisticated thermal cyclers. This technology made it possible to decentralize the COVID 19 diagnosis and implement it even in rural areas where there was no infrastructure for molecular diagnosis. In this way, we took advantage of a unique historical opportunity that allowed us to articulate actions and capacities of both the public and private sectors, converging on a common goal. The challenge for the future is to expand and consolidate these capacities to generate positive feedback that enables the development of a national biotechnology industry facing the challenges of the 21st century.","Comerci, D.

"The impact of COVID-19 on cyberbullying: A delictual claim for emotional harm?","Bullying as we have known in South Africa and internationally is not a new phenomenon, but as society we have become aware of its harmful effects. In the current challenging times amidst COVID-19, individuals, more especially children are spending more time engaging in online social interaction, as most private schools are resorting to online teaching and learning. This results in a further increase of incidents of online bullying, or 'cyberbullying'. As we are aware from studies, victims of both physical bullying and cyberbullying report a range of forms of psychological harm, such as depression and low self-esteem. Some victims of cyberbullying have even committed suicide. Lunfuno Mavhunga a grade 12 pupil from Nzhele in Limpopo earlier in 2021 committed suicide after a video of her being bullied by her fellow pupils went viral. Delictually victims of cyberbullying have remedies available such as a claim for defamation under the actio iniuriarum. In addition to this remedy the author in the paper seeks to propose that victims of cyberbullying should also explore the additional claim of emotional harm that he or she has suffered by the culpable conduct of the bully.","Khan, F.","https://doi.org/10.17159/2225-7160/2021/v54a33","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: De Jure; 54:565-578, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-19","",27162,""
"Prevalence of Anxiety and its Severity among Different Specialties of Health Care Professionals during COVID-19 Pandemic","Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has adversely affected people's physical and mental health necessitating a comprehensive public and mental health strategy focusing on venerable populations including Health Care Professionals (HCPs). Anxiety is a common mental health problem and untreated anxiety may cause immediate and long-term adverse health effects. Currently the data on the psychological impact of COVID-19 among specialities of HCPs is sparse. Aim: To study the prevalence of anxiety and its severity among different specialties of HCPs during COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional survey was conducted among HCPs from 1st October, 2020 to 20th February, 2021 at Kishori Ram Hospital and Diabetes Care Centre, Bathinda, Punjab, India, during COVID-19 pandemic in India using E-copies and hard copies of anonymously complete voluntary survey proforma. The proforma included socio-demography variables and a validated pretested structured Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) questionnaire distributed physically and by social media platforms to Indian doctors and medical students of &gt;18 years of age from all over India. From all responses received, 2246 were found to be valid responses from HCPs comprising of 1624 from medical specialities, 225 surgical specialities, 101 emergency/critical care specialities and 296 from students/dental speciality. No HCPs other than doctors with valid MBBS/BDS degrees or MBBS/BDS students were included. Valid responses were analysed according to the speciality in relation to prevalence of anxiety, its severity, age and gender. Mann-Whitney Test was used to compare GAD-7 score among different specialty group. Results: About 972 (43.3%) were in 20 to 40 years age group including 655 (67.4%) medical, 42 (4.3%) surgical, 37 (3.8%) emergency/critical care and 238 (24.5%) from students/dental speciality. Male HCP were 1513 and female HCP were 733. Prevalence of anxiety was 79.3% among all HCPs. According to gender groups prevalence of anxiety was 78.1% in males and 81.6% in females. According to age groups the prevalence of anxiety was 81.3% in 20-40 years age group, 81.6% in 41-60 years and 61.5% in &gt;60 years age group. Among specialities prevalence of anxiety was 78% in medical speciality group, 86.7% in surgical speciality group, 92.1% in emergency/critical care group and 76.4% in students/dental speciality group. Results showed maximum mean score in emergency/critical care speciality group and minimum mean score in medical speciality group. Conclusion: High prevalence of anxiety and its severity among HCPs across specialities highlights the adverse mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic underscoring the need for appropriate mental health support with multidisciplinary comprehensive mental health care measures.","Gupta, M.; Gupta, V.

"Health consequences of vitamin D deficiency in the human body","Vitamin D is extremely important for the proper functioning of the body. The most commonly known role of vitamin D is its participation in regulation of calcium-phosphate metabolism and bone mineralization. This role is crucial in the prevention of rickets in children and osteoporosis in the elderly. In recent years, numerous studies have confirmed the pleiotropic effects of vitamin D. Proper vitamin D levels in blood have a positive effect on overall health, thus reducing the risk of many diseases. Vitamin D plays, inter alia, a positive role in some diseases of the gastrointestinal tract (inflammatory bowel disease), nervous system (Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease), and cardiovascular disease (atherosclerosis). Additionally, its positive protective effect in the case of neoplastic and immunological diseases has been noted. Some studies also confirm the relationship of vitamin D deficiency to obesity and depression. In the event of these diseases, it is possible to prevent disease and support the process of treatment by maintaining appropriate levels of 25(OH)D in the blood. Besides, sufficient blood vitamin D levels reduces the risk of developing respiratory tract infections and suppresses cytokine storm, which is responsible for most COVID-19 deaths. The aim of the study was to present the current state of knowledge regarding the role of vitamin D in the human body, especially in the context of the impact of its abnormal level on the development of various diseases.","Glibowski, P.; Ilowiecka, K.; Srodek, K.","https://doi.org/10.2478/ahem-2021-0045","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Postepy Higieny I Medycyny Doswiadczalnej; 75(1):947-958, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-19","",27166,""
"Mental health symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic among cancer survivors who endorse cannabis: Results from the COVID-19 cannabis health study","Background: The use of medical cannabis represents an opportunity to improve access to equitable cancer treatment among minoritized populations who frequently face barriers to traditional palliative care options or mental health treatments. Poor mental health among cancer survivors is of concern as it reduces adherence to cancer survivorship treatment and can reduce overall survival. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of access to palliative care due to the increase of mental health symptoms among cancer survivors. Despite the potential benefits of medicinal cannabis, data describing the use of cannabis to manage mental health symptoms among cancer survivors is limited, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: Our objective was to examine the prevalence of mental health symptoms and the behavioral impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer survivors who endorse cannabis use. Methods: Our participants included adults (=18 years) who self-reported medicinal cannabis use and responded to our internet-based questionnaire (03/21/2020-03/24/2021). Overall, we received 3,594 responses. For this study, data included 158 participants including 79 cancer survivors (2.2%) along with age-matched medicinal cannabis users without a history of cancer (N = 79). Descriptive statistics were used to compare demographic characteristics, prevalence of generalized anxiety (GAD-7), and depression (CES-D-10), changes in behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic, and self-reported coping mechanisms by cancer survivorship status. Results: Overall, 61% and 48% of cancer survivors self-reported to use medicinal cannabis to manage their anxiety and depression, respectively. Additionally, 54% of cancer survivors reported cannabis use to manage their chronic pain. Probable clinical depression (CES-D-10 score = 10) and anxiety (GAD-7 score = 10) were identified in 50.7% and 38.9% of cancer survivors, respectively. Cancer survivors were more likely to report that their anxiety symptoms made it very or extremely difficult to work, take care of things at home, or get along with other people (23.0% vs. 11.8%, p = 0.015) than adults without a history of cancer. Pandemic-related coping mechanisms frequently reported by cancer survivors with anxiety or depression included more sleep (47.5%), practicing meditation/mindfulness (47.5%), physical activity (47.5%), talking to family and friends (42.5%), overeating or stress-eating (25.0%), and using more cannabis (25.0%). Cancer survivors with anxiety and depression reported to be more likely to fear giving COVID-19 to someone else (47.5% vs. 23.1%, p=0.023) and to fear being diagnosed with COVID-19 (77.5% vs. 38.5%, p&lt;0.001) compared to cancer survivors without mental health conditions. Conclusion: Given the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms reported among cancer survivors and their use of cannabis, further research is recommended to evaluate its use as palliative care to improve mental health and quality of life among cancer survivors.","Rodriguez, D.

"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on care delivery and quality of life in lung cancer surgery","The novel coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) disrupted the healthcare delivery landscape with dramatic impacts on cancer patients and family caregivers (FCGs). Many safety measures were implemented to provide services to patients during the pandemic. However, the impact of these measures on the experiences of lung cancer surgery patients, FCGs, and their healthcare team is not well known. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to describe the changes and experiences with surgical care delivery from the patient, FCG, and surgical team perspectives. Methods: This mixed methods study included healthcare professionals, lung cancer surgery patients, and their FCGs from an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center. Data was collected between September 2020 through February 2021 using the Protocol for Responding to and Assessing Patients' Assets, Risks, and Experiences survey (patients and FCGs only). Key informant interviews with patients, FCGs, and surgical team were also conducted. Patients/FCGs were recruited from a randomized efficacy trial of a multimedia self-management intervention in lung cancer surgery. Qualitative data was analyzed using the conventional content analysis approach and demographic descriptive statistics for patients/FCGs were determined through baseline surveys from the randomized trial. Results: Our study participants (n=56) were predominantly English speaking (91%), non-Hispanic White (68%), Asian (14%), and Black (7%) lung cancer surgery patients/FCGs. Most participants achieved more than a high school diploma (77%), 33% were employed full-time, and 50% used Medicare. Providers (n=4) included a nurse practitioner and thoracic surgeons. We identified 5 constructs that were associated with cancer care delivery from perioperative to discharge: 1) increased diagnostic testing-COVID-19 test;2) visitor restrictions increased patients/FCGs mental health distress and decreased provider-FCG shared-decision making;3) communication barriers decreased for patients/FCGs due to use of telehealth resources (i.e., Hope Virtual, WhatsApp, FaceTime) which increased frequency of provider engagement throughout care continuum;4) patients/FCGs concerns and lack of education of COVID-19 risk factors impacted postoperative recovery;and 5) COVD-19 â€œelevatedâ€ the use and need for including telemedicine in standard of care practices. Moreover, patients experienced delays in treatment, isolation, lack of social support, financial hardship, and fear of death from COVID-19. FCGs also experienced psychological distress, financial hardship, fear of contracting COVID-19, and a heightened awareness of public health safety measures. Discussion: The COVID-19 pandemic created challenges to the cancer care delivery landscape for the surgical team and impacted the psychological and financial well-being of lung cancer surgery patients and their FCGs. While the long-term effects of the pandemic is unknown, opportunities to improve patient/FCG quality of life outcomes through targeted mental health/financial toxicity interventions is warranted.","Teteh, D.

"Engaging the American Indian community in North Carolina to assess cancer research and training opportunities","Background: American Indians have significant barriers to cancer prevention and control due to a number of social structural factors. North Carolina has the largest American Indian population east of the Mississippi River with eight tribes and four urban Indian centers, yet there have been few coordinated strategies to address cancer disparities in this population. Engagement with tribal communities is vital in successful implementation of research and outreach activities. Methods: The Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center (WFBCCC) received a supplement to their P30 Cancer Center Support Grant to inform Community Outreach and Engagement initiatives through The Healing Walk project which was designed to determine the most pressing cancer concerns for American Indian communities in North Carolina and identify needs for research training for American Indian students. Feedback was obtained from tribal leaders, educators, and college students through one large and three mini-round table discussions and solicited by email throughout late 2018 and 2019. The final round table occurred two days before the 2020 COVID 19 mitigation mandates. Results: Community interviews produced a wealth of information on the self-reported issues within American Indian populations in North Carolina. Tribal community leaders identified systemic and demographic issues that contribute to health disparities among their people. These issues include: lack of trust in the medical community, structural barriers to care leading to late-stage diagnosis, perceptions related to cancer, high rates of cancer risk factors, including obesity and tobacco use, and historical trauma. Students identified factors which contribute to barriers in pursuing careers in cancer research, including a lack of American Indian mentors, financial barriers, mental health challenges that arise in attending majority institutions, and a lack of culturally competent research training. Conclusions: By relying on the viewpoints of tribal leaders, the WFBCCC can accurately address the needs of the communities and develop cancer prevention and control initiatives that are culturally responsible, such as Tribal Health Ambassadors. In accordance with the majority of the requests both students and educators made, the WFBCCC is creating an undergraduate research program for engaging AI students. Focusing on community identified areas of need, students will develop a research question relative to the health concerns of their tribe. The goal of this research program is two fold. First, to enable tribal communities to accurately assess cancer risk, incidence, and mortality, and with that knowledge reduce the current health disparities in AI populations. Second, to provide American Indian students with the opportunity to not only serve their community, but to give them the tools and experience to help understand and eliminate cancer disparities in their tribal communities.","Bell, R.; Strom, C.; Shore, K.; Hunt, C.; Winkfield, K.","https://doi.org/10.1158/1538-7755.DISP21-PO-069","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers and Prevention; 31(1 SUPPL), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-19","",27169,""
"Flipping the switch to virtual community engagement: Strategies and future directions for online cancer education","History The University of Chicago Comprehensive Cancer Center's HealthyU program started as a health education initiative to reach University of Chicago Medicine employees from across a variety of sections and departments. HealthyU consisted of weekly workshops, called Workshop Wednesdays and pledge cards for cancer screenings. HealthyU programming was only done during awareness months for the â€œscreenableâ€ cancers: breast, cervix, colon, and lung. Attendance at our workshops was sporadic and completed pledge cards usually did not meet programmatic goals. Making the Switch to Virtual Programming Beginning in October 2020, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, we took the HealthyU program online for Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Our breast cancer programming consisted of four educational webinars to encourage breast cancer screening, a digital screening pledge card, and a mammogram toolkit with printable resources to promote mammography. We had 50% more webinar participants and 23% more pledge cards signed virtually than we did in October of 2019 during our in-person programming. The success of our virtual Breast Cancer Awareness Month programming prompted us to expand HealthyU dramatically. Cutting out the logistics of on-campus programming has allowed us to broaden the scope of the HealthyU program in the following ways: 1. The target audience has grown beyond UChicago Medicine employees to include a variety of community partners across greater geographic areas both within and outside of our catchment area. 2. We host webinars on a weekly basis and for a wide range of cancer-related topics. 3. Our physical pledge cards are virtual and have grown to include pledge cards for other cancer screenings and risk-associated behaviors. 4. We created online toolkits to share with our community and UCM partners with information and shareable resources that can be used online or printed and distributed. 5. We have incorporated virtual contests to encourage cancer screening advocacy and awareness. 6. We designed self-guided cancer education modules and an online video library to supplement our programming. 7. We leveraged our social media presence to engage in real-time cancer-focused conversations online. 8. We developed other online webinar series, including documentary short screenings, survivorship storytelling, researcher/survivor summits, and singular webinars on public health topics. Outcomes & Future Directions Through the HealthyU program, we've connected over 100 UCM employees and community partners with 64 different University of Chicago faculty experts and 26 community experts. We plan to use the techniques and outreach strategies learned to expand our reach in other areas, including an online training course for cancer investigators and community members on the principles of community-based participatory research, and a community-scientist virtual summit on Cancer and the Microbiome. We have leveraged the success of this program to secure device donations to expand our outreach to communities with inadequate technology access.","Poulos, A.; Curry, G.","https://doi.org/10.1158/1538-7755.DISP21-PO-062","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers and Prevention; 31(1 SUPPL), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-19","",27170,""
"Development of endurance training program for patient diagnosed with post-COVID syndrome: A case report","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Post-Covid Syndrome is the chronic phase after COVID-19 when a person no longer has a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, however continues to display symptoms. Symptoms include fatigue, post-exertional malaise, cognitive dysfunction, shortness of breath and transient or long-term orthostatic intolerances such as Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS). There is limited evidence on exercise guidelines for Post-Covid Syndrome. The purpose of this case study is to describe the physical therapy (PT) plan of care for patient with Post-Covid Syndrome. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 51-year-old female with diagnosed COVID-19 with a nonremarkable recovery at home. Her past medical history was significant for depression, anxiety and migraines. She was active, engaging in hiking and recreational sports. She developed Post-Covid Syndrome and POTS five months later, with medical testing negative for brain MRI, echocardiogram, EKG, pulmonary function test, and bloodwork. Positive tests indicative of POTS, included the cardiac stress test and active stand test. PT started four months later to address fatigue and muscle weakness. She presented with mild cognitive impairment, impaired cardiovascular endurance and standing balance, left upper and lower extremity weakness. She was unable to walk more than 0.5 miles, required rest breaks during activity of daily living, and was unable to return to work. Based on exercise guidelines by De Wandele et al. for POTS, an exercise program was developed. Vitals (BP, HR, oxygen saturation and BORG Rating of Perceived Exertion) were monitored each session. The program was implemented at a frequency of 2 times/week for 10 visits and 1 time/week at home. The mode of exercise was endurance training using recumbent ergometer at 75% of max HR or Borg RPE of 13-15. Total intervention time was 30 minutes including 10 minutes for warm-up and cool-down. Patient was assessed at evaluation and progress report, 10 visits later with the 6- minute walk test (6MWT) to assess endurance, the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) to assess perceived fatigue severity and its impact on function, subjective activity diary of post-exertional malaise, and the EURO-Quality of Life (EUROQOL-5) to determine overall health. OUTCOMES: The patient completed supervised sessions without adverse reactions. She maintained the target HR and demonstrated improved 6MWT by 87 m, MFIS by 18 points and EUROQOL-5 by 8 points after 10 visits. She also had reduced post-exertional malaise episodes from twice a day to twice a week. DISCUSSION: This cardiovascular endurance training program is correlated with positive improvements in endurance, fatigue severity, and quality of life in a person with PostCovid Syndrome. Post-Covid Syndrome is a developing diagnosis and there is limited data on its clinical course of recovery. Further research is needed to develop specific exercise guidelines for Post-Covid Syndrome.","Omar, Y.

"Physical therapy intervention for an individual with post-COVID symptoms: A case report","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The major symptoms during COVID-19 are acute, but a significant portion of patients now increasingly have long term multisystem sequalae. However, most research is centered around care in the hospital. Research to further inform treatment of patients with post-COVID symptoms is vital. The purpose of this case report is to provide the physical therapist management for a patient with post-COVID symptoms in an outpatient setting. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 50-yearold woman tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 but did not require hospitalization. Ten weeks post COVID, she participated in an outpatient physical therapist evaluation that revealed deficits in exercise capacity, global decrease in strength, impaired breathing pattern, poor pulmonary education, decreased endurance;and mild anxiety with activity. Patient demonstrated some emotional breakdown due to decreased strength and current condition. On initial evaluation, 6-munte walk test distance (6MWD) was 79.5 m (substantially less than age-predicted value), the UCSD Shortness of Breath Questionnaire (SOBQ) score was 72/120 and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) score was 6/27 (mild depression). Spirometry data revealed mild restrictive disease. Patient's goal was to partake in daily activities without shortness of breath and feeling fatigued to allow return to full-time job. The patient participated in biweekly, 60-min sessions (n = 20) and a HEP was provided. These sessions included aerobic training, strengthening exercises, diaphragmatic breathing techniques, and patient education. During the first three treatment sessions, the patient often complained of â€œfogginessâ€ as she approached fatigue. Education on breathing and energy conservation techniques allowed to overcome these symptoms and for compliance with HEP. OUTCOMES: The patient's exercise capacity, physical function, muscle strength improved following the 20 sessions. At discharge, the 6-Minute walk distance improved to 335 m (324%). Scores on SOBQ improved beyond the MID to 34/120;and PHQ-9 to 1/27 (minimal depression). At discharge, patient could perform household tasks without fatigue, allowing her to eventually return to work safely. DISCUSSION: Following 20 sessions of outpatient physical therapy, our patient with post-COVID symptoms showed substantial improvements in exercise capacity, SOBQ and PHQ-9. This case report highlights the importance of addressing fatigue and anxiety related to physical symptoms in the plan of care for patients with post-COVID symptoms. Further research is needed to define the ideal interventions to manage this condition. While the treatment of patients post-COVID symptoms presents significant challenges, this report provides some insight in designing physical therapy interventions in the outpatient setting for this population.","Pathare, N.; MacPhail, D.

"Recommendations on the follow-up of patients with Gaucher disease in Spain: Results from a Delphi survey","Management of Gaucher disease (GD) is challenging because of its wide genotypic and phenotypic variability. In addition, the appearance of effective therapies for GD1 (enzyme replacement therapy, ERT and later substrate reduction therapy, SRT) has shifted the paradigm of care, and recommendations for GD management should now include strategies for patients without treatment, long-term treated patients, reproductive health, and transition of care from children to adults. Here we present the results of a Delphi survey on the follow-up of GD patients in specific clinical situations in Spain. Sixteen face-to-face meetings with experts were held to discuss daily clinical practice and to identify controversies regarding the management of GD. With this information, a questionnaire with 93 recommendations for different clinical scenarios was designed, and a Delphi survey among 86 physicians with experience in GD patient care was conducted. Results show consensus in 73 out of the 93 items. Recommendations on follow-up of adult and pediatric patients were in line with current guidelines, and underscored the importance of a patient-tailored approach. For the follow-up of stable patients receiving long-term treatment, consensus was reached on the importance of multidisciplinary team collaborating with the expert physician in GD, and specialists with GD knowledge (nurses, primary care, specialized radiologists, etc.), when required. Consensus was reached on the frequency of follow-up depending on the disease evolution time, whether or not patients received treatment, clinical disease stability, and specific recommendations for pregnant patients were also stated. Experts stressed on the importance of asking about symptoms reflecting quality of life such as pain, use of analgesics, antidepressants, etc. Lastly, recommendations on how to adapt GD management during a COVID-19 pandemic were collected. This expert consensus will help decision-making during the management of GD in specific clinical scenarios.","Giraldo, P.; Andrade-Campos, M.; Morales, M.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymgme.2021.11.109","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Molecular Genetics and Metabolism; 135(2):S46, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-19","",27174,""
"Burnout across boundaries: Can parental burnout directly or indirectly influence work outcomes?","Burnout, while historically considered a work-related condition, can be associated with parenting where it can have direct impacts upon parental outcomes and oneâ€™s personal resources such as mental health. However, little is known about the domain-incongruent effects of burnout and thus whether parental burnout can manifest within the workplace. The current study uses longitudinal data collected from 499 parents over three intervals across an 8-month period to explore two possible mechanisms. Firstly, a direct relationship is explored by considering whether parental burnout provides incremental validity above job burnout in the prediction of three work outcomes: job satisfaction, turnover intentions, and counterproductive work behaviors. Secondly, it is explored whether depression mediates the relationship between parental burnout and work outcomes. Findings suggest parental burnout may have limited impacts upon work outcomes, providing the impetus for a new direction of research to better understand whether or how burnout in one domain of life can influence the outcomes in other life domains.

"MATRICIDE DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC: AN UNUSUAL CASE OF FAMILY VIOLENCE","The need to limit the spread of the virus in the population has forced many countries to impose strict measures of social distancing and home isolation. These measures, although necessary, have caused unprecedented social disruption. One of the most worrying effects of this social crisis is the increase in episodes of family violence which can be extremely serious up to the killing of family members. Matricide is a fairly rare event worldwide. Many authors have over time attempted to figure out the origins of a pathological condition-but not limited to-underlying such crimes often executed through particularly brutal criminal acts against the victims. In this study we present a case of a 66-year-old woman who was killed with multiple stab wounds from a diving knife and then burned. It was determined that the victim was murdered by her 36-year-old son, unemployed for about a year and with a history of alcohol abuse, had a suspected diagnosis of bipolar disorder in treatment with antidepressant drugs. On the victimâ€™s body there were 31 stab wounds, localized mostly to the skull, face and thorax. Some of the typical characteristics highlighted in the literature regarding individuals who commit matricide are actually found in this case. This correspondence underscores the need to recognize and, in some cases, prevent the possible occurrence of such an eventuality within a family.","Treglia, M.; Pallocci, M.; Passalacqua, P.; De Luca, L.; Marsella, L.

"Examining anxiety and stress regarding virtual learning in colleges of health sciences: A Cross-Sectional Study in the Era of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Saudi Arabia","Background Stress and anxiety are relatively common, particularly in females and college students. Stress can impact studentsâ€™ overall performance and their physical and mental health. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected all aspects of life and is associated with high levels of psychological distress. It has considerably affected the education sector, not only locally but worldwide, forcing a shift in the education system from on-site to virtual learning. This cross-sectional study was undertaken to evaluate the prevalence of anxiety and stress regarding virtual learning among health sciences college students in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) after introducing blended virtual classes and exams and in-person laboratory training. The study was carried six months after the COVID-19 outbreak. Methodology Participants were recruited by convenient sampling and snowballing strategies. Our study was conducted between November 18 and December 6, 2020. Questionnaires were employed;they included the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale and focused on the participantsâ€™ attitudes toward virtual learning. The present research was validated by a pilot study, followed by implementing some amendments. Results A total of 418 health sciences college students, aged 18-27 (M = 20.88, SD = 1.97), participated in the study. Our analysis indicated that more than half the sample (51.44%) reported a risk of moderate to severe GAD. Anxiety was recognized more frequently in women (72.09%) than in men (27.91%). Interestingly, our <U+03A7>2 analysis revealed an association between marital status and anxiety, with a higher risk of GAD found in single people (compared with married). In addition, we found that the risk of anxiety increased in junior students (1st-3rd year) compared to senior students (4th-6th year). Conclusion Our study highlights the need to establish gender-based tailored mental health support systems that provide preventive measures. The study findings also recommend that institutions develop programs and platforms that safely support students to interact and seek guidance, particularly those at higher risk of stress, such as females and first-year students. Overall, our study underlines the need to pursue an understanding of the complicated nature of anxiety disorders..","Alshammari, Tahani, Alseraye, Sarah, Alqasim, Rawabi, Rogowska, Aleksandra, Alrasheed, Nouf, Alshammari, Musaad","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsps.2022.01.010","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Saudi Pharmaceutical Journal;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-19","",27178,""
"A Decade of Post-Intensive Care Syndrome: A Bibliometric Network Analysis","Background and Objectives: In 2012, the umbrella term post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) was introduced to capture functional long-term impairments of survivors of critical illness. We present a bibliometric network analysis of the PICS research field. Materials and Methods: The Web of Science core database was searched for articles published in 2012 or later using 'post-intensive care syndrome&rsquo;and variant spellings. Using VOSviewer, we computed co-authorship networks of countries, institutions, and authors, as well as keyword co-occurrence networks. We determined each country&rsquo;s relative research effort and Category Normalized Citation Index over time and analyzed the 100 most-cited articles with respect to article type, country of origin, and publishing journal. Results: Our search yielded 379 articles, of which 373 were analyzed. Annual PICS research output increased from 11 (2012) to 95 articles (2020). Most PICS research originates from the US, followed by England, Australia, the Netherlands, and Germany. We found various collaborations between countries, institutions, and authors, with recent collaborative networks of English and Australian institutions. Article keywords cover aspects of cognitive, mental health, and physical impairments, and more recently, COVID-19. Only a few keywords and articles pertained to PICS prevention and treatment. Conclusions: Our analysis of Web of Science-indexed PICS articles highlights the stark increase in PICS research output in recent years, primarily originating from US- and Europe-based authors and institutions. Despite the research field&rsquo;s growth, knowledge gaps with respect to PICS prevention and treatment remain.","Paul, Nicolas, Albrecht, Valentina, Denke, Claudia, Spies, Claudia D.; Krampe, Henning, Weiss, BjÃ¶rn","https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina58020170","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Medicina; 58(2):170, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-19","",27179,""
"A follow-up study on treatment effects of cognitive-behavioral therapy on social anxiety disorder: Impact of COVID-19 fear during post-lockdown period","There is a paucity of research on the role of COVID-19 related fear and lockdown on social anxiety disorder (SAD). In a follow-up study during post-lockdown period, we compared social anxiety of individuals with SAD who received cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) versus psychoeducational-supportive therapy (PST) before the COVID-19 pandemic, and the impact of COVID-19 related fear. Social anxiety severity was rated by the Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN) at pre-intervention, post-intervention, and post-lockdown periods. Fear of COVID-19 was assessed during the post-lockdown period. The treatment effects in the CBT group (nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯33) were significantly better than the PST group (nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯32) at post-intervention; this was maintained at 14-months following intervention despite COVID-related lockdown. In the PST group, there was no change following the intervention; and the social phobia increased after lockdown. The CBT group had significantly less COVID-19 related fear than the PST group. Social anxiety was positively correlated with fear of COVID-19; and individuals with comorbidities had significantly more fear. Using the hierarchical multiple regression, SPIN post-intervention, COVID-19 fear, and duration of SAD predicted social anxiety severity during the post-lockdown period. In conclusion, the effect of CBT for SAD was maintained through lockdown and was associated with significantly less COVID-19 related fear.","Samantaray, Kar, Mishra","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2022.114439","20220218","COVID-19; Cognitive behavioral therapy; Comorbidity; Mental health; Social distancing; Social phobia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-19","",27180,""
"How parents of children with autism spectrum disorder experience the COVID-19 pandemic: Perspectives and insights on the new normal","Considering the fact that family members necessarily spend more time together during the pandemic, this study aims to reveal the perceptions of parents with children who have autism spectrum disorder of the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey and their experiences of the difficulties during the pandemic. A qualitative phenomenology design was used in the study. Seven mothers and one father gave their consent and participated in the study. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and analyzed using content analysis. The results of the analysis were collected in two broad themes using 68 codes. The perspective of the parents, who evaluated the pandemic process positively in the beginning, became negative as lockdown lengthened. The issues and adverse effects of the pandemic that they most talked about were the increasing roles and responsibilities of parents, the deep impact on their mental health, and the problems experienced in distance education. During this period, parents who were psychologically depressed wanted to feel that they were not alone. Parents made many suggestions and recommendations so that others would not have the same experience.","Bozkus-Genc, Sani-Bozkurt","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ridd.2022.104200","20220218","Autism spectrum disorder; COVID-19 pandemic; Coronavirus outbreak; Learners with special needs; Parenting","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-19","",27181,""
"Investigating the Impact of Covid-19 on Telepsychiatry Use Across Sex and Race: A Study of North Carolina Emergency Departments","<b><i>Introduction:</i></b> <i>The COVID-19 pandemic and the intervention measures have increased mental health problems among Americans. Telepsychiatry provides a safe and efficient way to serve mental health patients in emergency departments (EDs). The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on telepsychiatry consultations in North Carolina (NC) and analyze the differences across sex and race.</i> <b><i>Methods:</i></b> <i>This longitudinal observational study used data from the NC Statewide Telepsychiatry Program to examine temporal changes in ED telepsychiatry consultations from January 2019 to March 2021 (117 weeks), including 4,739 telepsychiatry consultations conducted by 27 hospitals in 24 counties in NC during the period. The outcome measures were telepsychiatry consultation counts. Weekly ED telepsychiatry consultation counts were calculated overall and stratified by sex and race.</i> <b><i>Results:</i></b> <i>The overall weekly ED telepsychiatry consultation counts were decreasing before the national lockdown but started increase after the lockdown. Moreover, the counts of telepsychiatry consultations for white patients had a stronger increasing trend than that for black patients. Comparing telepsychiatry counts during the lockdown period (March and April) in 2020 and the same period in 2019, male patients had higher counts while female patients had lower counts, and white patients had higher counts while black patients had lower counts.</i> <b><i>Discussion:</i></b> <i>It seems that the COVID-19 crisis has led to a heightening demand for telepsychiatry consultations in NC, and there is a possible race disparity in these demands between black and white mental health patients. These findings underscore the need to further develop telepsychiatry services and enhance access to black patients.</i>","Xue, Saeed, Liang, Jones, Muppavarapu","https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2021.0549","20220218","COVID; e-Health; global health; telemedicine; telepsychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-19","",27182,""
"Augmented T cell mitochondrial reactive oxygen species in adults with major depressive disorder","The prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) is highest in young adulthood, an effect that has been magnified by the COVID-19 pandemic. Importantly, individuals with MDD are at a greater risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD). Accumulating evidence supports immune system dysregulation as a major contributor to the elevated CVD risk in older adults with MDD; however, whether this is present in young adults with MDD without comorbid disease remains unclear. Interestingly, recent data suggest augmented T cell mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (T cell mitoROS) as a potent driver of immune dysregulation in animal models of psychiatric disease. With this background in mind, we tested the hypothesis that young adults with MDD would have augmented T cell mitoROS and circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines compared to healthy young adults without MDD (HA)lood was drawn from 14 young adults with MDD (age: 23Ã‚Â±2 years) and 11 HA (age: 22Ã‚Â±1 years). T cell mitoROS (MitoSOX{trade mark, serif} red; total: CD3+, T-helper: CD4+, T cytotoxic: CD8+) and serum cytokines were assessed by flow cytometry. Total T cell mitoROS was significantly greater in adults with MDD compared to HA (median: 14089 au.; median: 1362 au., P=0.01). Likewise, both T helper and T cytotoxic cell mitoROS were significantly greater in adults with MDD compared to HA (both: P&lt;0.05). There were no differences in circulating cytokines between groups (all cytokines: P&gt;0.05). Collectively, these findings suggest that elevated T cell mitoROS may represent an early marker of immune system dysregulation in young, otherwise healthy, adults with MDD.","Grotle, Darling, Saunders, Fadel, Trott, Greaney","https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpheart.00019.2022","20220218","Inflammation; Neural-immune regulation; cytokines; depression; immune system dysregulation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-19","",27183,""
"Association of COVID-19 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome With Symptoms of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder in Family Members After ICU Discharge","Persistent physical and mental disorders are frequent in survivors of COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, data on these disorders among family members are scarce. To determine the association between patient hospitalization for COVID-19 ARDS vs ARDS from other causes and the risk of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-related symptoms in family members. Prospective cohort study in 23 intensive care units (ICUs) in France (January 2020 to June 2020 with final follow-up ending in October 2020). ARDS survivors and family members (1 family member per patient) were enrolled. Family members of patients hospitalized for ARDS due to COVID-19 vs ARDS due to other causes. The primary outcome was family member symptoms of PTSD at 90 days after ICU discharge, measured by the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (score range, 0 [best] to 88 [worst]; presence of PTSD symptoms defined by score &gt;22). Secondary outcomes were family member symptoms of anxiety and depression at 90 days assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (score range, 0 [best] to 42 [worst]; presence of anxiety or depression symptoms defined by subscale scores Ã¢â€°Â¥7). Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine the association between COVID-19 status and outcomes. Among 602 family members and 307 patients prospectively enrolled, 517 (86%) family members (median [IQR] age, 51 [40-63] years; 72% women; 48% spouses; 26% bereaved because of the study patient's death; 303 [50%] family members of COVID-19 patients) and 273 (89%) patients (median [IQR] age, 61 [50-69] years; 34% women; 181 [59%] with COVID-19) completed the day-90 assessment. Compared with non-COVID-19 ARDS, family members of patients with COVID-19 ARDS had a significantly higher prevalence of symptoms of PTSD (35% [103/293] vs 19% [40/211]; difference, 16% [95% CI, 8%-24%]; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), symptoms of anxiety (41% [121/294] vs 34% [70/207]; difference, 8% [95% CI, 0%-16%]; P=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05), and symptoms of depression (31% [91/291] vs 18% [37/209]; difference, 13% [95% CI, 6%-21%]; P&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). In multivariable models adjusting for age, sex, and level of social support, COVID-19 ARDS was significantly associated with increased risk of PTSD-related symptoms in family members (odds ratio, 2.05 [95% CI, 1.30 to 3.23]). Among family members of patients hospitalized in the ICU with ARDS, COVID-19 disease, as compared with other causes of ARDS, was significantly associated with increased risk of symptoms of PTSD at 90 days after ICU discharge.

"Use of Live Community Events on Facebook to Share Health and Clinical Research Information With a Minnesota Statewide Community: Exploratory Study","Community engagement can make a substantial difference in health outcomes and strengthen the capacity to deal with disruptive public health events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Social media platforms such as Facebook are a promising avenue to reach the broader public and enhance access to clinical and translational science, and require further evaluation from the scientific community. This study aims to describe the use of live community events to enhance communication about clinical and health research through a Facebook platform case study (Minnesota [MN] Research Link) with a Minnesota statewide community. We examined variables associated with video engagement including video length and type of posting. From June 2019 to February 2021, MN Research Link streamed 38 live community events on its public Facebook page, MN Research Link. Live community events highlighted different investigators' clinical and health research in the areas of mental health, health and wellness, chronic diseases, and immunology/infectious diseases. Facebook analytics were used to determine the number of views, total minutes viewed, engagement metrics, and audience retention. An engagement rate was calculated by the total number of interactions (likes, shares, and comments) divided by the total length of the live event by the type of live community event. The 38 live community events averaged 23 minutes and 1 second in duration. The total time viewed for all 38 videos was 10 hours, 44 minutes, and 40 seconds. Viewers' watch time averaged 23 seconds of content per video. After adjusting for video length, promotional videos and research presentations had the highest engagement and retention rates. Events that included audience participation did not have higher retention rates compared to events without audience participation.

"Preparing for the future of medical education: A case series of traditional and virtual clinical rotations in addiction medicine spanning the COVID pandemic","<i>Background:</i> Substance use accounts for more than 400,000 deaths annually in the United States and overdose rates surged during the COVID pandemic. While the pandemic created increased pressure for better prepared providers, it simultaneously placed restrictions on medical training programs. The purpose of this educational case series is to assess the feasibility of a virtual addiction medicine training program and conduct a qualitative evaluation of medical student attitudes toward caring for people with substance use disorders, both before and after their addiction medicine training experience. <i>Methods</i><i>:</i> We conducted a qualitative analysis related to course content focused on strengths and limitations of in-person and virtual training modalities. Individual quotes were evaluated and content themes were developed after a thorough review of all codes and detailed examination of interviewee quotes. <i>Results:</i> The primary themes that emerged were (1) Addiction medicine content is important to improve care of patients with substance disorders and is not fully addressed in undergraduate medical education (2) In-person and virtual training contain unique strengths and weaknesses and (3) Students perceived that both experiences provided positive and needed training in addiction medicine that shifted perspective and enhanced confidence to practice. <i>Conclusions:</i> Remote training via virtual lectures and patient visits may enhance training opportunities for students with limited exposure to addiction medicine patients and faculty with addiction medicine expertise. There is a need to further refine virtual care for patients with SUDs and virtual training to meet the needs of patients and learners across the country.","Bone, Wendel, Leong, Snyder, Costigan, Bowen, Sell, Kawasaki, Giampetro, Dissinger, Milchak, Reedy-Cooper, Stuckey","https://doi.org/10.1080/08897077.2022.2028702","20220218","Addiction medicine; Coronavirus pandemic; medical education; virtual education","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-19","",27186,""
"Online improvisation training, hybrid improvisation training and on-site improvisation training; are they the same?","Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan in December 2019, lifestyle has been changing to an online-based learning and working environment rather than on-site, and improvisation training is no exception. However, no research compares the efficacy of online versus on-site training. Although we believed that the most effective way to learn improvisation is an on-site format, it is important to explore how format differences can affect learners. We offer three types of training such as on-site training (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°6) (Consisting of 1 female with age Ã¢â€°Â¥40 and &lt;50, and 5 males with ages Ã¢â€°Â¥20 and &lt;50), hybrid training (Instructor participates from online and learners participate on-site) (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°120) (Consisting of 55 female with age Ã¢â€°Â¥15 and &lt;20, and 65 males with ages Ã¢â€°Â¥15 and &lt;50), and online training (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°20) (Consisting of 4 female with age Ã¢â€°Â¥20 and &lt;30, and 16 males with ages Ã¢â€°Â¥20 and &lt;50) We collected pretest, test, and posttest data by using the Kansei Analyzer, a simplified electroencephalograph (EEG) and Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire. All formats of training displayed an increase in vigor and a decrease in depression, confusion, tension, anger, and fatigue. The online training displayed better results than the on-site training. Regardless of the format, all training displayed an increase in stress during the activities and a decrease in stress after the activity without changes in other indexes. Additionally, on-site training displayed an increase in sleepiness and stress during the activities. Some participants were tested twice but no significant differences were found between the initial results and the secondary results. In this study, we found evidence that online improvisation can lead to the prevention of depressive symptoms and can function as a method for the reduction of stress in conjunction with the increase of individual vigor. However, a future study is required due to the low number of participants and the absence of POMS data for the on-site training. Any future studies should account for these factors while examining other data such as blood pressure, blood sugar, and pulse.","Tsubota, Sumali, Kai, Mitsukura","https://doi.org/10.1177/00368504221080673","20220218","Improvisation training; offline training; online training; relax efficient; stress reduction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-19","",27187,""
"Health-care access and utilization among HIV-infected men who have sex with men in two Chinese municipalities with or without lockdown amidst early COVID-19 pandemic","City lockdown is critical to successfully contain the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of lockdown and COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare among vulnerable population has yet to be explicated. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among HIV-infected men who have sex with men (MSM) in Wuhan with city lockdown and Shanghai without lockdown, and healthcare interruptions were evaluated and compared. A logistic regression analysis was employed to examine associates of HIV-related healthcare interruptions and compromised mental health. Compared to participants in Shanghai (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°440), HIV-infected MSM in Wuhan (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°503) had significantly higher proportion of untimely availability of antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) (20.6% vs. 8.4%), obtaining ARVs from outside institutions (29.1% vs. 8.1%), postponed non-AIDS treatment (6.4% vs. 2.8%) and untimely follow-up appointments (33.4% vs. 14.5%). HIV-related healthcare interruptions were positively associated with lockdown (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.89, 95% CI: 3.49-6.85) and non-local residence (OR<i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°</i>=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.91, 95% CI: 1.37-2.64). Compromised mental health, including insomnia and generalized anxiety disorders, was associated with non-local residence (OR Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.35, 95% CI: 1.01-1.81) and healthcare interruptions (OR<i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°</i>=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.34, 95% CI: 1.01-1.79).

"Perceived usefulness of yoga to maintain well-being and in relation to COVID-19 cases among Hungarian yoga practitioners","The present COVID-19 epidemic has had a considerable impact on the mental health of individuals worldwide. Research projects suggests potential benefits of yoga practice for prevention, or as medical supplementation in relation to the present pandemic. This study investigated the association between yoga and health status, and how the frequency of yoga practice affected the mental well-being (MWB) of the respondents. Hungarian yoga practitioners (N=379) aged 20 to 75 years (93.4% female) were asked about their personal health, perceived usefulness of yoga practice for COVID-19 cases and their MWB. Data were collected between April 17 and May 17, 2021. The measurement tool used was an online questionnaire including sociodemographic data, characteristics of yoga practice, COVID-19 and health related questions, and WHO Well-being Index (WBI-5). Associations were examined through ANOVA and Chi-square tests. There was a significant difference among the yoga practice groups by weekly frequency (once a week, 2-3 times a week, 4-5 times a week, daily) on the total mean score of well-being (WBI-5), F (3, 373) = 12.97, p &lt; 0.001, ÃŽÂ·p 2 = 0.094.

"Clinical Leader Series: A Virtual Mental Well-being Initiative for Nurse Leaders During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Beyond","A virtual mental well-being initiative was developed for nurse leaders to provide education about mental health and to teach self-care skills. Because of substantial demand placed on nurse leaders during the COVID-19 pandemic, organizations must address stress and burnout by providing a continuum of care to include education, support, and intervention. All levels of nurse leaders at a multicampus healthcare system were invited to attend. Data were collected on coping, empowerment, burnout, and quality of life. Participant responses to discussion prompts were compiled and reviewed. Although the independent parallel comparison did not show significant improvements, scores on the coping, empowerment, burnout, and quality-of-life measures were maintained. Discussion prompts yielded valuable insights into nurse leader experiences and session effectiveness.

"Students' Resilience and Mental Health in the Dental Curriculum","Dental education is perceived as a source of students' psychological and occupational stress. Resilience has been proposed as a protective factor that may support students' in managing that stress. The objectives of this study were two-fold: to map the mental health and wellbeing content in the curriculum of the Faculty of Dentistry (FoD) at the University of British Columbia (UBC), and to investigate factors influencing resilience levels among dental students at UBC. The curricular database and website of UBC's FoD were used to gather information on mental health content. A survey with the Connor-Davidson 10-Item Resilience Scale was distributed to dental students at UBC (N=289). Students' de-identified demographic data were also collected. Two main mental health and wellbeing curricular components were identified: one didactic session on stress management and one interactive workshop on resilience. The response rate for the survey was 68.2%. Students who did not receive any mental health content (2020/21 year 1 students) had higher resilience scores (p= 0.043) when compared to students who received both components (2019/20 year 1 students and 2018/19 year 2 students). The multiple regression analysis highlighted North American/ European ethnic origins as a predictor for higher resilience levels (p = 0.008). The results of this study showed that ethnic origins and major life events, such as the pandemic, influenced resilience. Curricular activities promoting resilience seemed to not necessarily impact students' resilience. Further longitudinal studies are needed to assess the curricular and non-curricular activities influence over dental students' wellbeing.","Maragha, Donnelly, Schuetz, von Bergmann, Brondani","https://doi.org/10.1111/eje.12790","20220218","COVID-19 pandemic; Dental Curriculum; Dental students; Ethnic Origins; Mental Health; Psychological resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-19","",27191,""
"Patient clinical documentation in telehealth environment: are we collecting appropriate and sufficient information for best practice?","During the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of telehealth for patient visits grew rapidly and served an important role as a valuable and necessary resource. Although clinical documentation is critical for telehealth patient visits, there is limited information about how healthcare facilities manage telehealth patient visit documentation, technology used for telehealth visits, and challenges encountered with telehealth patient visit documentation. This study aimed to assess the use of telehealth during the pandemic, the quality of clinical documentation in telehealth practice and to identify challenges and issues encountered with telehealth patient visits in order to develop a strategy for best practices for telehealth documentation and data management. Data were collected for this cross-sectional study in January-February 2021 via a self-designed survey of administrators/managers from physicians' offices and mental health facilities. Survey questions included four categories: health organization demographic information; telehealth visits; clinical documentation for telehealth visit; and challenges and barriers related to telehealth documentation technology use. Of 76 respondents, more than half (62%) of the healthcare facilities started using telehealth for patient visits within one year of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, with 94% of respondents indicating an increased use of telehealth for patient visits since the pandemic. The most common types of telehealth patient care provided during the pandemic included pediatrics, primary care, cardiology, and women's health. The most consistent data documentation of telehealth visits included: date of service, patient identification number, communication methods, patient informed consent, diagnosis and impression, evaluation results, and recommendations. The telehealth visit data was most commonly used for patient care and clinical practice, billing and reimbursement, quality improvement and patient satisfaction, and administrative planning. The top barriers to telehealth use by the healthcare professionals included patient challenges with telehealth services, such as inequities in quality of technology, lack of patient understanding, and lack of patient satisfaction; this was followed by frustration with constant updates of telehealth guidelines and procedures, understanding required telehealth documentation for reimbursement purposes, payer denial for telehealth visits, and legal and risk issues. Findings from this study can assist government entities, policymakers, and healthcare organizations in developing and advocating best practices in telehealth usage and clinical documentation improvement strategies.","Houser, Flite, Foster, Hunt, Morey, Palmer, Peterson, Pope, Sorensen","https://doi.org/10.21037/mhealth-21-30","20220218","Telehealth; data documentation; health information and technology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-19","",27192,""
"Professional Quality of Life Among Physicians and Nurses Working in Portuguese Hospitals During the Third Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic","In the last 2 weeks of January 2021, Portugal was the worst country in the world in incidence of infections and deaths due to COVID-19. As a result, the pressure on the healthcare system increased exponentially, exceeding its capacities and leaving hospitals in near collapse. This scenario caused multiple constraints, particularly for hospital medical staff. Previous studies conducted at different moments during the pandemic reported that COVID-19 has had significant negative impacts on healthcare workers' psychological health, including stress, anxiety, depression, burnout, post-traumatic stress symptoms, and sleep disturbances. However, there are many uncertainties regarding the professional quality of life of hospital nurses and physicians. To address gaps in previous research on secondary traumatic stress, we focused on healthcare workers working in hospitals affected by a major traumatic event: the third wave of COVID-19. The aim of the present study was to identify the contribution of personal and work-related contextual variables (gender, age, parental status, occupation, years of experience, working with patients affected by COVID-19) on professional quality of life of healthcare workers. Cross-sectional study with a web-based questionnaire given to physicians and nurses working in a hospital setting. A total of 853 healthcare professionals (276 physicians and 586 nurses; median age 37 years old) participated in the survey assessing professional quality of life compassion satisfaction, secondary traumatic stress, and burnout. Factors of professional quality of life were assessed using regression analysis. Most of the participants showed moderate (80%; <i>n</i> = 684) or high (18%; <i>n</i> = 155) levels of compassion satisfaction, whereas the majority of them experienced moderate levels of burnout (72%; <i>n</i> = 613) and secondary traumatic stress (69%; <i>n</i> = 592). The analyzed variables demonstrated no differences between professionals who were directly or not involved in the care of COVID-19 patients. Parental status was found to be a significant factor in compassion satisfaction. Female gender was significantly associated with more susceptibility to secondary traumatization. Factors that may potentially contribute to burnout include years of professional experience and the number of work hours per week. The COVID-19 pandemic has created a new challenge for the healthcare system. Burnout and secondary traumatic stress can lead to medical errors and impact standards of patient care, particularly compromising compassionate care. It is therefore recommended that hospitals develop psychoeducational initiatives to support professionals in dealing with barriers to compassion.","SerrÃƒÂ£o, Martins, Ribeiro, Maia, Pinho, Teixeira, Castro, Duarte","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.814109","20220218","COVID-19; burnout; compassion fatigue; compassion satisfaction; nurses; physicians; professional quality of life (ProQOL-5); secondary traumatic stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-19","",27193,""
"Detecting Presence of PTSD Using Sentiment Analysis From Text Data","Rates of Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have risen significantly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Telehealth has emerged as a means to monitor symptoms for such disorders. This is partly due to isolation or inaccessibility of therapeutic intervention caused from the pandemic. Additional screening tools may be needed to augment identification and diagnosis of PTSD through a virtual medium. Sentiment analysis refers to the use of natural language processing (NLP) to extract emotional content from text information. In our study, we train a machine learning (ML) model on text data, which is part of the Audio/Visual Emotion Challenge and Workshop (AVEC-19) corpus, to identify individuals with PTSD using sentiment analysis from semi-structured interviews. Our sample size included 188 individuals without PTSD, and 87 with PTSD. The interview was conducted by an artificial character (Ellie) over a video-conference call. Our model was able to achieve a balanced accuracy of 80.4% on a held out dataset used from the AVEC-19 challenge. Additionally, we implemented various partitioning techniques to determine if our model was generalizable enough. This shows that learned models can use sentiment analysis of speech to identify the presence of PTSD, even through a virtual medium. This can serve as an important, accessible and inexpensive tool to detect mental health abnormalities during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sawalha, Yousefnezhad, Shah, Brown, Greenshaw, Greiner","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.811392","20220218","emotion; language; machine learning; natural language processing; post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); sentiment analysis (SA); telepsychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-19","",27194,""

The burden of care and psychological impact of working in this circumstance can be unfavorable for many caregivers. In this qualitative study, the health care professionals' perception of stress during COVID-19 pandemic in Iran was assessed and several implications were proposed. The participants were selected among staff who were providing medical services to patients with COVID-19 infection at the largest teaching hospital in Iran. Quota sampling was used to include physicians, nurses, and other paramedics. The grounded theory was selected to develop interview questions. Moreover, the thematic approach was applied to analyze the data content and data analysis was performed based on open and axial coding following the implementation of codes in MAQDA software. A wide range of psychological reactions including anxiety, feelings of guilt, depression, and anger were detected in the staff. Uncertainty accompanied by the pandemic of COVID-19 and shortcomings in preparation for crisis management were recognized as the two main sources of stress among health care professionals. Based on the findings of the study, it is important to identify and evaluate the mental health needs of healthcare professionals.

"Validity and Reliability of the Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics-6 (SAVE-6) Scale to Measure Viral Anxiety of Healthcare Workers in Spain During the COVID-19 Pandemic","This study examined the validity and applicability of the Spanish version of the Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics-6 items (SAVE-6) scale, which can be usually applied to the general population, to healthcare workers to briefly measure their anxiety responses to the viral epidemic. A total of 135 healthcare workers participated in this online survey from January to July 2021. Participants' sociodemographic characteristics were gathered, and their psychiatric symptoms were rated using SAVE-6, Goldberg Anxiety and Depression Scale (GDAS), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to examine the validity of the scales. The single-structure model of the SAVE-6 scale was adopted based on the results of the parallel analysis. We decided on the SAVE-6 scale, as it proved to be a good fit to measure healthcare workers' anxiety response to the viral epidemic.

"The impact of COVID-19 stressors on psychological distress and suicidality in a nationwide community survey in Taiwan","COVID-19 stressors and psychological stress response are important correlates of suicide risks under the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of COVID-19 stress, its impact on mental health and associated risk factors among the general population during the outbreak of COVID-19 in July 2020 throughout Taiwan. A nationwide population-based survey was conducted using a computer-assisted telephone interview system with a stratified, proportional randomization method for the survey. The questionnaire comprised demographic variables, psychological distress assessed by the five-item Brief Symptom Rating Scale and independent psychosocial variables including COVID-19 stressors, loneliness, suicidality, and health-related self-efficacy. In total, 2094 respondents completed the survey (female 51%). The COVID-19 stress was experienced among 45.4% of the participants, with the most prevalent stressors related to daily life and job/financial concerns. Higher levels of suicidality, loneliness, and a lower level of self-efficacy had significantly higher odds of having COVID-19 stress. The structural equation model revealed that COVID-19 stress was moderately associated with psychological distress and mediated by other psychosocial risk factors. The findings call for more attention on strategies of stress management and mental health promotion for the public to prevent larger scales of psychological consequences in future waves of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Wu, Lee, Huong, Chan, Chen, Liao","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-06511-1","20220218","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-19","",27197,""

"A cross-sectional analysis of psychological distress among higher education students in Ireland","To examine levels of psychological distress among higher education students in Ireland overall and across a range of personal, higher education, and socioeconomic characteristics, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional online survey of college students in Ireland was undertaken in 2018. Data on 5201 students from 13 higher education institutions (HEIs) were analyzed. Stress, anxiety, and depression symptom scores based on the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) were calculated and reported, with statistical testing used to compare across groups. Overall, 29.6% and 19.1% of respondents were classified in the mild to moderate and severe to extremely severe range for depression respectively. The corresponding proportions were 25.9% and 20.7% for anxiety, and 24.5% and 14.8% for stress. Differences across groups included higher levels of psychological distress for transgender and female students compared to males (p &lt; 0.01), for gay/lesbian/bisexual students compared to heterosexuals (p &lt; 0.01), for undergraduates compared to postgraduates (p &lt; 0.01), for students from intermediate/technical/service/unskilled social classes compared to professional/self-employed socialÃ‚Â classes (p &lt; 0.01), and for those with financial difficulties compared to those without financial difficultiesÃ‚Â (p &lt; 0.01).

We examined change in severity of individual domains with Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. We used a latent profile analysis (LPA) to identify groups with distinct symptom change profiles. Using multinomial logistic regression, we examined potential predictors and correlates of LPA-derived groups. Models controlled for age, sex, and assessment date and corrected for multiple testing. Although the majority of individual psychopathology domains were worse on average during the 2020-2021 school year, youth showed distincive patterns of symptom change. In addition to a large group (72.2%) with relatively stable symptoms and a small group (6.4%) that improved on most symptoms, there were two groups with different constellations of worsening symptoms. These latter groups both showed increased sadness, anxiety and oppositionality; however, one had increased hyperactivity/impulsivity and no change in hopelessness while the other showed greater hopelessness and no change in hyperactivity. Symptoms related to the distinguishable domains of these groups predicted group membership, and changes in screen time, conflict with parents and social isolation were correlates of worsening. Cognition and lifetime clinical diagnoses failed to predict group membership. In youth outpatients, psychiatric and psychosocial difficulties were worse on average during the school year following the spring 2020 COVID-19 lockdown; yet, some youth experienced greater and distinctive symptom change. A personalized approach to support may be needed as youth emerge from this period.","Doyle, Colvin, Beery, Koven, Vuijk, Braaten","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13034-022-00441-6","20220218","COVID-19 pandemic; Child and adolescent psychiatry; United States","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-19","",27201,""
"Changes in antidepressant use in Australia: A nationwide analysis (2015-2021)","Depression and anxiety affect 4-14% of Australians every year; symptoms may have been exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. We examined recent patterns of antidepressant use in Australia in the period 2015-2021, which includes the first year of the pandemic. We used national dispensing claims for people agedÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢Â©Â¾10Ã¢â‚¬â€°years to investigate annual trends in prevalent and new antidepressant use (no antidepressants dispensed in the year prior). We conducted stratified analyses by sex, age group and antidepressant class. We report outcomes from 2015 to 2019 and used time series analysis to quantify changes during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020-February 2021). In 2019, the annual prevalence of antidepressant use was 170.4 per 1000 women and 101.8 per 1000 men, an increase of 7.0% and 9.2% from 2015, respectively. New antidepressant use also increased for both sexes (3.0% for women and 4.9% for men) and across most age groups, particularly among adolescents (aged 10-17Ã¢â‚¬â€°years; 46-57%). During the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, we observed higher than expected prevalent use (+2.2%, 95% CI = [0.3%, 4.2%]) among females, corresponding to a predicted excess of 45,217 (95% CI = [5,819, 84,614]) females dispensed antidepressants. The largest increases during the first year of the pandemic occurred among female adolescents for both prevalent (+11.7%, 95% CI = [4.1%, 20.5%]) and new antidepressant use (+15.6%, 95% CI = [8.5%, 23.7%]). Antidepressant use continues to increase in Australia overall and especially among young people. We found a differential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in treated depression and anxiety, greater among females than males, and greater among young females than other age groups, suggesting an increased mental health burden in populations already on a trajectory of increased use of antidepressants prior to the pandemic. Reasons for these differences require further investigation.","de Oliveira Costa, Gillies, Schaffer, Peiris, Zoega, Pearson","https://doi.org/10.1177/00048674221079740","20220218","Antidepressants; COVID-19; incidence; prevalence; trends","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-19","",27202,""

"[Impact of the COVID pandemic on the anxiety of patients with functional gastrointestinal symptoms]","Functional gastrointestinal disorders such as functional dyspepsia (FD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are stress-associated. The COVID-19 pandemic, which has been rampant since 2020, has caused anxiety and stress in the population. Distancing measures to combat the pandemic have affected mental health. Our objective was to examine the impact of the 3rd lockdown in Germany in December 2020 and January 2021 on the apprehension of patients with FD and IBS.Patients diagnosed with FD or IBS treated in a tertiary or primary care hospital in the South of Baden-WÃƒÂ¼rttemberg in 2020 voluntarily participated in an anonymous online survey. Questions about concomitant diseases, concern about COVID-19 and stress perception were answered.A total of 106 patients (Ã¢â„¢â‚¬=67, Ã¢â„¢â€š=38, 1 diverse) participated in the survey. Of these, 16 had FD (Ã¢â„¢â‚¬=9, Ã¢â„¢â€š=6, diverse=1), 80 had IBS (Ã¢â„¢â‚¬=52, Ã¢â„¢â€š=28), and 10 had both (Ã¢â„¢â‚¬=6, Ã¢â„¢â€š=4). The average age was 43.6 years. Depressive and anxiety disorders were most frequently reported comorbidities in both the FD (25% each) and IBS group (20% each), followed by joint wear and tear (FD: 13%, RDS: 14%). In a direct comparison of participants with FD and IBS, those with IBS showed significantly higher scores for an increase in gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms during the pandemic (p=0.007), more frequent presentation to a physician during the pandemic, and greater social withdrawal due to GI symptoms (p=0.05). In direct comparison, those with IBS showed higher scores for fear that vaccination against COVID-19 would adversely affect GI symptoms compared to FD (p=0.05).In times of the pandemic, interdisciplinary collaboration in the care of patients with FD or IBS seems more necessary than ever to address concerns and provide good patient care.

"The impact of physical conditions on the incidence of major depressive disorder in Chinese university students: Results from a longitudinal study","Major depressive disorder (MDD) is prevalent, and highly comorbid with physical illnesses. Few longitudinal studies have investigated the relationship between physical health conditions and MDD. The objectives of this study were to investigate the comorbid relationship between physical conditions and MDD, and the association between physical conditions and the 2-year risk of MDD. A study was conducted in first-year Chinese university students (nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯8,079) over two and half years, using a longitudinal design. An adapted version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI - 3.0) was used to assess for MDD. The presence of physician diagnosed physical conditions was assessed using ten self-report questions. Cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between self-reported physical conditions and MDD were estimated, adjusting for possible confounders. The most frequently reported physical conditions were migraines, chronic rhinitis, and gastritis. We found that migraines, gastritis, and stomach ulcers were associated with a significantly higher lifetime prevalence of MDD than those without any physical health conditions. In those without a lifetime MDD, migraines, gastritis and stomach ulcers were also found to be significant predictors for 2-year risk of new onset MDD. Recall and selection biases are possible when using self-reporting measures. Additionally, the COVID-19 outbreak impacted the response rate at the second follow-up assessment. Lastly, the severity of the physical conditions was not measured. Physical conditions and MDD are highly prevalent and comorbid in university students. Migraines, gastritis and stomach ulcers are associated with the risk of developing MDD. Future studies should further investigate how this information can be used to prevent MDD.","Vereecke, Sorensen, Zhu, Liu, Jiao, Wang, Wang, Zhou, Duan, Liu, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.02.041","20220217","Acronyms: MDDÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯major depressive disorder; BAIÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯Beck Anxiety Inventory; CIDIÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯Composite International Diagnostic Interview; CIÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯confidence interval; Major depressive disorder; ORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯odds ratio; PHQ-9Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯Patient Health Questionnaire-9; T0Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯baseline; T1Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯first follow up; T2Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯second follow up; comorbidity; nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯sample size; physical conditions; university students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-19","",27206,""
"Nightmares mediate the association between traumatic event exposure and suicidal ideation in frontline medical workers exposed to COVID-19","Trauma experience increases the risk of suicidal ideation, but little is known about potentially psychological mechanisms underlying this relationship. This study aims to examine the relationship between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related traumatic event (CTE) exposure and suicidal ideation among hospital workers, and identify mediating roles of sleep disturbances in this relationship. Workers in seven designated hospitals in Wuhan, China, were invited to participate in an online survey from May 27, 2020, to July 31, 2020. Participants completed a self-report questionnaire to evaluate demographic characteristics, level of CTE exposures, nightmare frequency, insomnia severity, symptoms of depression and anxiety, and suicidal ideation. A series of correlation analyses were performed, and a mediation model was generated to examine correlations between CTE exposure, sleep disturbances, and suicidal ideation. A total of 16,220 hospital workers were included in the final analysis, 13.3% of them reported suicidal ideation in the past month. CTE exposure was significantly associated with insomnia severity, nightmare frequency, and suicidal ideation. After controlling potential confounders, nightmares but not insomnia, depression, or anxiety were shown to be independent risk factors for suicidal ideation. Pathway analyses showed that the relationship between CTE exposure and suicidal ideation was fully mediated by nightmares (proportion mediated 66.4%) after adjusting for demographic characteristics and psychological confounders. Cross-sectional design precluded the investigation of causal relationships. CTE exposure increases risk of hospital workers' suicidal ideation that is mediated by nightmares, suggesting nightmares intervention might be considered as a component when developing suicide prevention strategies.","Que, Shi, Yan, Chen, Wu, Sun, Yuan, Liu, Zhu, Fan, Lu, Hu, Xiao, Liu, Li, Wang, Wang, Ran, Shi, Wing, Bao, Lu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.02.033","20220217","COVID-19; Mediation analysis; Nightmares; Sleep disturbance; Suicidal ideation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-19","",27207,""
"Psychological impact during COVID-19 pandemic: A web-based cross-sectional study among students studying at College of Science and Technology (CST), Phuentsholing, Bhutan","The unprecedented experience of national lockdowns and uncertainty of academic career due to the COVID-19 pandemic has multifaceted impacts on mental health among university students worldwide. This study determined its impact on depression and anxiety level, and associated risk factors among engineering students studying at College of Science and Technology (CST), Phuentsholing, Bhutan during the first lockdown in the country. Self-reported depression and anxiety levels were assessed using Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) respectively. Data was collected using an e-questionnaire link generated in Google form and the link was shared with students via the student's official email group. A total of 278 students (response rate, 26.9%) completed the questionnaire. The majority of respondents were male (69.8%) and were aged from 18 to 30 (Mean: 21.7 Ã‚Â±SD 2.07) years. The prevalence of self-reported moderate to severe depression and anxiety were 44.2% (95% CI, 38.5-49.6) and 27.3% (95% CI, 22.3-32.4) respectively. Participants having their family members as frontline workers reported a significantly higher level of anxiety (Ãâ€¡2 = 4.85, p = 0.028). In multivariable logistic regression analysis, students who were academically lagging showed a higher risk of depression (AOR = 5.36, 95% CI = 2.86-10.04) and anxiety (AOR = 3.83, 95%CI = 1.86-7.88) as compared to students who were not academically behind. A high percentage of depression and anxiety was reported by students of CST during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings from the study highlight the importance of adopting appropriate online-based teaching and learning methods to ensure timely academic and professional achievements. Moreover, the relevant stakeholders should put health system strategies in place to provide psychological support to university students during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Tshering, Dema","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263999","20220217","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-19","",27208,""

"[Determination of the prevalence of postcovid syndrome and assessment of the effectiveness of the drug Cortexin in the treatment of neurological disorders in patients with postcovid syndrome Results of the multicenter clinical and epidemiological observational program CORTEX]","To study the prevalence of clinical manifestations of postcoid syndrome in patients at an outpatient neurological appointment, to evaluate the effectiveness of therapy regimens using Cortexin at doses of 10 mg and 20 mg IM for 10 days. 674 neurologists from all regions of the Russian Federation, Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan took part in the study. A total of 979 COVID-19 patients were recruited. The average age is 54.6Ã‚Â±0.45 years. The duration of the transferred SARS-CoV-2 days and from 1 month or more 12. 3 visits were carried out: 1 on the day of treatment (assessment of complaints, analysis of scale indicators, prescription of the drug Cortexin in doses of 10-20 mg/m for 10 days). 2 (telephone survey) visit for 10-14 days, 3 visit - for 30 days at the reception. The condition was assessed using the Asthenia Assessment Scale (MFI-20), the Brief Mental Status Assessment Scale (MMSE questionnaire), the Schulte test, and the Subjective Treatment Quality Assessment Scale. The daily proportion of patients with complaints after a previous coronavirus infection was 30% in the total structure of neurological admission. The most common complaints: fatigue, general weakness, decreased memory and concentration, dizziness, sleep disturbance, irritability, aggression, shortness of breath, pain syndromes, excessive sweating, anosmia, hyposmia, perverted taste of paresthesia, hair loss, blurred vision, unstable blood pressure, tachycardia, allergic reactions, menstrual irregularities, erectile dysfunction, apathy, panic attacks, suicidal thoughts, depression, refusal to eat meat. There was no significant correlation of clinical symptoms with the severity of COVID-19, the percentage of lung tissue damage, and different periods of postcovid syndrome.

"Evaluating an Evidence-Based Parenting Intervention Among Filipino Parents: Protocol for a Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial","Filipino Americans underuse mental health and preventive care services even though studies have indicated that Filipino youth experience high rates of suicidal ideation, substance abuse, and teen pregnancies, whereas adults experience immigration stress, discrimination, and depression. Evidence-based parenting interventions provided in early childhood have proven to be effective in preventing the onset and escalation of child mental health disorders. In a pilot randomized controlled trial, we found that participation in the Incredible Years Basic Parent Training Program (IY) improved parenting stress and positive parenting practices and decreased child internalizing and externalizing symptoms among Filipino families. A fully powered trial is needed to determine the efficacy of IY as a prevention program among Filipino families. The aims of this study are to describe the design and rationale of a randomized controlled trial evaluating the effects of the web-based IY program among parents recruited from multiple community-based settings and its impact on parenting practices, parenting stress, and child problem behavior among Filipino Americans and describe the impact of COVID-19 on our study protocols. This study uses a randomized controlled 2-arm individually randomized group treatment pretest-posttest design for 180 parent-child dyads. Individuals are eligible if they are Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years, live in California, and have at least one Filipino child aged 8-12 years. Consenting participants are randomly allocated to receive either the 12-week IY parenting intervention (intervention arm) or American Academy of Pediatrics' Bright Future handouts and placed on a waitlist to receive IY posttrial (waitlist control arm). Primary outcomes include the Parent Practices Interview and the Parenting Stress Index. Secondary outcomes will be measured using the Child Behavior Checklist (completed by parent) and will include child internalizing and externalizing behaviors and total problems. Data are collected at baseline and 3- and 6-month follow-ups. Changes made to the protocol owing to COVID-19 include administration of surveys remotely and implementation of the intervention on the web. The pandemic has provided an opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of a web-based version of IY that may improve access and increase use of the intervention. Recruitment and data collection procedures are still ongoing and are expected to be completed by December 2022. Our research will determine whether IY promotes positive parenting practices and prevents child internalizing and externalizing behaviors in healthy but high-risk populations such as Filipino families. It will also uplift cultural narratives and add to the evidence base for web-based parenting programs and their implementation in real-world settings. If found efficacious, IY has the potential to prevent behavioral health disparities in this understudied and high-risk Filipino population and can be scaled, adapted, and implemented in other at-risk racial and ethnic minority communities.

"Validating the Suicide Behavior Questionnaire-RevisedÃ‚Â among Filipino adults during the COVID-19 pandemic","The study aimed to examine the validity of the Suicide Behavior Questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R) among adult Filipinos experiencing severe depression symptoms during the COVID-19-related lockdowns in 2020. Results support SBQ-R's internal reliability. Confirmatory factor analyses supported SBQ-R's one-factor structure and its measurement invariance across gender and age. The SBQ-R's positive relationship with negative affect and its negative relationships with positive affect and family support demonstrate the questionnaire's criterion-related validity. The SBQ-R's cutoff of Ã¢â€°Â¥8 shows that 78% of the sample were at-risk for suicide. The SBQ-R is valid in assessing suicide risk among severely depressed adults during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Dizon, Mendoza, Mordeno, Nalipay","https://doi.org/10.1080/07481187.2022.2039327","20220217","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-19","",27212,""
"The impact of COVID-19 and experiences of secondary traumatic stress and burnout","This study examines the relationships between multiple COVID-19 related stressors and experiences of secondary traumatic stress (STS) and burnout (BO). This sample (N = 550) of professionals and caregivers from a foster care system in the United States completed an online survey regarding their experiences of COVID-19 related stress in multiple domains (disruptions in routines, income/employment, food access, medical/mental health care access, access to social support, worries about COVID, family conflict/violence, and COVID diagnoses). The survey also included established measures of STS and BO. A subset of COVID-19 stressors was found to account for 27.4% of the variance in STS and 24.7% of the variance in BO scores in regression analyses. Significant correlates for STS included worries about COVID, family conflict/violence and food access, while only worries about COVID and family conflict/violence were significant in the model testing BO. Part of the sample (N = 64) had participated in a related 2019 study of STS and BO and were included in comparison analyses of these conditions before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results for T1 and T2 comparisons yielded significant increases in STS related symptoms of intrusion and alterations in cognitions and mood, with differences in total STS scores trending toward significance. No significant differences were found in BO scores. These findings and associated implications are discussed for groups of caregivers and helping professionals with preexisting high levels of indirect trauma exposure in a pandemic context. This study provides some guidance on how to identify those at risk for increased distress in their helping roles and considerations for implementing support strategies during a pandemic.

"Depressive symptoms and stress among nurses in the COVID unit: A 7-month cohort study","Previous studies have reported high prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms among frontline nurses caring for COVID-19 patients. Yet, only a limited number of prospective studies examining nurses' mental health problems have been performed. The present study aimed to examine depressive symptoms and COVID-19-related stresses among nurses working specifically in a hospital COVID unit over a 7-month period. In this study, depressive symptoms and COVID-19-related stresses of a total of 28 nurses who worked in the COVID unit were assessed using the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptom (QIDS) and the Tokyo Metropolitan Distress Scale for Pandemic (TMDP) over the 7-month period from December 2020 to June 2021. The mean QIDS scores in all participants fluctuated during the study period, showing a high correlation with the reported number of new COVID-19 cases in the region. The mean TMDP scores showed a gradual decline over the period. Scores on the social stress factor of the TMDP demonstrated a statistically significant correlation with the QIDS scores. The results indicate that the number of new COVID-19 patients in the region is associated with depressive symptoms among nurses in the hospital COVID unit. Scores on the social stress factor in the TMDP are also correlated with depressive symptoms among nurses.","Tsubono, Ikeda","https://doi.org/10.1111/jjns.12477","20220217","COVID unit; COVID-19; depression; nurses; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-19","",27214,""

"Nurse admissions at a specialized mental health programme: A pre-Covid-19 retrospective review (2000-2019)","Nursing is a stressful and emotionally demanding profession. To date, few mental health treatment interventions have been developed for them worldwide. This study aims to explore referral trends in nurses with mental disorders admitted to a pioneer specialized mental health programme in Europe from 2000 to 2019. A retrospective observational study of 1297 medical e-records of nurses with mental health disorders admitted to the Galatea Care Programme in Barcelona was conducted. Three periods were analysed: 2000-2006, 2007-2012 and 2013-2019. Socio-demographic and clinical variables were compared. Diagnoses followed Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) criteria. Gender and age at referral did not change over time. Self-referrals grew from 85.1% in the first period to 95.3% in the last period; inpatient admissions decreased from 24.1% to 18.2%, although this was not significant; nurses were less frequently on sick leave on admission over time (59.1% vs. 45.7%); they were more likely to have a temporary contract in the second period (9.5% vs. 4.8% and 4%) and prevalence of main diagnosis changed with a considerable decrease in affective and substance use disorders after 2006 and a progressive increase in adjustment disorders during the whole period. Free, voluntary, highly confidential programmes for nurses with mental disorders may enhance voluntary and earlier help seeking. These findings can be considered when implementing specialized interventions for them in other settings. WHAT PROBLEM DID THE STUDY ADDRESS?: Nursing is a stressful and emotionally demanding profession. To date, few specialized mental health services have been developed for them worldwide. This study aims to explore referral trends in nurses with mental disorders admitted to a pioneer programme in Europe, the Galatea Care Programme in Barcelona, from 2000 to 2019. WHAT WERE THE MAIN FINDINGS?: The number of referrals to the programme grew especially after the first 7-year period. Admissions were more likely to be voluntary during the last period. Prevalence of substance use disorders at admission dropped steadily while prevalence of adjustment disorders progressively increased over the two decades. Nurses were also less likely to be on sick leave at admission.

"Unrealistic pessimism and obsessive-compulsive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic: Two longitudinal studies","Unrealistic pessimism (UP) is an aspect of overestimation of threat (OET) that has been associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder/symptoms (OCD/OCS). During the COVID-19 pandemic, UP may have played an important role in the course of OCD. To investigate the relationship, we conducted two longitudinal studies assuming that higher UP predicts an increase in OCS. In Study 1, we investigated UP in the general population (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1,184) at the start of the pandemic asking about overall vulnerability to infection with SARS-CoV-2 and UP regarding infection and outcome of severe illness. Further, OCS status (OCS+/-) was assessed at the start of the pandemic and 3Ã¢â‚¬â€°months later. In Study 2, we investigated UP in individuals with OCD (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°268) regarding the likelihood of getting infected, recovering, or dying from an infection with SARS-CoV-2 at the start of the pandemic and re-assessed OCS 3Ã¢â‚¬â€°months later. In Study 1, UP was higher in the OCS+ compared to the OCS- group, and estimates of a higher overall vulnerability for an infection predicted a decrease in OCS over time. UP regarding severe illness predicted an increase in symptoms over time. In Study 2, UP was found for a recovery and death after an infection with SARS-CoV-2, but not for infection itself. Exaggeration of one's personal vulnerability rather than OET per se seems pivotal in OCD, with UP being associated with OCD/OCS+ as well as a more negative course of symptomatology over the pandemic in a nonclinical sample. Unrealistic optimism, a bias common in healthy individuals, is thought to be a coping mechanism promoting well-being in the face of danger or uncertainty. The current study extends findings that its inversion, unrealistic pessimism, may play an important role in obsessive-compulsive disorder and may also be involved in the development of the disorder. This study highlights the importance that prevention programs during a pandemic should include targeting unrealistic pessimism.","Jelinek, RÃƒÂ¶hrig, Moritz, GÃƒÂ¶ritz, Voderholzer, Riesel, Yassari, Miegel","https://doi.org/10.1111/bjc.12362","20220217","COVID-19 pandemic; OCD; cognitive biases; overestimation of threat; unrealistic optimism","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-19","",27217,""
"A longitudinal study of mental health in at-risk adolescents before and during the COVID-19 pandemic","Although cross-sectional studies have shown that the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected the mental health of adolescents, the effect of the pandemic on adolescents with pre-pandemic symptoms is unclear. We, therefore, tested the hypothesis that adolescents had increased emotional and behavioral problems during the lockdowns imposed during the pandemic.This study included three measurements in a prospective cohort of 1022 adolescents who were oversampled based on their high risk of developing psychopathology. Before the pandemic, we assessed depressive, anxiety, stress, oppositional defiant problems, psychotic experiences and suicidality, using the Youth Self-Report; 445 and 333 of these 1,022 adolescents subsequently completed the online questionnaire in the first lockdown (in April 2020) and in the second lockdown (in January 2021), respectively. Multilevel random intercept regression models were used to determine the change in psychiatric symptoms, including an interaction term to assess whether these changes differed based on the severity of symptoms prior to the pandemic. Throughout the pandemic, the majority of the participating adolescents reported having emotional and behavioral symptoms that were within the normal range. Moreover, the mean symptom scores for all six outcomes decreased significantly among adolescents with high clinical severity prior to the pandemic.In contrast to our original hypothesis, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may not necessarily be detrimental, at least among a specific subgroup of adolescents with pre-existing mental health problems. Moreover, our finding that most adolescents in this at-risk sample did not report experiencing clinically relevant symptoms during the pandemic reflects their resilience during the pandemic.","Bouter, Zarchev, de Neve-Enthoven, Ravensbergen, Kamperman, Hoogendijk, Grootendorst-van Mil","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00787-021-01935-y","20220217","Adolescent; COVID-19; Epidemiology; Mental health; Population-based studies","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-19","",27218,""
"Online peer support training to promote adolescents' emotional support skills, mental health and agency during COVID-19: Randomised controlled trial and qualitative evaluation","Adolescents often look to their peers for emotional support, so it is critical that they are prepared to take on a supportive role, especially during a health crisis. Using a randomised controlled trial (ISRCTN99248812, 28/05/2020), we tested the short-term efficacy of an online training programme to equip young people with skills to support to their peers' mental wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic. In June 2020, one-hundred UK adolescents (aged 16-18) recruited through social media were randomly allocated (1:1) to immediate 5-day peer support training or a wait-list, via an independently generated allocation sequence. Primary outcomes were indicators of ability to help others (motivation, perceived skills, frequency of help provided, compassion to others and connectedness to peers). Secondary outcomes included emotional symptoms, mental wellbeing, and indicators of agency (civic engagement and self-efficacy). We also collected qualitative reports of participants' experience. Assessments were completed at baseline and 1 week post randomisation (primary endpoint), and up to 4 weeks post randomisation (training group only). The training increased support-giving skills, frequency of providing support, compassion and peer connectedness (medium-large-effect sizes), but not motivation to provide support, 1 week post randomisation, compared to controls. Gains in the training group were maintained 4 weeks post randomisation. Training also improved adolescents' mental health and agency, and qualitative reports revealed further positive outcomes including increased self-care and empowerment. Leveraging digital platforms that are familiar to young people, peer support training has the potential to enable adolescents to support their own and their peers' mental wellbeing during a health crisis.","Pavarini, Reardon, Hollowell, Bennett, Lawrance, Pinfold, Singh, Brooks-Hall, Foster-Estwick, Juma, Lewis, Power, Rogers","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00787-021-01933-0","20220217","Adolescents; COVID-19; Empowerment; Mental health; Peer support; Social skills","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-19","",27219,""
"Happier during lockdown: a descriptive analysis of self-reported wellbeing in 17,000 UK school students during Covid-19 lockdown","Relatively little research has focused on children and young people (CYP) whose mental health and wellbeing improved during Covid-19 lockdown measures. We aimed to (1) determine the proportion of CYP who self-reported improvement in their mental wellbeing during the first Covid-19 lockdown and (2) describe the characteristics of this group in relation to their peers. We conducted a descriptive analysis of data from the 2020 OxWell Student Survey, a self-report, cross-sectional survey of English CYP. A total of 16,940 CYP primarily aged 8-18Ã‚Â years reported on change in mental wellbeing during lockdown. We characterised these CYP in terms of school, home, relational, and lifestyle factors as well as feelings about returning to school. One-third (33%) of CYP reported improved mental wellbeing during the first UK national lockdown. Compared with peers who reported no change or deterioration, a higher proportion of CYP with improved mental wellbeing reported improved relationships with friends and family, less loneliness and exclusion, reduced bullying, better management of school tasks, and more sleep and exercise during lockdown. In conclusion, a sizeable minority of CYP reported improved mental wellbeing during lockdown. Determining the reasons why these CYP feltÃ‚Â theyÃ‚Â fared better during lockdown and considering how these beneficial experiences can be maintained beyond the pandemic might provide insights into how to promote the future mental health and wellbeing of school-aged CYP.Ã‚Â All those working with CYP now have an opportunity toÃ‚Â consider whetherÃ‚Â aÃ‚Â systemic shift isÃ‚Â needed in orderÃ‚Â to understand and realise any learnings from experiences during the pandemic.","Soneson, Puntis, Chapman, Mansfield, Jones, Fazel","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00787-021-01934-z","20220217","Covid-19; Lockdown; Mental health; School; Wellbeing; Young people","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-19","",27220,""
"The Prevalence and Associated Factors of Depressive Symptoms Among Medical Students in Bangladesh During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Pilot Study","Whilst very limited studies have demonstrated a correlation between the COVID-19 pandemic and depressive symptoms amongst Bangladeshi medical students, the prevalence and associated factors of depressive symptoms as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) remains widely unknown. The study aimed to investigate the prevalence and factors associated with depression symptoms among Bangladeshi medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown period. In this web-based cross-sectional pilot study, medical students' data was collected using the Google Forms web survey platform after obtaining electronic informed consent. A total of 425 medical students were selected using a systematic sampling technique to accumulate depression symptoms and demographic and pandemic-related information. Depression was measured by a self-administered, validated English version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) tool. The descriptive analysis utilized frequency and percentages, while the stepwise binary logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate the factors associated with depressive symptoms. Among 425 medical students, 62.3% were female, 97.4% unmarried. Almost 80.2% of medical students had mild to severe levels of depressive symptoms as characterized by PHQ-9. A significantly higher probability of depression was found amongst female students (adjusted OR = 1.8), those who struggled to stay away from social media (adjusted OR = 1.8), those who tried to be optimistic for maintaining better psychology (adjusted OR = 11.1), and those who always had a sleeping difficulty in the last 4 weeks (adjusted OR = 8.9). A very high prevalence of depression symptoms among Bangladeshi medical students was found across the majority of socio-demographic variables. The alarming prevalence and associated factors of depression suggests the need for follow-intensity psychosocial interventions designed for medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Biswas, Hasan, Samir, Alin, Homaira, Hassan, Khatun, Anjum, Hossain, Koly, Safa, Alam, Rafi, Osman Biswas, Yasmin, Podder, Trisa, Azad, Nodi, Ashraf, Akther, Ahmed","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.811345","20220217","Bangladesh; COVID-19; depressive symptoms; medical students; patient health questionnaire-(PHQ-9)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-19","",27221,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 Lockdown on Quality of Life in Pregnant Women","The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with significant impacts on mental health and well-being of populations worldwide. However, little is known about its significant impact on psychological aspects of vulnerable population groups such as pregnant women. Therefore, the aim of the study was to determine the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic among pregnant women in mainland China. A cross-sectional survey was performed between July and August 2020 using a modified validated 40-item questionnaire which consisted of sociodemographics, attitude, lifestyle changes and the Impact of Event Scale (IES) toward COVID-19 using snowball and convenience samplings. A total of 1,078 participants were included in the study. The mean age of participants was 29.4 Ã‚Â± 4.0 years. Overall, the mean IES of participants was 30.6 Ã‚Â± 12.8 (i.e., moderate-to-severe stressful impact) amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, with 63.9% of participants had an IES score Ã¢â€°Â¥26. Despite increased family and social support, more than half of participants also reported increased feeling of being horrified, apprehensive and helpless. The COVID-19 pandemic has several psychological impacts on pregnant women. Therefore, based on these valuable data of pregnant women collected, we recommend that a thoughtful planning and time preparation by the government would definitely help to reduce the negative impacts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and restore the quality of life among pregnant women. Further research is needed to identify vulnerable groups including pregnant women to better adapt and inform mental health interventions and policies by health authorities.","Ma, Wang, Zhou","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.785383","20220217","China; IES; pregnant women; psychiatry; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-19","",27222,""
"Significantly Increased Public Interest in Major Depressive Disorder During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Insights From a Google Trends Analysis","Background As early as before the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, nearly one billion people worldwide suffered from mental health problems. Of all the mental health conditions, major depressive disorder (MDD) is the leading cause of global health-related burden.Ã‚Â During the COVID-19Ã‚Â pandemic, many uncertain factors affecting mental health accumulated, such as virus transmission, blockade and ban, public transport restrictions, closure of schools and enterprises, and reduction of social interaction, which led to an increase in the potential risk of MDD, further increasing the global health-relatedÃ‚Â burden. Methodology To better clarify the public interest in major depressive disorderÃ‚Â during theÃ‚Â COVID-19Ã‚Â pandemic, a Google Trends analysis wasÃ‚Â employed with data from December 2019 to December 2021, taking the cumulative diagnosis rate and cumulative mortality rate of COVID-19Ã‚Â as the reference standard, The changes in public interest and behavior in online searching for majorÃ‚Â depressive disorderÃ‚Â in the three countries most affected by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus (i.e. the United States, Brazil, and India) were evaluated. Results We observed that during the COVID-19Ã‚Â pandemic, publicÃ‚Â interest inÃ‚Â major depressive disorderÃ‚Â increased significantly on the Internet. At the same time, compared with the United States, this upward trend is more prominent in India and Brazil. The study found that the major depressive disorderÃ‚Â search index of the United States reached the maximum at the end of September 2021, the major depressive disorderÃ‚Â search index of Brazil reached the maximum at the beginning of July 2021, and the major depressive disorderÃ‚Â search index of India reached the maximum at the beginning of June 2021. The above time nodes are the first turning point of decline after the continuous surge of COVID-19 confirmed cases in the United States, Brazil, and India, indicating that there is an important time correlation between the surge of COVID-19 cases and the public online search term major depressive disorder. Conclusion The Google Trends analysis shows that public interest in major depressive disorderÃ‚Â is on the rise underÃ‚Â the COVID-19 pandemic and that COVID-19 may be associated with MDD. These findings deserve further exploration, especially as a growing body of research reports suggestsÃ‚Â that the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge in the prevalence of MDD. The epidemic alerts the vast majority of countries to urgently strengthen mental health systems and provide patients with the necessary interventions based on the determinants of poor mental health.","Li, Tan, Zou, Zeng, Kang, Chen","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.21228","20220217","covid-19; google trends; major depressive disorder (mdd); mental illness; pandemic; psychology health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-19","",27223,""

"The Profile of Caring: An Internationally Tested Model to Assess and Support Nurses During Pandemic","The psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on nurses, and subsequent increases in turnover, have been extensively documented. This article examines a profile of nurses which included (1) the degree to which direct-care nurses are caring for themselves, (2) the degree to which their manager acts in a caring way, (3) the degree to which nurses have clarity about their professional role and about how the system works, and (4) the degree to which nurses are satisfied with essential social and technical dimensions of their jobs, to help understand how some of the critical internal states and working relationships of nurses fit together as a model. To test the model, authors used structural equation modeling with a 35-item measurement tool in three countries (Russia, Serbia, and Turkey; <i>n</i> = 984), replicating a recent 8-country study. Results revealed a good model fit, similar to the original study, despite statistically significant differences in mean scores between the countries studied. Good model fit with a second group of countries, despite differences in mean scores, suggests that results from both studies can be used for a global conversation about how caring, clarity, and job satisfaction in nursing relate to one another. These results provide evidence that health facilities should study variables such as caring for self, caring by the unit or department manager, clarity of role and system, and job satisfaction to learn about, recover, and monitor nurses' health and experience of work as they emerge from the pandemic.","Nelson, MilutinoviÃ„â€¡, Kasimovskaya, Ãƒâ€¡elik, KiliÃƒÂ§, GÃƒÂ¶zÃƒÂ¼m, Vrbnjak","https://doi.org/10.1891/CN_2021_0069","20220218","caring; culture; international/global health; mental health; nursing; work environment; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Job Satisfaction; Nursing Staff, Hospital; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-19","",27226,""

"Risks of mental health outcomes in people with covid-19: cohort study","To estimate the risks of incident mental health disorders in survivors of the acute phase of covid-19. Cohort study. US Department of Veterans Affairs. Cohort comprising 153Ã¢â‚¬â€°848 people who survived the first 30 days of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and two control groups: a contemporary group (n=5Ã¢â‚¬â€°637Ã¢â‚¬â€°840) with no evidence of SARS-CoV-2, and a historical control group (n=5Ã¢â‚¬â€°859Ã¢â‚¬â€°251) that predated the covid-19 pandemic. Risks of prespecified incident mental health outcomes, calculated as hazard ratio and absolute risk difference per 1000 people at one year, with corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Predefined covariates and algorithmically selected high dimensional covariates were used to balance the covid-19 and control groups through inverse weighting. The covid-19 group showed an increased risk of incident anxiety disorders (hazard ratio 1.35 (95% confidence interval 1.30 to 1.39); risk difference 11.06 (95% confidence interval 9.64 to 12.53) per 1000 people at one year), depressive disorders (1.39 (1.34 to 1.43); 15.12 (13.38 to 16.91) per 1000 people at one year), stress and adjustment disorders (1.38 (1.34 to 1.43); 13.29 (11.71 to 14.92) per 1000 people at one year), and use of antidepressants (1.55 (1.50 to 1.60); 21.59 (19.63 to 23.60) per 1000 people at one year) and benzodiazepines (1.65 (1.58 to 1.72); 10.46 (9.37 to 11.61) per 1000 people at one year). The risk of incident opioid prescriptions also increased (1.76 (1.71 to 1.81); 35.90 (33.61 to 38.25) per 1000 people at one year), opioid use disorders (1.34 (1.21 to 1.48); 0.96 (0.59 to 1.37) per 1000 people at one year), and other (non-opioid) substance use disorders (1.20 (1.15 to 1.26); 4.34 (3.22 to 5.51) per 1000 people at one year). The covid-19 group also showed an increased risk of incident neurocognitive decline (1.80 (1.72 to 1.89); 10.75 (9.65 to 11.91) per 1000 people at one year) and sleep disorders (1.41 (1.38 to 1.45); 23.80 (21.65 to 26.00) per 1000 people at one year). The risk of any incident mental health diagnosis or prescription was increased (1.60 (1.55 to 1.66); 64.38 (58.90 to 70.01) per 1000 people at one year). The risks of examined outcomes were increased even among people who were not admitted to hospital and were highest among those who were admitted to hospital during the acute phase of covid-19. Results were consistent with those in the historical control group. The risk of incident mental health disorders was consistently higher in the covid-19 group in comparisons of people with covid-19 not admitted to hospital versus those not admitted to hospital for seasonal influenza, admitted to hospital with covid-19 versus admitted to hospital with seasonal influenza, and admitted to hospital with covid-19 versus admitted to hospital for any other cause. The findings suggest that people who survive the acute phase of covid-19 are at increased risk of an array of incident mental health disorders. Tackling mental health disorders among survivors of covid-19 should be a priority.","Xie, Xu, Al-Aly","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj-2021-068993","20220217","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-19","",27228,""

"Impact of COVID-19 on mental health research: is this the breaking point?","There are many structural problems facing the UK at present, from a weakened National Health Service to deeply ingrained inequality. These challenges extend through society to clinical practice and have an impact on current mental health research, which was in a perilous state even before the coronavirus pandemic hit. In this editorial, a group of psychiatric researchers who currently sit on the Academic Faculty of the Royal College of Psychiatrists and represent the breadth of research in mental health from across the UK discuss the challenges faced in academic mental health research. They reflect on the need for additional investment in the specialty and ask whether this is a turning point for the future of mental health research.","Sparasci, Bhui, Biswas, Chamberlain, Dubicka, Dudas, Farooq, Ford, Husain, Jones, Killaspy, Lee, Lingford-Hughes, Mulholland, Rubinsztein, Shankar, Sharma, Sinclair, Stone, Young","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjp.2022.8","20220217","Education and training; clinical governance; cost-effectiveness; economics; supervision","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-19","",27230,""
"START-online: acceptability and feasibility of an online intervention for carers of people living with dementia","With increasing numbers of people living with dementia relying on family to care for them at home, there is an urgent need for practical and evidence-based programs to support carers in maintaining their mental health and well-being. The objective of this study was to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of a modified STrAtegies for RelaTives (START) program delivered online (START-online). A mixed-methods non-blinded evaluation of START-online (using Zoom as videoconferencing platform) for acceptability and feasibility (completion rates and qualitative feedback through surveys and focus groups) and quantitative evaluation. This occurred at the National Ageing Research Institute, in metropolitan Victoria, Australia. Twenty-nine eligible carers were referred, 20 (70%) consented to the study. Of these, 16 (80%) completed all 8 sessions, 2 completed only 3 sessions, and 2 withdrew. Carers' qualitative feedback indicated that the therapist interaction was valued, content and online delivery of the program was acceptable. Feedback was mixed on the appropriate stage of caring. START-online was feasible and acceptable for carers, including those living outside of metropolitan areas who might otherwise be unable to access face-to-face programs. With the recent COVID-19 pandemic necessitating social distancing to avoid infection, interventions such as this one have increasing relevance in the provision of flexible services.","Loi, Tropea, Gaffy, Panayiotou, Capon, Chiang, Bryant, Doyle, Kelly, Livingston, Dow","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40814-022-00999-0","20220217","Caregivers; Dementia; Family carers; Intervention; Online","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-19","",27231,""
"The emotional side of post-traumatic stress reaction during COVID-19 pandemic: an Italian survey","Social restrictions due to COVID-19 might have had a significant impact on mental health. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of four emotional domains (nervousness, anger, numbness, physiological arousal) in a sample of citizens during the first pandemic wave in 2020, and their association with sociodemographic characteristics, housing conditions and lifestyle modifications. A cross-sectional study based on a self-administered online questionnaire was set up to investigate emotions. Respondents were recruited through a non-probabilistic snowball sampling approach. The SPAN questionnaire was used to measure emotions in the interviewed population. The association between emotions and independent variables (gender, age, marital status, educational level, working condition, housing condition, COVID-19 positivity, sleep disturbance, increase in alcohol consumption and decrease in physical activity) was assessed through the multivariate Poisson regression. A total of 6,675 subjects were included in the analysis. Almost half of respondents (48.9%) experienced nervousness, 41.3% anger, 15.6% numbness and 18.8% physiological arousal. Females were more likely to face nervousness, anger and physiological arousal. For all the outcomes a decreasing trend was observed from younger to older. Singles were more likely to experience numbness compared to married people. Increase in alcohol consumption was associated with nervousness, anger and numbness. Decrease in physical activity was associated with nervousness, anger and physiological arousal. Restless sleep was the variable most associated with all emotional domains. The first COVID-19 pandemic wave had a significant emotional impact on this sample, especially among younger people, singles and females. Even without reaching clinical relevance, these emotions could represent a form of psychological distress, which requires the implementation of preventive strategies, in particular regarding lifestyle care.","Ferrante, Rossini, Rousset, Ostacoli, Piccinelli, Carletto, Giordano","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-12749-1","20220217","COVID-19; Lifestyle; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-19","",27232,""

"Association of COVID-19 Lockdown during the Perinatal Period with Postpartum Depression: Evidence from Rural Areas of Western China","COVID-19 lockdown has posed unique challenges to postpartum women, but its association with postpartum depression is not well understood in the Global South. This study aims to evaluate the association between COVID-19 lockdown and postpartum depression in rural areas of western China. A multi-stage random cluster sampling method was used to select a cohort of pregnant and postpartum women with infants aged 0-6Ã‚Â months. We conducted an in-person survey before the COVID-19 lockdown and a phone survey right after the lockdown ended. We used multivariate regression models to evaluate the association between lockdown and postpartum depression. Subgroup analysis was performed to explore the role of social support. The overall prevalence of postpartum depression was 13.3%. Postpartum women who experienced the lockdown were less likely to be depressed than those who did not (adjusted odds ratio (aOR)Ã‚Â = .43, 95% confidence interval (CI)Ã‚Â = [.27, .70]). Lockdown was negatively associated with postpartum depression among postpartum women with low level of social support (aORÃ‚Â = .30, 95% CIÃ‚Â = [.18, .51]). COVID-19 lockdown was associated with lower likelihood of postpartum depression, potentially due to increased support from family. Future research is needed to explore targeted interventions to prevent postpartum depression among women from migrant worker families in rural China.","Wu, Ye, Wang, Sun, Ji, Zhou, Chang","https://doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2022.2036425","20220217","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-19","",27234,""
"Social Disconnection and Psychological Distress in Canadian Men During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly challenged many men's mental health. Efforts to control the spread of the virus have led to increasing social disconnection, fueling concerns about its long-term effects on men's mental health, and more specifically their experience of psychological distress. Social disconnection, psychological distress, and the relationship between them have yet to be formally explored in a Canadian male sample during the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study examined whether reduced social connection among men was associated with increased anxiety and depressive symptoms (psychological distress) and whether this association was moderated by living alone. The sample consisted of 434 help-seeking Canadian men who completed standardized measures. Analyses controlled for the potentially confounding effects of age and fear of COVID-19. Findings revealed that less social connection was associated with increased psychological distress. This association was not moderated by living alone, nor was living alone directly associated with psychological distress. Younger age and fear of COVID-19 were each independently associated with psychological distress. Socially disconnected men were more likely to experience anxiety and depressive symptoms, suggesting the need for interventions focussed on men's social connectedness, social support, and belongingness to help reduce some COVID-19-induced mental health risks.","Simpson, Oliffe, Rice, Kealy, Seidler, Ogrodniczuk","https://doi.org/10.1177/15579883221078145","20220217","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; men; psychological distress; social connectedness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-19","",27235,""
