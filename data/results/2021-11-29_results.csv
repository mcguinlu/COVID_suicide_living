"The relationship of COVID-19 related stress and media consumption with schizotypy, depression and anxiety","Studies report a strong impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related stressors on the mental wellbeing of general population. In this paper, we investigated whether COVID-19 related concerns and social adversity affected schizotypal traits, anxiety and depression using structural equational modelling. In mediation analyses, we furthermore explored whether these associations were mediated by healthy (sleep and physical exercise) or unhealthy behaviours (drug and alcohol consumption, excessive media use). We assessed schizotypy, depression and anxiety as well as, healthy and unhealthy behaviours and a wide range of sociodemographic scores using online surveys from residents of Germany and the United Kingdom over one year during the COVID-19 pandemic. Four independent samples were collected (April/ May 2020: N=781, September/ October 2020: N=498, January/ February 2021: N=544, May 2021: N= 486). The results revealed that COVID-19 related life concerns were significantly associated with schizotypy in the autumn 2020 and spring 2021 surveys, and with anxiety and depressive symptoms in all surveys; and social adversity significantly affected the expression of schizotypal traits in all but the spring 2020 survey, and depressive and anxiety symptoms in all samples. Importantly, we found that excessive media consumption (>4h per day) fully mediated the relationship of COVID-19 related life concerns and schizotypal traits in the winter 2021 survey. Furthermore, several of the surveys showed that excessive media consumption was associated with increased depressive and anxiety-related symptoms in people burdened by COVID-19 related life. The ongoing uncertainties of the pandemic and the restrictions on social life have a strong impact on mental well-being and especially the expression of schizotypal traits. The negative impact is further boosted by excessive media consumption, which is especially critical for people with high schizotypal traits.","Sarah Daimer; Lorenz Mihatsch; Sharon AS Neufeld; Graham K Murray; Franziska Knolle","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.11.26.21266896","20211128","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-29","",22861,""
"Relationships among High School Student-Athletes' Mental Health, Stressors, and Social Support during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Japan","Objectives: The impact of the spread of COVID-19 on the mental health and its mitigating factors of high school athletes is not fully understood. The aims of this study were 1) to describe the psychological distress and stressors experienced by high school athletes during the COVID-19 pandemic and to elucidate the relationships between them and 2) to determine the relationship between psychological distress and social support. Methods: Participants of this cross-sectional study were recruited from public high schools in East Japan. We conducted either an online or paper-based questionnaire survey from July 12 to 31, 2020, and used data collected from 3017 high school student athletes (valid response rate: 88.7%) for the analyses. We evaluated psychological distress (K6 [&ge;]10), stressors to athletes during the COVID-19 pandemic (SAC-19), and perceived social support from others. Logistic regression analysis was used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for developing psychological distress. Results: Among the participants, 764 (25.3%) experienced psychological distress. Among the five factors extracted from the SAC-19, self-restraint requests (OR = 1.03, 95% CI: 1.01-1.04), pressure from the surrounding environment (OR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.12-1.18), and difficulties in maintaining athletic activities (OR = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.12-1.21) increased the risk of psychological distress. On the other hand, participants who were satisfied with the support from family members (OR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.67-0.90), teammates (the same grade) (OR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.67-0.98), and coaches and instructors (OR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.65-0.91) showed lower psychological distress. Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic, high school athletes experienced more psychological distress than usual. Stressors such as self-restraint requests, pressure from the surrounding environment, and difficulties in maintaining athletic activities increased the risk. On the other hand, social support from family members, teammates (the same grade), and coaches and instructors can help alleviate these stressors.","Kaori Yamaguchi; Eriko Katagami; Ryoji Shinohara; Taishi Tsuji; Zentaro Yamagata; Hironobu Tsuchiya","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.11.25.21266885","20211128","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-29","",22862,""
"A systematic scoping review on the impact of the COVID-19 quarantine on the psychological wellbeing of medical students","Background The impact of social isolation, on the psychological wellbeing of medical students, who had to quarantine due to the COVID19 pandemic, is uncertain. A scoping review of the literature was therefore conducted to assess the extent of the published research in this area. Methods The PRISMA ScR guideline, was used to structure this study. A search strategy was carried out across six bibliographic databases. Data from the selected studies were extracted, and the following variables recorded. First author and year of publication, country of study, study design, sample size, focus group, mode of analysing impact of quarantine from COVID19 on mental health and results of the studies. Results A total of 223 articles were identified across the six databases, from which 69 duplicates were excluded resulting in 154 full text articles. Of these, 29 met the inclusion criteria. Following a review of the abstracts of these 29, ten full text articles were identified all of which were cross sectional studies. Sample sizes ranged from 182 to 860 students and all studies used a variety of self administered questionnaires to measure psychological wellbeing. Eight of the 10 articles showed that quarantine had a negative impact on the psychological wellbeing of medical students. Conclusion. The evidence is small but growing. Quarantine because of the COVID19 pandemic appears to have had a negative impact on the psychological wellbeing of medical students. There is a need for more studies to further evaluate this research question.","Divya Vythilingam; William Atiomo","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.11.28.21266956","20211128","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-29","",22863,""
