"Prevalence of COVID-19 and Long COVID in Collegiate Student Athletes from Spring 2020 to Fall 2021: A Retrospective Survey","Symptomatic COVID-19 and post-COVID conditions, also referred to as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) or Long COVID, have been widely reported in young, healthy people, but their prevalence has not yet been determined in student athletes. We surveyed a convenience sample of 18 collegiate school administrators, representing about 7,000 student athletes. According to their survey responses, 9.8% of student athletes tested positive for COVID-19 in spring 2020 and 25.4% tested positive in the academic year of fall 2020 to spring 2021. About 4% of student athletes who tested positive from spring 2020 to spring 2021 developed Long COVID, defined as new, recurring, or ongoing physical or mental health consequences occurring 4 or more weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study highlights that Long COVID occurs in healthy collegiate athletes and merits a larger study to determine population-wide prevalence.","Daisy Massey; Sharon Saydah; Blythe Adamson; Andrew Lincoln; Douglas Aukerman; Ethan Berke; Robby Sikka; Harlan Krumholz","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.06.12.22276048","20220616","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-17","",32900,""
"Mental health of healthcare workers in England during the COVID-19 pandemic: a longitudinal cohort study","Objective To examine variations in impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of all types of healthcare workers (HCWs) in England over the first 17 months of the pandemic. Method We undertook a prospective cohort study of 22,501 HCWs from 18 English acute and mental health NHS Trusts, collecting online survey data on common mental disorders (CMDs), depression, anxiety, alcohol use, and PTSD, from April 2020 to August 2021. We analysed these data cross-sectionally by time period (corresponding to periods the NHS was under most pressure), and longitudinally. Data were weighted to better represent Trust population demographics. Results The proportion of those with probable CMDs was greater during periods when the NHS was under most pressure (measured by average monthly deaths). For example, 55% (95%CI 53%, 58%) of participants reported symptoms of CMDs in April-June 2020 versus 47% (95%CI 46%, 48%) July-October 2020. Contrary to expectation, there were no major differences between professional groups (i.e. clinical and non-clinical staff). Younger, female, lower paid staff, who felt poorly supported by colleagues/managers, and who experienced potentially morally injurious events were most at risk of negative mental health outcomes. Conclusion Among HCWs, the prevalence of probable CMDs increased during periods of escalating pressure on the NHS, suggesting staff support should be increased at such points in the future, and staff should be better prepared for such situations via training. All staff, regardless of role, experienced poorer mental health during these periods, suggesting that support should be provided for all staff groups.","Danielle Lamb; Rafael Gafoor; Hannah Scott; Ewan Carr; Sharon Stevelink; Rosalind Raine; Matthew Hotopf; Neil Greenberg; Siobhan Hegarty; Ira Madan; Paul Moran; Richard Morriss; Dominic Murphy; Anne Marie Rafferty; Scott Weich; Sarah Dorrington; Simon Wessely","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.06.16.22276479","20220616","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-17","",32901,""
"Capturing the experiences of UK healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: A structural topic modelling analysis of 7,412 free-text survey responses","Background Healthcare workers (HCWs) have provided vital services during the COVID-19 pandemic, but existing research consists of quantitative surveys (lacking in depth or context) or qualitative interviews (with limited generalisability). Structural Topic Modelling (STM) of large-scale free-text survey data offers a way of capturing the perspectives of a wide range of HCWs in their own words about their experiences of the pandemic. Methods In an online survey distributed to all staff at 18 geographically dispersed NHS Trusts, we asked respondents, Is there anything else you think we should know about your experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic?. We used STM on 7,412 responses to identify topics, and thematic analysis on the resultant topics and text excerpts. Results We identified 33 topics, grouped into two domains, each containing four themes. Our findings emphasise: the deleterious effect of increased workloads, lack of PPE, inconsistent advice/guidance, and lack of autonomy; differing experiences of home working as negative/positive; and the benefits of supportive leadership and peers in ameliorating challenges. Themes varied by demographics and time: discussion of home working decreasing over time, while discussion of workplace challenges increased. Discussion of mental health was lowest between September-November 2020, between the first and second waves of COVID-19 in the UK. Discussion Our findings represent the most salient experiences of HCWs through the pandemic. STM enabled statistical examination of how the qualitative themes raised differed according to participant characteristics. This relatively underutilised methodology in healthcare research can provide more nuanced, yet generalisable, evidence than that available via surveys or small interview studies, and should be used in future research.","Danielle Lamb; Liam Wright; Hannah Scott; Bethany Croak; Sam Gnanapragasam; Mary Jane Docherty; Neil Greenberg; Matthew Hotopf; Sharon Stevelink; Rosalind Raine; Simon Wessely","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.06.16.22276487","20220616","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-17","",32902,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on College Students' at One of the Most Diverse Campuses in the United States: A Factor Analysis of Survey Data","Objective: This survey study is designed to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on stress among specific sub-populations of college students. Design, Settings and Participants: An online questionnaire was sent to the students from University of Nevada, Las Vegas between 2020 October and December to assess the psychological impact of COVID-19. A total of 2,091 respondents signed the consent form online and their responses were collected. Methods: The Perceived Stress levels of college students were analyzed via exploratory factor analysis of a survey of college students, which was collected at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV). An explanatory factor analysis was carried out on the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) results. We subsequently analyzed each factor using stepwise linear regression that focused on various socio-demographic groups. Results: A two-factor model was obtained using the explanatory factor analysis. After comparing with the past studies that investigated the factor structure of the PSS-10 scale, we identified these two factors as ""Anxiety"" and ""Irritability"". The subsequent stepwise linear regression analysis suggested that gender and age (P< 0.01) are significantly associated with both factors. However, the ethnicities of students are not significantly associated with both factors. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study that assessed the perceived stress of university students in the US during the COVID-19 pandemic. We showed that the PSS-10 scale could be summarized as a two-factor structure through an exploratory factor analysis. A stepwise regression approach was used and we found both of the factors are significantly associated with the gender of the participants. However, we found no significant association between both factors and ethnicity. In summary, our findings will help identify students with higher risk for stress and mental health issues in pandemics and future crises.","Bowen Liu; Edward Huynh; Chengcheng Li; Qing Wu","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.06.14.22276416","20220616","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-17","",32903,""
"Moral injury and psychological wellbeing in UK healthcare staff","Background: Potentially morally injurious events (PMIEs) can negatively impact mental health. The COVID-19 pandemic may have placed healthcare staff at risk of moral injury. Aim: To examine the impact of PMIE on healthcare staff wellbeing. Method: 12,965 healthcare staff (clinical and non-clinical) were recruited from 18 NHS-England trusts into a survey of PMIE exposure and wellbeing. Results: PMIEs were significantly associated with adverse mental health symptoms across healthcare staff. Specific work factors were significantly associated with experiences of moral injury, including being redeployed, lack of PPE, and having a colleague die of COVID-19. Nurses who reported symptoms of mental disorders were more likely to report all forms of PMIEs than those without symptoms (AOR 2.7; 95% CI 2.2, 3.3). Doctors who reported symptoms were only more likely to report betrayal events, such as breach of trust by colleagues (AOR 2.7, 95% CI 1.5, 4.9). Conclusions: A considerable proportion of NHS healthcare staff in both clinical and non-clinical roles report exposure to PMIEs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Prospective research is needed to identify the direction of causation between moral injury and mental disorder as well as continuing to monitor the longer term outcomes of exposure to PMIEs.","Victoria Williamson; Danielle Lamb; Matthew Hotopf; Rosalind Raine; Sharon Stevelink; Simon Wessely; Mary Jane Docherty; Ira Madan; Dominic Murphy; Neil Greenberg","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.06.16.22276476","20220616","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-17","",32904,""

"Organic Personality Disorder Following Mixed Sars-Cov-2 And Herpes Simplex Viral Encephalitis","We describe a 30-year-old functionally active male, who had sudden onset of fever, sever headache, altered sensorium followed by neck rigidity for 3 days duration. Nasopharyngeal swab for covid 19 was taken suspecting covid 19 encephalitis which turned out to be positive. CT brain revealed a hypodense lesion in the left anterior temporal lobe. CSF analysis showed lymphocytosis and elevated protein. RT-PCR of CSF detected HSV DNA. Patient was treated in an intensive care unit with intravenous antiviral drugs and was given oxygen support for hypoxemia. HIV was seronegative. After 2 weeks, there was significant alteration of the habitual pattern of premorbid behavior. Patient was brought to the psychiatric OPD with complaints of altered emotional behavior characterized by emotional lability, unprovoked aggression, reduced ability to persevere with goal directed activities and significant cognitive impairment. On MSE, patient has perseveration of speech, labile affect with no thought or perceptual disturbances. Combined infection of COVID 19 and HSV encephalitis is a rare entity, posing a dilemma of possible causative factor for the neuropsychiatric manifestation. Neuropsychiatric manifestations of HSV encephalitis include personality/behavioral change, seizures and cognitive impairment. No such recognized syndromes have been identified with covid 19 encephalitis except for delirium, depressive and anxiety states and post-traumatic stress disorder. The possible pathophysiology behind covid 19 encephalitis causing neuropsychiatric manifestation is immune/antibody mediated mechanism. Hence in this case, the contribution of SARS-CoV-2 causing such neuropsychiatric manifestation cannot be ruled out. References 1.

"Health Related Quality Of Life And Depression In Older Adults With Knee Osteoarthritis Pain - Cross-Sectional Telephonic Survey In Covid 19 Pandemic","Background In a situation of COVID 19 pandemic subjects suffering from osteoarthritis pain will be suffering from mental and physical symptoms due to lockdown and there will be difficulty to assess the healthcare facility. According to the World Mental Health Atlas (2014), the number of psychiatrist per lakh of population in India was 0.75, with even lesser number of psychologists and psychiatric social workers. Even the median number of psychiatrists is only 0.2/100,000 in India as opposed to a global median of 3/100,000 population. Telepsychiatry can bring about a revolution as in capacity building by leveraging digital technology in the present situation. This study helps to find those KOA subjects who are suffering depression and to improve their quality of life by providing them aids of treatment. Aims and Objectives Aim To study the health-related quality of life and depression in subjects with knee osteoarthritis pain. Objectives PRIMARY 1. To study the health-related quality of life in older adult subjects with knee osteoarthritis pain. 2.To study the severity of depression in older adult subjects with knee osteoarthritis pain. SECONDARY 1.To study the relation between health-related quality of life and knee osteoarthritis pain in older adult subjects. 2.To study the relation between knee osteoarthritis pain and depression. 3.To study the relation between health-related quality of life and depression among studied older adult subjects. Methods Subjects aged more than 50 full filling selection criteria are recruited from the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, KGMU, Lucknow. 1.Mobile numbers of subjects from the records available in the department of Orthopaedics were collected from JANUARY 2018 to JANUARY 2020 2.Subjects those who were on treatment for knee osteoarthritis from the department of Orthopaedic Surgery were contacted over telephone and recruited according to the selection criteria for the study. Call was recorded after taking consent. 3.Subjects were contacted during the daytime 10 am -2pm. If patients subjects and attenders were not comfortable with the time, they were asked for the suitable time to contact them. 4.Subjects were approached for three times. If not answering for three times they were considered as out of reach 5.Survey was completed in maximum 2 sessions,15 minutes each if the subject was not comfortable in answering in a single session. 6.Proper introduction of doctor calling them was given to the subjects and attenders and the purpose of telephone call was informed to the subjects and attenders. 7.After the informed consent which has been recorded on the telephone subjects were interviewed on the basis of sociodemographic questionnaire. 8.Following basic interview subjects were evaluated using scales which includes PHQ-9, SF-12 and WOMAC. 9.HR QOL was measured by SF-12 which includes general health, limitation of activities, physical health, emotional health and social activities. 10.PHQ-9 to assess the diagnosis and severity of depression was applied. 11.WOMAC scale was applied which gives the status of pain, stiffness and physical disabilities. 12.Each assessment took 20-30 minutes. All the answers given over phone were recorded by the principal investigator. 13.If subjects and attenders, ask for advice regarding the treatment were addressed properly following guidance from consultants. 14.For the subjects with depression, advice was given to consult the geriatric mental health helpline number of KGMU. 15.Subjects were divided into 2 main groups depressed and non-depressed and also divided into three groups based on KL grading into KL grade 2, KL grade 3 and KL grade 4 and further analysis was done accordingly. Ethics UNIVERSITY ETHICS COMMITTEE-103rd ECM II B-Thesis/P24, N0;1391/Ethics/2020 Results Results showed that there is significant difference in pain and general health related quality of life based on the KL grading of Knee osteoarthritis.(P=0.02,P=0.04)There is significant difference in pain between males and females and females have more severity of pain,(p=0.001) Am ng the depressed and non-depressed group, depressed group have more pain ,(P=0.026) There is significant difference in pain based on duration of Knee osteoarthritis, (p=0.05).There is significant difference in physical function between depressed and non- depressed group, depressed group having more physical dysfunction. There is significant association between stiffness and health related quality of life, P=0.001. Pain is positively correlated with depression,(P=0.001). Study concluded that pain and general health related quality of life worsens with higher grading of Knee osteoarthritis. Pain is more in females and depressed group. Physical function is lesser in depressed group. As stiffness increases health related quality of life decreases. Pain increases as the duration of Knee osteoarthritis increases and pain is correlated with pain. Discussion Depression in the elderly may emerge because of general medical illnesses, especially those, such as OA, that cause prolonged suffering, leading the patient to physical disability and loss of autonomy. The impact of depression is important, since depressed individuals are more likely to report chronic pain, or pain of greater intensity. This fact can be a complicating factor in the process of treatment adherence and may still increase the perception of pain. The depressive disorder, when associated with physical illness, can cause the emergence of anxiety symptoms. Women have higher rates of depression, anxiety and need family support and it is more common in age above 60. Conclusion The studies previously done ordinarily incorporate pain and function scores however have not regularly included psychosocial factors evaluating QoL, which likewise impacts how patients feel, work, and endurance. Study concluded that there is significant difference in pain and general health related quality of life based on the KL grading of KOA. Pain and general health related quality of life worsens with higher grading of KOA. There is significant difference in pain between males and females and depressed and non-depressed group. Pain is more in females and depressed group. There is significant difference in physical function between depressed and non-depressed group. Physical function is lesser in depressed group. There is significant difference in pain based on duration of Knee osteoarthritis. Pain increases as the duration of KOA increases. As stiffness increases health related quality of life decreases. Pain is positively correlated with depression. 73rd Annual National Conference of Indian Psychiatric Society 2022 January 20 - 23, Vizag Conventions, PM Palem, Visakhapatnam Theme : Bridging Minds...

"Digital Technology and Media Use by Adolescents: Latent Class Analysis","Background: Digital technology and media use is integral to adolescentsâ€™ lives and has been associated with both positive and negative health consequences. Previous studies have largely focused on understanding technology behaviors and outcomes within adolescent populations, which can promote assumptions about adolescent technology use as homogeneous. Furthermore, many studies on adolescent technology use have focused on risks and negative outcomes. To better understand adolescent digital technology use, we need new approaches that can assess distinct profiles within study populations and take a balanced approach to understanding the risks and benefits of digital technology use. Objective: The purpose of this study was to identify profiles of adolescent technology use within a large study population focusing on four evidence-based constructs: technology ownership and use, parental involvement, health outcomes, and well-being indicators. Methods: Adolescent-parent dyads were recruited for a cross-sectional web-based survey using the Qualtrics (Qualtrics International, Inc) platform and panels. Technology use measures included ownership of devices, social media use frequency, and the Adolescentsâ€™ Digital Technology Interactions and Importance scale. Parent involvement measures included household media rules, technology-related parenting practices, parent social media use frequency, and the parent-child relationship. Health outcome measures included physical activity, sleep, problematic internet use, and mental health assessments. Well-being indicators included mental wellness, communication, and empathy. We used latent class analysis (LCA) to identify distinct profile groups across the aforementioned 4 critical constructs. Results: Among the 3981 adolescent-parent dyads recruited, adolescent participants had a mean age of 15.0 (SD 1.43) years;a total of 46.3% (1842/3981) were female, 67.8% (2701/3981) were White, and 75% (2986/3981) lived in a household with an income above the poverty line. The LCA identified 2 discrete classes. Class 1 was made up of 62.8% (2501/3981) of the participants. Class 1 participants were more likely than Class 2 participants to report family-owned devices, have lower technology importance scores, have household technology rules often centered on content, have positive parent relationships and lower parent social media use, and report better health outcomes and well-being indicators. Conclusions: Findings from this national cross-sectional survey using LCA led to 2 distinct profile groups of adolescent media use and their association with technology use and parent involvement as well as health and well-being outcomes. The two classes included a larger Class 1 (Family-Engaged Adolescents) and a smaller Class 2 (At-Risk Adolescents). The findings of this study can inform interventions to reinforce positive technology use and family support.","Moreno, Megan A.; Binger, Kole, Zhao, Qianqian, Eickhoff, Jens, Minich, Matt, Yalda Tehranian, Uhls","https://www.google.com/search?q=Digital+Technology+and+Media+Use+by+Adolescents:+Latent+Class+Analysis","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: JMIR Pediatrics and Parenting; 5(2), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-17","",32910,""
"Newer Determinants of an Old Problem: Factors for Suicidal Behaviour in the Current Era","BACKGROUND: The national record crime bureau of India reported more than 1.53 lakh suicide in 2020, which is the highest in the last decade. Suicide can be considered a public health problem. Suicide risk assessment is complex, having contributions from biopsychosocial and environmental influences. We aim to discuss the role of COVID Pandemic, behavioural addictions and climate change in suicidality. FINDINGS: COVID has brought grief, physical disability, loss of employment and financial constraints, loneliness, and scarcity of healthcare resources. Isolation and pandemic related anxiety can lead to self-harm ideation in certain vulnerable populations like elderly, homeless, dependent and those having chronic physical and mental illnesses. Additionally, there is a high probability of neuropsychiatric symptoms in individuals with post-COVID syndrome with an increase in suicidal behaviour. Behavioural addictions like gambling disorder, gaming disorder and sexual addictions have a high association with suicidality. Premorbid impulsivity, male gender, unemployment, comorbidities and poor support have been demonstrated to have a higher association in people with a behavioural addiction and suicidality. Increased suicide risk along with other neuropsychiatric complications has been reported due to poor air quality, increased temperature & rainfall changes. Natural disasters like hurricanes or earthquakes are known to have both acute and long term impacts on mental health & suicidality with higher impact on environmentally motivated migrants and displaced populations. CONCLUSION: There is a convincing association of these three conditions in increasing suicide risk, making these an issue of global concern. Robust scientific evidence should be generated for the same which can then guide clinicians & policymakers to act decisively on the issue.","Mohapatra, Satyakam, Panda, Udit Kumar, Parida, Manoj Kumar","https://www.google.com/search?q=Newer+Determinants+of+an+Old+Problem:+Factors+for+Suicidal+Behaviour+in+the+Current+Era","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Indian journal of psychiatry; 64(Suppl 3):S643-S644, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-17","",32911,""
"Effects Of Lockdown On Sleep Pattern In The General Population During Covid-19 Pandemic","Background and aim: COVID-19 Pandemic hit India in January 2020. In order to curb the spread of the virus, a nationwide lockdown was instated on March 24th. The lockdown has had an adverse psychological impact on the general population. Sleep is essential because of its many benefits for mental and physical health. Lack of sleep can impair both mental and physical functioning like decision making, mood changes, anxiety symptoms, jeopardize immune response, increase accidents and increase medical expenditures. The current study was aimed at assessing the sleep patterns during the pandemic in the general public. Material and method: This was a cross sectional, observational descriptive survey study conducted through social media platforms. Socio demographic data such age, gender, marital status, etc along with sleep schedules, working routine was assessed using a semi structured proforma. Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and Patient Health Questionnaire- 4 (PHQ-4) were tools used to assess insomnia;depression and anxiety respectively. Result: A total of 124 subjects were included in the study. Sleep patterns revealed a delay in routine bed times, with a reduction in sleep quality and increase in total sleep duration. Moderate to severe insomnia was seen in 9% of patients and 29% had subthreshold insomnia. Anxiety was found in 19% and 22% had depressive symptoms. Conclusion: Lockdown due to the COVID 19 pandemic was associated with changes in sleep pattern, quantity and quality of night-time sleep and had also led to manifestation of emotional symptoms in the general population.","Mishra â€“ Lf, Kshirod K.; Reshamvala â€“ Lom/A, Ahmed M.; Sathe â€“ Lom/H, Harshal, John â€“ Lf, Sally","https://www.google.com/search?q=Effects+Of+Lockdown+On+Sleep+Pattern+In+The+General+Population+During+Covid-19+Pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Indian journal of psychiatry; 64(Suppl 3):S537-S537, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-17","",32912,""

Previous literature has focused on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on social and economic infrastructure and the instabilities that are evidenced as a consequence of the coronavirus outbreak. 2 A number of studies have identified the abrupt drop in the global economy and the responses of the global stock market as evidenced in reported stock indices. 2 Studies have also shown a significant increase in the suicide rates. 3,4 and the economic slump has resulted in millions of people facing job loss or job insecurity. 5 There is a need for companies to adopt new methods of working that recognise the impact of the pandemic on the workforce and their families. Studies also show that the inevitable changes made to both work-related and other organisational structures introduced to keep people safe have had negative consequence on mental health of the people they seek to protect. 6 THE IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON MENTAL HEALTH IN THE WORKPLACE AND ON THE WORKFORCE There are a number of studies on earlier epidemics such as SARS, Ebola, and so on, which evidence the emotional distress seen in the general public at times of health crisis.

"Virtual Reality Behavioral Activation for Adults With Major Depressive Disorder: Feasibility Randomized Controlled Trial","Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a global crisis with increasing incidence and prevalence. There are many established evidence-based psychotherapies (EBPs) for depression, but numerous barriers still exist;most notably, access and dissemination. Virtual reality (VR) may offer some solutions to existing constraints of EBPs for MDD. Objective: We aimed to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and tolerability of using VR as a method of delivering behavioral activation (BA) for adults diagnosed with MDD during a global pandemic and to explore for signs of clinical efficacy by comparing VR-enhanced BA (VR BA) to a standard BA treatment and a treatment as usual control group for individuals diagnosed with MDD. Methods: A feasibility trial using a 3-armed, unblinded, randomized controlled pilot design was conducted. The study took place remotely via Zoom telehealth visits between April 8, 2020, and January 15, 2021. This study used a 3-week, 4-session protocol in which VR BA participants used a VR headset to complete their BA homework. Feasibility was measured using dropout rates, serious adverse events, completion of homework, an adapted telepresence scale, the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire, the Brief Agitation Measure, and an adapted Technology Acceptance Model. Efficacy was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaireâ€“9. Results: Of the 35 participants assessed for eligibility, 13 (37%) were randomized into VR BA (n=5, 38%), traditional BA (n=4, 31%), or a treatment as usual control (n=4, 31%). The mean age of the 13 participants (5/13, 38% male;7/13, 54% female;and 1/13, 8% nonbinary or third gender) was 35.4 (SD 12.3) years. This study demonstrated VR BA feasibility in participants with MDD through documented high levels of acceptability and tolerability while engaging in VR-induced pleasurable activities in conjunction with a brief BA protocol. No adverse events were reported. This study also illustrated that VR BA may have potential clinical utility for treating MDD, as the average VR BA participantâ€™s clinical severity decreased by 5.67 points, signifying a clinically meaningful change in severity from a moderate to a mild level of depression as per the Patient Health Questionnaireâ€“9 score. Conclusions: The findings of this study demonstrate that VR BA is safe and feasible to explore for the treatment of MDD. This study documented evidence that VR BA may be efficacious and justifies further examination in an adequately powered randomized controlled trial. This pilot study highlights the potential utility that VR technology may offer patients with MDD, especially those who have difficulty accessing real-world pleasant activities. In addition, for those having difficulty accessing care, VR BA could be adapted as a first step to help people improve their mood and increase their motivation while waiting to connect with a health care professional for other EBPs.

"Neuropsychiatric Aspects of COVID-19","Background COVID-19 pandemic has led to widespread psychosocial distress. In addition to pandemic associated psychological distress, there is increasing evidence to suggest direct effects of the COVID- 19 virus itself and the subsequent host immunologic response on Central Nervous System manifesting in the form of wide range of neuropsychiatric complications in both acute and post recovery phase. Neuropsychiatric manifestations The data available from similar epidemics of SARS and MERS CoV, revealed common neuropsychiatric manifestations including (a) Neurological: Headache, Impaired sensorium ranging from mild drowsiness to delirium and coma, dysfunction of olfaction and taste sensation, seizures, encephalitis, encephalopathy, Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), acute cerebrovascular events, narcolepsy and other neuromuscular and demyelinating processes (b) Psychiatric: Depressed mood, anxiety, impaired memory and insomnia in acute phase and even in post-illness stage, depressed mood, insomnia, anxiety, irritability, memory impairment, fatigue, traumatic memories and sleep disorder were frequently reported. A diverse group of presentations, increasingly referred to as â€œlong Covid,â€ is also being described in patients who reported with wide variety of symptoms including disabling fatigue and cognitive difficulties, persisting for many months after acute infection. Psychoneuroimmunology of COVID-19 Though exact neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2 is unknown , the present available data based on laboratory studies on SARS-CoV-2 and research on its taxonomically similar coronaviruses such as SARS-COV and MERS-COV suggest its potential to enter the CNS via angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptors. Other mechanisms causing CNS dysfunction include cytokine driven inflammatory responses and wider systemic effects such as endotheliopathy, breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, and clotting abnormalities. Additional mechanisms for neuropsychiatric disorders include autoimmunity and psychological trauma of life threatening illness and pandemic related socioeconomic stressors. The relative contributions of these mechanisms to neuropsychiatric sequelae remain largely unknown. Role of psychiatrist Psychiatrist has an important role in not only managing concerns, fears, and misconceptions at the local community and broader public level but also in early identification, prevention, and treatment of COVID-19 related neuropsychiatric manifestations, and hence should be an integral part of COVID-19 treating team. Management The management of neuropsychiatric complications of COVID requires a multidisciplinary team input due to the multisystemic nature of the illness, particularly in severe cases. Adopting bio-psychosocial strategies and judicious use of psychotropic medications is essential for better results. Conclusion Covid-19 is likely to have important neuropsychiatric effects in both the short and longer term.

While there has been extensive work on the effect of pandemic on the mental health of the general population, studies on the impact of pandemic on people with mental illness are limited. Aims- The study aimed to ascertain Psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic in patients with pre-existing mental illness and its correlation with clinical, socio-demographical factors. Methodology â€“ 100 participants aged 18-65 years, who visited Psychiatry OPD, were included. The psychological impact due to life stress was assessed using the Impact of Event Scale. Current Psycho-pathology was assessed by DASS-21 scale. The perceived loneliness and social isolation were assessed by De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale. Results- Out of 100 participants, 55% reported to have faced difficulties during pandemic, 64% reported worsening of mental illness, 40% faced difficulty in accessing medications, resulting in non-compliance. 61% managed to visit hospital during pandemic, while 35% could not access consultation services. Only 4% sought teleconsultation. Psychological impact of COVID was found to be positively correlated with the perceived loneliness and social isolation during quarantine(r=11.619, p=0.01). Discussion- These results depict a significant impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health patients with psychiatric illness that is exacerbated by social isolation. Quarantine and social distancing lead to elevated levels of loneliness and social isolation, which in turn produce repercussions on mental health. Also family dynamics and difficulty to access mental health care, appear to play a significant role. Conclusion- These results highlight a significant impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health of psychiatric patients and elucidates prominent association with demographic factors and the difficulty to access mental health care. There is need to strengthen telepsychiatry services in recent times.","Khadanga, Poornima, Mithra, Raman Sree Pruthvi, Pawar, Gaurav, Jha, Urmi","https://www.google.com/search?q=IMPACT+OF+COVID-19+PANDEMIC+IN+PATIENTS+WITH+PRE-EXISTING+MENTAL+ILLNESS+VISITING+OUTPATIENT+DEPARTMENT+OF+TERTIARY+HEALTH+CARE+CENTRE-+A+CROSS+SECTIONAL+OBSERVATIONAL+STUDY","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Indian journal of psychiatry; 64(Suppl 3):S532-S533, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-17","",32925,""
"Mental Health Support Group: A model to create Mental Health Workforce for Health Care","The COVID pandemic led to an increase in psychological issues. These issues were even more prominent among the Health Care Workers (HCWs) as they had significant risk factors such as long working hours, direct exposure to infection, isolation and quarantine, seeing loss around them, fear of carrying the virus home etc. It is important to address their psychological issues. The already existing mental health resources are limited in terms of numbers as well as accessibility. This led to a need to create a mental health workforce at the local level for the HCWs. We present the inception, training and service delivery of such a model from a medical college as a model to involve various disciplines and categories of staff to create a workforce.

"ENT/Audiology Department of Samoa welcomes the introduction of the Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV) into the national childhood immunisation program","The Pacific Island region is estimated to have among the highest levels of otitis media (middle ear infections) and secondary hearing loss in the world [3], and a public health approach has already been advocated for its prevention, early identification, and management in the Pacific Islands [4]. The significant factors contributing to pneumococcal carriage and density continue to be young age, residential location, living with young children, low family income, and symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection [10]. Again, the lesson we can draw from the Papua New Guinean experience is that PCV is but one part of a package of public health care measures: childhood immunisations should not overshadow the role of environmental health measures in reducing the risk of infections.

"Coping with continuing pandemic: Role of Social Psychiatry Proposal from the World Association of Social Psychiatry (WASP)","Covid-19 pandemic has been an unprecedented crisis seen by the humanity in the last two years with a magnitude no less than the two world wars. Globally, more than 260 million cases have been reported and more than 5 million deaths have been attributed to Covid-19 till the end of November 2021. Despite introduction of the vaccine nearly a year ago, though there has been a big hope of controlling the pandemic, there have been repeated rises in infections due to the mutations in virus, like the coming of Delta, Delta plus and Omicron variants, which are increasingly infectious. There have already been two waves of the pandemic with the second wave being very lethal in India. The pandemic had both direct as well as indirect effects on mental health of the population across allover the world. Many countries had to resort to lockdowns to control the spread of infection, which had serious economic consequences, adding to the mental and social distress. Other infection control measures like quarantine and social isolation, and inability of the persons with existing mental illnesses to access treatment further added to the problem. Introduction of vaccine brought some hope, but it has been a great challenge to cover such a huge population with vaccine alongwith dealing with vaccine hesitancy. This symposium being proposed by the World Association of Social Psychiatry. The symposium will assess the current situation with focus on psychosocial aspects, social psychiatry approach used to deal with the mental health issues, challenges ahead and the lessons learnt to deal with any future challenges of similar nature.

"Depression and Anxiety in inpatients of dedicated COVID-19 Hospital","Background: COVID-19 is a RNA virus predominantly involving lungs causing mild to severe respiratory illness. Psychiatric disorders are much common in COVID 19 pandemic including depression 33% prevalence and anxiety 28% prevalence in general population(1). The interactions between immune systems and neurotransmitters(2), neurotrophism(3) and psychological stressors(4) emerged as a mechanisms underpinning mood disorders, psychosis. However no studies are done in Indian population in estimating burden of Anxiety and depression in inpatients of dedicated COVID-19 hospital. Aims: 1. To estimate the burden of depression and anxiety in COVID 19 positive patients in a tertiary hospital. 2. To evaluate its relationship with inflammatory markers. Methods: Patients were screened during tele-couselling after taking verbal consent using GAD7 and PHQ-9 questionnaire to assess anxiety and depression. Patients were examined in the wards;those patients who fulfill diagnostic criteria for depression and anxiety according to ICD-10 were included. Routine inflammatory markers sent during admission were noted, patients are followed up during course of hospital stay, and treatment response was noted. Results: Prevalence of depression is 13.6% and anxiety 17.8% in hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID 19 infection. Females suffered more for both anxiety and depression. Positively correlated with inflammatory markers especially serum LDH and baseline systemic immune inflammatory index (SII) which reflects immune response and systemic inflammation to infection. Conclusion: Programs should be designed to reduce the stress in general population in collaboration with mental health professionals. 1. Luo M, Guo L, Yu M, Jiang W, Wang H.

"Are the Collaborative Video Consultations module in Diploma in Primary Care Psychiatry helpful","Introduction: The â€˜Diploma in Primary Care Psychiatryâ€™ (DPCP) is a 1-year, module-based, digitally-driven, hybrid format, distance education training program conducted by Tele-Medicine Centre, Department of Psychiatry at National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences, Bengaluru for in-service MBBS doctors [Primary Care Doctors (PCDs)] of various states. This course can catalyze Indiaâ€™s National Mental Health Program for the capacity building of PCDs. We discuss the outcome of â€œCollaborative Video Consultationâ€ (CVC) modules that mimics real-time expert guidance for the DPCP course conducted for MBBS in-service doctors of Bihar, India. Methodology: In one year, we supervised 217 CVCs. We examined the diagnostic concurrence between PCDs and tele-psychiatrists, reviewed the CVCs, and generated learning themes. Results: Among the total sample (n=217), 64 (29.9%) patients had Severe Mental Disorders, 73(32.8%) had Common Mental Disorders, and 36(14.7%) had substance use disorders. The diagnostic concurrence was 83%, with a kappa agreement of 0.77 (p&lt;0.001). Learning themes that emerged ranged from diagnostic clarification to enhancement of clinical skills. Discussion: It is the first study to evaluate the impact of the CVC module. The 83% diagnostic concordance reflects on the overall effectiveness of the training modules. The learning themes that emerged were quite diverse and involved various aspects of psychiatric care. Hence, this training model in a post-COVID world is a feasible and scalable option for training primary care doctors in India, leading to a reduced treatment gap and global burden of disease. Introduction: Primary healthcare provides universally accessible â€˜essential healthcareâ€™ to individuals and families in the community. In India, the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in the National Mental Health Survey from a representative adult population was 10.6%1, and the treatment gap is more than 70% for all psychiatric disorders. Psychiatric disorders are major contributors to the global health burden1. To address this, empowering Primary Care Doctors (PCDs) in identifying, assessing, and managing first-line psychiatric illness in a primary care setting is the feasible strategy given the countryâ€™s inadequate psychiatrist to patient ratio. The concept of comprehensive primary healthcare services has been highlighted by the Bhore committee2 and demonstrated to be feasible through the landmark Bellary model3. However, with a population of 1.4 billion, India needs more novel methods to implement and sustain community psychiatry services through District Mental Health Program (DMHP). After the Mental Health care Act (MHCA) 20174, mental health services delivery in the community and deinstitutionalization have become a legal mandate in India. Since 2015 there has been a paradigm shift in the district mental health program delivery in Bihar state5 through an innovative, collaborative model between NIMHANS, National Health Mission (NHM) state health society, Bihar. The DMHP program has successfully trained several health care providers from Bihar Doctors and nurses from Bihar over the last three years. In 2017-18, eleven district medical officers were trained to initiate DMHP services.6 Despite this, there was a need to better prepare the primary doctors in psychiatry to provide mental healthcare services, especially given the lack of formal Psychiatric training beyond two weeks in undergraduate in most medical colleges. PCD training in mental health care involves several logistic challenges such as inadequate undergraduate training in psychiatry, time constraints in learning due to their hectic clinical work, lack of adequate human resources, and failure of multiple capacity-building programs through traditional classroom training. To overcome these challenges, Diploma in Primary Psychiatry (DPCP), a 1-year modular-based digitally-driven hybrid training program, was conceptualized by the Telemedicine Centre, Department of Psychiatry at Nationa Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences) (NIMHANS) Bengaluru for DMHP capacity building. This course can be the catalyst to further mobilize Indiaâ€™s National Mental Health Program for the capacity building of PCDs. DPCP program was designed to cater to PCDs training in psychiatry with minimal disruption to their clinical duties with the incentive of career enhancement through an additional diploma degree. This program was initiated first with PCDs of Uttarakhand in collaboration with the State Government. The Uttarakhand DPCP program was reasonably effective and paved the way to conceptualizing other telemedicine-based innovative approaches to mental health capacity enhancement7. This study discusses the outcome of one of the modules, the Collaborative Video Consultation Module (CVC) (on-the-job supervised training by a board-certified psychiatrist) of the DPCP program for in-service MBBS doctors from Bihar. To evaluate the outcome of this training program, this paper focuses on assessing PCDâ€™s ability to diagnose psychiatric disorders and their perception of learnings from the CVC module. Methodology: This paper was based on findings from the DPCP program conducted for in-service MBBS doctors of Bihar from February 2020 to March 2021. The overview of the program has been explained in brief below. So far, Telemedicine Centre, NIMHANS, Bengaluru, awarded DPCP to 20 in-service MBBS doctors of Uttarakhand. It follows the hybrid model of training with initial brief (5 days) onsite training at a tertiary care psychiatry department (NIMHANS), which has classroom sessions, consultation-based training (real-time observations of psychiatric assessments of patients and management), and also visit a DMHP center to understand the working of DMHP. This brief onsite module followed by everything digital modules aiming for direct skill transfer using adult learning principles (andragogy)8. The details about different modules of DPCP are described elsewhere9(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32361210/) (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30166682/). In continuation with the collaboration and to enable the provision of DMHP services across all districts of Bihar, primary care doctors from 19 districts of Bihar and 3 Prisons were enrolled in a one-year DPCP program. The curriculum for DPCP is Clinical Schedules of Primary Care Psychiatry version 2.2(CSP), which has a validated screening procedure and a heuristic point of care manual designed for PCDs10. The 22 PCDs came to NIMHANS from 17th February 2020 to 22nd February 2020. In this module, PCDs were trained in psychiatric history-taking and mental state examination through clinical demonstration and onsite classes. In-Person consultation-based training in the outpatient clinic was conducted at First contact and follow-up outpatient services of the Department of Psychiatry, NIMHANS, Bengaluru. All PCDs underwent didactic teaching sessions in Common mental disorders (CMDs), teaching sessions on specialized topics such as Emergency psychiatry, Geriatric Psychiatry, Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Forensic and legal aspects of psychiatry, along with a visit to DMHP services at Chikkaballapur district, about 70 km from Bangalore, Karnataka. They also received orientation on Tele- On-Consultation-Training sessions and made them familiarised with the digital modules of DPCP and the telemedicine platforms. On returning to their workplace- District hospital settings, Digital Modules were initiated. This paper focuses on findings from the collaborative video consultation (CVC) module conducted throughout the course, especially after Tele on-consultation training module. CVC module Format: In the CVC module, instant video consultation is sought by trainee PCDs from tele-psychiatrist, which is a real-time second opinion from a board-certified psychiatrist. The Tele-psychiatrist was available to the PCDs during working hours and occasionally for emergency cases, anytime for discussion/advice. PCDs choose to discuss their selected patients to decide the best treatment for them or any ifficulty in diagnosis. Some of these patients were also seen in follow-ups up to 6 months whenever these patients visit these doctors (one of the criteria of formative assessment of DPCP course). Soon after CVC, a tele-psychiatrist enters all clinical data in a specially designed proforma containing learning points and whether PCD felt skill enhancement or not from each CVC. Diagnosis of the patient population is made as per clinical schedules of primary care psychiatry. Whenever clinical presentation is not allowing CSP diagnoses, ICD-10 CDDG diagnosis is considered. PCDs discussed several cases ranging from children, adolescents with mental health issues to elderly individuals with psychiatric complaints. PCDs were also actively involved in providing care to psychiatry patients who could not follow up with their treating psychiatrists during the 1st wave of the COVID 19 pandemic and travel restrictions during the lockdown. They also discussed patients presenting to emergencies with psychiatric disorders. The PCDs were motivated and actively involved in helping patients who needed psychiatry care, including counseling patients in isolation centers. Diagnostic concurrence was evaluated from similarities/differences in PCD and tele-psychiatrist diagnosis. The authors screened all the data entered in the CVC, and pre-defined learning themes were generated. The learning themes were finalized after agreement by all the authors. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 27.011. Results: In the past year, 217 CVCs were conducted for 15 PCDs as a part of the CVC module. The socio-demographic of these 217 cases are as follows (Table 2)Table 1 CVC module case discussion sheetDateTimeVerbal consent of patient/CaregiversCase descriptionPCD DiagnosisTele-psychiatrist diagnosisCMD/SMD SUDAdvisedLearning pointsDuration ofSessionTable 2 Socio-demographic profile of the CVC sample (n=217)SociodemographicMean (SD)/n (%)Age34.84 (15.75)Gender Male147 (67.7)Gender Female68 (31.3) The mean age of the clinical sample was 34 years (S.

The learning acquired during CVCs demonstrated by the learning themes ranged from understanding psychopathology, arriving at a diagnosis, and planning treatment. The maximum number of CVCs who conducted the learning theme was the enhancement of their advanced clinical skills. Of the 217 CVCs, the PCDs prescribed both pharmacological and also non-pharmacological management (counseling) in a maximum number of patients (n=190, 87.6%) Assessing the effectiveness of a training program is essential;effectiveness is measured in several parameters such as knowledge attitude and practices of the trainee health workers through structured questionnaires, assessing patient outcomes, and evaluating the skill acquired12 . Collaborative Video Consultations (CVC) module is an instant video consultations module with trainer tele-psychiatrist on selected general patients, wherein, Tele-OCT module focused on imbibing basic clinical skills for identification and management of commonly presenting psychiatric illness in a PCD among consecutive general practice patients. At the same time, CVCs (which can be equated to second opinion through video consultations) are PCD-driven modules that focus on enhancing their skills obtained in the Tele-OCT module 13. In CVC, the initial screening of the patient is done by PCDs and reaches out to tele-psychiatrist in case of any clarification/difficulty for these selected patients. It is the first study to evaluate the impact of the CVC module. Since PCDs would have completed a minimum of one session of Tele-OCT before CVCs, it is expected that PCDs have been trained already in rapid screening and management of psychiatric disorders. Of the total CVC consultations, 83% had diagnostic concordance with kappa agreement of 0.78 which means to say that PCDs were able to diagnose most of the cases which reflect on the overall effectiveness of the DPCP program, in particular, the Tele-OCT module pointing towards achieving adequate competency to provide mental health care which is essential for assessing the impact of any medical training program14. The CVC module helped PCDs to sustain confidence secondary to real time positive feedback experience. This has also been proved in an earlier study on the impact of the overall effectiveness of training programs for PCDs in Bihar15. Gask L et al. (1998), in the pre-digital era, had discu sed the application of video feedback (playing of recorded videos of patient consultations) of training in mental health skills to address areas requiring improvement16, CVC which can be considered as an innovative digital module enables to provide real-time confidence maintaining feedback to the PCDs;thus the discordance of 17% also can be taken on a positive note as PCDs were able to identify their areas of error/doubts and bring it to discussion with tele-psychiatrist. On assessing the descriptive of learning themes, it has been shown that PCDs perceive skill enhancement in 35.5% of case discussions. This is in line with the objectives of CVCs, as basic training would have been done in previous modules, and CVCs essentially result in skill enhancement in the assessment, diagnosis, and management of psychiatric cases. CVCs allowed the Tele psychiatrists to observe and help the PCDs to refine and help PCDs gain new skills, the importance of knowledge transfer and case-based reader acceptance, which has been demonstrated in a study by Fleury, MJ et al. 2012 wherein they studied qualitative aspects of training of general practitioner in psychiatry17. Learning themes also reflected 7.4% of learning happened in special population management. PCDs need to be aware of psychiatric issues in special populations such as the elderly and pregnant women to facilitate appropriate and timely referrals and emergency management. Other learning themes such as handling complex cases, referral red flags, and atypical case presentations will likely help PCDs identify patients requiring specialist management. Some learning themes such as screening for psychiatric illness, diagnosis, and pharmacological management also reflect building upon their learned skills through Tele-OCT and getting practiced at CVC discussions. The documenting of the learning points enabled the tele-psychiatrist to assess the areas wherein PCD would require more handholding. The traditional classroom training focuses on knowledge transfer, whereas the CVC focuses on skill transfer using a bottom-up approach, in line with the adult learning principles. Though the training aimed to provide essential DMHP services, additional skills were also imbibed, as demonstrated by the various learning themes discussed in our study results. The CVC module also enabled the PCDs to collaboratively engage with the tele-psychiatrist, which would, in turn, will allow them to provide collaborative care under DMHP and be team leaders. In the absence of psychiatrists and difficulty to access the limited specialty psychiatric services, training of PCDs in psychiatry is vital;the CVC module is probably preliminary evidence that without such training, many individuals with mental health issues would remain undiagnosed and untreated and continue to be in the â€œfunctional treatment gapâ€ among primary care attendees3. The learning and the training would serve the purpose of task sharing and task shifting in mental health, which is an effective strategy to address the treatment gap under the current scenario. Strengths & Limitations: This study is the first study to evaluate the effectiveness of the CVC module of the DPCP program by assessing the diagnostic concurrence. This study also involves a qualitative component of assessing learning themes, through which it assesses PCDâ€™s perception about CVC discussions. This study also shows the feasibility of providing instant video consultations to all PCDs amidst the Covid pandemic. Follow-up data were not available, which is an essential limitation of this study. The authors are planning to incorporate it in future studies. Conclusion: In this study, we have discussed the implication of CVC on the training of PCDs and their skills. The study demonstrates the positive impact of the CVC on the training of PCDs in primary care psychiatry. Capacity-building training programs should employ training modules such as the CVC for effective training and better patient care. Such modules may be used not just to PCDs but to other cadres of the he lth care workforce. The symptomatic and functional outcomes of CVC-treated patients have to be studied in the future. The cost-effectiveness and impact on service provision need to be studied in the future. Further, there is also a need to assess and compare the various training formats in primary care psychiatry and its impact. Funding: The Training Program was funded by the State Health Society,Government of Bihar Acknowledgements: The researchers would like to thank the Doctors, Nurses who took up the training and were selflessly strived for ensuring best patient care. The Authors thank patients and families for their cooperation. We thank the NIMHANS Administration for their support in conducting the training program. We would like to express our gratitude to the Government of Bihar Administrators without whose efforts and collaboration this program would not have been possible. References: (Endnotes) 1.

"Study of Psychopathology in family members of patients who died due to Covid-19 â€“ A door-to-door survey","BACKGROUND- The lack of preparedness among suddenly bereaved persons is shown to be associated with higher mortality among the bereaved than when the deceased had a known pre-existing morbidity(1). Most deaths due to COVID-19 came as a sudden surprise for unprepared family members. However,there are no studies or research that are being conducted regarding the psychopathology of family members of patients who died of COVID-19. AIMS/OBJECTIVES- To study proportion of psychiatric illness in family members of patients who died of COVID-19. To find the association between the death of an earning member & psychiatric illnesses in the family. METHODS- We began a door-to-door survey in an urban locality begetting permission from the Institutional Ethics Committee. After obtaining informed consent, 40 families of COVID-19 patients were identified,whose members were interviewed using a semi-structured proforma. The deaths due to COVID19 occurred between the months of Marchâ€™21 and Juneâ€™21 and the interviews were carried during Augustâ€™21. Data collected was tabulated and analysed statistically and results were obtained. RESULTS - Of the 79 participants 11 had psychiatric illness. The proportion of psychiatric illness was observed to be 13.924% and the most common illnesses observed were depression (54.5%) followed by adjustment disorder (36.7%) and anxiety (18.2%). Of these 79 participants 15 (18.9%) had lost an earning member,of which 4 (26.7%) participants developed a psychiatric illness. The proportion of participants with psychiatric illness who lost an earning member of the family was 26.7% which was more than that in non-earning group (10.9%). But this difference is not statistically significant. CONCLUSION- We observed that family members of patients who died of COVID-19 are more prone for psychopathology. Various psychopathologies were seen in this study of which the most common psychopathology was depression. Further studies are required for the family members of patients who died due to COVID-19.

"Mental healthcare delivery for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 Presenting/ proposing authorâ€™s contact details","The COVID-19 pandemic has stretched the healthcare system its limits, largely remaining a puzzle with no definitive treatment and ever emerging variants. The overwhelming psychological stress on such patients (observed devastation, concerns about deterioration, physical isolation, social discriminations) and the CNS effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection together may lead to various psychiatric symptoms like insomnia, depressive mood, anxiety, aggressive outbursts and even suicidal ideations. Literature suggests that up to 35% have depressive symptoms, 28% have anxiety and 20% may have impaired consciousness and confusion which is linked with severe progression of disease. Persons with mental illnesses are at a higher risk of contracting viral infections because of a myriad of factors, such as a chronically dysregulated innate immune system, cognitive and higher motor functioning, and sometimes deficient personal hygiene. The recommendations and necessary social isolation can limit the continuation of tailored care, support and treatment for these patients. The situation worsens when these patients develop COVID-19 and require hospitalization for management, away from familiar caregivers and receive care through the barriers of personal protective equipment (PPE). All patients admitted at our hospital were screened for need of mental healthcare telephonically and received counselling, with in person consultation provided as required on a case-to-case basis for further management. The experience sharing of COVID-19 recovered health care professionals via audio announcement system was initiated to boost the morale of patients. All the patients were managed within COVID-19 isolation protocols. The current evidence, unique experience, novel approach at screening and support, learnings and future directions for mental healthcare delivery in a dedicated COVID-19 hospital (DCH) will be discussed. 1.

"Evaluation of the Effect of Patient Education and Strengthening Exercise Therapy Using a Mobile Messaging App on Work Productivity in Japanese Patients With Chronic Low Back Pain: Open-Label, Randomized, Parallel-Group Trial","Background: Artificial intelligenceâ€“assisted interactive health promotion systems are useful tools for the management of musculoskeletal conditions. Objective: This study aimed to explore the effects of web-based video patient education and strengthening exercise therapy, using a mobile messaging app, on work productivity and pain in patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP) receiving pharmacological treatment. Methods: Patients with CLBP were randomly allocated to either the exercise group, who received education and exercise therapy using a mobile messaging app, or the conventional group. For patient education, a web-based video program was used to provide evidence-based thinking regarding the importance of a cognitive behavioral approach for CLBP. The exercise therapy was developed in accordance with the recommendations for alignment, core muscles, and endogenous activation, including improvement of posture and mobility for proper alignment, stimulation and/or strengthening of deep muscles for spinal stability, and operation of intrinsic pain for the activation of endogenous substances by aerobic exercise. Both groups continued to receive the usual medical care with pharmacological treatment. The end points were changes in work productivity, pain intensity, quality of life, fear of movement, and depression. The observation period for this study was 12 weeks. An analysis adjusted for baseline values, age at the time of consent acquisition, sex, and willingness to strengthen the exercise therapy was performed. Results: The exercise and conventional groups included 48 and 51 patients, with a mean age of 47.9 years (SD 10.2 years;n=27, 56.3% male patients) and 46.9 years (SD 12.3 years;n=28, 54.9% male patients) in the full analysis set, respectively. No significant impact of these interventions on work productivity was observed in the exercise group compared with the conventional group (primary end point: Quantity and Quality method;0.062 vs 0.114;difference between groups -0.053, 95% CI -0.184 to 0.079;P=.43). However, the exercise group showed consistently better trends for the other end points than did the conventional group. Compared with the conventional group, the exercise group showed a significant improvement in the symptoms of low back pain (3.2 vs 3.8;difference between groups -0.5, 95% CI -1.1 to 0.0;P=.04), quality of life (EuroQoL 5 Dimensions 5 Level: 0.068 vs 0.006;difference between groups 0.061, 95% CI 0.008 to 0.114;P=.03), and fear of movement at week 12 (-2.3 vs 0.5;difference between groups -2.8, 95% CI -5.5 to -0.1;P=.04). Conclusions: This study suggests that patient education and strengthening exercise therapy using a mobile messaging app may be useful for treating CLBP. This study does not reveal the effect of therapeutic interventions on CLBP on work productivity. Thus, further research is required to assess work productivity with therapeutic interventions.

"Psychological problems among health care workers in a tertiary care centre during covid-19 pandemic: a qualitative study","Background: Thousands of health care personnel are engaged in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. Health care workers (HCWs) who are engaged in caring for COVID-19 positive cases may manifest features of psychological distress and even disorders. Objectives: To have an in-depth understanding of the mental health problems experienced by the HCWs engaged in delivering care to COVID-19 cases in a tertiary care centre;and also, their preoccupations, apprehensions and felt needs during that period. Methods: A qualitative study was undertaken among the health care workers of a tertiary care teaching centre in Northern Kerala. In-depth Interviews (IDIs) and Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were undertaken among the HCWs including doctors, nurses, nursing assistants and last-grade assistant workers involved in giving care to COVID-19 patients. IDIs and FGDs were conducted till redundancy of information. All IDIs and FGDs were recorded, transcribed and translated to English. The translated data was analysed by free-listing, pile-sorting. domain identification, coding and summarizing. Results: 12 IDIs and 3 FGDs were conducted involving different stakeholders like doctors (faculty members and Junior Residents), nurses, nursing assistants, last-grade assistants and administrators. Increase in psychological problems like anxiety and depression were described by the participants. Physical problems were reported in relation to use of PPE kit. Psychosocial problems like isolation of health care workers by neighbours and family members were also reported. Conclusions: Anxiety and depressive symptoms as well psychosocial problems are the common problems seen in HCWs engaged in COVID-19 duty.","Indu, P.

"Psychological Coping and Resilience among Kashmiri Population during Covid-19 Pandemic","Background Research has shown that the human response to mass crises or disasters can be varied, ranging from chronic anxiety, depression and posttraumatic stress to resilience and recovery. This in turn depends upon different coping strategies used by individuals and various socio-cultural factors of the region. Although a few studies have been done to assess the resilience during Covid-19 pandemic, they are limited to a particular target population and cannot be generalized to different populations of the world. Aims This study was planned to assess the various coping strategies used by the people of Kashmir and the level of their resilience during the Covid-19 pandemic. Methods It was a cross sectional descriptive study done at three districts of Kashmir (Baramulla, Srinagar, Shopian). Convenient sampling method was used and a total of 310 people were included in the study. Mental illness was ruled out using GHQ-12. Coping strategies were assessed by using Brief COPE and resilience was measured by using Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. Data was analyzed using SPSS (23.0 version) software. Results The mean age of the sample population was 34 years. The most common coping methods used were religion (mean 6.13, SD=1.41), active coping (mean 5.59, SD=1.36) and acceptance (mean 5.56, SD=1.52). The mean resilience score of the study population was 65.87 (SD=13.7) which indicates high resilience level. Resilience had significant positive correlation with active coping,r(308)=.36,p=.001;acceptance,r(308)=.27,p=.001;positive reframing,r(308)=.26,p=.001;planning,r(308)=.23,p=.001 and emotional support,r(308)=.19,p=.001. Conclusion The general Kashmiri population had a high resilience level in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic. Religion was the most commonly used coping mechanism. Positive coping mechanisms may lead to increased resilience among people during mass crisis or pandemics.","Hussain, Tajamul, Pandith, Mudasir Hassan, Imtiyaz, Bushra, Shah, Sameer Ahmad, Bhat, Farooq Ahmad, Majeed, Mir Humayun, Ali Wani, Mudasir","https://www.google.com/search?q=Psychological+Coping+and+Resilience+among+Kashmiri+Population+during+Covid-19+Pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Indian journal of psychiatry; 64(Suppl 3):S615-S615, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-17","",32936,""
"Cross-Sectional Associations between Living and Built Environments and Depression Symptoms among Chinese Older Adults","In this study, we explored the cross-sectional associations between living and built environments and depression among older Chinese adults. Data from 5822 participants were obtained. Depression symptoms were evaluated through the use of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), with a score higher than 4 categorized as having depression symptoms. The living environment was assessed by asking about dust in the environment and barrier-free facilities. We considered the presence of amenities within a 10 min walking distance and the proportion of green space within an 800 m distance from participantsâ€™ dwellings to reflect the built environment. Data were analyzed by multilevel logistic regression. Participants living in a non-dusty environment with proximity to green space had a lower risk of depression (non-dusty environment: OR = 0.784, 95% CI = 0.642, 0.956;green space: OR = 0.834, 95% CI = 0.697, 0.998). However, having no access to barrier-free facilities and hospital proximity increased the depression risk (barrier-free facilities: OR = 1.253, 95% CI = 1.078, 1.457;hospital: OR = 1.318, 95% CI = 1.104, 1.574).

"A study on behavioural problems in children and adolescents during COVID pandemic and its impact on the mental wellbeing of parents- an online survey","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented changes in the lives of billions of children due to national containment measures and school closures. The minors are particularly vulnerable to behavioural difficulties amidst the uncertainties. Increased responsibilities in the parents are adding to their mental turmoil. Hence, it is imperative that the issue is addressed to halt an emerging Mental Health pandemic. Aims: The study aimed at assessing behavioral problems of children and adolescents during home confinement and its correlation with mental well-being of the parents. Method: The study used an internet-based questionnaire covering sociodemographic and clinical variables, completed by 250 parents of children between 4-17 years of age. Strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ) for behavioral problems in children and Adult Well-being Scale for parents was used for evaluation. Statistical analysis was done by Pearson Correlation and ANOVA test. Results: Emotional (t=2.102, p=0.05) and Hyperactivity (t=2.15, p=0.03) scores were more in boys as compared to girls. Conduct (t=4.87, p&lt;0.01), Hyperactivity (t=4.46, p&lt;0.01) and emotional (t=2.54, p=0.01) problems were positively associated with the use of online platforms with increased screen time showing a statistically significant correlation with psychopathology. Total difficulty score showed positive correlation with depression (r=0.28, p&lt;0.01), anxiety (r=0.27, p&lt;0.01) and irritability (r=0.34, p&lt;0.01) in parents. Discussion: The results reflect that childrenâ€™s disruptive and emotional problems increased with the increased screen time which could be due to social skills deficit in an unexpected setting of school closure and home confinement. This negatively impacts parentsâ€™ well-being as shown in our results in keeping with previous studies conducted. Conclusion: The study revisits the negative impact of behavioral problems in children on parental wellbeing which has increased manifold in stressful times of today. The importance of ameliorating distress of parents as well as targeting problematic behaviors is crucial for positive mental health.","Gupta, Nimisha, khadanga, Poornima","https://www.google.com/search?q=A+study+on+behavioural+problems+in+children+and+adolescents+during+COVID+pandemic+and+its+impact+on+the+mental+wellbeing+of+parents-+an+online+survey","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Indian journal of psychiatry; 64(Suppl 3):S540-S540, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-17","",32938,""

There was a significant indirect effect of need for approval on suicidal ideation via detachment. Moreover, the moderated mediation models of need for approval and preoccupation with relationships on suicidality via negative affectivity were significant in men, but not women, whereas the moderated mediation model of need for approval on suicidality via detachment was significant in women, but not men.

"COVID-19 pandemic Effects and after effects on people with Neurodevelopmental Disorders and their Families","COVID-19 has disrupted everyday life worldwide and is the first disease event since the 1918 H1N1 Spanish influenza (flu) pandemic. The extensive damage wreaked by historical pandemics on health, economy, and society was a function of pathogen characteristics and lack of public health resources. In particular this pandemic has worsened neurodevelopmental disorders ADHD, ASD,IDD with an increase in MH, Psychosocial consequences in children and parents.Many of the NDDs are illnesses of life span and require multiple supportive, life enhancing interventions.COVID Pandemic increased phobias,anxiety,clinginess, distraction, irritability, depression, mood lability, impaired social interaction, sleep disturbances, low self-esteem, substance use disorder, and suicide. In India,USA and around the globe Parents and caregivers are experiencing much turmoil. They are increasingly burdened by the changing nature of caring for their children and other family members. May cause caregivers to experience intense distress, anxiety, loneliness, agitation,depression, social withdrawal and other challenging behaviors. There is evidence that there is a higher risk for those residing in residential group homes.Parents are finding themselves simultaneously expected to play the role of parent, special education teacher, and individual aide, all the while having to provide care for other children in the home and juggle work-from-home. children with NDD and families need evaluations, treatments and supports by professionals, as the ongoing pandemic can exacerbate the current challenges and provide ways of handling, coping.Also focus on identification of long-term control strategies that balance consideration of health in at risk populations, societal behavior, and economic impact.

"Social and behavioral vulnerability, pregnancy, and negative mental health outcomes in the US during the Covid-19 pandemic","The novel coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic has had a significant impact on the mental health of the general U.S. population. Extant literature has increasingly linked social vulnerabilities, risky behavior, and limited social and psychological resources to the growing mental health crisis during the virus's spread. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of pertinent social vulnerabilities and subjective risk factors for both men and women on mental health (i.e., depression, anxiety, isolation) with a closer examination of the influence of pregnancy during the pandemic on mental health. The sample included 740,640 respondents participating in the U.S. Covid-19 Trends and Impact Survey that was deployed between February and March 2021. Descriptive statistics and ordinary least squares regression models are presented with a focus on the factors that shape negative mental health outcomes, particularly on the disparities between pregnant and non-pregnant women relative to men, but also subjective/perception factors (e.g., fear/worry) and social vulnerabilities. Results show that pregnant women were at significantly greater risk of negative mental health outcomes at this stage of the pandemic than either men or non-pregnant women. Overall, respondents who were younger, without children in the household, unemployed, worried generally about infection or their finances, or had ever tested positive for Covid were also more likely to report feelings of anxiety, isolation, and depression than their counterparts. Pregnant women may be especially vulnerable to depression, anxiety, and isolation during the pandemic and our findings suggest the importance of developing targeted mental health support for this sub-population.","Godleski, Stephanie A.; Harris, Casey T.; Fitzpatrick, Kevin M.; Kothari, Ammina","https://www.google.com/search?q=Social+and+behavioral+vulnerability,+pregnancy,+and+negative+mental+health+outcomes+in+the+U.S.+during+the+Covid-19+pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: AIMS public health; 9(2):331-341, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-17","",32941,""

"Psychedelic Mystical Experience: A New Agenda for Theology","When the link between psychedelic drugs and mystical states of experience was first discovered in the 1960s, Huston Smith challenged scholars in religion and philosophy to consider the implications. Very few took up his challenge. Beginning in 2006, hundreds of studies have linked psychedelics not just to mystical states of experience but to potential treatments for many mental health disorders. Regulatory approval for therapies is on the horizon, and hundreds of millions of people worldwide could be treated. Research findings challenge the underlying rationale of the War on Drugs, leading to decriminalization of specific psychedelic drugs or to authorization of their use in mental health contexts. Religious institutions are slowly adapting, with some referring to psychedelics as sacraments or as pathways to deeper spirituality. Religious leaders are also beginning to speak out publicly in support of careful use of these drugs, and some are training to become â€œpsychedelic chaplainsâ€ to work alongside mental health professionals administering these drugs. Scholars in theology and religion are encouraged to engage these trends, to explore challenging philosophical and theological issues surrounding mystical states of experience in general, and to consider the long-term cultural impact of the most recent psychedelic research.","Cole-Turner, Ron","https://www.google.com/search?q=Psychedelic+Mystical+Experience:+A+New+Agenda+for+Theology","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Religions; 13(5):385, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-17","",32944,""

"A Machine Learning Approach for Detecting Digital Behavioral Patterns of Depression Using Nonintrusive Smartphone Data (Complementary Path to Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Assessment): Prospective Observational Study","Background: Depression is a major global cause of morbidity, an economic burden, and the greatest health challenge leading to chronic disability. Mobile monitoring of mental conditions has long been a sought-after metric to overcome the problems associated with the screening, diagnosis, and monitoring of depression and its heterogeneous presentation. The widespread availability of smartphones has made it possible to use their data to generate digital behavioral models that can be used for both clinical and remote screening and monitoring purposes. This study is novel as it adds to the field by conducting a trial using private and nonintrusive sensors that can help detect and monitor depression in a continuous, passive manner. Objective: This study demonstrates a novel mental behavioral profiling metric (the Mental Health Similarity Score), derived from analyzing passively monitored, private, and nonintrusive smartphone use data, to identify and track depressive behavior and its progression. Methods: Smartphone data sets and self-reported Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) depression assessments were collected from 558 smartphone users on the Android operating system in an observational study over an average of 10.7 (SD 23.7) days. We quantified 37 digital behavioral markers from the passive smartphone data set and explored the relationship between the digital behavioral markers and depression using correlation coefficients and random forest models. We leveraged 4 supervised machine learning classification algorithms to predict depression and its severity using PHQ-9 scores as the ground truth. We also quantified an additional 3 digital markers from gyroscope sensors and explored their feasibility in improving the modelâ€™s accuracy in detecting depression. Results: The PHQ-9 2-class model (none vs severe) achieved the following metrics: precision of 85% to 89%, recall of 85% to 89%, F1 of 87%, and accuracy of 87%. The PHQ-9 3-class model (none vs mild vs severe) achieved the following metrics: precision of 74% to 86%, recall of 76% to 83%, F1 of 75% to 84%, and accuracy of 78%. A significant positive Pearson correlation was found between PHQ-9 questions 2, 6, and 9 within the severely depressed users and the mental behavioral profiling metric (r=0.73). The PHQ-9 question-specific model achieved the following metrics: precision of 76% to 80%, recall of 75% to 81%, F1 of 78% to 89%, and accuracy of 78%. When a gyroscope sensor was added as a feature, the Pearson correlation among questions 2, 6, and 9 decreased from 0.73 to 0.46. The PHQ-9 2-class model+gyro features achieved the following metrics: precision of 74% to 78%, recall of 67% to 83%, F1 of 72% to 78%, and accuracy of 76%. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that the Mental Health Similarity Score can be used to identify and track depressive behavior and its progression with high accuracy.","Choudhary, Soumya, Thomas, Nikita, Ellenberger, Janine, Srinivasan, Girish, Cohen, Roy","https://www.google.com/search?q=A+Machine+Learning+Approach+for+Detecting+Digital+Behavioral+Patterns+of+Depression+Using+Nonintrusive+Smartphone+Data+(Complementary+Path+to+Patient+Health+Questionnaire-9+Assessment):+Prospective+Observational+Study","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: JMIR Formative Research; 6(5), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-17","",32946,""
"Covid-19 Restrictions and the Effects of Physical Activity on Mental Health in Midwestern Adolescent Adaptive Athletes","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic and related lockdowns in 2020 negatively impacted high school students, with increased depression and anxiety especially in athletes who participated in team sports. For adolescents with disabilities, physical activity provides physical and mental health benefits;however, the impact of COVID-19 related adaptive sports cancellations have not been thoroughly investigated. Hypothesis: Adaptive athletes with lower activity levels during a period of COVID-19 related restrictions will have worse scores of depression, anxiety, and quality of life. Methods: Institutional Review Board (IRB) exemption was granted. Adaptive athletes ages 12-21 were identified through Midwestern adaptive athletic associations. Athletes completed a survey between June 2020 and January 2021 including Patient Health Questionairre-9 Item (PHQ-9) for depression, General Anxiety Disorder-7 Item (GAD-7) anxiety, Pediatric Functional Activity Brief Scale (PFABS) for activity level, and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 (PedsQL) for quality of life. PFABS and PedsQL were modified as appropriate to adaptive athletes. Univariate analysis was performed using chi-square tests to assess the association between activity and mental health. Student T-tests were used for multivariate analysis to assess the role of sex, grade in school, and individual vs team sport participation on quality of life. Results: Twenty-four respondents completed the survey in its entirety, with majority from Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Illinois. Demographics are shown in Table 1. There was no significant association between physical activity levels and GAD-7 (R2=-0.040), PHQ-9 (R2=-0.020) or PedsQL (R2=-0.043). Activity levels of adaptive sports athletes did not differ by gender, sport type or school grade (Table 1). Discussion: Unlike previous work in able-bodied adolescents, we found no correlation between physical activity and scores related to depression and anxiety among adolescent adaptive sports athletes during COVID-19. Additionally, there were no difference in activity levels nor mental health scores by gender, sport type nor school grade, a proxy for age. While, the sample size in this study was a fraction of those used in previous work, adaptive athletes are a small proportion of adolescent athletes. Adaptive athletes, who face greater challenges in society on a daily basis, may have had lower quality of life measures at baseline or more sophisticated coping mechanisms already in place providing fortitude in mental health in the face of the pandemic. Conclusion: In a small cohort of adaptive athletes in the Midwest region of the USA, sport related cancellations had no association with mental health scores from June 2020 to January 2021.Table 1.

Materials & Methods: In this cross-sectional descriptive study, data was retrieved from the telepsychiatry services and was analyzed to examine the demographic and clinical parameters of patients. Results: Atotal of 3444 teleconsultations were sought with a mean age of 37.78 Â± 15.08. About 80% of the patients were in the age group of 20-60 years. Females outnumbered males with 1938 (56.3%) females and 1538 (43.7%) males. Mood disorders were the most frequent diagnosis with Major Depressive Disorder in 1572 (45.6%) and Bipolar Disorder in 636 (18.5%). Co-morbidity was present in 234 (6.8%) of the study group. The mean psychotropics prescribed were 1.95 Â± 0.84. One, two, three and four psychotropics were prescribed in 918 (26.7%), 1470 (42.7%), 900 (26.1%) and 42 (1.2%) respectively. Those aged &lt; 20 years or = 60 years prescribed psychotropics at lower rates in comparison to the 20-60 years age group. Female patients had a significantly higher rate of psychotropic prescription than male patients. Three or four psychotropics were prescribed to those with co-morbidity at a significantly higher rate.

"Examining Anxiety Treatment Information Needs: Web-Based Survey Study","Background: Several treatments for anxiety are available, which can make treatment decisions difficult. Resources are often produced with limited knowledge of what information is of interest to consumers. This is a problem because there is limited understanding of what people want to know when considering help for anxiety. Objective: This study aimed to examine the information needs and preferences concerning treatment options for anxiety by assessing the following: what information people consider to be important when they are considering treatment options for anxiety, what information people have received on psychological and medication treatment in the past, how they received this information in the past, and whether there are any differences in information needs between specific samples and demographic groups. Methods: Using a web-based survey, we recruited participants from a peer-support association website (n=288) and clinic samples (psychology, n=113;psychiatry, n=64). Results: Participants in all samples wanted information on a broad range of topics pertaining to anxiety treatment. However, they reported that they did not receive the desired amount of information. Participants in the clinic samples rated the importance of information topics higher than did those in the self-help sample. When considering the anxiety treatment information received in the past, most respondents indicated receiving information from informational websites, family doctors, and mental health practitioners. In terms of what respondents want to learn about, high ratings of importance were given to topics concerning treatment effectiveness, how it works, advantages and disadvantages, what happens when it stops, and common side effects. Conclusions: It is challenging for individuals to obtain anxiety-related information on the range of topics they desire through currently available information sources. It is also difficult to provide comprehensive information during typical clinical visits. Providing evidence-based information on the web and in a brochure format may help consumers make informed choices and support the advice provided by health professionals.","Bernstein, Matthew T.; Reynolds, Kristin A.; Jakobson, Lorna S.; Stoesz, Brenda M.; Alcolado, Gillian M.; Furer, Patricia","https://www.google.com/search?q=Examining+Anxiety+Treatment+Information+Needs:+Web-Based+Survey+Study","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: JMIR Formative Research; 6(5), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-17","",32951,""
"Prevalence of and factors associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms among people living with HIV infection in Davao City, Philippines","Depression and anxiety are common among people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLWHIV) infection. In this study, we aimed to determine the prevalence of and factors associated with depression and anxiety among PLWHIV infection in Davao City, Philippines, in order to inform programs to minimize these mental health conditions in the study population. Study subjects were chosen from patients who accessed the HIV and AIDS Core Team (HACT) Clinic at an urban tertiary care hospital in Davao City, Philippines, during August-September 2019. Eligible study subjects were asked to complete the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire to assess their depressive and anxiety symptoms. Selected factors were evaluated to determine their association with depressive and anxiety symptoms. A total of 145 subjects were included in the study, 95.9% male. The study subject mean (+or- standard deviation) age was 33.0 (+or- 8.4) years old. Among study subjects, 51.7% and 41.4% had symptoms of depression and anxiety, respectively. Factors significantly associated with depressive symptoms were being aged 25-34 years (adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR)=1.55;95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06-2.26;p-value=0.023) compared to being aged &gt;34 years and being unemployed (aPR=1.62;95% CI: 1.15-2.29;p-value=0.006) compared to being employed. The factor significantly associated with anxiety symptoms was being aged 25- 34 years (aPR=1.61;95% CI: 1.03-2.51;p-value=0.038) compared to being aged &gt;34 years. In summary, a high prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms was observed among our study subjects;younger age and being unemployed were associated with depressive symptoms and being younger was associated with anxiety symptoms. We conclude there is a need for a program to reduce depression and anxiety in the study population.

"Putting research into practice: knowledge translation and implementation for action on nutrition","The transfer of research evidence into practice has been historically slow, and requires an integration of many elements, including quality evidence, supportive physical and intellectual environments, and facilitation, as discussed at the NNEdPro Sixth International Summit on Nutrition and Health. Examples of applying clinical research into practice focused on the use of group consultations (also known as group clinics or shared medical appointments) to support behaviour change, the role of dietary micronutrients during the COVID-19 pandemic and the potential of Precision Nutrition. An emerging area from early implementation evidence includes group consultations, also known as shared medical appointments, as discussed by Dr Fallows. Group consultations have been shown to improve clinical outcomes for some patient groups (e.g., HbA1c, lipids, BMI), as well as improve self-care and health education, and patient and clinician satisfaction. These groups have been piloted throughout the UK both face-to-face and virtually, with initial findings suggesting they are feasible and acceptable to patients and clinicians. Further work is needed to assess whether these could be cost-effective when scaled-up in National Health Service UK primary care. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been increasing emphasis on the central role of nutrition in health, including the role of dietary micronutrients, as discussed by Dr Van Dael and Shane McAuliffe. Nutrition plays an important role in immunity, yet the nutritional status of the most vulnerable population groups is likely to deteriorate further due to the health and socio-economic impacts of the novel coronavirus. Thus, implementation of this evidence into health care practice is key. Precision Nutrition, defined as an â€˜approach that uses information on individual characteristics to develop targeted nutrition advice, products or servicesâ€™, offers an exciting opportunity to further individualise dietary advice for behaviour change, as discussed by Dr Kohlmeier and Dr Hernandez. Precision nutrition is underpinned by the recognition that individuals differ in many important ways due to identifiable molecular traits and can be utilised to determine personalised weight loss interventions based on genetic variants. Use of implementation science is in line with one of the six cross-cutting pillars of the Nutrition Decade: Aligned health systems for universal coverage of nutrition actions. Dr Bell, an Advanced Accredited Practising Dietitian in Australia, provided an overview of key implementation science models and frameworks. Implementation frameworks such as the Action Research Framework, the Knowledge to Action Cycle, and the Spread and Sustain Framework, are underpinned by knowledge creation, effective education, and culture change. Dr Bell then highlighted how theoretical frameworks have provided guidance for the implementation of real world, complex nutrition interventions, including the Systematised Interdisciplinary Program for Implementation and Evaluation (SIMPLE) in Australia, and the More-2-Eat program in Canada.","Bell, Jack, Fallows, Ellen, Peter Van, Dael, McAuliffe, Shane, Kohlmeier, Martin, Alfredo Martinez, Hernandez, Adamski, Melissa, Ray, Sumantra, Crocombe, Dominic, Marjorie Lima do, Vale","https://www.google.com/search?q=Putting+research+into+practice:+knowledge+translation+and+implementation+for+action+on+nutrition","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health; 5(Suppl 1):A1, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-17","",32953,""

Despite young people and clinicians being the predominant users of such technologies, few studies have examined their perspectives on different digital mental health technologies. Objective: This study aims to understand the technologies that young people have access to and use in their everyday lives and what applications of these technologies they are interested in to support their mental health. The study also explores the technologies that youth mental health clinicians currently use within their practice and what applications of these technologies they are interested in to support their clientsâ€™ mental health. Methods: Youth mental health service users (aged 12-25 years) from both primary and specialist services, young people from the general population (aged 16-25 years), and youth mental health clinicians completed a web-based survey exploring technology ownership, use of, and interest levels in using different digital interventions to support their mental health or that of their clients. Results: A total of 588 young people and 73 youth mental health clinicians completed the survey. Smartphone ownership or private access among young people within mental health services and the general population was universal (611/617, 99%), with high levels of access to computers and social media. Youth technology use was frequent, with 63.3% (387/611) using smartphones several times an hour. Clinicians reported using smartphones (61/76, 80%) and video chat (69/76, 91%) commonly in clinical practice and found them to be helpful. Approximately 50% (296/609) of the young people used mental health apps, which was significantly less than the clinicians (<U+03C7>23=28.8, n=670;P&lt;.001). Similarly, clinicians were significantly more interested in using technology for mental health support than young people (H3=55.90;P&lt;.001), with 100% (73/73) of clinicians being at least slightly interested in technology to support mental health compared with 88% (520/591) of young people. Follow-up tests revealed no difference in interest between young people from the general population, primary mental health services, and specialist mental health services (all P&gt;.23). Young people were most interested in web-based self-help, mobile self-help, and blended therapy. Conclusions: Technology access is pervasive among young people within and outside of youth mental health services;clinicians are already using technology to support clinical care, and there is widespread interest in digital mental health technologies among these groups of end users. These findings provide important insights into the perspectives of young people and clinicians regarding the value of digital mental health interventions in supporting youth mental health.","Bell, Imogen H.; Thompson, Andrew, Valentine, Lee, Adams, Sophie, Alvarez-Jimenez, Mario, Nicholas, Jennifer","https://www.google.com/search?q=Ownership,+Use+of,+and+Interest+in+Digital+Mental+Health+Technologies+Among+Clinicians+and+Young+People+Across+a+Spectrum+of+Clinical+Care+Needs:+Cross-sectional+Survey","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: JMIR Mental Health; 9(5), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-17","",32954,""

"A Cross-Sectional Study on The Correlation between Psychological Distress and Eating Behaviours of Young Adults During the Covid-19 Pandemic","Background Since the onset of COVID-19 pandemic, an increasing level of anxiety, depression and stress are being reported along with a dramatic shift in daily routine, living and eating patterns of young individuals. Aims The study aimed to explore the associations between the psychosocial impact of the COVID 19 pandemic in India, depressive symptomatology, anxiety/stress levels and disordered eating behaviours among adults aged between 18-35years. Methods This was a community based, cross sectional study conducted during August 2021. An online survey was circulated, wherein 110 adults participated. Questions about socio-demographic, lifestyle and eating behaviours were asked. Coronavirus Impact Scale (CIS), Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS-21) and Three Factor Eating Questionnaire Revised 18-item version (TFEQ-R18) were used. Pearsonâ€™s correlation analysis was used. Results A total of 101 valid responses were used for statistical analysis. 51% respondents reported mild change in daily routine while 49% reported stress and discord in their families due to the pandemic. Almost 10% of the respondents reported features suggestive of moderate depression and anxiety, while 1.9% reported bingeing on food almost every day in the past month. A positive association was observed between the scores of coronavirus impact scale and that of depression (r=0.366, p=0.000), anxiety (r=0.402, p=0.000), stress (r=0.416, p= 0.000) and uncontrolled eating (r=0.198, r=0.047). Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increasing psychological distress and also disordered eating patterns, particularly of bingeing types.

"Antidepressant-like Activity of Patchouli Oil var Tapak Tuan (Pogostemon cablin Benth) via Elevated Dopamine Level: A Study Using Rat Model","Essential oils are gaining popularity for their use in treating depression, including that extracted from patchouli leaves and stems (Pogostemon cablin). Herein, we used patchouli oil (PO) containing a high amount of patchouli alcohol derived from P. cablin var. Tapak Tuan. The aim of this study was to investigate the antidepressant potential of PO, with a variety of patchouli alcohol concentrations obtained from a separation process using vacuum distillation with different temperature ranges. The initial patchouli oil (iPO) was traditionally distilled by a local farmer and further distilled using a rotary evaporator at temperature ranges of 115â€“160 Â°C (POF-1);120â€“160 Â°C (POF-2), and 125â€“160 Â°C (POF-3), resulting in products with different patchouli alcohol concentrations. POF-3, with the highest patchouli alcohol content of 60.66% (based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry), was used for cooling crystallization, resulting in 100% patchouli alcohol crystal (pPA). A tail suspension test (TST) was performed on a rat model to screen the antidepressant potential of iPO and its derivatives. The TST results revealed that POF-3 had the best antidepressant-like effect and was second only to the fluoxetine-based antidepressant, KalxetinÂ®, where both groups had significant reductions of immobility time post-treatment (p &lt; 0.0001). Other than patchouli alcohol, POF-3 also contained ledol and trans-geraniol, which have been reported for their antidepressant-related activities. Brain dopamine levels increased significantly in the group treated with POF-3 (p &lt; 0.05 as compared with the control group), suggesting its primary anti-depressant mechanism. These findings suggest the potential of vacuum-distilled patchouli oil in reducing depression via dopamine elevation.","Astuti, Puji, Khairan, Khairan, Marthoenis, Marthoenis, Hasballah, Kartini","https://www.google.com/search?q=Antidepressant-like+Activity+of+Patchouli+Oil+var.+Tapak+Tuan+(Pogostemon+cablin+Benth)+via+Elevated+Dopamine+Level:+A+Study+Using+Rat+Model","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Pharmaceuticals; 15(5):608, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-17","",32960,""

"Wellbeing and healthcare priority settings in Sweden at the beginning of the COVID-19 omicron wave","IntroductionThe COVID pandemic proves that a sustainable of healthcare system is dependent both on resources and a consensus about which values should guide the decision makers to appropriately set priorities for resource allocation. There is not clear how exactly the decision makers choose the priorities for spending, but there were differences between and within countries. For example, in Sweden, where healthcare system has a pronounced public character and a declared emphasis on equity and solidarity, there was a high variation between and within regions with respect to how resources were used for treatment, prevention, and vaccination. This article is an explorative analysis of the respondentsâ€™ wellbeing and their preferences regarding priority-setting in healthcare in Sweden during December 2021, when the extremely high infection risk of the Omicron sparked significant concern among global experts and politicians.MethodsOur web-survey was answered by1000 respondents from the web panel Userneeds. The sample is representative with respect age, gender, and geographical region for the adult population of Sweden. The respondents are invited to imagine that they are decision-makers in the health care system and decide for six hypothetical choice situations, where the resources are allocated to save the life of patients at risk of dying due to suicide, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer and acute heart attack. In addition to the choices, the survey also includes questions about the individualâ€™s demographic and socio-economic characteristics, their well-being, their risk for and experience (their own and/or someone near them) with suicide, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer and acute heart attack.ResultsOur preliminary results show that regardless of their age, people with a high value of life-satisfaction and with no experience related to suicide, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer and acute heart attack tend to allocate resources for relatively young patients suffering do to suicide and breast cancer.","AndrÃ©n, Daniela","https://www.google.com/search?q=Wellbeing+and+healthcare+priority+settings+in+Sweden+at+the+beginning+of+the+COVID-19+omicron+wave","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BMJ Global Health; 7(Suppl 2):A9, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-17","",32962,""
"Psychological intervention in Pandemic Related Pregnancy Stress among women pregnant during COVID-19: An Experience from South Kashmir, India","Background and objectives Pregnancy the most challenging period of womenâ€™s lives were greatly hit by the Coronavirus pandemic and lockdown implemented to curtail the spread of infection in the community has also affected antenatal care. The present study was aimed to find out the effectiveness of mental health education programmes in pandemic related pregnancy stress among women pregnant during COVID-19. Material and methods A combination of descriptive and experimental research design was used. The stress related to COVID 19 was measured using the Pandemic-Related Pregnancy Stress Scale (PREPS) in 123 pregnant females. The compact mental health education intervention programme specially designed for COVID-19 was administered in the experimental group of 61 pregnant females. The stress levels were compared with 61 pregnant females of the control group who were not exposed to the mental health education programme. The results were compared and evaluated for the effectiveness of mental health education programmes in combating the stress during this pandemic. The programme was reintroduced during the second COVID-19 wave and results were accordingly analysed. Results From the study, we found there exists a significant difference in the COVID 19 pandemic related pregnancy stress between control and experimental groups. The mean scores of PREPS preparedness of the experimental group before and after the intervention was 3.36Â±0.89 and 1.25Â±0.81 respectively. A t-value of 12.38 was found which is statistically significant at a CI of 95% (1.77 to 2.44). Similarly, the mean score of PREPS infection of experimental group before and after the intervention was 3.36Â±0.91 and 1.28Â±0.71 and for PREPS positive appraisal of the experimental group before and after the intervention was 1.27Â±0.90 and 3.34Â±11.58 respectively The t-value of 11.58 was found which is statistically significant at CI of 95% (-2,42 to -1.71). However, in control the mean scores for PREPS subscales before and after were almost the same (3.34Â±0.71 and 3.34Â±0.71, 4.04Â±0.91 and 3.94Â±0.80, 2.27Â±0.90 and 2.01Â±0.80). The t-values were statistically insignificant. Therefore from the results, we conclude that in both the experimental and control group the PREPS subscale scores were higher before intervention and reduced to significant levels after intervention in the experimental group however, there was no significant change in stress levels in the control group who were not exposed to the intervention programme. There was also a significant improvement in positive appraisal in pregnant females who received mental health education. Similar results were found during the second COVID-19 wave. Conclusion Pandemic related pregnancy stress had increased and can be of unfavourable consequences regarding mother and infants health. Therefore, early intervention to improve self-care and motivate women to approach the self in a way that entails inculcating and exercising things that inevitably enhance physical and mental health. At the same time refraining from the contrary thereby dispensing with professional medical help will eventually improve the overall mental health of pregnant females.","Amin, Rehana, Nazir, Tanzeela, Margoob, Mushtaq Ahmad, Margoob, Mushtaq Ahmad","https://www.google.com/search?q=Psychological+intervention+in+Pandemic+Related+Pregnancy+Stress+among+women+pregnant+during+COVID-19:+An+Experience+from+South+Kashmir,+India","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Indian journal of psychiatry; 64(Suppl 3):S592-S593, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-17","",32963,""

Stress is one of the major issues which can lead to anxiety, depression and sleep problems. Stress can be due factors like fear of getting infected with the virus or spreading it to the family members, uncertainty related to running out of supplies of groceries or medications, troubled sleeping or recurrent thought of the virus, etc. An understanding of the magnitude of the stress causing factors will be helpful in planning and guiding the resources in a proper direction during and in future pandemics. Aim : To estimate the magnitude of covid related stress and its relation with the sociodemographic and clinical variables. Methodology: It was a cross-sectional online study. The study proforma included the semi-structured proforma and COVID Stress Scale (CSS). Results and Discussion : A total of 326 responses were received of which 311 were analysed. Higher mean scores were observed in the compulsive checking ( 6.15, SD 4.77) and danger and contamination subscale ( 5.94, SD4.74) of CSS while lower scores were observed in traumatic stress domain(1.59, SD3.36). Age, gender, marital status and category of healthcare professional were significant for xenophobia, while traumatic stress and socioeconomic consequence were significant in case who were married. A history of COVID-19 infection leads to more compulsive checking for COVID-10 infection and related information.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Stress+in+Healthcare+Workers+during+COVID-19+Pandemic:+A+Cross-sectional+online+study+from+Northern+India","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Indian journal of psychiatry; 64(Suppl 3):S600-S601, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-17","",32966,""
"Ring up and care: Experience from clinician initiated telephonic follow-up for older persons with mental illness","Background: Tele-psychiatry has grown exponentially during COVID-19 pandemic. As regular out-patient services were shutdown, we initiated a telephonic follow up consultation from Geriatric Mental Health department, for patients who had their first face to face consultation up-to 2 months prior to pandemic induced lock down with the intent to maintain the continuity of care. Methods: In this background we are reporting our experience of this unique initiative, in terms of acceptance of service, status of patients, compliance and barriers to care. The data is reviewed and reported descriptively after obtaining the Institutional Ethic Committee approval. Results: A total of 179 patients (N=179) were rung up and 120 could be contacted, among which 8 patients had deceased at the time of call. Hundred and eight patients (108) consented for tele-follow up consultation, whose mean age was 68.76Â±7.22 years. Majority of patients (74.07%) were still symptomatic at the time of follow-up call and expressed their felt need for psychiatric care which was unmet. Forty patients (39.22%) had stopped prescribed medicines. Unavailability of consultation as well as psychotropic medicines in the locality were the major reasons for poor compliance. Sixteen patients (14.8.1%) required urgent referral to the nearby district mental health service. Conclusion: Clinician initiated telephonic follow-up was well received. This initiative has uncovered hurdles to care and unmet needs of patients of geriatric psychiatry in such unprecedented situation and would help in improving the preparedness.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Ring+up+and+care:+Experience+from+clinician+initiated+telephonic+follow-up+for+older+persons+with+mental+illness","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Indian journal of psychiatry; 64(Suppl 3):S619-S619, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-17","",32967,""

"The place of Long Acting Injectables (LAI) in the treatment of Schizophrenia: Current perspectives","Long acting injectables antipsychotics (LAIs) preparations were introduced for the first time in 1960s for management of schizophrenia. Over the years, many LAIs have been introduced. A recent meta-analysis of prospective and retrospective studies evaluating the effectiveness of LAIs vis-Ã -vis oral antipsychotics in patients with schizophrenia have demonstrated superiority of LAIs over oral antipsychotics in reducing rehospitalization rates, illness severity/chronicity, have lower all cause discontinuation rates and improved medication adherence. However, despite all these findings, oral antipsychotics form the bulk of the prescriptions for patients with psychotic disorders. The prescription rates for LAIs by the psychiatristsâ€™ all across the World show wide variation with rates ranging from 6% to 80%. Several factors influence the prescription of LAIâ€™s, including the attitudes of psychiatrists, nursing staff, patients and their relatives, stigmatizing views regarding LAIs, issues related to patient autonomy, fear of side-effects, cost related issues etc. This symposium will deal with the following aspects in greater detail: 1. The current evidence of LAIs in the management of Schizophrenia: Sandeep Grover 2. The patientâ€™s and caregiversâ€™ perspectives about LAIs: Swapnajeet Sahoo 3. The psychiatristsâ€™ perspectives about LAIs: Aseem Mehra 14/09/2021, Kurnool, A.P To Dr Gowtam Saha President Indian Psychiatry Society (IPS) drgautam@ancips2022.com Through Proper Channel Sub: Proposal for a Symposium at ANCIPS, 2022 Respected sir, Greeting on behalf of my Psychiatry friends & Colleagues.

"Parenting In The Era Of Information Overload","Presenting authorâ€™s contact details: Shivanad B Hiremath Assistant Professor Department of Psychiatry KIMS,Hubli, Karnataka Mobile: 7760072812, bhshiv@gmail.com Author and co-authorsâ€™ details: Prabeesh Nair Senior Resident Department of Psychiatry KIMS,Hubli, Karnataka Mobile: 8296405029 drprabeeshnair@gmail.com Niranjan Ittannavar Psychiatrist Central Prison Vijayapur, Karnataka Mobile: 7019691434 Niranjan1334@gmail.com Saudhamini Bhat Senior Resident Department of Psychiatry KIMS,Hubli, Karnataka Mobile: 9980043250 drsaudhaminibhat@gmail.com Chaithra S Hiremath Consultant Psychiatrist Aantharya Neuro-Psychiatric centre Hosur, Hubli, Karnataka Mobile: 7760483036, chaitravhm@gmail.com : Parenting is an incredibly challenging as well as rewarding job, which has a strong influence on the childâ€™s mental health along with the overall growth and development of the children. From the first-time humans walked on the earth till now through the various ages, parenting has constantly evolved to adapt itself to time and society. The recent years has seen more involvement of the Indian parents in their childrenâ€™s growth due to growing awareness and information explosion. And the Covid-19 pandemic catalyzed the speed even more, nudging the parentsâ€™ even greater role in emotional, social and educational development of their children. Transitioning the spread of information majorly from printed materials to digital media has led to exponential rise in the creation of sources of information as well as itâ€™s dissipation. This has made digital media an integral part of our personal, social, academic and professional lives. Both the information as well as connectivity it provides has been immense. In fact, during the lockdowns digital media has been the only source for that same. Due to the sheer volume of information created on digital platforms, lots of these go unscrutinized thus many times misinformation starts creeping in various sources. Also, the allure of the digital media can shift our healthy dependence on digital media to the unhealthy range. Thus, for a new parent it presents two-fold problem. One-fold where the learning new parent has to both filter out the misinformation from sources as well as assimilate the vast information on parenting well, so that the quality of parenting isnâ€™t compromised. The second fold is to determine the right amount of involvement of digital media in the parentsâ€™ and childrenâ€™s lives, so that neither the too much involvement negatively affect the physical, mental and social health nor the suboptimal involvement deprive them of necessary knowledge, skills set and social well- being to keep up with the world, let alone progress in life. In this symposium, the speakers will be discussing about the advantages and disadvantages of parenting in digital age, aspects of online/ e-learning, home schooling as alternative solution, achieving balance between healthy parenting and digital evolution. Individual topics and speaker details: 1.Introduction, historical evolution and need for the discussion: Shivanand B Hiremath 2.Influence of digital media on parenting: Prabeesh Nair 3.Parental role in digital learning: Niranjan Ittannavar 4.Homeschooling as a alternative solution: Saudhamini Bhat 5.Healthy parenting in the digital age: Chaithra S Hiremath Lost: Never to be Found ? Understanding and Addressing Grief 1.Dr Sona Kakar MD Consultant Psychiatrist Talk Time Clinic Hyderabad drsonakakar@gmail.com 2.Dr Ajit Bhide MD Emeritus Consultant in Psychiatry St. Marthaâ€™s Hospital Bengaluru drajitbhide@gmail.com Grief is one of the most painful experiences in relation to mankind. It is universal and inevitable if there is a loss. Ironically every single moment we are losing something, be it time, money, our dreams or relationships. Grief can be normal but might take pathological dimensions, As psychiatrists dealing with patients who have lost a loved one, we need to be well informed about this human experience consequent to loss. In order to help a patient in grief, we have to underst nd this complex and painful phenomenon. We need also to look at ways to help the patient minimize his trauma and resolve the grief. This symposium seeks to understand the emotion of grief, its relation to loss, differentiate it from other emotions with the help of case discussions and literature and look at ways to address it in clinical practice. Resistant Depression Under the Scanner 1.Dr Sona Kakar MD Consultant Psychiatrist Talk Time Clinic Hyderabad drsonakakar@gmail.com 2.Dr Vipul Singh MD Government Medical College Kannauj drvipulsingh@yahoo.co.in Depression is one of the common clinical presentations in our practice. In a few patients we may notice Resistant Depression which creates distress and hopelessness in the patient and helplessness in the treating psychiatrist. This often requires a close observation of the symptoms and the use of adjunctive therapies and treatments. In this symposium we would like to closely scrutinize evolving strategies in the management of Resistant Depression and will cover both biological and Psychotherapeutic interventions which have shown promise through research.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Parenting+In+The+Era+Of+Information+Overload","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Indian journal of psychiatry; 64(Suppl 3):S645-S645, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-17","",32971,""
"Impact of COVID19 on sleep quality of health care professionals","Background: The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) not only caused particularly large public health problems, but also caused great psychological distress, especially for medical staff. Sleep problems, such as poor sleep quality, are common in the health care profession due to high level of work-related stress. Poor sleep quality could result in serious health consequences, such as hypertension, exhaustion, burnout, and depression. Objectives: To examine the sleep quality of healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic and its correlation with the socio-demographic data Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted using online Google forms. It included demographic data like age, gender, hours of covid duty and Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) questionnaire among healthcare professionals of tertiary care covid hospital and the responses were recorded.

"Establishing Good Practices Model for Comprehensive School Mental Health Promotion: An Orientation Training Workshop","Good mental health is critical to childrenâ€™s happiness and success in school life. It has been proven through research that students who receive social-emotional and mental health support achieve better academically. Health and well-being as a developmental goal is well articulated in National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. The covid-19 pandemic has impacted the psychosocial wellbeing of children and adolescents across the country. The WHO (2016) report on mental health estimates nearly 20% of children and adolescents are suffering from disabling mental illnesses worldwide. Suicide rates and self-harm attempts of Indian adolescents are one of the highest in the world, accounting for 25% of deaths in boys and 50-75% of deaths in girls aged 10-19 years. In recent times of Covid-19, a large spectrum of mental health issues affecting young minds and families have been reported. Schools are most impactful agents of change when it concerns the mental health and well-being of the students as these are the critical periods of studentâ€™s lives. It is the need of the hour to design a program for adaptive and positive behavior that enabling children and adolescents to deal effectively with the demands and challenges of everyday life. Developing core life skills from the early years in school through the Life Skills Education Paradigm is such a program which helps in evolving their awareness and creates responsible and empowered citizens for the country. Here students as â€˜Life Skills and Wellbeing Ambassadorsâ€™ can play a vital role in creating a participatory climate for behavioral change and adapt to strengthen their inclusive environment. â€˜The Adolescent Peer Educators Leadership Program for enriching Life Skills, Holistic Health and Wellbeing of studentsâ€™ by Expressions India, has been a model of implementation in many parts of the country. The workshop will provide an opportunity to learn the methodology and implementation of Life Skills Training program. Establishing a life skills initiative at national level requires an infrastructure capable of developing a life skills program of widespread relevance and acceptability as well as managing the implementation and evaluation of the program over time. The hands-on training workshop for School Mental Health in India shall go a long way in promoting positive climate of psychosocial well-being in the school and minimizing the impact of mental health conditions.

"Assessment of Change in Severity of Stress, Anxiety and Depression in Covid-19 Patients During Hospital Stay â€“ A Cross-sectional Study","Background â€“ COVID 19 illness is associated with psychological impairments. Whether this impairment is due to illness itself or inpatient stay also contributes to it needs to be ascertained. Present study was done to assess the change in severity of stress, depression and anxiety in COVID-19 patients on the day of hospital admission and on the day of discharge and its association with clinical variables. Methods â€“ A cross sectional study design with sample of 104 patients admitted in the COVID wards. Socio-demographic and COVID related clinical variables and laboratory parameters were recorded. The severity of stress (PSS scale), anxiety (HAM-A scale) and depression (HAM-D scale) was assessed on the day of hospital admission & on the day of discharge. Association between change in severity of these and other variables was assessed. Results Significant increase in severity of stress, anxiety and depression was found during indoor stay of Covid-19 patients. Severity increased despite improvement in physical status of subjects. There was no significant association of increased severity of stress, anxiety, depression with demographic variables and laboratory parameters. Conclusion â€“ There was a significant increase in level of stress, anxiety and depression during the inpatient stay despite improvement in clinical symptoms, with minimal association with demographic and clinical variables. INTRODUCTION Since the beginning of COVID 19 pandemic, issues related to mental health has been highlighted repeatedly. Apparently fear of the consequences of this deadly disease has led to increase in stress, anxiety and depression in COVID hospitalized patients.[1]The psychosocial stressors are not only limited to those who were infected but are also exacerbated in the un-infected individuals.[2] Various factors that may be responsible for this include the direct effect of virus in central nervous system, the neuropsychiatric effects of inflammatory markers, the psychological impact of contact isolation and the stigma of getting infected, and disrupted social functions associated with serious illness.[4] Few studies from other countries have shown that most of the hospitalized COVID 19 patients report increased symptoms of anxiety and depression during their inpatient stay. This was significantly associated with occupation status, level of education and severity of Covid-19 illness. [2, 3] However, most of published research available on psychological impact of COVID 19 had focussed more on healthcare workers [11,12,25] and general public or outpatient setting. [13]To our knowledge, there is no literature from India that had assessed change in severity of stress, anxiety and depression in COVID 19 and its associated variables during their hospital stay as indoor patients in Covid-19 Ward. The primary objective of present study was to assess the change in severity of stress, anxiety and depression in COVID-19 patients on the day of admission and on the day of discharge. Secondary objective was to find any association between the change in severity of stress, anxiety and depression with socio-demographic and Covid 19 related clinical variables. METHODS Study Setting â€“COVID inpatient ward in a tertiary care medical college. Study Design â€“A cross-sectional study design with assessment of subjects at two points- 1st on the day of admission and 2nd on the day of discharge. Sample size â€“All the subjects admitted to COVID wards over two months period between 25th May 2021 and 24th July 2021 were approached for their willingness to participate in the study. We could recruit total 104 subjects who met eligibility criteria and gave informed consent. Eligibility Criteria - Inclusion criteria â€“ 1. Patients above 18 years of age with positive COVID RT-PCR report. 2. Patients admitted to Covid-19 ward in the tertiary care hospital. Exclusion criteria â€“ the following patients were excluded: 1. Only Rapid Antigen Test positive 2. Only HRCT suggestive of typical pneumonia 3. Pre-existing psychiatric illness and substance abuse except nicotine 4. Non-invasive ventilation support or medically unstable 5. Persons with impaired capacity Ethical aspects â€“ As per institutionâ€™s policy for research on human subjects approval from the Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) and then from Ethics Committee for Research on Human Subjects (ECRHS) of the institute was obtained. Written informed consent was obtained from all the participants and they were explained about their right to leave the study at any point of time without any impact on their ongoing treatment for Covid-19 illness. No additional financial burden was put on the subjects by participation in study. Assessments â€“ Subjectâ€™s socio-demographic and clinical information was recorded anonymously in a pre-designed and pilot tested format. Information included sex, age, marital status, employment status, education, income of head of family and details of primary care giver. The socio-economic status was classified using Kuppuswamy scale. We also recorded clinical variables related to COVID-19 illness like Heart Rate, temperature, Blood pressure, respiratory rate, Oxygen saturation (SPO2) on the day of admission and on the day of discharge to assess clinical improvement in Covid-19 illness. Severity of stress, Depression and anxiety were also assessed at same two time points. Level of stress was assessed using perceived stress scale (PSS) which classifies stress level into Mild stress (0-13), Moderate stress (14-26), Severe stress (27-40). [4,5] The severity of anxiety was assessed using Hamilton Anxiety rating scale (HAM-A). Total score obtained can be classified into No anxiety (0-7), mild anxiety (8-14), moderate anxiety (15-23), severe anxiety (&gt;24). [6] Severity of depression was assessed using Hamilton Depression rating scale (HAM-D). Total score obtained classifies severity of depression as no depression (0-7) mild depression (8-16), moderate depression (17-23), severe depression (&gt;24). [7] Both these scales are already validated to estimate the change in severity of anxiety and depression over a period in time.[8] Laboratory investigations like d-dimer, ferritin, Lactate Dehydrogenase, Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate, C-Reactive Protein were recorded only once during the inpatient stay. Statistical analysis - The collected data was analysed using SPSS (Statistical Software for social Sciences) software version 25. Initially descriptive statistics was carried out for the variables using appropriate measures of central tendency. Association between the severity of stress, anxiety and depression with socio-demographic and clinical variables was done using the Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test and spearmanâ€™s correlation. Significance was set with 95% confidence level and p value &lt; 0.05 was taken as significant. RESULTS Majority of the patients were male (63.4%) with male to female ratio of 1.7. Maximum patients were in the age group of 31-40 years (35.5%) followed by 51 - 60 years (27.8%) and 41-50 years (24.2%). Most were from the rural area (79%), belonging to Hindu religion (95.2%) and had education up to middle school (34.6%). The participants were at clerk level (41.3%), married (85.6%), had full time job (79%). As per Kuppuswamy scale, the subjects could be classified as upper middle (10%), lower middle (67%), upper lower (23%) and none belonged to upper and lower class.Spouse (67%) were the most common caregivers. Average IPD stay in covid-19 ward was 8.23 (2.9). Table-1 shows change in severity of stress, anxiety, depression and clinical variables measured at two cross sections. It is evident that more number of patients experienced higher levels of stress, anxiety and depression at the time of discharge despite being sent to their homes to stay with their family members.Table 1 Severity of Stress, anxiety and depression as measured on day of admission and day of discharge from COVID-19VariableSeverityOn day of Admission N (%)On day of discharge N (%)Significance (p value)Stress PSS)Mild66 (63.46)46 (44.23)0.0054Moderate 33 (31.73)41 (39.42)0.2479Severe05 (4.80)17 (16.35)0.0069Anxiety (HAM-A)No Anxiety63 (60.57)53 (50.9)0.1614Mild16 (15.38)21 (20.19)0.3684Moderate14 (13.46)22 (21.15)0.1436Severe01 (0.96)08 (7.69)0.0173Depression(HAM-D)No Depression88 (84.61)77 (74.03)0.0602Mild12 (11.53)19 (18.26)0.1739Moderate02 (1.9)5 (4.8)0.2463Severe02 (1.9)3 (2.8)0.6691 Change in stress level, anxiety and depression and the Covid -19 related clinical variables from day of admission to on day of discharge is stated in Table-2. Compared to the assessment on the day of admission, there was significant increase in the level of stress, anxiety and depression on the day of discharge, despite favourable improvement in physical condition as indicated by covid-19 related clinical variables (temperature, pulse rate, blood pressure and oxygen saturation) as listed in the table. This indicates that itâ€™s not the clinical severity of Covid-19 illness itself that causes psychological distress, but inpatient stay and factors associated with it, may also lead to psychological distress in patients admitted to Covid-19 wards.Table 2 Change in stress level, anxiety and depression and the Covid -19 related clinical variables from day of admission to on day of dischargeVariablesPSSHAM-AHAM-DTemperaturePulse RateRespiratory rateBP SystolicBP DiastolicOxygen Saturation Mean value (SD) on Admission10.30 (9.10)6.05 (6.54)3.78 (4.57)99.01 (1.54)90 (9.79)32 (32.8)123.96 (9.75)82.82 (6.14)94.28 (10.2)Mean value (SD) on Discharge15.08 (9.88)8.57 (8.65)4.91 (5.83)98.17 (0.60)84 (6.28)26 (9.73)120.55 (5.56)80.56 (5.56)96.98 (9.88)Difference-4.78-2.52-1.130.84663.412.26-2.7Z-4.93b-4.18b-3.20b-5.94a-5.72a-3.11a-3.38a-3.74a-7.49bP value0.0000.0000.0010.0000.0000.0020.0010.0000.000 Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test. p&lt;0.01 is highly significant, a=based on positiveranks, b=based on negative rank Table-3 demonstrates association between demographic variables, laboratory parameters with change in levels of stress, anxiety and depression during hospital stay.

This is happening despite clinical improvement in th se subjects. For demographic variables, in line with previously published studies, a higher proportion of patients in our study were in the age group of 31 â€“ 60 years, more than half were male, belonged to rural region, had some education,and majority were doing clerical jobs or any part time jobs,and belonged to lower middle class.[1,2] A recent study conducted to assess the level of stress anxiety and depressions during hospitalization reported similar demographic profile with majority participants being male, married and had good level of education and were employed.[1] Few studies which were of cross sectional nature suggested high levels of anxiety as a form of psychological stress, especially following the isolation to seek treatment of COVID 19 infection. [2, 9] Our study had assessed these at two points and the level of stress, anxiety and depression was found to be more on the day of the discharge from hospital than on day of admission. In contrast to this, a study from Israel found that the level of anxiety and depression decreased one month following hospitalization. [15] Some studies included the past psychiatric illness and substance use as a variable, but we excluded the subjects with pre-existing or past psychiatric illness from our study to avoid confounding effect. [1,2] Authors in an Italian study evaluated COVID 19 patients in the emergency department and then screened for psychopathology approximately 1 month after initial emergency department evaluation. It was found that 56% of patients screened positive in at least one psychiatric domain. Approximately 31% screened positive for depression, 42% for anxiety, and 28% for obsessive-compulsive symptoms. [10] In our study there was no association between interaction with care giver and severity of stress, anxiety and depression, however few studies also found that isolation and lack of support from care givers and relatives was the key factor for anxiety and depression where less social supports led to more anxiety and depressive symptoms and more depression was found in caregivers. [3,15,21] A study conducted in Wuhan China, the prevalence rate of depression and anxiety was found to be 21% and 16.4% respectively. [14] Few other studies also reported psychological distress after hospital discharge. [17, 18, 23] In our study severity of stress, anxiety and depression is not strongly associated with demographic and social variables, may be due to strong social support and intact family bonding in Indian settings. Depression was also found in quarantined patients. The family support & social interaction was alleviating factor. [24] This differs from findings of studies from other countries which reported that lack of social support for patients with COVID-19 being associated with depression and socioeconomic status bearing major impact on severity of depression. [18,19,20] Present study was unique from our country to assess the change in the severity level of stress, anxiety and depression during hospital stay in indoor patients of Covid-19 illness. Findings of our study highlight need for inclusion of psychological screening and appropriate management of all patients admitted to Covid-19 ward. Similar recommendations had been made by other authors. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy was found to be effective in reducing psychological distress in patients. [22] Among our subjects, all those with significant levels of anxiety and depression were provided treatment at the time of discharge itself. They were informed to be on regular follow in psychiatry OPD after discharge from the ward. After completion of study and preliminary analysis of data, to reduce the stress of admitted patients, we conducted stress management sessions in COVID wards itself as an initiative of our department. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS The major strength is this is the first study in India which has assessed the change in levels of stress, anxiety and depression during the inpatient [IPD] stay of COVID 19 patients and initiated appropriate management for same. The results of the study should be interpreted with the limitations of it being a single centre study with assessment of only inpatients and cross-sectional design of the study. CONCLUSIONS There was a significant increase in level of stress, anxiety and depression during the inpatient stay of COVID 19 patients despite improvement in fever and respiratory distress. This change was associated with level of their income and some lab parameters. However, majority of the demographic and clinical variables had no significant impact on increased level of stress, anxiety and depression. Findings highlight the need for appropriate intervention for their psychological health as an essential part of care in COVID wards. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST: None REFERENCES 1.

"The Emotional Anatomy of Lockdown","Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, policy makers have tried to balance the effectiveness of lockdowns (or stay-at-home orders) with their potential mental health costs. Yet, two years into the pandemic, we are still lacking solid evidence about the emotional toll of lockdowns. Across two intensive longitudinal datasets with 14,511 observations collected in Australia in 2021 (total N = 441), we compare the degree, persistence, and regulation of peopleâ€™s emotions on days in and out of lockdown. We find that lockdowns take an emotional toll, but that this toll is relatively mild. In lockdown, people experienced slightly more negative and slightly less positive emotion; returned to a mildly negative emotional state more quickly; and used low-effort emotion regulation strategies. We conclude that people are resilient to the challenges lockdowns pose to personal and social well-being.","Ella Moeck et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E00FC-EBD-FDD","20220617","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-17","",32981,""
