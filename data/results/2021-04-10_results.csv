"Mental health inequalities in healthcare, economic, and housing disruption during COVID -19: an investigation in 12 longitudinal studies","BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic and its associated virus suppression measures have disrupted lives and livelihoods, potentially exacerbating inequalities. People already experiencing mental ill-health may have been especially vulnerable to disruptions.

AimInvestigate associations between pre-pandemic psychological distress and disruptions during the pandemic to (1) healthcare, economic activity, and housing, (2) cumulative disruptions and 3) whether these differ by age, sex, ethnicity or education.

MethodsData were from 59,482 participants in 12 UK longitudinal adult population surveys with data collected both prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants self-reported disruptions since the start of the pandemic to: healthcare (medication access, procedures, or appointments); economic activity (negative changes in employment, income or working hours); and housing (change of address or household composition). Logistic regression models were used within each study to estimate associations between pre-pandemic psychological distress scores and disruption outcomes. Findings were synthesised using a random effects meta-analysis with restricted maximum likelihood.

ResultsBetween one to two-thirds of study participants experienced at least one disruption during the pandemic, with 2.3-33.2% experiencing disruptions in 2 or more of the 3 domains examined. One standard deviation higher pre-pandemic psychological distress was associated with: (i) increased odds of any healthcare disruptions (OR=1.30; 95% CI: 1.20 to 1.40) with fully adjusted ORs ranging from 1.33 [1.20 to 1.49] for disruptions to prescriptions or medication access and 1.24 [1.09 to 1.41] for disruption to procedures; (ii) loss of employment (OR=1.13 [1.06 to 1.21]) and income (OR=1.12 [1.06 to 1.19]) and reductions in working hours/furlough (OR=1.05 [1.00 to 1.09]); (iii) no associations with housing disruptions (OR=1.00 [0.97 to 1.03]); and (iv) increased likelihood of experiencing a disruption in at least two domains (OR=1.25 [1.18 to 1.32]) or in one domain (OR=1.11 [1.07 to 1.16]) relative to experiencing no disruption. We did not find evidence of these associations differing by sex, ethnicity, education level, or age.

ConclusionThose suffering from psychological distress before the pandemic were more likely to experience healthcare disruptions, economic disruptions related to unemployment and loss of income, and to clusters of disruptions across multiple domains during the pandemic. Considering mental ill-health was already unequally distributed in the UK population, the pandemic may exacerbate existing mental health inequalities. Individuals with poor mental health may need additional support to manage these pandemic-associated disruptions.","Giorgio Di Gessa; Jane Maddock; Michael J Green; Ellen J Thompson; Eoin McElroy; Helena L Davies; Jessica Mundy; Anna J Stevenson; Alex S.F Kwong; Gareth J Griffith; Srinivasa Vittal Katikireddi; Claire L Niedzwiedz; George B Ploubidis; Emla Fitzsimons; Morag Henderson; Richard J.

"Depression and anxiety in pregnancy during COVID-19: A rapid review and meta-analysis","The study rapidly reviewed and meta-analyzed the worldwide prevalence of depression and anxiety among pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. A systematic search of the literature and meta-analyses were conducted from December 2019 - February 2021 with a total of 46 studies meeting inclusion criteria. Depression was assessed in 37 studies (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 47,677), with a pooled prevalence of 25.6%. Anxiety was assessed in 34 studies (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 42,773), with a pooled prevalence of 30.5%; moderation by time showed that prevalence of anxiety was higher in studies conducted later in the pandemic.","Tomfohr-Madsen, Racine, Giesbrecht, Lebel, Madigan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113912","20210409","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Mental health; Meta-analysis; Pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-10","",12786,""
"Impacts and challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic on emergency medicine physicians in the United States","Emergency medicine (EM) physicians have been on the front line of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to determine the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and other related factors such as resource availability and institutional support on well-being, burnout and job-satisfaction of EM physicians in the United States. A cross-sectional survey study of EM physicians was conducted through the Emergency Medicine Practice Research Network of the ACEP. The survey focused on resource adequacy, institutional support, well-being, and burnout. A total of 890 EM physicians were invited to participate. Both descriptive and risk adjusted, and multivariate regressions were performed with a statistical significance defined as p &lt; 0.05. EM physicians' response rate was 18.7% (166) from 39 states. Burnout was reported by 74.7% (124) since the start of the pandemic. Factors contributing included work-related emotional strain and anxiety, isolation from family and friends, and increased workload. Those reporting inadequate resources felt ignored by their institutions (p &lt; 0.0001). Physicians who felt there was inadequate institutional support, were also dissatisfied with patient care resources (p = 0.001). Physicians expressing job dissatisfaction were more likely to report feelings of burnout (p = 0.001). EM physicians face greater burnout in the COVID-19 pandemic. This may be compounded by resource scarcity, psychological stress, isolation, and job dissatisfaction. Many of the survey respondents reported inadequate mental health services and resources. The findings of this study may help identify solutions to mitigate these issues.","Nguyen, Liu, McKenney, Liu, Ang, Elkbuli","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2021.03.088","20210409","American College of Emergency Physicians; COVID-19 pandemic; Emergency physicians, burnout; Institutional support; Job satisfaction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-10","",12787,""
"COVID-19 and Suicide: A Deadly Association","COVID-19 hit the world amidst an unprecedented suicide epidemic in this century. As the world focuses on limiting the spread of the virus and prioritizing acutely medically ill patients, containment measures are not without mental health consequences. With rising anxiety and depression, risk of suicide-acutely and in the aftermath of the pandemic-also rises. This article aims to shed light on this major public health problem and better understand what factors may create or exacerbate psychiatric symptoms and suicide. We review suicide data predating the pandemic and examine impact of previous epidemics on suicide rates. We then focus on the current pandemic's impacts and the world's response to COVID-19. We examine how these may lead to increased suicide rates, focusing on the US population. Finally, we offer suggestions on mitigating interventions to curb the impending rise in suicide and the resultant increased burden on an already stretched health care system.","Abi Zeid Daou, Rached, Geller","https://doi.org/10.1097/NMD.0000000000001338","20210409","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-10","",12788,""
"The differential effects of social media on depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation among the younger and older population during COVID-19: Population-based cross-sectional survey study","Social media has become a ubiquitous part of daily life during the COVID-19 isolation. However, the role of social media use in depression and suicidal ideation of the general public remains unclear. Related empirical studies were limited and reported inconsistent findings. Little is known about the potential underlying mechanisms that may illustrate the relationship between social media use and depression/suicidal ideation during COVID-19. This study tested the mediation effects of social loneliness and post-traumatic stress (PTSD symptoms) on the relationship between social media use and depressive symptoms/suicidal ideation and the moderation effect of age on the mediation models. We administered a population-based random telephone survey in May and June 2020 when infection control measures were being vigorously implemented in Hong Kong. 1070 adults (658 social media users and 412 non-users) completed the survey. Structural equation modeling (SEM) and multigroup SEM were conducted to test the mediation and moderation effects. The weighted prevalence of probable depression was 11.6%; 1.6% had suicidal ideation in the past two weeks. Both moderated mediation models of depressive symptoms (Ãâ€¡2(df)=335.34(62), p&lt;.05, CFI=.94, NNFI=.92, RMSEA=.06) and suicidal ideation (Ãâ€¡2(df)=50.80(34), p&lt;.05, CFI=.99, NNFI=.99, RMSEA=.02) showed acceptable model fit. There was a significantly negative direct effect of social media use on depressive symptoms among older people (ÃŽÂ²=-.07, p=.04) but not among younger people (ÃŽÂ²=.04, p=.55). The indirect effect via PTSD symptoms was significantly positive among both younger (ÃŽÂ²=.09, p=.02) and older people (ÃŽÂ²=.10, p=.01). The indirect effect via social loneliness was significant among older people (ÃŽÂ²=-.01, p=.04) but not among younger people (ÃŽÂ²=.01, p=.31). The direct effect of social media use on suicidal ideation was not statistically significant in both age groups (p&gt;.05). The indirect effects via PTSD symptoms were statistically significant among younger (ÃŽÂ²=.02, p=.04) and older people (ÃŽÂ²=.03, p=.01). Social loneliness was not a significant mediator between social media use and suicidal ideation among neither younger nor older people (p&gt;.05). Social media may be a 'double-edged sword' for psycho-social well-being during COVID-19 and its roles vary across age groups. The mediators identified in this study can be addressed by psychological interventions to prevent severe mental health problems during and after COVID-19.","Yang, Yip, Mak, Zhang, Lee, Wong","https://doi.org/10.2196/24623","20210409","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-10","",12789,""
"Telemedicine usage via WeChat for Children with Congenital Heart Disease Preoperatively During COVID-19 Pandemic: A Retrospective Analysis","During the COVID-19 pandemic, parents of infants having medical problem face challenges of insufficient medical resources at home. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of WeChat-based telehealth services on the preoperative follow-up of infants with congenital heart disease (CHD) during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 190 infants with CHD who underwent remote follow-up via WeChat from December 2019 to May 2020 in Fujian Maternity and Child Health Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University. In addition, the psychological benefits of WeChat on the parents of these infants were analyzed. In total, 190 infants were involved in this study, including 72 cases of ventricular septal defects, 42 cases of patent ductus arteriosus, 55 cases of atrial septal defects, 3 cases of tetralogy of Fallot, 2 cases of endocardial cushion defects, 12 cases of pulmonary stenosis, 2 cases of total anomalous pulmonary venous connection and 2 cases of aortic arch constriction. During the follow-up period, 48 infants who received surgical indications were hospitalized in time for surgical treatment. It was recommended that 10 infants with respiratory tract infections be treated in local hospitals through the WeChat platform. We provided feeding guidance to 28 infants with dysplasia through the WeChat platform. The psychological evaluation results of parents showed that the median score and range of Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) scores were 42 and 32-58, respectively. Nine parents (4.7%) were clinically depressed, while the majority had mild depression. The median score and range of Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) scores were 44 and 31-59, respectively. Twenty parents (10.5%) had clinical anxiety, while the rest had mild anxiety. During the COVID-19 pandemic, follow-up management and health services for infants with CHD prior to surgery through the WeChat platform were useful in identifying the state of an infants' condition as well as in identifying and relieving care pressure, anxiety and depression in the parents.","Zhang, Xie, Lei, Cao, Chen","https://doi.org/10.1093/intqhc/mzab066","20210409","COVID-19; Congenital heart disease (CHD); Telehealth services; WeChat","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-10","",12790,""
"[Coronavirus Pandemic - #STAYHOME: How Are You Holding Up? Questions And Tips For 11-18-Year-Olds To Make It Better]","Adolescents have to cope with several challenges and restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with many of those incongruent with the typical developmental tasks of adolescent age. Some adolescents might be particularly vulnerable in this situation, including those who are deprived of psychological, social or health care services and/or are exposed to abuse or neglect in their home environment. The aims of the current international multicentre follow-up study are to: 1. collect data on the mental health and quality of life of adolescents during and after the pandemic; 2. improve their mental health by providing an online prevention program that addresses their actual needs; 3. accelerate the development of culturally adapted prevention programs by involving an international team, and 4. to contribute to adequate preparation for any potentially occurring, similar situationin the future. Participants aged 11-18 years and their parents/caregivers from diff erent parts of Europe and non-European countries are recruited online. Data are collected regularly in a follow-up study by means of structured self-administered online questionnaires on adolescents' mental health, quality of life and current attitudes and needs. The baseline data collection was in March 2020 at first restrictions of the COVID pandemic in Europe. It is followed up several times (at the beginning weekly, later monthly, bi-monthly, three-monthly) to study changes in mental health, quality of life and attitudes of children and adolescents during the coronavirus disease pandemic. Data were collected by means of structured questionnaires (see below). The time frame of the study is set to one year from study start, March 2021. The last data collection was done in December 2020. The prevention program is developed and provided based on continuously analysed incoming data. Prevention based on the results of the study is expected to contribute to maintaining adolescents' mental health, improve their quality of life, increase their and their environment's cooperation with the necessary restrictions during the pandemic, and to make reintegration easier once the restrictions are over. Furthermore, the study has the potential to inform on the wellbeing of children and adolescents in extreme situations in general, thus contribute to future preventive measures and policymaking. Implications and Contribution: The proposed international online follow-up study is expected to provide scientifi c evidence for 1. possible changes in the mental health and quality of life of adolescents during and after a pandemic situation, 2. the eff ectiveness of a culturally adapted prevention program developed to address challenges associated with these changes.","SzentivÃƒÂ¡nyi, Horvath, Kjeldsen, L Buist, Farkas, Ferenczi-Dallos, Garas, Gyori, Gyorfi, Gyorfi, Ravens-Sieberer, Balazs","https://www.google.com/search?q=[Coronavirus+Pandemic+-+#STAYHOME:+How+Are+You+Holding+Up?+Questions+And+Tips+For+11-18-Year-Olds+To+Make+It+Better].","20210409","COVID-19 pandemic; adolescent; mental health; quality of life online prevention program.; restrictions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-10","",12791,""
"[Mental health assessment of medical workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Russia: results of an online survey]","To assess the mental health of health workers during a pandemic. Eight hundred and twelve medical workers took part in a cross-sectional Internet survey. The questionnaire included a socio-demographic block, a block of questionnaires for assessing the level of symptoms of anxiety and depression (PHQ-9 and GAD-7). The data were processed using statistical methods. The prevalence of anxiety and depression among healthcare providers during the pandemic was 48.77% and 57.63% respectively. Subjectively poor quality of sleep was noted by 37.4% of respondents. Cluster analysis distinguished 4 groups of respondents: group 1 was characterized by high scores on PHQ-9 and GAD-7 and a low subjective assessment of sleep quality; group 2 had low scores on PHQ-9 and GAD-7 and a high subjective assessment of sleep quality; respondents from clusters 3 and 4 had average total scores on PHQ-9 and GAD-7, however, group 4 was characterized by significantly lower values of subjective sleep quality assessment. The division into clusters makes it possible to understand which groups of medical workers require psychological (psychotherapeutic) support in the first place. Cluster 1 respondents with high levels of anxiety and depression, as well as poor sleep quality, need priority assistance.

"The impact of confinement on older Jordanian adults'Ã‚Â mental distress during the COVID-19 pandemic: A web-based cross-sectional study","This study aimed to determine the impact of Coronavirus disease, 2019 (COVID-19) confinement on older Jordanian adults' mental distress and to assess which study variables that predict Posttraumatic Stress disorder. This cross-sectional study was conducted on 315 older Jordanian adults using an online survey in Amman, Jordan between May 28 andÃ‚Â June 12. The assessment revealed a moderate level of avoidance (MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.97, SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.7), a higher effect of intrusion (MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.08, SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.9), an above midpoint level of fear 18.50Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°8.6, and mild depression (MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°6.96, SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°7.3).

"A Path Forward: Mental Health and the US Pandemic Response","The COVID-19 pandemic presents a crisis of mental health in the United States (U.S.) alongside a crisis of infectious disease. Racial inequities in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality have brought health equity to the forefront of public health policy, exacerbating prior inequities in mental health care access and outcomes. This Commentary asserts that policymakers and advocates must prioritize mental health when responding to the pandemic. While the pandemic is an emergency of unprecedented scale, the authors argue that it also is an opportunity to implement broad-based mental health policy reforms in the U.S. that build on the successes of the Affordable Care Act and the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act. Guided by innovative state and local policies to promote population-level mental health, we outline a series of empirically grounded strategies for federal and state policymakers to promote mental health equity in the wake of COVID-19.","McCray, Rosenberg","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11414-020-09747-9","20210409","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-10","",12794,""
"Ambulatory Patients with Cardiometabolic Disease and Without Evidence of COVID-19 During the Pandemic The CorCOVID LATAM Study","SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has modified the cardiovascular care of ambulatory patients. The aim of this survey was to study changes in lifestyle habits, treatment adherence, and mental health status in patients with cardiometabolic disease, but no clinical evidence of COVID-19. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in ambulatory patients with cardiometabolic disease using paper/digital surveys. Variables investigated included socioeconomic status, physical activity, diet, tobacco use, alcohol intake, treatment discontinuation, and psychological symptoms. A total of 4,216 patients (50.9% males, mean age 60.3 Ã‚Â± 15.3 years old) from 13 Spanish-speaking Latin American countries were enrolled. Among the study population, 46.4% of patients did not have contact with a healthcare provider, 31.5% reported access barriers to treatments and 17% discontinued some medication. Multivariate analysis showed that non-adherence to treatment was more prevalent in the secondary prevention group: peripheral vascular disease (OR 1.55, CI 1.08-2.24; p = 0.018), heart failure (OR 1.36, CI 1.05-1.75; p = 0.017), and coronary artery disease (OR 1.29 CI 1.04-1.60; p = 0.018). No physical activity was reported by 38% of patients. Only 15% of patients met minimum recommendations of physical activity (more than 150 minutes/week) and vegetable and fruit intake. Low/very low income (45.5%) was associated with a lower level of physical activity (p &lt; 0.0001), less fruit and vegetables intake (p &lt; 0.0001), more tobacco use (p &lt; 0.001) and perception of depression (p &lt; 0.001). Low educational level was also associated with the perception of depression (OR 1.46, CI 1.26-1.70; p &lt; 0.01). Patients with cardiometabolic disease but without clinical evidence of COVID-19 showed significant medication non-adherence, especially in secondary prevention patients. Deterioration in lifestyle habits and appearance of depressive symptoms during the pandemic were frequent and related to socioeconomic status.","Santi, MÃƒÂ¡rquez, Piskorz, Saldarriaga, Lorenzatti, Wyss, MartÃƒÂ­n, Perales, Arcela, de Lourdes Rojas Gimon, Sambadaro, Perez, Mendoza, Lanas, Flores, Liprandi, Alexander, Baranchuk","https://doi.org/10.5334/gh.932","20210409","COVID-19 pandemic; Latin America; SARS-CoV-2; cardiometabolic disease; cardiovascular disease; social determinants","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-10","",12795,""
"Associations Between Fear of COVID-19, Affective Symptoms and Risk Perception Among Community-Dwelling Older Adults During a COVID-19 Lockdown","Fear is a common and potentially distressful psychological response to the current COVID-19 pandemic. The factors associated with such fear remains relatively unstudied among older adults. We investigated if fear of COVID-19 could be associated with a combination of psychological factors such as anxiety and depressive symptoms, and risk perception of COVID-19, and demographic factors in a community sample of older adults. Older adults (<i>N</i> = 413, <i>M</i><sub>age</sub> = 69.09 years, <i>SD</i> = 5.45) completed measures of fear of COVID-19, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and risk perception of COVID-19, during a COVID-19 lockdown. These variables, together with demographics, were fitted to a structural equation model. Anxiety and depressive symptoms were highly correlated with each other and were combined into the higher order latent variable of affective symptoms for analyses. The final model revealed that fear of COVID-19 was positively associated with psychological factors of affective symptoms and risk perception. Older age was associated with greater fear of COVID-19. Our findings showed that fear of COVID-19 can be a projection of pre-existing affective symptoms and inflated risk perceptions and highlighted the need to address the incorrect risk perceptions of COVID-19 and socio-affective issues among older adults in the community.","Han, Mahendran, Yu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.638831","20210409","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; fear; older adults; risk perception","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-10","",12796,""
"How Does a Sport Psychological Intervention Help Professional Cyclists to Cope With Their Mental Health During the COVID-19 Lockdown?","All around the world in March, due to COVID-19, competitive sport calendars were suddenly canceled, jeopardizing the training programs of athletes. Moreover, in Italy, the government banned all non-essential travel across the entire country from the beginning of March. Consequently, Italian cyclists were banned from leaving their homes and therefore unable to perform their ordinary training activities. The Italian Association of Professional Cyclists (ACCPI) early on during that period noticed that several cyclists were experiencing a worrying decrease in their mental well-being and asked the authors to set up an online Sport Psychology Intervention (SPI) during lockdown to enhance the athletes' mental health. Through a number of unprecedented events and considerations, the aim of the current investigation was to assess the Italian cyclists' mental health during the lockdown and its changes after the SPI. We validated the Italian version of the Sport Mental Health Continuum Short Form (Sport MHC-SF)-presented in Study 1-and then applied it to a sample of Italian professional cyclists-presented in Study 2-prior to and after the SPI. To achieve these objectives, the reliability and construct validity of the Italian version of the Sport MHC-SF were tested in Study 1. RM-MANOVA tests were run to evaluate the effect of SPI on cyclists in Study 2. A total of 185 Italian athletes were involved in the validation of the MHC in Study 1 and 38 professional cyclists in Study 2. Results from Study 1 suggested a three-factor higher order model of Sport MHC-SF [Model fit: Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup>(df) = 471.252 (252), <i>p</i> &lt; 0.000; CFI = 0.951; RMSEA = 0.049; RMR= 0.048]. MCFA showed that the default model kept invariance among groups of athletes (i.e., female, male, individual, and team sports). Results from Study 2 highlighted that professional cyclists who followed the SPI were able to cope better with psychological stressors, showing improved well-being compared to the athletes that did not. No significant differences were found for emotional and social well-being. The present multi-study paper contributes to the theoretical field with a validated measure of Sport MHC-SF translated in the Italian language and culture. It also provides practical implications related to cases of reduced mental health due to injury, illness, or similar situations of home confinement in the future.","Bertollo, Forzini, Biondi, Di Liborio, Vaccaro, Georgiadis, Conti","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.607152","20210409","coronavirus; cycling; elite athletes; mental health; performance; professional athletes; sport psychology; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-10","",12797,""
"A Fear of COVID-19 and PTSD Symptoms in Pathological Personality: The Mediating Effect of Dissociation and Emotion Dysregulation","<b>Background:</b> The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak is currently putting a strain on the mental health resilience of the world's population. Specifically, it is likely to elicit an intense response to fear and to act as a risk factor for the onset of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Some individuals may be more at risk than others, with pathological personality variables being a potential candidate as a central vulnerability factor. In addition, the pathways that lead the pathological personality to PTSD and intense fear responses to COVID-19 are likely to be explained by poor emotion regulation capacities, as well as by dissociative mechanisms. <b>Aims:</b> This study aimed to shed light on vulnerability factors that may account for the onset of PTSD and intense responses of fear in response to COVID-19 outbreak and to test the mediating role of emotion dysregulation and dissociation proneness in these pathways. <b>Methods:</b> We used a longitudinal design of research administered to a sample of community individuals (<i>N</i> = 308; mean<sub>age</sub> = 35.31, SD = 13.91; 22.7% were male). Moreover, we used self-report questionnaires to measure pathological personality, emotion regulation capacities, dissociative proneness at the beginning of the lockdown, and PTSD symptoms and fear of COVID-19 at the end of the Italian lockdown (from March 9 to May 18, 2020). Structural equation modeling was used to test the hypotheses. <b>Results:</b> We found that pathological personality levels longitudinally predicted PTSD and fear of COVID-19 levels. Moreover, the associations between emotion dysregulation and dissociation were shown to significantly and totally mediate the relationship between pathological personality and PTSD, whereas no significant mediation effects were observed in relation to fear of COVID-19. <b>Conclusions:</b> Individuals with pathological personality traits may be more vulnerable to the onset of negative psychological consequences related to COVID-19 outbreak, such as PTSD symptomatology and fear levels. Emotion regulation capacities appear to be relevant targets of interventions for PTSD symptomatology. Future research should explore the mediating variables linking pathological personality to intense fear responses to COVID-19.","Velotti, Civilla, Rogier, Beomonte Zobel","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.590021","20210409","dissociation; emotion dysregulation; fear of COVID-19; longitudinal; pathological personality; posttraumatic stress disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-10","",12798,""
"COVID-19: Mental Health Prevention and Care for Healthcare Professionals","The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic exposed health professionals to high stress levels inducing significant psychological impact. Our region, <i>Grand Est</i>, was the most impacted French region during the first COVID-19 wave. In this context, we created CoviPsyHUS, local mental health prevention and care system dedicated explicitly to healthcare workers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in one of this region's tertiary hospitals. We deployed CoviPsyHUS gradually in 1 month. To date, CoviPsyHUS comprises 60 mental health professionals dedicated to 4 complementary components: (i) a mental health support hotline (170 calls), (ii) relaxation rooms (used by 2,120 healthcare workers with 110 therapeutic workshops offered), (iii) mobile teams (1,200 contacts with healthcare staff), and (iv) a section dedicated to patients and their families. Among the critical points to integrate mental health care system during a crisis, we identified: (i) massive dissemination of mental health support information with multimodal communication, (ii) clear identification of the mental health support system, (iii) proactive mobile teams to identify healthcare professionals in difficulty, (iv) concrete measures to relieve the healthcare professionals under pressure (e.g., the relay in communication with families), (v) support for primary needs (body care (physiotherapy), advice and first-line therapy for sleep disorders), and (vi) psychoeducation and emotion management techniques. The different components of CoviPsyHUS are vital elements in meeting the needs of caregivers in situations of continuous stress. The organization of 4 targeted, modular, and rapidly deployable components makes CoviPsyHUS an innovative, reactive, and replicable mental health prevention and care system that could serve as a universal support model for other COVID-19 affected teams or other exceptional health crises in the future.","Rolling, Mengin, Palacio, Mastelli, Fath, Gras, Von Hunolstein, SchrÃƒÂ¶der, Vidailhet","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.566740","20210409","COVID-19; continuous stress exposure; healthcare professionals; mental health; pandemic; psychological crisis prevention","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-10","",12799,""
"Coping With COVID-19: Mindfulness-Based Approaches for Mitigating Mental Health Crisis","The novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 that first emerged in Wuhan, China, in Nov-Dec 2019 has already impacted a significant proportion of the world population. Governments of many countries imposed quarantines and social distancing measures in 2020, many of which remain in place, to mitigate the spread of the SARS-Cov-2 virus causing the COVID-19 disease. The direct impact of COVID-19 on people infected with the virus, their families and the health care workers, as well as the impact of the mitigation measures such as quarantine, social distancing, and self-isolation on the rest of the population have contributed to a global mental health pandemic, including anxiety, depression, panic attacks, posttraumatic stress symptoms, psychosis, addiction, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and suicidality. These effects are present acutely (for example, due to fear of contamination or losing loved ones, effects of quarantine/isolation, withdrawal of community and social services, etc.) and may continue long after the pandemic is over (for example, due to bereavement, unemployment, financial losses, etc). The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered mental health problems in people without previous history of mental illness, as well as worsened the symptoms in those with pre-existing psychiatric diagnosis. Therefore, the global effort is called for to deal with this mental health pandemic secondary to COVID-19 itself to address the emergence of new as well as the exacerbation of the existing mental health issues. Conversely, this global context provides an extraordinary opportunity for studying individual differences in response to and resilience in the face of physical and psychological threat, challenge to &quot;normal&quot; way of life, and long-term uncertainty. In this viewpoint article we outline the particular suitability of mindfulness, its skills and mechanisms, as an approach to the prevention and management of mental health issues, as well as to the promotion of well-being and building the foundations of adaptability and flexibility in dealing with the long-term uncertainty and profound changes to the social, economic, and possibly political systems as this pandemic continues to unfold.","Antonova, Schlosser, Pandey, Kumari","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.563417","20210409","COVID-19; PTSD; anxiety; coping; depression; mental health; mindfulness; psychosis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-10","",12800,""
"Psychological Status and Correlated Factors of Primary Medical Staff During the COVID-19 Outbreak in Hefei City, China","To investigate the mental illness and correlated factors of primary medical staff during the COVID-19 outbreak in Hefei city, China. A total of 180 primary medical staff were randomly selected from seven community hospitals in Hefei Economic and Technological Development Zone as a study group. One hundred and eighty-two health people were recruited as the control group. The self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) and Psychological questionnaire of public health emergencies were distributed to them for evaluation. The score of SAS, SDS in study group was higher than that in control group [(35.57Ã‚Â±10.39) vs (31.31Ã‚Â±7.98); (44.16Ã‚Â±8.46) vs (41.47Ã‚Â±9.47)] (<i>t</i>=4.371, <i>P</i>&lt; 0.001; <i>t</i>=2.849, <i>P</i>=0.005). The fear subscale and total score in the psychological questionnaire of sudden public health events were negatively correlated with age (<i>r</i>=-0.216, <i>P</i>=0.004; <i>r</i>=-0.154, <i>P</i>=0.039). Marriage was negatively correlated with depression subscales in psychological questionnaires of SAS, SDS and sudden public health events (<i>r</i>=-0.184, <i>P</i>=0.013; <i>r</i>=-0.298, <i>P</i>&lt;0.001; <i>r</i>=-0.161, <i>P</i>=0.031; <i>r</i>=-0.147, <i>P</i>=0.049). Education level was positively correlated with the total score of a psychological questionnaire for sudden public health events (<i>r</i>=0.151, <i>P</i>=0.043); Logistic regression analysis showed that marital status was a protective factor of psychological abnormality. It is necessary to pay attention to the psychological status of primary medical staff, especially the young unmarried medical staff.","Wang, Gao, Li, Wu","https://doi.org/10.2147/JMDH.S289336","20210409","anxiety; depressed; doctor; novel coronavirus pneumonia; nurse","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-10","",12801,""
"ActiGraph and Short-term Heart Rate Variability Study Protocol: Amended for the COVID-19 Pandemic","ActiGraph accelerometry is widely used in nursing research to estimate daily physical activity. Heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of autonomic modulation, can be assessed in conjunction with the ActiGraph using a Polar H7 Bluetooth heart rate monitor. There is a paucity of nursing literature to guide nurse researchers' protocol development when using the ActiGraph to assess both physical activity and short-term HRV via its Bluetooth capabilities. The aim of this study was to describe a standardized research ActiGraph and HRV (ActiGraph HRV) protocol for an ongoing randomized controlled trial to measure physical activity and short-term HRV in patients with ischemic heart disease who report hopelessness. We outline the study protocol for the standardization of reliable and rigorous physical activity and HRV data collection using the ActiGraph wGT3X-BT and Polar H7 Bluetooth heart rate monitor, and data analysis using ActiLife and Kubios software programs. Sixty-four participants enrolled in the randomized controlled trial to date, and 45 (70.3%) have completed or are actively participating in the study. Heart rate variability data have been collected on 43 of the 45 participants (96%) to date. During the first data collection time point, 42 of 44 participants (95.5%) wore the ActiGraph for a minimum of 5 valid days, followed by 28 of 31 participants (90.3%) and 25 of 26 participants (96.2%) at subsequent data collection time points. The intraclass correlation for physical activity in this study is 0.95 and 0.98 for HRV. Revisions to the protocol were successfully implemented at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic for data collection using social distancing. The protocol was additionally amended in response to an unanticipated problem with ActiGraph battery life using Bluetooth technology. Use of the ActiGraph HRV protocol has led to a reliable and rigorous measurement of physical activity and HRV for patients with ischemic heart disease who report hopelessness in this randomized controlled trial. We provide an ActiGraph HRV protocol that can be adapted as a model in the development of ActiGraph HRV protocols for future nursing research in community and home-based settings while maximizing social distancing in the current and future pandemics.","Luong, Goodyke, Dunn, Baynard, Bronas","https://doi.org/10.1097/JCN.0000000000000817","20210409","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-10","",12802,""
"The COVID-19 pandemic and new clinical trial activations","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe disruptions in care for many patients. A key question is whether the landscape of clinical research has also changed. In a retrospective cohort study, we examined the association of the COVID-19 outbreak with new clinical trial activations. Trial data for all interventional and observational oncology, cardiovascular, and mental health studies from January 2015 through September 2020 were obtained from ClinicalTrials.gov . An interrupted time-series analysis with Poisson regression was used. We examined 62,252 trial activations. During the initial COVID-19 outbreak (February 2020 through May 2020), model-estimated monthly trial activations for US-based studies were only 57% of the expected estimate had the pandemic not occurred (relative riskÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.57, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.61, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). For non-US-based studies, the impact of the pandemic was less dramatic (relative riskÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.77, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.82, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), resulting in an overall 27% reduction in the relative risk of new trial activations for US-based trials compared to non-US-based trials (relative risk ratioÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.73, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.81, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). Although a rebound occurred in the initial reopening phase (June 2020 through September 2020), the rebound was weaker for US-based studies compared to non-US-based studies (relative risk ratioÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.87, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.95, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). These findings are consistent with the disproportionate burden of COVID-19 diagnoses and deaths during the initial phase of the pandemic in the USA. Reduced activation of cancer clinical trials will likely slow the pace of clinical research and new drug discovery, with long-term negative consequences for cancer patients. An important question is whether the renewed outbreak period of winter 2020/2021 will have a similarly negative impact on the initiation of new clinical research studies for non-COVID-19 diseases.","Unger, Xiao","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13063-021-05219-3","20210409","COVID-19; Cancer clinical trials; Cardiovascular clinical trials; ClinicalTrials.gov; Mental health clinical trials","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-10","",12803,""
"Can psychological flexibility and prosociality mitigate illness perceptions toward COVID-19 on mental health? A cross-sectional study among Hong Kong adults","The negative impact of COVID-19 pandemic on public mental health can be persistent and substantial over a long period of time, but little is known regarding what psychological factors or processes can buffer such impact. The present study aimed to examine the mediating roles of coping, psychological flexibility and prosociality in the impacts of perceived illness threats toward COVID-19 on mental health. Five-hundred and fourteen Hong Kong citizens (18Ã¢â‚¬â€°years or above) completed an online survey to measure illness perceptions toward COVID-19, coping, psychological flexibility, prosociality, and mental health, together with their socio-demographic variables. Structural equation modelling was used to explore the explanatory model that was the best-fit to illustrate the relationships between these constructs. Serial mediation structural equation model showed that only psychological flexibility (unstandardised beta coefficient, ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.12, 95% CI [-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.20, -Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.02], pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.031) and prosociality (unstandardised ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.04, 95% CI [0.01, 0.08], pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) fully mediated the relationship between illness perceptions toward COVID-19 and mental health. In addition, psychological flexibility exerted a direct effect on prosociality (standardised ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.22, 95% CI [0.12, 0.32], pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). This best-fit model explained 62% of the variance of mental health. Fostering psychological flexibility and prosocial behaviour may play significant roles in mitigating the adverse effects of COVID-19 and its perceived threats on public mental health.","Chong, Chien, Cheng, Kassianos, Gloster, Karekla","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-021-00692-6","20210409","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Mental health; Prosociality; Psychological flexibility","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-10","",12804,""
"Prevalence of psychiatric diagnosis and related psychopathological symptoms among patients with COVID-19 during the second wave of the pandemic","The possibility of psychopathological symptoms and related risk factors among normal persons and patients infected during the outbreak of COVID-19 has been widely investigated. The mental health outcomes of the second wave of the pandemic remain unclear, especially those of patients with an infection. Thus, this study aims to explore the prevalence of and related risk factors associated with psychopathological symptoms among patients infected with COVID-19 during the second wave. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in five isolated wards of a designated hospital in Beijing, China, from July 1 to July 15, 2020. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) was conducted to assess psychiatric disorders, and a series of scales were used to measure self-reported psychopathological symptoms and psychosomatic factors. Multivariate regression analysis was used to analyze the risk factors associated with psychopathological symptoms. Among 119 participants with infections, the prevalence of generalized anxiety symptoms (51.3%), depressive symptoms (41.2%), and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS)/posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (33.6%) was observed. Loneliness, hope, coping strategies, and history of mental disorders were the shared risk or protective factors across several psychopathological symptoms. The perceived impact of COVID-19 is the specific risk factor associated with state anxiety symptoms. The prevalence of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSS/PTSD is high among patients with infections during the second wave of the pandemic in Beijing. Clinical doctors must realize that these patients will probably experience depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, and PTSS/PTSD, as well as some neuropsychiatric syndromes. Specific mental health care is urgently required to help patients manage the virus during the second wave of the pandemic.","Zhang, Feng, Song, Yang, Duan","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-021-00694-4","20210409","COVID-19; Infected patients; Mental health; Psychopathological symptoms; Risk factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-10","",12805,""
"Pulmonary rehabilitation focusing on the regulation of respiratory movement can improve prognosis of severe patients with COVID-19","Since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China, it has become a global public health emergency. Besides conventional care, pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is an equally important treatment for patients with COVID-19 suffering from respiratory, physical and psychological disease. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of PR on the inpatients with severe COVID-19. This study was a self-pre- and post-control prospective clinical trial, which totally recruited 31 inpatients confirmed COVID-19 by RT-PCR. They were performed 3-weeks PR. The demographic data, medical records, symptoms, laboratory findings and chest computed tomographic (CT) scans of patients were collected at baseline. The effect of PR was assessed by questionnaires before PR as well as after 2- and 3-weeks PR. After 3-weeks PR and treatment, neutrophil percentage decreased, while lymphocyte percentage and lymphocyte count increased (before vs. 2 weeks after PR respectively: P=0.001; P=0.001; P&lt;0.0001). Besides, CRP and procalcitonin reduced significantly (before vs. after respectively: P&lt;0.0001; P=0.023). Patients' oxygen intake decreased and oxygen saturation increased significantly. Meanwhile, PR relieved the patients' symptoms of cough and dyspnea, improved the patients' self-care ability, physical fitness and mental state significantly. Activities of daily living (ADL) score increased and Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale (mMRC) decreased after PR. PR can relieve symptoms, enhance health-related quality of life, improve respiratory muscle function and alleviate disease-related anxiety and depression of severe patients with COVID-19. PR should be provided throughout the diseases management process, regardless of whether the patient is hospitalized or at home.","Sun, Liu, Li, Shang, Li, Ji, Wu, Han, Shi","https://doi.org/10.21037/apm-20-2014","20210409","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); activities of daily living (ADL); pulmonary rehabilitation; symptoms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-10","",12806,""
"Effect of smartphone app on post-traumatic stress disorder in COVID-19 convalescent patients: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis","The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) seriously affects humans' health worldwide physically and mentally. Studies revealed that the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) increased under this condition. PTSD can change the structure of patients' central nervous system, and increase the risk of anxiety or depression, thus greatly affecting the quality of patients' life and their families. PTSD is preventable, and the effects of early prevention are better. Non-drug intervention can prevent or reduce the psychological sequelae after hospitalization, help patients understand the experience during hospitalization, and be beneficial to their psychological rehabilitation. Whether smartphone app based intervention can be an alternative therapy for PTSD in terms of COVID-19 convalescent patients is still controversial. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis and systematic review to evaluate the effects of smartphone app based intervention on PTSD in COVID-19 convalescent patients, so as to provide some guidance for clinical application. The literatures that are related to the smartphone app based intervention and PTSD in COVID-19 convalescent patients from inception to February 2021 will be searched. The following databases are our focused areas: ClinicalTrials.gov, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials repositories, PubMed, EmBase, and Web of Science databases. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 2 investigators would independently screen the literature extract data and evaluate the risk of bias in the included studies. Meta-analysis was performed with RevMan5.3 software. The results of this meta-analysis will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication. The conclusion of our study could provide evidence for the judgment of whether smartphone app based intervention is an effective intervention on PTSD in COVID-19 convalescent patients.
