"Risk factors and prediction nomogram model for psychosocial and behavioural problems among children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic: A national multicentre study: Risk Factors of Childhood Psychosocial Problems","We aimed to explore the risk profiles attributable to psychosocial and behavioural problems during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. To this end, we created a risk-prediction nomogram model. A national multicentre study was conducted through an online questionnaire involving 12,186 children (6-11 years old) and adolescents (12-16 years old). Respondents' psychosocial and behavioural functioning were assessed using the Achenbach Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL). Data were analysed using STATA software and R-language. The positive detection rate of psychological problems within Wuhan was greater than that outside Wuhan for schizoid (PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.005), and depression (PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.030) in children, and for somatic complaints (PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.048), immaturity (PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.023), and delinquent behaviour (PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.046) in adolescents. After graded multivariable adjustment, seven factors associated with psychological problems in children and adolescents outside Wuhan were parent-child conflict (odds ratio (OR): 4.94, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 4.27-5.72), sleep problems (OR: 4.05, 95% CI: 3.77-4.36), online study time (OR: 0.41, 95% CI: 0.37-0.47), physical activity time (OR: 0.510, 95% CI: 0.44-0.59), number of close friends (OR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.44-0.6), time spent playing videogames (OR: 2.26, 95% CI: 1.90-2.69) and eating disorders (OR: 2.71, 95% CI: 2.35-3.11) (all P &lt; 0.001). Contrastingly, within Wuhan, only the first four factors, namely, parent-child conflict (5.95, 2.82-12.57), sleep problems (4.47, 3.06-6.54), online study time (0.37, 0.22-0.64), and physical activity time (0.42, 0.22-0.80) were identified (all P &lt; 0.01). Accordingly, nomogram models were created with significant attributes and had decent prediction performance with C-indexes over 80%. A cross-sectional study and self-reported measures. Besides the four significant risk factors within and outside Wuhan, the three additional factors outside Wuhan deserve special attention. The prediction nomogram models constructed in this study have important clinical and public health implications for psychosocial and behavioural assessment.","Wang, Chen, Jia, Shi, Zhang, Li, Hao, Hou, Deng, Zhang, Huang, Xie, Fang, Xu, Xu, Guan, Wang, Shen, Li, Qian, Wang, Shan, Tan, Wang, Yu, Wang, Zhang, Li, Ke, Li","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.06.077","20210720","Children and adolescents; Coronavirus disease 2019; Psychosocial and behavioural problems; Risk factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-22","",16087,""
"Changes in alcohol use during the COVID-19 pandemic among American veterans","The COVID-19 pandemic has had considerable behavioral health implications globally. One subgroup that may be of particular concern is U.S. veterans, who are susceptible to mental health and substance use concerns. The current study aimed to investigate changes in alcohol use and binge drinking before and during the first year of the pandemic among U.S. veterans, and how pre-pandemic mental health disorders, namely posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and COVID-19-related factors like loneliness, negative reactions to COVID-19, and economic hardship influenced alcohol use trends. 1230 veterans were recruited in February 2020 as part of a larger survey study on veteran health behaviors. Veterans were asked to complete follow-up assessments throughout the pandemic at 6, 9, and 12- months. Overall, veterans reported a significant decrease in alcohol use (IRRÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.98) and binge drinking (IRRÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.11) However, women, racial/ethnic minority veterans, and those with pre-existing PTSD exhibited smaller decreases in alcohol use and binge drinking and overall higher rates of use compared to men, White veterans, and those without PTSD. Both economic hardship and negative reactions to COVID-19 were associated with greater alcohol and binge drinking whereas loneliness showed a negative association with alcohol use and binge drinking. Veterans reported decreases in alcohol use and binge drinking throughout the pandemic, with heterogeneity in these outcomes noted for higher risk groups. Special research and clinical attention should be given to the behavioral health care needs of veterans in the post-pandemic period.","Davis, Prindle, Castro, Saba, Fitzke, Pedersen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addbeh.2021.107052","20210720","Active duty; COVID-19; Drug use; Longitudinal; Trauma; Veterans administration","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-22","",16088,""
"A National Pediatric Telepsychiatry Curriculum for Graduate Medical Education and Continuing Medical Education","<b><i>Objectives:</i></b> Our goal was to develop an open access nationally disseminated online curriculum for use in graduate and continuing medical education on the topic of pediatric telepsychiatry to enhance the uptake of telepsychiatry among child psychiatry training programs and improve access to mental health care for youth and families. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Following Kern's 6-stage model of curriculum development, we identified a core problem, conducted a needs assessment, developed broad goals and measurable objectives in a competency-based model, and developed educational content and methods. The curriculum was reviewed by experts and feedback incorporated. Given the urgent need for such a curriculum due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the curriculum was immediately posted on the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and American Association of Directors of Psychiatric Residency Training websites. Further evaluation will be conducted over the next year. <b><i>Results:</i></b> The curriculum covers the six areas of core competence adapted for pediatric telepsychiatry and includes teaching content and resources, evaluation tools, and information about other resources. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> This online curriculum is available online and provides an important resource and set of standards for pediatric telepsychiatry training.

"Be My Safe Haven: Parent-Child Relationships and Emotional Health During COVID-19","Since March 2020, millions of children have been confined to their homes and restricted from in-person activities, radically changing the dynamics of parent-child relationships. This study examines the association between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) impact and the mental health of parents and school-aged children; specifically, whether qualities of the parent-child relationship moderated the relationship between parents' emotional health (EH) and children's emotional and behavioral health (EBH). Data from this Internet-based study of a community sample were collected in March-May 2020. Parents (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°158, 92.4% White, 96.2% female) reported on COVID-19 impacts, their own EH, perceptions of their relationship with their eldest child between 6 and 12Ã¢â‚¬â€°years-old, and the EBH of that child. Responses to questions about COVID-19 impact were assigned weighted values and used to create a COVID-19 impact scale. Hierarchical linear regressions revealed that greater COVID-19 impact was associated with greater parents' EH issues only, and parents' EH was a significant positive predictor of children's EBH. Positive qualities and conflict in the parent-child relationship moderated the link between parents' and children's EH. At higher levels of relationship conflict and lower levels of positivity, there were stronger positive associations between parents' and children's EH. Parent-child relationship quality did not moderate the association between parents' EH and children's behavioral health (BH). These cross-sectional study results suggest that beyond focusing on symptom management, families may benefit from supports targeting the parent-child relationship. Insights and implications for practitioners are discussed.","Bate, Pham, Borelli","https://doi.org/10.1093/jpepsy/jsab046","20210720","attachment; pandemic; parentÃ¢â‚¬â€œchild relationships; social distancing; trauma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-22","",16090,""
"The impact of COVID-19 lockdown on gambling habit: A cross-sectional study from Italy","Few preliminary studies have shown an impact of COVID-19 confinement on gambling habits. We aim to evaluate short-term effects of lockdown restrictions on gambling behaviors in Italy. Within the project Lost in Italy, a web-based cross-sectional study was conducted on a representative sample of 6,003 Italians aged 18-74 years, enrolled during April 27-May 3 2020, and were asked to report gambling activity before the lockdown and at the time of interview. The prevalence of participants reporting any gambling decreased from 16.3% before lockdown to 9.7% during lockdown. Traditional gambling decreased from 9.9 to 2.4% and online gambling from 9.9 to 8.0%. Among gamblers, median time of gambling grew from 4.5 to 5.1 h/month. Among non-players before lockdown, 1.1% started playing. Among players before lockdown, 19.7% increased gambling activity. Multivariate analysis showed an increase in gambling activity in younger generations (p for trend = 0.001), current smokers (odds ratio, OR 1.48), users of electronic cigarettes (OR 1.63), heated tobacco products (OR 1.82), cannabis (OR 5.16), psychotropic drugs (OR 3.93), and subjects having hazardous alcohol drinking (OR 1.93). Self-reported low quality of life (OR 1.97), low sleep quantity (OR 2.00), depressive symptoms (OR 3.06) and anxiety symptoms (OR 2.93) were significantly related to an increase in total gambling activity during lockdown. Although gambling substantially decreased during lockdown, time spent in gambling slightly increased. The strong relationship found between compromised mental health and addictive behaviors calls for urgent policies to prevent vulnerable populations from increasing and developing severe gambling addiction.","Lugo, Stival, Paroni, Amerio, Carreras, Gorini, Mastrobattista, Minutillo, Mortali, Odone, Pacifici, Tinghino, Gallus","https://doi.org/10.1556/2006.2021.00033","20210720","COVID-19; Italy; gambling; lockdown; mental health; poly-addiction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-22","",16091,""
"Loneliness Among US Adults Aged Ã¢â€°Â¥55 Early in the COVID-19 Pandemic : Findings From the COVID-19 Coping Study","Loneliness is associated with increased risks of adverse health outcomes among middle-aged and older adults. We estimated the prevalence of loneliness and identified key sociodemographic, employment, living, and health-related risk factors for loneliness among adults aged Ã¢â€°Â¥55 during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, when much of the country was under shelter-in-place orders. We collected data from online questionnaires in the COVID-19 Coping Study, a national study of 6938 US adults aged Ã¢â€°Â¥55 from April 2 through May 31, 2020. We estimated the population-weighted prevalence of loneliness (scores Ã¢â€°Â¥6 of 9 on the 3-item UCLA Loneliness Scale), overall and by sociodemographic, employment, living, and health-related factors. We used population-weighted modified Poisson regression models to estimate prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% CIs for the associations between these factors and loneliness, adjusting for age, sex, race, ethnicity, and education level. Overall, we estimated that 29.5% (95% CI, 27.9%31.3%) of US adults aged Ã¢â€°Â¥55 were considered high in loneliness in April and May 2020. In population-weighted adjusted models, loneliness was the most prevalent among those who reported depression, who were not married or in a relationship, who lived alone, and who were unemployed at the onset of the pandemic. We identified subpopulations of middle-aged and older adults who were vulnerable to loneliness during a period when COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders were in place across most of the country. These insights may inform the allocation of resources to mitigate an unintended health consequence during times of restricted activity.","O'Shea, Finlay, Kler, Joseph, Kobayashi","https://doi.org/10.1177/00333549211029965","20210720","COVID-19; aging; isolation; loneliness; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-22","",16092,""
"An Assessment of Mental Health Outcomes During the COVID-19 Pandemic","In late 2019, the first case of COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan, China. Soon after, cases began to spread globally. This study aimed to examine the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the adult population in the United States. We conducted an exploratory cross-sectional study using an anonymous online survey methodology distributed to participants across 13 states. The data collected included demographical information and outcomes from validated mental health screeners (GAD-7, PHQ-9, and IES-R) to assess levels of anxiety, depression, and stress. A total of 1356 participants completed the survey. GAD-7, PHQ-9, and IES-R levels differed significantly (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05) according to age, gender, and educational level. There was also significant difference between GAD-7 level as well as IES-R level between healthcare and non-healthcare workers (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.02 and pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.028).

"The relationship between common mental disorders (CMDs), food insecurity and domestic violence in pregnant women during the COVID-19 lockdown in Cape Town, South Africa","We aimed to explore the relationship between common mental disorders (CMDs), food insecurity and experiences of domestic violence among pregnant women attending public sector midwife obstetric units and basic antenatal care clinics in Cape Town during the COVID-19 lockdown. Perinatal women, attending 14 healthcare facilities in Cape Town, were enrolled in the study during baseline data collection before the COVID-19 lockdown. During the lockdown period, fieldworkers telephonically contacted the perinatal women who were enrolled in the study and had provided contact details. The following data were collected from those who consented to the study: socio-demographic information, mental health assessment, food insecurity status and experiences of domestic violence. Poisson regression was used to model the associations of a number of risk factors with the occurrence of CMDs. Of the 2149 women enrolled in the ASSET study, 885 consented to telephonic interviews. We found that 12.5% of women had probable CMDs and 43% were severely food insecure. Psychological distress increased significantly during the lockdown period, compared to before the COVID-19 outbreak. Using multivariate Poisson regression modelling, we showed that the risk of CMDs was increased in women who were severely food insecure or who experienced psychological or sexual abuse. This study provides evidence of the effect of the COVID-19 lockdown on the mental health status of perinatal women living in low-resource settings in Cape Town and highlights how a crisis such as the COVID-19 lockdown amplifies the psycho-social risk factors associated with CMDs in perinatal women.","Abrahams, Boisits, Schneider, Prince, Lund","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00127-021-02140-7","20210720","COVID-19; Depression; Food insecurity; Maternal; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-22","",16094,""
"COVID-19 lockdown has altered the dynamics between affective symptoms and social isolation among older adults: results from a longitudinal network analysis","The COVID-19 lockdown has drastically limited social interactions and brought about a climate of fear and uncertainty. These circumstances not only increased affective symptoms and social isolation among community dwelling older adults but also alter the dynamics between them. Using network analyses, we study the changes in these dynamics before and during the lockdown. Community-dwelling older adults (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°419) completed questionnaires assessing depression, anxiety, and social isolation, before the COVID-19 pandemic, as part of a cohort study, and during the lockdown period. The total scores of these questionnaires were compared across time. For the network analyses, partial correlation networks were constructed using items in the questionnaires as nodes, separately at both timepoints. Changes in edges, as well as nodal and bridge centrality were examined across time. Depression and anxiety symptoms, and social isolation had significantly increased during the lockdown. Significant changes were observed across time on several edges. Greater connectivity between the affective and social isolation nodes at lockdown was observed. Depression symptoms have become more tightly coupled across individuals, and so were the anxiety symptoms. Depression symptoms have also become slightly decoupled from those of anxiety. These changing network dynamics reflect the greater influence of social isolation on affective symptoms across individuals and an increased vulnerability to affective disorders. These findings provide novel perspectives and translational implications on the changing mental health context amidst a COVID-19 pandemic situation.","Yu, Mahendran","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-94301-6","20210721","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-22","",16095,""
"Impact of COVID-19 lockdown on mental health in Germany: longitudinal observation of different mental health trajectories and protective factors","The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting measures can be regarded as a global stressor. Cross-sectional studies showed rather negative impacts on people's mental health, while longitudinal studies considering pre-lockdown data are still scarce. The present study investigated the impact of COVID-19 related lockdown measures in a longitudinal German sample, assessed since 2017. During lockdown, 523 participants completed additional weekly online questionnaires on e.g., mental health, COVID-19-related and general stressor exposure. Predictors for and distinct trajectories of mental health outcomes were determined, using multilevel models and latent growth mixture models, respectively. Positive pandemic appraisal, social support, and adaptive cognitive emotion regulation were positively, whereas perceived stress, daily hassles, and feeling lonely negatively related to mental health outcomes in the entire sample. Three subgroups (""recovered,"" 9.0%; ""resilient,"" 82.6%; ""delayed dysfunction,"" 8.4%) with different mental health responses to initial lockdown measures were identified. Subgroups differed in perceived stress and COVID-19-specific positive appraisal.

Participants' psychological state deteriorated over time in the delayed dysfunction group, putting them at risk for mental disorder development. Consequently, health services should especially identify and allocate resources to vulnerable individuals.","Ahrens, Neumann, Kollmann, Brokelmann, von Werthern, Malyshau, Weichert, Lutz, Fiebach, Wessa, Kalisch, Plichta, Lieb, TÃƒÂ¼scher, Reif","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-021-01508-2","20210720","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-22","",16096,""
"Challenges facing essential workers: a cross-sectional survey of the subjective mental health and well-being of New Zealand healthcare and 'other' essential workers during the COVID-19 lockdown","To compare psychological outcomes, experiences and sources of stress over the COVID-19 lockdown in New Zealand in essential workers (healthcare and 'other' essential workers) with that of workers in nonessential work roles. Online cross-sectional survey. Conducted in New Zealand over level 4 lockdown in April/May 2020. Findings from employed participants (2495) are included in this report; 381 healthcare workers, 649 'other' essential workers and 1465 nonessential workers. Measures included psychological distress (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10)), anxiety (Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7)), well-being (WHO-5), alcohol use, subjective experiences and sources of stress. Differences between work categories were quantified as risk ratios or Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> tests. After controlling for confounders that differed between groups of essential and nonessential workers, those in healthcare and those in 'other' essential work were at 71% (95% CI 1.29 to 2.27) and 59% (95% CI 1.25 to 2.02) greater risk respectively, of moderate levels of anxiety (GAD-7 Ã¢â€°Â¥10), than those in nonessential work. Those in healthcare were at 19% (95% CI 1.02 to 1.39) greater risk of poor well-being (WHO-5 &lt;13). There was no evidence of differences across work roles in risk for psychological distress (K10 Ã¢â€°Â¥12) or increased alcohol use. Healthcare and 'other' essential workers reported increased workload (p&lt;0.001) and less uncertainty about finances and employment than those in nonessential work (p&lt;0.001). Healthcare and nonessential workers reported decreased social contact. No difference by work category in health concerns was reported; 15% had concerns about participants' own health and 33% about other people's health. During the pandemic lockdown, essential workers (those in healthcare and those providing 'other' essential work) were at increased risk of anxiety compared with those in nonessential work, with those in healthcare also being at increased risk of poor well-being. This highlights the need to recognise the challenges this vital workforce face in pandemics.","Bell, Williman, Beaglehole, Stanley, Jenkins, Gendall, Rapsey, Every-Palmer","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-048107","20210721","COVID-19; epidemiology; mental health; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-22","",16097,""

"Fear of COVID-19 and COVID-19 Stress and Association with Sociodemographic and Psychological Process Factors in Cases under Surveillance in a Frontline Worker Population in Borneo","COVID-19 stress and fear of COVID-19 is an increasingly researched construct in the general population. However, its prevalence and association with sociodemographic factors and psychological process variables has not been explored in frontline workers under surveillance in a Bornean population. This study was a cross-sectional study using a sociodemographic questionnaire incorporating two specific epidemiological risk variables, namely specific questions about COVID-19 surveillance status (persons under investigation (PUI), persons under surveillance (PUS), and positive cases) and the nature of frontline worker status. Furthermore, five other instruments were used, with three measuring psychopathology (namely depression, anxiety and stress, fear of COVID-19, and stress due to COVID-19) and two psychological process variables (namely psychological flexibility and mindfulness). Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests were performed to assess if there were significant differences in psychopathology and psychological process variables between sociodemographic and epidemiological risk variables. Hierarchical multiple regression was further performed, with depression, anxiety, and stress as dependent variables. There were significant differences in the fear of COVID-19 between positive cases, PUI, and PUS. The fear of COVID-19 scores were higher in positive cases compared to in PUS and PUI groups. Upon hierarchical multiple regression, mindfulness and psychological flexibility were significant predictors of depression, anxiety, and stress after controlling for sociodemographic and epidemiological risk factors. This study demonstrates that exposure to COVID-19 as persons under investigation or surveillance significantly increases the fear of COVID-19, and brief psychological interventions that can positively influence mindfulness and psychological flexibility should be prioritized for these at-risk groups to prevent undue psychological morbidity in the long run.","Pang, Nold Imon, Johoniki, Mohd Kassim, Omar, Syed Abdul Rahim, Hayati, Jeffree, Ng","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18137210","20210721","COVID-19 stress; fear of COVID-19; mindfulness; persons under investigation; psychological flexibility","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-22","",16099,""

Internet was the main source of information on the coronavirus. Although 74.6% of the total number of patients did not give up hospital therapies, 34.8% complained about variations in the continuity of treatment, with different percentages in the three samples. The majority of the sample (73.8%) was worried of being infected, but 21.9% did not share their anxieties and worries with others. The multivariate regression analysis showed that a pessimistic perception of quality of life was influenced by living in extra-urban areas and alone (OR = 1.4; OR = 2.1); while a perception of a reduced physical function result affected by the state of anxiety and stress (OR = 1.9) and the difficulties in continuity of medical assistance (OR = 2.2). The scoring of the SF-12 in the Physical Component Summary and Mental Component Summary scores showed a fluctuating trend throughout the three periods investigated. It is important for health professionals, caregivers and social workers to identify the new needs in order to enhance home care interventions, personalize and optimize care, ensure continuity of care and guarantee a high quality of life even in a health emergency situation.","Ferrara, Langiano, Falese, De Marco, De Vito","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18137161","20210721","COVID-19; cancer; containment; coronavirus; lockdown; mental health; pandemic; quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-22","",16100,""
"Direct and Stress-Buffering Effects of COVID-19-Related Changes in Exercise Activity on the Well-Being of German Sport Students","Maintaining or initiating exercise activity in the COVID-19 pandemic may act as a buffer against the observed stress-related deterioration in well-being, with emotion regulation (ER) discussed as a possible moderator. Therefore, the present study investigated the interaction between stress, exercise activity (EA), and ER on mood. In an online survey, 366 German sports science students (56% women, <i>M</i><sub>age</sub> = 23.04, <i>SD</i> = 2.87) reported their stress levels (general and COVID-19-specific), mood (energy, valence, calmness), EA before and during the pandemic, and use of ER strategies in spring 2020. Pandemic-related change in EA was calculated as residual change. Due to gender differences in mental health and EA, the main and interaction effects were tested in twelve hierarchical regression analyses, separately for men and women. Overall, EA significantly decreased during the pandemic and was positively associated with energy in both men and women. ER was positively associated with women's energy, but negatively with all three mood dimensions in men. Only one three-way interaction appeared significant: in the case of high stress, low levels of EA and high use of ER were associated with the greatest deteriorations in energy in men. Our findings suggest that EA may buffer deteriorations in energy in men with high stress and difficulties in ER.","Giessing, Kannen, Strahler, Frenkel","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18137117","20210721","coping; emotion regulation; mental health; mood; pandemic; physical activity; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-22","",16101,""
"Changes in Health Behaviors, Mental and Physical Health among Older Adults under Severe Lockdown Restrictions during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Spain","We used data from 3041 participants in four cohorts of community-dwelling individuals aged Ã¢â€°Â¥65 years in Spain collected through a pre-pandemic face-to-face interview and a telephone interview conducted between weeks 7 to 15 after the beginning of the COVID-19 lockdown. On average, the confinement was not associated with a deterioration in lifestyle risk factors (smoking, alcohol intake, diet, or weight), except for a decreased physical activity and increased sedentary time, which reversed with the end of confinement. However, chronic pain worsened, and moderate declines in mental health, that did not seem to reverse after restrictions were lifted, were observed. Males, older adults with greater social isolation or greater feelings of loneliness, those with poorer housing conditions, as well as those with a higher prevalence of chronic morbidities were at increased risk of developing unhealthier lifestyles or mental health declines with confinement. On the other hand, previously having a greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet and doing more physical activity protected older adults from developing unhealthier lifestyles with confinement. If another lockdown were imposed during this or future pandemics, public health programs should specially address the needs of older individuals with male sex, greater social isolation, sub-optimal housing conditions, and chronic morbidities because of their greater vulnerability to the enacted movement restrictions.","GarcÃƒÂ­a-Esquinas, OrtolÃƒÂ¡, Gine-VÃƒÂ¡zquez, Carnicero, MaÃƒÂ±as, Lara, Alvarez-Bustos, Vicente-Rodriguez, Sotos-Prieto, Olaya, Garcia-Garcia, Gusi, Banegas, RodrÃƒÂ­guez-GÃƒÂ³mez, Struijk, MartÃƒÂ­nez-GÃƒÂ³mez, Lana, Haro, Ayuso-Mateos, RodrÃƒÂ­guez-MaÃƒÂ±as, Ara, Miret, RodrÃƒÂ­guez-Artalejo","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18137067","20210721","COVID-19; chronic pain; confinement; elderly; lifestyle behaviors; lockdown; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-22","",16102,""
"Physical Activity among Adults Residing in 11 Countries during the COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown","During the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, physical activity (PA) behaviors were altered worldwide due to public health measures such as ""lockdown."" This study described PA among adults residing in 11 countries during COVID-19 lockdown and examined factors associated with PA engagement. We conducted a cross-sectional anonymous survey among adults (Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years old) in 11 countries (Brazil, Bulgaria, China, India, Ireland, Malaysia, North Macedonia, Singapore, Spain, Turkey, United States). Of 11,775 participants, 63.7% were female and 52.8% were 18-34 years old. More than 40% of participants were insufficiently active (43.9%) and reported a decrease in their PA during lockdown (44.8%). Statistically significant differences were observed in (1) proportions of participants being insufficiently active, (2) level of PA, and (3) decrease in PA across the 11 countries. More stringent governmental policy responses were associated with greater likelihood of being insufficiently active during lockdown (adjusted odds ratio = 1.22, 95% confidence interval = 1.03, 1.45). Higher depression or anxiety scores were associated with greater likelihood of decreased level of PA during lockdown.We found substantial reductions in PA levels during COVID-19 lockdown across countries. Country-specific PA promotion interventions are needed during this and similar global emergencies.","Ding, Yang, Chin, Sullivan, Durstine, Violant-Holz, Demirhan, Oliveira, Popeska, Kuan, Khan, Dai, Xu, Mladenova, Balasekaran, Smith, On Behalf Of Global Community Health-Covid-Collaborative Research Team","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18137056","20210721","changes in physical activity; governmental policy responses; insufficiently active","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-22","",16103,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on self-harm and suicidal behaviour: update of living systematic review","<b>Background:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic has caused considerable morbidity, mortality and disruption to people's lives around the world. There are concerns that rates of suicide and suicidal behaviour may rise during and in its aftermath. Our living systematic review synthesises findings from emerging literature on incidence and prevalence of suicidal behaviour as well as suicide prevention efforts in relation to COVID-19, with this iteration synthesising relevant evidence up to 19 <sup>th</sup> October 2020. <b>Method:</b> Ã‚Â Automated daily searches feed into a web-based database with screening and data extraction functionalities. Eligibility criteria include incidence/prevalence of suicidal behaviour, exposure-outcome relationships and effects of interventions in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Outcomes of interest are suicide, self-harm or attempted suicide and suicidal thoughts. No restrictions are placed on language or study type, except for single-person case reports. We exclude one-off cross-sectional studies without either pre-pandemic measures or comparisons of COVID-19 positive vs. unaffected individuals. <b>Results:</b> Searches identified 6,226 articles. Seventy-eight articles met our inclusion criteria. We identified a further 64 relevant cross-sectional studies that did not meet our revised inclusion criteria. Thirty-four articles were not peer-reviewed (e.g. research letters, pre-prints). All articles were based on observational studies. There was no consistent evidence of a rise in suicide but many studies noted adverse economic effects were evolving. There was evidence of a rise in community distress, fall in hospital presentation for suicidal behaviour and early evidence of an increased frequency of suicidal thoughts in those who had become infected with COVID-19. <b>Conclusions: Ã‚Â </b>Research evidence of the impact of COVID-19 on suicidal behaviour is accumulating rapidly. This living review provides a regular synthesis of the most up-to-date research evidence to guide public health and clinical policy to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on suicide risk as the longer term impacts of the pandemic on suicide risk are researched.","John, Eyles, Webb, Okolie, Schmidt, Arensman, Hawton, O'Connor, Kapur, Moran, O'Neill, McGuiness, Olorisade, Dekel, Macleod-Hall, Cheng, Higgins, Gunnell","https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.25522.2","20210721","COVID-19; Living systematic review; Self-harm; Suicidal thoughts; Suicide; Attempted suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-22","",16104,""
