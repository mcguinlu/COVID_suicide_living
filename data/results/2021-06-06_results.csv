"Suicide rates during social crises: Changes in the suicide rate in Japan after the Great East Japan earthquake and during the COVID-19 pandemic","We aimed to observe the changes in suicide rates after the Great East Japan Earthquake and during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, as typical cases of social crises, in Japan. A descriptive epidemiological study was conducted using data on the number of deaths by suicide published by the National Police Agency. The suicide rate ratio during the crisis-the monthly suicide mortality rate in the year of the crisis divided by the average suicide mortality rate in the three years before the crisis-was used as the indicator. After the earthquake, in March 2011 the suicide rate was 18% lower than the average mortality rate for the previous three years. However, it increased by 18% in May and 8% in June; increased mortality was observed among women. The suicide rate began to decline after October 2011. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the suicide rate decreased from February to June 2020. The declines in April and May were significant at 20% and 18%, respectively. From July onwards, the suicide rate of women began to rise, and from October, the overall suicide also began to increase. The rise in female suicide rates was significant, especially in October, with an increase of 70%. Thus, during these crises, suicide rates fell temporarily but then rose, especially among women. The period of increase in suicide rates was longer during the COVID-19 pandemic than after the earthquake. Therefore, there is an urgent need to promote measures for suicide prevention currently, and during a future crisis.","Osaki, Otsuki, Imamoto, Kinjo, Fujii, Kuwabara, Kondo, Suyama","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.05.035","20210605","COVID-19 pandemic; Earthquake; Mortality; Social crisis; Suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-06","",14367,""
"Social media use in China before and during COVID-19: Preliminary results from an online retrospective survey","More people reported symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression during the outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19). They might have increased their social media use during the outbreak of COVID-19 compared to before COVID-19. An online retrospective survey was conducted on a total sample of 10,963 participants. Social media use patterns before and during COVID-19, Social media addiction (SMA), and mental health problems (stress, anxiety, and depression) were assessed. This study found that, compared with before COVID-19, weekly social media use was significantly increased during COVID-19 (from 17.2 to 21.4Ã‚Â h). Nearly 40% of SMA respondents increased their weekly social media use Ã¢â€°Â¥3.5Ã‚Â h. The prevalence rate of was 6.8%, and the prevalence rates of moderate or severe stress, anxiety, and depression were 10.8%, 26.4%, and 18.2%, respectively, during COVID-19. Female gender, experiencing moderate or severe stress, and SMA were associated with increased weekly social media use Ã¢â€°Â¥3.5Ã‚Â h. Male gender, experiencing moderate or severe stress, anxiety, depression, and increased weekly social media use Ã¢â€°Â¥3.5Ã‚Â h were associated with SMA. This study suggests a significant increase in social media use and a relatively high prevalence rate of SMA in China during COVID-19. Our findings identify factors associated with increased social media use and SMA that could be used to develop psychological interventions to prevent SMA during the COVID-19 epidemic.","Luo, Chen, Liao","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.05.057","20210605","Before and during COVID-19; Prevalence rate; Retrospective survey; Social media addiction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-06","",14368,""
"[Covid-19 and front-line nurses' mental health: a literature review]","The Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic caused a severe health crisis that has affected millions of people and quarantined half of the world's population. The health emergency from Covid-19 has seen health workers on the front line face all the difficulties related to the burden of care and the reorganization of procedures, roles, and tools at the hospital level. One of the most significant and probably underestimated aspects is the psychological stress of frontline nurses. The article aims to analyze the literature relating to the impact on the mental health of nurses engaged in the management and care of Covid-19 patients. A systematic review of the published articles on the subject was conducted from January 2020 to November 2020. The search for papers was conducted on scientific databases like PubMed, Scopus and Embase. The results show the onset of anxiety, depression and stress and insomnia in healthcare workers. These aspects are closely related to numerous factors, including the fear of contracting the disease and infecting family members, stressful shifts and little rest, leading to a state of psychological and physical tension capable of activating pathological behaviours. The literature highlights the importance of support interventions for frontline personnel to avoid the onset of psycho-pathophysical severe problems. The review suggests that frontline nurses during the emergency phase of Covid- 19 may be prone to psychological disorders that can compromise mental health. Therefore, the surveillance and monitoring of symptoms, together with targeted support interventions, should be guaranteed daily to all professionals involved to prevent the onset of psychological disorders. La pandemia da Coronavirus (Covid-19) ha causato una grave crisi sanitaria che ha coinvolto milioni di persone e messo in quarantena metÃƒ della popolazione mondiale. L'emergenza sanitaria da Covid-19 ha visto gli operatori sanitari in prima linea affrontare tutte le difficoltÃƒ legate all'onere della cura e alla riorganizzazione delle procedure, ruoli, e strumenti a livello ospedaliero. Uno degli aspetti piÃƒÂ¹ significativi e probabilmente sottovalutati ÃƒÂ¨ lo stress psicologico del personale infermieristico in prima linea. L'obiettivo dellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢articolo ÃƒÂ¨ quello di analizzare la letteratura relativa allÃ¢â‚¬â„¢impatto sulla salute mentale del personale infermieristico impegnato nella gestione e cura di pazienti affetti da Covid-19. ÃƒË† stata condotta una revisione sistematica degli articoli pubblicati sull'argomento da gennaio 2020 a novembre 2020. La ricerca degli articoli ÃƒÂ¨ stata condotta sui database scientifici Pub Med, Scopus e Embase. I risultati mostrano lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢insorgenza nel personale sanitario di ansia, depressione e stress e insonnia. Tali aspetti risultano strettamente correlati a numerosi fattori, tra cui la paura di contrarre la malattia e di trasmetterla alle famiglie, turni stressanti e poco riposo, portando ad uno stato di tensione psicologica e fisica in grado di attivare comportamenti patologici. La letteratura evidenzia lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢importanza di interventi di sostegno al personale in prima linea al fine di evitare l'insorgere di gravi problemi di natura psico-patofisica. La revisione condotta suggerisce come gli infermieri in prima linea durante la fase di emergenza di Covid-19 possano essere soggetti a disturbi psicologici in grado di compromettere la salute mentale. Pertanto, la sorveglianza e il monitoraggio dei sintomi, congiuntamente a mirati interventi di sostegno, dovrebbero essere garantiti quotidianamente a tutti i professionisti coinvolti ai fine di prevenire l'insorgenza di disturbi psicologici.","Ruta, Dal Mas, Biancuzzi, Ferrara, Della Monica","https://doi.org/10.7429/pi.2021.741041","20210605","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-06","",14369,""
"Mental health and stress among ICU healthcare professionals in France according to intensity of the COVID-19 epidemic","We investigated the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on mental health of professionals working in the intensive care unit (ICU) according to the intensity of the epidemic in France. This cross-sectional survey was conducted in 77 French hospitals from April 22 to May 13 2020. All ICU frontline healthcare workers were eligible. The primary endpoint was the mental health, assessed using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire. Sources of stress during the crisis were assessed using the Perceived Stressors in Intensive Care Units (PS-ICU) scale. Epidemic intensity was defined as high or low for each region based on publicly available data from SantÃƒÂ© Publique France. Effects were assessed using linear mixed models, moderation and mediation analyses. In total, 2643 health professionals participated; 64.36% in high-intensity zones. Professionals in areas with greater epidemic intensity were at higher risk of mental health issues (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), and higher levels of overall perceived stress (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), compared to low-intensity zones. Factors associated with higher overall perceived stress were female sex (BÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.13; 95% confidence interval [CI]Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.08-0.17), having a relative at risk of COVID-19 (BÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.14; 95%-CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.09-0.18) and working in high-intensity zones (BÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.11; 95%-CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.02-0.20). Perceived stress mediated the impact of the crisis context on mental health (BÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.23, 95%-CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05, 0.41) and the impact of stress on mental health was moderated by positive thinking, bÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.32, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.54, -Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.11. COVID-19 negatively impacted the mental health of ICU professionals. Professionals working in zones where the epidemic was of high intensity were significantly more affected, with higher levels of perceived stress.

"Short-term health-related quality of life, physical function and psychological consequences of severe COVID-19","Survivors of severe COVID-19 are at risk of impaired health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and persistent physical and psychological disability after ICU and hospital discharge. The subsequent social burden is a major concern. We aimed to assess the short-term HRQoL, physical function and prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms of invasively mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients treated in our ICU. Prospective, observational cohort study in a follow-up clinic. Patients completed a 6-min walking test (6MWT) to assess their cardio-pulmonary function around 2 months (early follow-up) from hospital discharge, the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire for quality of life assessment around 2 months and at 6 months from hospital discharge and an anonymous web-based Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) questionnaire for Post-Traumatic Stress symptoms at 2 months. 47 patients attended our follow-up program, mean age 59Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°10Ã‚Â years, median pre-morbid Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) 2 [2-3]. The median distance walked in 6Ã‚Â min was 470 [406-516] m, 83 [67-99]% of the predicted value. Overall 1 out 3 patients and 4/18 (22%) among those with a good functional baseline prior to COVID-19 (CFS of 1 or 2) had lower (84%) than predicted 6MWT. EQ-5D-5L quality of life VAS was 80 [70-90] out of 100 at early follow-up with a slight improvement to 85 [77.5-90] at 6 months. Mobility, self-care and usual activities improved between the two timepoints, while pain/discomfort and depression/anxiety did not improve or got worse. The IES-R total score was greater than the threshold for concern of 1.6 in 27/41(66%) respondents. Patients recovering from severe COVID-19 requiring invasive mechanical ventilation surviving hospital discharge present with early mild to moderate functional impairment, mildly reduced quality of life from hospital discharge with an overall improvement of mobility, self-care and the ability of performing usual activities, while a worsening of pain and depression/anxiety symptoms at 6 months and a large proportion of symptoms of post-traumatic distress soon after hospital discharge.","Carenzo, Protti, Dalla Corte, Aceto, Iapichino, Milani, Santini, Chiurazzi, Ferrari, Heffler, Angelini, Aghemo, Ciccarelli, Chiti, Iwashyna, Herridge, Cecconi","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13613-021-00881-x","20210605","6-min walking test; COVID-19; Follow-up; Health Related Quality of Life; Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-06","",14371,""
"Burnout, Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Among Family Physicians in Kansas Responding to the COVID-19 Pandemic","COVID-19 has spread rapidly, with vast global implications. This study assessed how family physicians in Kansas were responding to COVID-19 and the effects of the pandemic on their well-being. The authors conducted a cross-sectional survey of 113 family physicians in Kansas between May 22, 2020 and June 25, 2020. The study participants completed an anonymous, 36-item survey assessing their concerns about being exposed to COVID-19 and levels of personal depression, anxiety, stress, and burnout in addition to demographic information. There was a 45.6% response rate, with 50.4% (n = 57) of the respondents reporting manifestations of burnout. The physicians who personally treated any presumptive or confirmed COVID-19 patient, compared with those who did not, were more likely to report at least 1 manifestation of burnout, experience emotional exhaustion, and feel a higher level of personal stress. Our findings demonstrate that the COVID-19 pandemic may be taking an emotional toll on family physicians in Kansas. This study provides a baseline from which to continue further monitoring of outcomes. Data can help drive initiatives at local, state, and national levels to help diminish the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on physicians.","Ofei-Dodoo, Loo-Gross, Kellerman","https://doi.org/10.3122/jabfm.2021.03.200523","20210605","COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Family Medicine; Family Physicians; Kansas; Mental Health; Occupational Burnout; Pandemics; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-06","",14372,""
"Health-Related Quality of Life for People With Acute and Chronic Illnesses During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) for adults with chronic and acute illnesses informs health and economic policy for pandemic recovery. Our primary aim was to compare HRQoL of 3 illness groups of outpatient adults: those with diabetes, those who survived a hospitalization for COVID-19, and those who had a respiratory virus not COVID-19. The secondary aim was to compare the group domain summary scores to the referent general population. We identified the 3 groups from the electronic medical record and invited them to complete the SF-36 survey. Analysis of variance and post hoc testing was used for univariate analyses followed by linear regression. One hundred thirty-two adults completed the survey. The groups differed least for physical functioning and most for emotional/mental health. The hospitalized group had the greatest limitation in role due to emotional issues. All groups had significantly lower social functioning scores than the general population. Linear regression showed lower HRQoL domain score in role limitations due to emotional issues adjusted for age, race, and gender for the hospitalized group. SF-36 scores show the decrease in HRQoL that outpatient adults have suffered, mostly in the emotional domain, regardless of illness group during the COVID-19 pandemic.","O'Dwyer, Meixner, Albiac, El Khoury, Capizzano, Ramakrishnan, Salada, Furst, Haro, Alves, Sen, Harper","https://doi.org/10.3122/jabfm.2021.03.200593","20210605","Acute Disease; COVID-19; Chronic Disease; Linear Models; Outpatients; Pandemics; Primary Health Care; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-06","",14373,""
"Clinical Redeployment of an Academic Family Medicine Department in an Early, Severe COVID-19 Pandemic in the Bronx, NY","A severe surge of the COVID-19 pandemic in spring 2020 infected 33% of the population and caused more than 7000 deaths in the Bronx, NY. The Department of Family and Social Medicine at Montefiore Medical Center rapidly and strategically reconfigured clinical services to meet the needs of patients, communities, and the health system. Family medicine hospitalist services tripled in size within 2 weeks to cover 71 beds and cared for 447 patients between March 24 and June 10, 2020, of whom 279 (62.4%) had COVID-19. Community health centers reorganized to maintain primary care services, shifting abruptly to telemedicine while maintaining 95% of the previous year's visit volume, and address intensified patient needs related to viral infection and mental health impacts. Core principles for redeployment included role flexibility, communication, responsiveness, and safety and wellness. During a pandemic surge, academic family medicine departments have an important role in expanding hospitalist services and redesigning primary care services. The ability to reconfigure work to meet unprecedented demands on health care was facilitated by family medicine's broad scope of practice including training in hospital medicine, interpersonal communication, behavioral health, care across settings, collaborative partnerships with specialists, and adaptability to communities' needs.","Flattau, Cristallo, Duggan, Gbur, Fabienne Daguilh, Selwyn","https://doi.org/10.3122/jabfm.2021.03.200562","20210605","COVID-19; Community Health Centers; Emergency Preparedness; Family Medicine; Hospital Medicine; Hospitalists; New York; Pandemics; Primary Health Care; Telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-06","",14374,""
"Relationship between wealth and emotional well-being before, during, versus after a nationwide disease outbreak: a large-scale investigation of disparities in psychological vulnerability across COVID-19 pandemic phases in China","This research investigated whether certain population segments might be more psychologically vulnerable in different phases of a pandemic. Specifically, the research examined how disparities in wealth might be associated with differences in emotional well-being before, during, versus after the nationwide COVID-19 outbreak in China. In this large-scale cross-sectional study, three rounds of nationally representative data collection (N=27Ã¢â‚¬â€°760) were conducted immediately before (December 2019), in the midst of (February 2020), versus immediately after (April 2020) the countrywide COVID-19 outbreak in China. Participants' emotional well-being, wealth (income, property ownership) and demographic information were measured using established instruments. Statistical analyses examined relationships between disparities in different types of wealth and emotional well-being across the pandemic phases. Although the onset of the coronavirus outbreak substantially degraded emotional well-being, having a higher income was associated with better emotional well-being during the outbreak. Property owners experienced a larger drop in emotional well-being during the outbreak than non-owners; however, the former was not emotionally worse off than the latter during the outbreak. After the nationwide COVID-19 outbreak had been contained and the economy reopened, those with more wealth of either type again became better off in emotional well-being than those with less. The highest income segment even experienced better emotional well-being after the end of the nationwide outbreak than prior to the outbreak. In contrast, the lowest income segment became worse off in emotional well-being after the nationwide outbreak ended than before the outbreak began. People with less wealth tend to be emotionally worse off throughout the different phases of a disease outbreak. In particular, even after an outbreak has been contained, the poor are less able to restore their psychological well-being. Policies and interventions are needed to address disparities in mental health in the age of pandemics.","Yang, Ma","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-044262","20210605","COVID-19; health economics; mental health; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-06","",14375,""
"Chronic use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors in hypertensive COVID-19 patients: Results from a Spanish registry and meta-analysis","Hypertension is a prevalent condition among SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Whether renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors are beneficial or harmful is controversial. We have performed a national retrospective, nonexperimental comparative study from two tertiary hospitals to evaluate the impact of chronic use of RAAS inhibitors in hypertensive COVID-19 patients. A meta-analysis was performed to strengthen our findings. Of 849 patients, 422 (49.7%) patients were hypertensive and 310 (73.5%) were taking RAAS inhibitors at baseline. Hypertensive patients were older, had more comorbidities, and a greater incidence of respiratory failure (-0.151 [95% CI -0.218, -0.084]). Overall mortality in hypertensive patients was 28.4%, but smaller among those with prescribed RAAS inhibitors before (-0.167 [95% CI -0.220, -0.114]) and during hospitalization (0.090 [-0.008,0.188]). Similar findings were observed after two propensity score matches that evaluated the benefit of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers among hypertensive patients. Multivariate logistic regression analysis of hypertensive patients found that age, diabetes mellitus, C-reactive protein, and renal failure were independently associated with all-cause mortality. On the contrary, ACEIs decreased the risk of death (OR 0.444 [95% CI 0.224-0.881]). Meta-analysis suggested a protective benefit of RAAS inhibitors (OR 0.6 [95% CI 0.42-0.8]) among hypertensive COVID-19. Our data suggest that RAAS inhibitors may play a protective role in hypertensive COVID-19 patients. This finding was supported by a meta-analysis of the current evidence.

"Sleep disorders reveal distress among children and adolescents during the Covid-19 first wave: results of a large web-based Italian survey","Measures to contain the Covid-19 pandemic led to significant lifestyle changes for children and adolescents mainly related to the closure of schools and recreational activities, reduced social interaction, and increased family concerns. A cross-sectional online survey of 78 questions investigating social determinants of health, mood changes, symptoms of anxiety, increase in sleep disorders and unusual repetitive movements was offered to parents living in Italy with children Ã¢â€°Â¤18Ã¢â‚¬â€°years; including families of children with disabilities, autism spectrum disorders, chronic diseases, and specific learning disabilities. The survey was conducted on the Qualtrics platform 6 months after the beginning of the pandemic and distributed in hospitals and paediatricians' waiting rooms as well as through social networks. The primary outcomes were the increase in sleep disorders among children and adolescents. Possible risk factors were investigated through multivariable regression. Six thousand two hundred ten volunteer parents responded to the questions concerning mood changes, sleep disorders and unusual repetitive movements, and were included in the present study. The majority were female (91.8%) and Italian (97.0%). 72.7% answered that their children had become more nervous, worried, or sad (80.2% in children with learning disabilities); 77.6% reported feelings of loneliness and 69.3% more difficulties in children falling asleep, 30.2% in staying asleep, and 18.7% an increase in nightmares and/or sleep terrors. Statistical analysis identified socioeconomic status, parent's job loss, food insecurity, family attitude toward the pandemic, and children's mood swing, feelings of loneliness, or missing outdoor activities, as major risk factors for sleep disorders. The first Covid-19 lockdown impacted children's and adolescents' health through an increase in sleep disorders. In the following phases of the pandemic, this evidence may be useful to investigate and treat these disorders as well as make decisions about containment health policies concerning this age group.","Dondi, Fetta, Lenzi, Morigi, Candela, Rocca, Cordelli, Lanari","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13052-021-01083-8","20210605","Child mental health; Coronavirus; Distance learning; Lockdown; Mood changes; SDSC; Sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-06","",14377,""
"Depression and anxiety among pregnant mothers in the initial stage of the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic in the southwest of Iran","Ã¢â‚¬Å’BACKGROUND: Women are at a higher risk for depression progression, especially during pregnancy. The current study purposed to investigate depression, anxiety, and stress levels of pregnant mothers in the initial stage of the COVID-19 infection in the southwest of Iran. This cross-sectional study was conducted during March and April, 2020, in Shiraz, Iran. Pregnant mothers registered in maternity clinics affiliated with Shiraz University of Medical Sciences were included. An online self-administered checklist was used. It included socio-demographic, obstetric and medical histories, and the short form of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) to evaluate depression, anxiety, and stress. A p-valueÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05 was considered significant. In total, 540 pregnant mothers answered the questionnaire. 83.5% had no comorbidity. Abnormal depression scores were significantly higher in those who had no insurance (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.5) and in those with poor self-rated health (SRH) (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°27.8). Pregnant mothers with lower SRH and two or more comorbidities had a higher chance of having an abnormal level of anxiety subscale (6.9, 3.7 times, retrospectively). The results revealed that an abnormal level of depression was associated with SRH and medical insurance status. Moreover, the number of comorbidities and poor SRH significantly increased the chance of achieving abnormal anxiety levels in pregnant mothers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Children of mothers who experience high psychological distress during pregnancy are more susceptible to cognitive and behavioral problems. Few studies have reported the psychological distress of pregnant mothers during the COVID-19 pandemic, and it may be considered as a risk factor for child developmental disorders.In total, 540 out of 920 registered pregnant mothers in maternity clinics affiliated with Shiraz University of Medical Sciences answered the online questionnaire and were included in this study. An online self-administered data gathering tool was used so that the respondents felt more secure. The data gathering tool had three main parts: socio-demographic, obstetric and medical histories, and the short form of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) which consisting of 21 questions, 7 in each subscale; depression (DASS-D), anxiety (DASS-A) and stress (DASS-S).Pregnant mothers who had two or more comorbidities or those with lower self-rated health (SRH) had a higher chance of having an abnormal anxiety level. Depression levels were higher in pregnant mothers who had no insurance. Additionally, depression symptoms were more prevalent in pregnant mothers who had low health status than in those with good or intermediated SRH.In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic contributes to a significant increase in depression and anxiety symptoms among pregnant mothers. Moreover, lack of insurance, poor SRH, and having comorbidities are significantly associated with increasing depressive and anxiety scores.","Maharlouei, Keshavarz, Salemi, Lankarani","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12978-021-01167-y","20210605","Anxiety; COVID-19; DASS-21; Depression; Mental disorders; Pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-06","",14378,""

"Positive and Negative Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Relationship Satisfaction in Male Couples","Little is known about the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and control measures on gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) couples. The goal of this study was to investigate individual-level relationship satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic in a sample of 209 coupled GBMSM in the United States. We analyzed reported happiness and feelings about a relationship's future and assessed the odds of changing relationship happiness and investment associated with pandemic-related life changes (pandemic-related employment change; COVID-19 illness; high-risk of severe illness), using logistic and multinomial logit models. Fifty-five percent of participants (<i>N</i> = 114) reported that their relationship happiness had not changed during the pandemic, but 30% (<i>N</i> = 62) reported increased relationship happiness. 25% (<i>N</i> = 53) reported they had become more invested in their relationship's future during the pandemic, and only one participant reported decreased investment. The odds of increased relationship investment was significantly associated with pandemic-related employment change (adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.19 [1.04, 4.61]) and increased sex during the pandemic (aOR: 4.38 [1.55, 12.41]). Those with a pandemic-related employment change also had significantly higher odds of increased relationship happiness than those without a change (aOR: 2.10 [1.01, 4.35]). COVID-19 cases that reported being at higher risk of serious COVID-19 disease had higher odds of decreased relationship happiness than high-risk non-cases (aOR: 6.58 [1.10, 39.39]). Additional research in this area is warranted to minimize the long-term impacts of the pandemic on coupled GBMSM.","Walsh, Stephenson","https://doi.org/10.1177/15579883211022180","20210605","COVID-19; and other men who have sex with men; bisexual; gay; mental health; pre-existing conditions; relationship satisfaction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-06","",14380,""
