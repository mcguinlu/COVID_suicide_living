"Inf-Net: Automatic COVID-19 Lung Infection Segmentation from CT Scans","Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread globally in early 2020, causing the world to face an existential health crisis. Automated detection of lung infections from computed tomography (CT) images offers a great potential to augment the traditional healthcare strategy for tackling COVID-19. However, segmenting infected regions from CT scans faces several challenges, including high variation in infection characteristics, and low intensity contrast between infections and normal tissues. Further, collecting a large amount of data is impractical within a short time period, inhibiting the training of a deep model. To address these challenges, a novel COVID-19 Lung Infection Segmentation Deep Network (Inf-Net) is proposed to automatically identify infected regions from chest CT scans. In our Inf-Net, a parallel partial decoder is used to aggregate the high-level features and generate a global map. Then, the implicit reverse attention and explicit edge-attention are utilized to model the boundaries and enhance the representations. Moreover, to alleviate the shortage of labeled data, we present a semi-supervised segmentation framework based on a randomly selected propagation strategy, which only requires a few labeled images and leverages primarily unlabeled data. Our semi-supervised framework can improve the learning ability and achieve a higher performance. Extensive experiments on a COVID-19 infection dataset demonstrate that the proposed Inf-Net outperforms most cutting-edge segmentation models and advances the state-of-the-art","Fan, D.-P.; Zhou, T.; Ji, G.-P.; Zhou, Y.; Chen, G.; Fu, H.; Shen, J.; Shao, L.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.22.20074948v1?rss=1""","20200427",NA,"medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-27","",445,""
"Knowledge, attitude, practice and perception regarding COVID-19 among students in Bangladesh: Survey in Rajshahi University","Background: The number of infection and death by COVID-19 has been rapidly increasing since December 2019 in all over the world. Until now, there is no specific treatment or vaccine for this disease; WHO suggests only some protective measures like maintaining social distance, staying home, washing hands with soap or sanitizer, wearing mask etc. The objective of this study was to survey knowledge, attitude, practice and perception regarding COVID-19 among students in Rajshahi University, Bangladesh. Methods: We collected data from 305 students of Rajshahi University for this cross-sectional study using mixed sampling from March 11 to March 19, 2020. Frequency distribution, Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used in this study. Results: Out of 305 participants, 224 (73.4%) and 81 (26.6%) were male and female students respectively. The study revealed that Rajshahi university students had average knowledge on symptoms, protective way and transmission of COVID-19. Female students were more knowledgeable than male. More than one third of the students had negative attitude to avoiding public transport and going out to public places with friends and family. The practice of students during our data collection period and in future was not satisfactory. More than one third of students were not keen to stay at home and avoid going to crowded places. The perception towards COVID-19 was not good; they had no idea whether the outbreak would affect their daily routine, study and financial matters, study field work and restrict leisure time of meeting family and relatives. Conclusions: We found that general knowledge, attitude, practice and perception of the university students regarding COVID-19 were not satisfactory. This indicated that the situation was worse among common people. In Bangladesh, the number of healthcare providers is insufficient. University students can be employed as potential workforce to create awareness among mass people on prevention of COVID-19.","Wadood, M. A.; Mamun, A.; Rafi, M.

"First study on mental distress in Brazil during the COVID-19 crisis","Objective: We aim to provide the first evidence of mental distress and its associated predictors among adults in the ongoing COVID-19 crisis in Brazil. Methods: We conducted a primary survey of 638 adults in Brazil on March 25-28, 2020, about one month (32 days) after the first COVID-19 case in South America was confirmed in Sao Paulo. Results: In Brazil, 52% (332) of the sampled adults experienced mild or moderate distress, and 18.8% (120) suffered severe distress. Adults who were female, younger, more educated, and exercised less report-ed higher levels of distress. The distance from the Brazilian epicenter of Sao Paulo inter-acted with age and workplace attendance to predict the level of distress. The typhoon eye effect was stronger for people who were older or attended their workplace less. The most vulnerable adults were those who were far from the epicenter and did not go to their workplace in the week before the survey. Conclusion: Identifying the predictors of distress enables mental health services to better target finding and helping the more mentally vulnerable adults during the ongoing COVID-19 crisis.","Zhang, S.

"LONG-TERM CLINICAL OUTCOMES IN SURVIVORS OF CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAKS AFTER HOSPITALISATION OR ICU ADMISSION: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF FOLLOW-UP STUDIES","Objective: To determine the long-term clinical problems in adult survivors of coronavirus (CoV) infection [Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)] after hospitalisation or Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission. Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature. Data sources: Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL Plus and PsycINFO were searched using the strategy: (Coronavirus OR Coronavirus Infections OR COVID OR SARS virus OR Severe acute respiratory syndrome OR MERS OR Middle east respiratory syndrome) AND (Follow-up OR Follow-up studies OR Prevalence). Original studies reporting the clinical outcomes of adult survivors of coronavirus outbreaks two months after discharge or three months after admission were included. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (OCEBM) 2009 Level of Evidence Tool. Meta-analysis was conducted to derive pooled estimates of prevalence and severity for different outcomes at time points up to 6 months follow-up and beyond 6 months follow-up. Results: The search yielded 1169 studies of which 28 were included in this review. There were 15 Level 1b, 8 Level 2b, 2 Level 3b and 3 Level 4 studies by OCEBM grading. Pooled analysis of studies revealed that complications commonly observed were impaired diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) [prevalence of 27.26%, 95% CI 14.87 to 44.57] and reduced exercise capacity [(6-minute walking distance (6MWD) mean 461m, 95% CI 449.66 to 472.71] at 6 months with limited improvement beyond 6 months. Coronavirus survivors had considerable prevalence of psychological disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [38.80%, CI 30.93 to 47.31], depression [33.20%, CI 19.80 to 50.02] and anxiety [30.04%, CI 10.44 to 61.26) beyond 6 months. These complications were accompanied by low Short Form 36 (SF-36) scores at 6 months and beyond indicating reduced quality of life which is present long-term. Conclusions: The long term clinical problems in survivors of CoV infections (SARS and MERS) after hospitalisation or Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission include respiratory dysfunction, reduced exercise capacity, psychological problems such as PTSD, depression and anxiety, and reduced quality of life. Critical care, rehabilitation and mental health services should anticipate a high prevalence of these problems following COVID-19 and ensure their adequate and timely management with the aim of restoring premorbid quality of life.","Ahmed, H.; Patel, K.; Greenwood, D.; Halpin, S.; Lewthwaite, P.; Salawu, A.; Eyre, L.; Breen, A.; O'Connor, R.; Jones, A.; Sivan, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.16.20067975v1?rss=1""","20200422",NA,"medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-27","",448,""
"Mental health outcomes among front and second line health workers associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy.","In this study, we report on mental health outcomes among health workers (HWs) involved with the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. Data on mental health on 1379 HWs were collected between March 27th and March 31th 2020 using an on-line questionnaire spread throughout social networks, using a snowball technique along with sponsored social network advertisement. Key mental health outcomes were Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder symptoms (PTSD), severe depression, anxiety, insomnia and perceived stress. PTSD symptoms, severe depression, anxiety and insomnia, and high perceived stress were endorsed respectively by 681 (49.38%), 341 (24.73%), 273 (19.80%), 114 (8.27%) and 302 (21.90%) respondents. Regression analysis show that younger age, female gender, being a front-line HWs, having a colleague deceased, hospitalised or in quarantine were associated with poor mental health outcomes. This is the first report on mental health outcomes and associated risk factors among HWs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, confirming a substantial proportion of health workers involved with the COVID-19 pandemic having mental health issues, in particular young women, first-line HWs.","Rossi, R.; Socci, V.; Pacitti, F.; Di Lorenzo, G.; Di Marco, A.; Siracusano, A.; Rossi, A.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.16.20067801v1?rss=1""","20200422",NA,"medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-27","",449,""
"Surveying Tenants of Permanent Supportive Housing in Skid Row about COVID-19","Permanent supportive housing (PSH) targets highly vulnerable homeless adults who exhibit early onset of geriatric conditions and require in-home supports. This suggests that risk for COVID-19 within PSH has the potential to resemble vulnerabilities found in nursing homes, which have been described as ""ground zero"" for the current pandemic. This study reports on survey results collected from 532 PSH tenants in Los Angeles, California during the 4th week of March in 2020. Results show that nearly all tenants were aware of COVID-19 and 65% considered it to be a very serious health threat, which was a strong predictor of taking protective measures (i.e. handwashing and social distancing). Tenants in units with shared bathroom facilities had lower odds of social distancing than those in studio apartments. Tenants with mental health diagnoses had lower odds of consistent handwashing. Lack of access to food, hygiene items, and medication delivery were common barriers to sheltering in place.","Henwood, B.

"Years of life lost due to the psychosocial consequences of COVID19 mitigation strategies based on Swiss data","Background: The pandemic caused by COVID-19 has forced governments to implement strict social mitigation strategies to reduce the acute morbidity and mortality from acute infections. These strategies however carry a significant risk for mental health which can lead to increased short-term and long-term mortality, which is currently not included in modelling the impact of the pandemic. Methods: We used years of life lost (YLL) as the main outcome measure as applied to Switzerland as an exemplar. We focused on suicide, depression, alcohol use disorder, childhood physical abuse and social isolation as these are known to increase YLL in the context of imposed restriction in social contact and freedom of movement. We also estimated a minimum duration of mitigation of 3 months based on current public health plans. Results: The study projects that the average person would suffer 0.205 YLL due to psychosocial consequence of COVID-19 mitigation measures. However, this loss would be entirely borne by a subpopulation of 2.1 percent of the population, the average of whom suffer an average 9.79 YLL. Conclusions: The results presented here are likely to underestimate the true impact of the mitigation strategies on YLL. However, model like the one presented here highlight the need for public health models to expand their scope in order to provide better estimates of the risks and benefits of mitigation.","Moser, D.

"Neuropsychiatric adverse events of chloroquine: a real-world pharmacovigilance study using the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database","In late March and early April 2020, the antimalarial drug, chloroquine, has been approved as an emergency treatment for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States and in Europe. Although infrequent, neuropsychiatric symptoms have been reported in patients who received chloroquine for the treatment of malaria or autoimmune diseases. In this study, aiming to investigate these adverse events (AEs) using a large self-reporting database, we conducted a disproportionality analysis for the detection of neuropsychiatric AE signals associated with the use of chloroquine (or hydroxychloroquine), reported to FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database between the fourth quarter of 2012 and the fourth quarter of 2019. We included 2,389,474 AE cases, among which 520 cases developed neuropsychiatric AE following the use of chloroquine. Adjusted reporting odds ratio (ROR) for the development of each of the neuropsychiatric AEs following the use of chloroquine was calculated using a multilevel model: exposure to chloroquine was associated with a statistically significant high reporting of amnesia, delirium, hallucinations, depression, and loss of consciousness, (lower 95% confidence interval of the adjusted ROR > 1), although the degree of increase in their ROR was limited. There was no statistically significant high reporting of any other neuropsychiatric AE, including suicide, psychosis, confusion, and agitation. Current pharmacovigilance study results did not suggest any potential link between the use of chloroquine and an increased risk of suicide, psychosis, confusion, and agitation, which would be informative during the emergency use of chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19.","Sato, Kenichiro; Mano, Tatsuo; Iwata, Atsushi; Toda, Tatsushi","https://doi.org/10.5582/bst.2020.03082","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-27","",453,""

"A Multinational, Multicentre Study on the Psychological Outcomes and Associated Physical Symptoms Amongst Healthcare Workers During COVID-19 Outbreak","Objective Since the declaration of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak as pandemic, there are reports on the increased prevalence of physical symptoms observed in the general population. We investigated the association between psychological outcomes and physical symptoms among healthcare workers. Methods Healthcare workers from 5 major hospitals, involved in the care for COVID-19 patients, in Singapore and India were invited to participate in a study by performing a self-administered questionnaire within the period of February 19 to April 17, 2020. Healthcare workers included doctors, nurses, allied healthcare workers, administrators, clerical staff and maintenance workers. This questionnaire collected information on demographics, medical history, symptom prevalence in the past month, Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) instrument. The prevalence of physical symptoms displayed by healthcare workers and the associations between physical symptoms and psychological outcomes of depression, anxiety, stress, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were evaluated. Results Out of the 906 healthcare workers who participated in the survey, 48 (5.3%) screened positive for moderate to very-severe depression, 79 (8.7%) for moderate to extremely-severe anxiety, 20 (2.2%) for moderate to extremely-severe stress, and 34 (3.8%) for moderate to severe levels of psychological distress. The commonest reported symptom was headache (32.3%), with a large number of participants (33.4%) reporting more than four symptoms. Participants who had experienced symptoms in the preceding month were more likely to be older, have pre-existing comorbidities and a positive screen for depression, anxiety, stress, and PTSD. After adjusting for age, gender and comorbidities, it was found that depression (OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.54-5.07, p=0.001), anxiety (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.36-3.48, p=0.001), stress (OR 3.06, 95% CI 1.27-7.41, p=0.13), and PTSD (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.12-4.35, p=0.023) remained significantly associated with the presence of physical symptoms experienced in the preceding month. Linear regression revealed that the presence of physical symptoms was associated with higher mean scores in the IES-R, DASS Anxiety, Stress and Depression subscales. Conclusions Our study demonstrates a significant association between the prevalence of physical symptoms and psychological outcomes among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 outbreak. We postulate that this association may be bi-directional, and that timely psychological interventions for healthcare workers with physical symptoms should be considered once an infection has been excluded.","Chew, Nicholas W.

"Coronaviruses and people with intellectual disability: An exploratory data analysis","BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has been announced as a new coronavirus disease by the World Health Organization (WHO). At the time of writing this article (April 2020), the world is drastically influenced by the COVID-19. Recently the COVID-19 open research dataset (CORD-19) was published. For researchers on intellectual disability such as ourselves, it is of key interest to learn whether this open research dataset may be used to investigate the virus and its consequences for people with an intellectual disability. METHODS: From CORD-19 we identified full text articles containing terms related to the intellectual disability-care and applied a text mining technique, specifically the TF-IDF analysis in combination with K-means clustering. RESULTS: 259 articles contained one or more of our specified terms related to intellectual disability. We were able to cluster these articles related to intellectual disabilities into five clusters on different topics, namely: Mental health, Viral diseases, Diagnoses & Treatments, Maternal care & Pediatrics, and Genetics. CONCLUSION: The CORD-19 open research dataset consists of valuable information about not only COVID-19 disease but also intellectual disabilities and the relationship between them. We suggest researchers investigate Literature-Based Discovery approaches on the CORD-19 and develop a new dataset that addresses the intersection of these two fields for further research.","Tummers, J.; Catal, C.; Tobi, H.; Tekinerdogan, B.; Leusink, G.","https://doi.org/10.1111/jir.12730","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-27","",458,""

Previous experience from smaller scale epidemics and emerging literature around COVID-19 show that the unparalleled amount of stress that healthcare workers are dealing with, is associated with increased psychological morbidities. We have depicted the psychological burden that the COVID-19 pandemic has posed on healthcare professionals in Greece and have reviewed the literature around the effect of previous epidemics on frontline healthcare staff.

"The Effect of COVID-19 on Youth Mental Health","The purposes of this study was to assess the youth mental health after the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) occurred in China two weeks later, and to investigate factors of mental health among youth groups. A cross-sectional study was conducted two weeks after the occurrence of COVID-19 in China. A total of 584 youth enrolled in this study and completed the question about cognitive status of COVID-19, the General Health Questionnaire(GHQ-12), the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C) and the Negative coping styles scale. Univariate analysis and univariate logistic regression were used to evaluate the effect of COVID-19 on youth mental health. The results of this cross-sectional study suggest that nearly 40.4% the sampled youth were found to be prone to psychological problems and 14.4% the sampled youth with Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Univariate logistic regression revealed that youth mental health was significantly related to being less educated (OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>8.71, 95%CI:1.97–38.43), being the enterprise employee (OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>2.36, 95%CI:1.09–5.09), suffering from the PTSD symptom (OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.05, 95%CI:1.03–1.07) and using negative coping styles (OR<U+2009>=<U+2009>1.03, 95%CI:1.00–1.07). Results of this study suggest that nearly 40.4% of the youth group had a tendency to have psychological problems. Thus, this was a remarkable evidence that infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, may have an immense influence on youth mental health. Therefor, local governments should develop effective psychological interventions for youth groups, moreover, it is important to consider the educational level and occupation of the youth during the interventions.","Liang, Leilei; Ren, Hui; Cao, Ruilin; Hu, Yueyang; Qin, Zeying; Li, Chuanen; Mei, Songli","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11126-020-09744-3","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-27","",460,""

With the deeper cognition of COVID-19 and accumulation of clinical experience, we proposed the recommendations for pulmonary rehabilitation of COVID-19 in adults based on the opinions of front-line clinical experts involved in the management of this epidemic and a review of the relevant literature and evidences: (1)for the inpatients with COVID-19, pulmonary rehabilitation would relieve the symptoms of dyspnea, anxiety, and depression; eventually improve physical function and the quality of life; (2)For severe/critical inpatients, the early performance of pulmonary rehabilitation is not suggested. (3)For isolating patients, the pulmonary rehabilitation guidence should be conducted through education video, instruction manual or remote consultation. (4)Assessment and monitor should be performed throughout the entire pulmonary rehabilitation process.(5)Taking proper grading protection following the guideline. These recommendations can serve as a clinical practice guidence and basis for pulmonary rehabilitation of COVID-19.","","https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112147-20200228-00206","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-27","",462,""

People are stuck at home, worrying about their health, their family and their paycheck, Spectrum News New York 1 reported April 13. ?We are seeing a lot of calls related to anxiety and stress that people are experiencing today,? said Matt Kudish, executive director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness of New York City. The organization says the number of callers seeking help has jumped 60% over the last few weeks, and that conversations now last about 15 minutes longer than average. The city says it's also seeing an increase in demand. Web sessions to its NYC Well service jumped 185% last month to more than 81,000. ?We're hearing from people who are worried about their own physical health, they're worried about their mental health being forced to stay socially distant from other people,? Kudish said. Health care providers predict that even when the COVID-19 crisis ends, the mental health crisis will continue. They say people will continue to be anxious ? this time about leaving home and being convinced it's safe to be outside.","","https://doi.org/10.1002/mhw.32328","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-27","",464,""
"Laboratory testing of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV): Current status, challenges, and countermeasures","Emerging and reemerging infectious diseases are global public concerns. With the outbreak of unknown pneumonia in Wuhan, China in December 2019, a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 has been attracting tremendous attention. Rapid and accurate laboratory testing of SARS-CoV-2 is essential for early discovery, early reporting, early quarantine, early treatment, and cutting off epidemic transmission. The genome structure, transmission, and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 are basically similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the other two beta-CoVs of medical importance. During the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics, a variety of molecular and serological diagnostic assays were established and should be referred to for SARS-CoV-2. In this review, by summarizing the articles and guidelines about specimen collection, nucleic acid tests (NAT) and serological tests for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, several suggestions are put forward to improve the laboratory testing of SARS-CoV-2. In summary, for NAT: collecting stool and blood samples at later periods of illness to improve the positive rate if lower respiratory tract specimens are unavailable; increasing template volume to raise the sensitivity of detection; putting samples in reagents containing guanidine salt to inactivate virus as well as protect RNA; setting proper positive, negative and inhibition controls to ensure high-quality results; simultaneously amplifying human RNase P gene to avoid false-negative results. For antibody test, diverse assays targeting different antigens, and collecting paired samples are needed.","Yan, Ying; Chang, Le; Wang, Lunan","https://doi.org/10.1002/rmv.2106","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-27","",465,""

"Affective temperament, attachment style, and the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak: an early report on the Italian general population","The outbreak of COVID-19 is severely affecting mental health worldwide, although individual response may vary. This study aims to investigate the psychological distress perceived by the Italian general population during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to analyze affective temperament and adult attachment styles as potential mediators. Through an online survey, we collected sociodemographic and lockdown-related information and evaluated distress, temperament, and attachment using the Kessler 10 Psychological Distress Scale (K10), the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego-Autoquestionnaire short version (TEMPS-A) and the Attachment Style Questionnaire (ASQ). In our sample (n=500), 62% of the individuals reported no likelihood of psychological distress, whereas 19.4% and 18.6% displayed mild and moderate-to-severe likelihood. Cyclothymic (OR: 1.24; p<0.001), depressive (OR: 1.52; p<0.001) and anxious (OR: 1.58; p=0.002) temperaments, and the ASQ “Need for approval” (OR: 1.08; p=0.01) were risk factors for moderate-to-severe psychological distress compared to no distress, while the ASQ “Confidence” (OR: 0.89; p=0.002) and “Discomfort with closeness” were protective (OR: 0.92; p=0.001). Cyclothymic (OR: 1.17; p=0.008) and depressive (OR: 1.32; p=0.003) temperaments resulted as risk factors in subjects with moderate-to-severe psychological distress compared to mild distress, while the ASQ “Confidence” (OR: 0.92; p=0.039) and “Discomfort with closeness” (OR: 0.94; p=0.023) were protective. Our data indicated that a relevant rate of individuals may have experienced psychological distress following the COVID-19 outbreak. Specific affective temperament and attachment features predict the extent of mental health burden. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first data available on the psychological impact of the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic on a sizeable sample of the Italian population. Moreover, our study is the first to investigate temperament and attachment characteristics in the psychological response to the ongoing pandemic.

"Safety signals for QT prolongation or Torsades de Pointes associated with azithromycin with or without chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine","Background Combinations of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin have been promoted as treatments for COVID-19 based on small, uncontrolled clinical trials that have not assessed potential risks. Risks of treatment include QT segment prolongation, Torsades de Pointes (TdP), and death. This comparative pharmacovigilance analysis evaluated the risk of these events. Methods Data from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) (>13 million total reports) were used. Queries extracted reports based on exposures of HCQ/chloroquine (CQ) alone, azithromycin alone, HCQ/CQ + azithromycin, amoxicillin alone, HCQ/CQ + amoxicillin alone. Amoxicillin served as a control. Events of interest included death and TdP/QT prolongation as well as accidents/injuries and depression as control events. Proportional Reporting Ratios (PRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated where a lower limit of the of 95% CI (Lower95CI) value of =2.0 is interpreted as a potential safety signal. Results Lower95CIs for HCQ/CQ alone showed no potential safety signals for TdP/QT prolongation, death, or any of the control events included. The PRRs and 95% CIs for TdP/QT prolongation was 1.43 (1.29–2.59) with HCQ/CQ use alone and 4.10 (3.80–4.42) for azithromycin alone. For the combined HCQ/CQ + azithromycin group, the PRR and 95% CI was 3.77 (1.80–7.87). For the control of amoxicillin, there were no safety signals when used alone or in combination with HCQ/CQ. Conclusions HCQ/CQ use was not associated with a safety signal in this analysis of FAERS data. However, azithromycin used alone was associated with TdP/QT prolongation events and should be used with caution.","Sarayani, Amir; Cicali, Brian; Henriksen, Carl H.; Brown, Joshua D.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.04.016","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-27","",468,""

"The Elabela-APJ axis: a promising therapeutic target for heart failure","Heart failure (HF) is a growing epidemic with high morbidity and mortality at an international scale. The apelin–APJ receptor pathway has been implicated in HF, making it a promising therapeutic target. APJ has been shown to be activated by a novel endogenous peptide ligand known as Elabela (ELA, also called Toddler or Apela), with a critical role in cardiac development and function. Activation of the ELA–APJ receptor axis exerts a wide range of physiological effects, including depressor response, positive inotropic action, diuresis, anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, and anti-remodeling, leading to its cardiovascular protection. The ELA–APJ axis is essential for diverse biological processes and has been shown to regulate fluid homeostasis, myocardial contractility, vasodilation, angiogenesis, cellular differentiation, apoptosis, oxidative stress, cardiorenal fibrosis, and dysfunction. The beneficial effects of the ELA–APJ receptor system are well-established by treating hypertension, myocardial infarction, and HF. Additionally, administration of ELA protects human embryonic stem cells against apoptosis and stress-induced cell death and promotes survival and self-renewal in an APJ-independent manner (X receptor) via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway, which may provide a new therapeutic approach for HF. Thus, targeting the ELA–APJ axis has emerged as a pre-warning biomarker and a novel therapeutic approach against progression of HF. An increased understanding of cardiovascular actions of ELA will help to develop effective interventions. This article gives an overview of the characteristics of the ELA–apelin–APJ axis and summarizes the current knowledge on its cardioprotective roles, potential mechanisms, and prospective application for acute and chronic HF.","Ma, Zheng; Song, Juan-Juan; Martin, Sara; Yang, Xin-Chun; Zhong, Jiu-Chang","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10741-020-09957-5","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-27","",470,""

"Insights into the Microbiological Safety of Wooden Cutting Boards Used for Meat Processing in Hong Kong’s Wet Markets: A Focus on Food-Contact Surfaces, Cross-Contamination and the Efficacy of Traditional Hygiene Practices","Hong Kong&rsquo;s wet markets play a crucial role in the country&rsquo;s supply of safe, fresh meat to satisfy the dietary needs of its population. Whilst food safety regulations have been introduced over the past few years to maintain the microbial safety of foods sold from these wet markets, it remains unclear whether the hygiene maintenance that is performed on the wooden cutting boards used for meat-processing is effective. In fact, hygiene maintenance may often be overlooked, and hygiene standards may be insufficient. If so, this may lead to the spread of harmful pathogens through cross-contamination, thereby causing severe risks to public health. The aim of this study was to determine the level of microbial transfer between wooden cutting boards and swine meat of various qualities, using 16S metagenomic sequencing, strain identification and biofilm screening of isolated strains. The results established that: (a) the traditional hygiene practices used for cleaning wooden cutting boards in Hong Kong&rsquo;s wet markets expose the surfaces to potentially harmful microorganisms; (b) the processing of microbially contaminated meat on cutting boards cleaned using traditional practices leads to cross-contamination; and (c) several potentially pathogenic microorganisms found on the cutting boards have good biofilm-forming abilities. These results reinforce the need to review the traditional methods used to clean wooden cutting boards after the processing of raw meat in Hong Kong&rsquo; wet markets so as to prevent cross-contamination events. The establishment of proper hygiene protocols may reduce the spread of disease-causing microorganisms (including antibiotic-resistant microorganisms) in food-processing environments.","Sekoai, Patrick T.; Feng, Shiqi; Zhou, Wenwen; Ngan, Wing Y.; Pu, Yang; Yao, Yuan; Pan, Jie; Habimana, Olivier","https://doi.org/10.3390/MICROORGANISMS8040579","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-27","",478,""

Psychodynamic places a large emphasis on defense mechanisms and unconscious mind, where upsetting feelings, urges, and thoughts that are too painful for us to directly look at are housed. Even though these painful feelings and thoughts are outside of our awareness, they still influence our behavior in many ways. Optimal application of psychodynamic approach offers the frame for acceptance of psychological stress in a more positive way and benefits psychological growth.

"Impact of Human Disasters and COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Health: Potential of Digital Psychiatry","Deep emotional traumas in societies overwhelmed by large-scale human disasters, like, global pandemic diseases, natural disasters, man-made tragedies, war conflicts, social crises, etc., can cause massive stress-related disorders. Motivated by the ongoing global coronavirus pandemic, the article provides an overview of scientific evidence regarding adverse impact of diverse human disasters on mental health in afflicted groups and societies. Following this broader context, psychosocial impact of COVID-19 as a specific global human disaster is presented, with an emphasis on disturbing mental health aspects of the ongoing pandemic. Limited resources of mental health services in a number of countries around the world are illustrated, which will be further stretched by the forthcoming increase in demand for mental health services due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. Mental health challenges are particularly important for the Republic of Croatia in the current situation, due to disturbing stress of the 2020 Zagreb earthquake and the high pre-pandemic prevalence of chronic Homeland-War-related posttraumatic stress disorders. Comprehensive approach based on digital psychiatry is proposed to address the lack of access to psychiatric services, which includes artificial intelligence, telepsychiatry and an array of new technologies, like internet-based computer-aided mental health tools and services. These tools and means should be utilized as an important part of the whole package of measures to mitigate negative mental health effects of the global coronavirus pandemic. Our scientific and engineering experiences in the design and development of digital tools and means in mitigation of stress-related disorders and assessment of stress resilience are presented.

Beyond the risks strictly related to the infection, concerns have been expressed for the psychological impact that COVID-19 may have, especially on vulnerable individuals with pre-existing mental health conditions. Somatic symptom disorder (SSD) is characterized by a dysfunctional preoccupation with physical symptoms leading to excessive and unnecessary healthcare utilization. Despite being quite common, such condition remains underrecognized. We report a detailed clinical case of a 16 years old adolescent, who presented with a history suggestive of COVID-19 infection and associated psychological distress. Despite testing negative for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, his extreme and persisting health preoccupations required an inpatient admission to the Child and Adolescent Neuropsychiatric Unit. He responded rapidly to a low dose of antipsychotic and an antidepressant. Based on his medical history and current presentation, he received a diagnosis of SSD. When COVID-19-like symptoms occur, we highlight the importance of differentially diagnosing a possible exacerbation of a pre-existing SSD, triggered by fear of being infected. This may help preventing further burden to the healthcare system.","Colizzi, Marco; Bortoletto, Riccardo; Silvestri, Marta; Mondini, Federica; Puttini, Elena; Cainelli, Chiara; Gaudino, Rossella; Ruggeri, Mirella; Zoccante, Leonardo","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2020.100073","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-27","",491,""

"COVID-19 and the Air We Breathe","In a dense urban area like this one, most residents have no access to private outdoor space and rely on public parks for exercise, the mental health boost that comes from a connection with nature, and fresh air. Conscientious city dwellers now ponder how to maintain safe social distance while sharing limited outdoor space with others. Official recommendations in the United States have converged on 6 ft of distance as the rule of thumb(1) for avoiding the exchange of potentially infective respiratory droplets and aerosols, but these recommendations were devised on the basis of observations made in the 1930s for hospital environments.(2) Do they hold for outdoors, in a breeze? During exercise? In some places, the outdoor air that we seek is fresher than before the pandemic. Shutdowns have resulted in much lower emissions of pollutants related to travel and commercial activity, but other sources of air pollution have remained stable or even increased. Household electricity use has increased dramatically, and consumption patterns have shifted as a result of our new, more intensely domestic lifestyle. These changes in emissions coincide with the seasonal meteorological changes that come with the transition from winter into spring, complicating the identification and interpretation of trends from satellite data and long-term monitoring networks","McNeill, V.

"Multidisciplinary research priorities for the COVID-19 pandemic: a call for action for mental health science","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is having a profound effect on all aspects of society, including mental health and physical health. We explore the psychological, social, and neuroscientific effects of COVID-19 and set out the immediate priorities and longer-term strategies for mental health science research. These priorities were informed by surveys of the public and an expert panel convened by the UK Academy of Medical Sciences and the mental health research charity, MQ: Transforming Mental Health, in the first weeks of the pandemic in the UK in March, 2020. We urge UK research funding agencies to work with researchers, people with lived experience, and others to establish a high level coordination group to ensure that these research priorities are addressed, and to allow new ones to be identified over time. The need to maintain high-quality research standards is imperative. International collaboration and a global perspective will be beneficial. An immediate priority is collecting high-quality data on the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic across the whole population and vulnerable groups, and on brain function, cognition, and mental health of patients with COVID-19. There is an urgent need for research to address how mental health consequences for vulnerable groups can be mitigated under pandemic conditions, and on the impact of repeated media consumption and health messaging around COVID-19. Discovery, evaluation, and refinement of mechanistically driven interventions to address the psychological, social, and neuroscientific aspects of the pandemic are required. Rising to this challenge will require integration across disciplines and sectors, and should be done together with people with lived experience. New funding will be required to meet these priorities, and it can be efficiently leveraged by the UK's world-leading infrastructure. This Position Paper provides a strategy that may be both adapted for, and integrated with, research efforts in other countries.","Holmes, Emily A.; O'Connor, Rory C.; Perry, V.

"The Impact of COVID-19 on Bariatric Surgery: Re-Defining Psychosocial Care","Abstract The global outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has had a tremendous psychological impact on individuals around the world. Individuals with obesity are susceptible to distress and psychological sequalae secondary to this pandemic, which can have detrimental effects on obesity management. In particular, individuals undergoing bariatric surgery could experience increased emotional distress resulting in increased eating psychopathology, mental health exacerbation and difficulties with self-management. Addressing these challenges requires novel approaches to re-defining psychosocial care before and after bariatric surgery. Emerging evidence suggests the remote delivery of care using virtual care models, including mobile and online modalities, could extend the reach of psychosocial services to individuals after bariatric surgery and mitigate weight regain or impairment in quality of life. Due to this pandemic, the rapid integration of virtual psychosocial care in bariatric surgery programs to address patients? needs will create new opportunities for clinical and implementation science research.","Sockalingam, Sanjeev; Leung, Samantha E.; Cassin, Stephanie E.","https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.22836","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-27","",504,""

"One Academic Health System's Early (and Ongoing) Experience Responding to COVID-19: Recommendations From the Initial Epicenter of the Pandemic in the United States","On January 19, 2020, the first case of a patient with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States was reported in Washington State. On February 29, 2020, a patient infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) passed away in a hospital in Seattle-King County, the first reported COVID-19-related death in the United States. That same day, a skilled nursing and rehabilitation facility in the county reported that several of its residents tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and that many staff had symptoms compatible with COVID-19.The University of Washington Medicine health system (UW Medicine), which is based in Seattle-King County and provides quaternary care for the region, was one of several health care organizations called upon to address this growing crisis. What ensued was a series of swiftly enacted decisions and activities at UW Medicine, in partnership with local, state, and national public health agencies, to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. Tapping into the multipronged mission areas of academic medicine, UW Medicine worked to support the community, innovate in science and clinical practice, lead policy and practice guideline development, and adopt changes as the crisis unfolded. In doing so, health system leaders had to balance their commitments to students, residents and fellows, researchers, faculty, staff, and hospital and health center entities, while ensuring that patients continued to receive cutting edge, high-quality, safe care.

"Attending to the Emotional Well-Being of the Health Care Workforce in a New York City Health System During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has placed an enormous strain on health care workers, and its potential impact has implications for the physical and emotional well-being of the work force. As hospital systems run far over capacity, facing possible shortages of critical care medical resources and personal protective equipment as well as clinician deaths, the psychological stressors necessitate a strong well-being support model for staff. At the Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS) in New York City, health care workers have been heroically providing front-line care to COVID-19 patients while facing their own appropriate fears for their personal safety in the setting of contagion. This moral obligation cannot be burdened by unacceptable risks; the health system's full support is required to address the needs of its workforce.In this Invited Commentary, the authors describe how an MSHS Employee, Faculty, and Trainee Crisis Support Task Force-created in early March 2020 and composed of behavioral health, human resources, and well-being leaders from across the health system-used a rapid needs assessment model to capture the concerns of the workforce related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The task force identified 3 priority areas central to promoting and maintaining the well-being of the entire MSHS workforce during the pandemic: meeting basic daily needs; enhancing communications for delivery of current, reliable, and reassuring messages; and developing robust psychosocial and mental health support options. Using a work group strategy, the task force operationalized the roll-out of support initiatives for each priority area. Attending to the emotional well-being of health care workers has emerged as a central element in the MSHS COVID-19 response, which continues to be committed to the physical and emotional needs of a workforce that courageously faces this crisis.","Ripp, Jonathan; Peccoralo, Lauren; Charney, Dennis","https://doi.org/10.1097/ACM.0000000000003414","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-27","",508,""

According to the knowledge of infectious diseases such as SARS and MERS, many patients and health care workers suffered from depression and anxiety during and after the epidemic. In particular, post-epidemic survivors were more likely to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Similar conditions could be occurred during and after COVID-19. Therefore, it is also an important task to reduce the prevalence of PTSD after COVID-19 as much as possible and to relieve the tension of infected patients, first-line medical staff, quarantine personnel and so on. Traditional Chinese medicine has unique advantages in the treatment of emotional diseases. Understanding the etiology and pathogenesis of PTSD by theory of traditional Chinese medicine and looking for effective methods to treat PTSD will be helpful to treat PTSD of survivors after COVID-19. It is found that Sini Powder has potential value in the treatment of PTSD by the summary and comparison of the research on traditional Chinese medicine related to the treatment of PTSD. We hope to overcome this epidemic psychologically and spiritually. Therefore, it is considered that Sini Powder can be used as the first choice for relieving emotional diseases of related patients during COVID-19 and treating PTSD of survivors after COVID-19.","Li, Y.

"WHEN BASIC SUPPLIES ARE MISSING, WHAT TO DO? SPECIFIC DEMANDS OF THE LOCAL STREET POPULATION IN TIMES OF CORONAVIRUS – A CONCERN OF SOCIAL PSYCHIATRY","Background : Homeless experts and some federal housing officials are sounding the alarm that the patchwork of government efforts to address the coronavirus outbreak risks leaving out one group of acutely vulnerable people: the homeless. In terms of isolation, it is too unclear what that looks like if you normally sleep on the streets. In this tough moment, when people should be turned away, not only it feels inhumane, but it is also a big public health risk, because where are they going to go? Method : The studies were identified using large-sized newspapers with international circulation. Results : With more cities suspecting community transmission of the novel coronavirus, people who sleep in shelters or hunker down outside already have a lower life expectancy and often have underlying health conditions that put them at greater risk if they develop COVID-19 (Global News, 2020). These people face lack of sleep, malnutrition, and “extreme stress levels just to meet their daily needs”, all of which weakens the immune system. Along with mental illness or substance abuse disorders, they are “incredibly vulnerable to this virus”. Conclusions : Health organizations are well aware of the risks involved in mental health. A large population of homeless people experience their pain and psychological distress intermittently. For low-income patients, the various borderline situations related to health/illness involve growing expectations regarding the basic needs. This is a serious concern when linked to the pandemic.","Neto, Modesto Leite Rolim; de Souza, Ricardo Inácio; Quezado, Rosa Magda Martins; Mendonça, Elayne Cristina Santos; de Araújo, Tallys Iury; Luz, Dayse Christina Rodrigues Pereira; de Santana, Willma José; Sampaio, Juliana Ribeiro Francelino; Carvalho, Poliana Moreira de Medeiros; Arrais, Tereza Maria Siqueira Nascimento; Landim, José Marcondes Macedo; da Silva, Claúdio Gleideston Lima","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112939","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-27","",511,""
"When health professionals look death in the eye: the mental health of professionals who deal daily with the 2019 coronavirus outbreak","Background : The fact that COVID-19 is transmissible from human to human and associated with high morbidity and potentially fatality can intensify the perception of personal danger. In addition, the foreseeable shortage of supplies and an increasing flow of suspected and real cases of COVID-19 contribute to the pressures and concerns of health professionals. Method : The studies were identified in well-known international journals found in two electronic databases: Scopus and Embase. The data were cross-checked with information from the main international newspapers. Results : Work-related stress is a potential cause of concern for health professionals. It has been associated with anxiety including multiple clinical activities, depression in the face of the coexistence of countless deaths, long work shifts with the most diverse unknowns and demands in the treatment with patients with COVID-19. Therefore, it is an important indicator of psychic exhaustion. Conclusions : As coronavirus cases increase and deaths surge in Italy, new figures show an ""enormous"" level of contagion among the country's medical personnel. At least 2,629 health workers have been infected with coronavirus since the outbreak onset in February, representing 8.3% of total cases. The percentage of infected health workers has almost doubled the number registered in China throughout the epidemic.

Such widespread outbreaks are associated with adverse mental health consequences. Keeping this in mind, existing literature on the COVID-19 outbreak pertinent to mental health was retrieved via a literature search of the PubMed database. Published articles were classified according to their overall themes and summarized. Preliminary evidence suggests that symptoms of anxiety and depression (16–28%) and self-reported stress (8%) are common psychological reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic, and may be associated with disturbed sleep. A number of individual and structural variables moderate this risk. In planning services for such populations, both the needs of the concerned people and the necessary preventive guidelines must be taken into account. The available literature has emerged from only a few of the affected countries, and may not reflect the experience of persons living in other parts of the world.

Data are lacking on impact of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on Health-Related Quality of Life among patients affected by Primary Antibody Deficiencies. AIM OF THE STUDY: to identify factors impacting the Health-Related-Quality of Life among Italian patients affected by Primary Antibody Deficiencies switched to remote assistance at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Survey on quality of life in 158 Primary Antibody Deficiency patients measured by the CVID_QoL, a disease-specific tool, and by the GHQ-12, a generic tool to assess the risk of anxiety/depression. Since the beginning of COVID-19 epidemic, we shifted all PAD patients to home therapy, and activated remote visits. Questionnaires were sent by email four weeks later. CVID_QoL and GHQ-12 data scores were compared with the same set of data from a survey done in 2017. RESULTS: Of 210 patients, 158 (75%) agreed to participate. The quality of life worse in the group of patients who become at risk of anxiety/depression at the study time. Health-Related-Quality of Life was similar in patients forced to shift from hospital-based to home-based immunoglobulin treatment and in patients who continued their usual home-based replacement.

"COVID-19 and pets: When pandemic meets panic","As the novel coronavirus outbreak spreads globally with devastating effects on human health, pets are also becoming unnecessary victims amidst the pandemic panic. Many have been reluctantly left home alone by owners who have been forced to temporarily evacuate their homes. And, although no evidence exists to indicate that they can either transmit the virus or develop its associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), fear among the public that pets might play a role in spreading COVID-19 has resulted in pets being abandoned or even killed. This article outlines some of the ways in which the current pandemic has negatively impacted the welfare of pets. It also highlights the relationships between animal, human, and environmental health, as well as the importance of taking a collaborative transdisciplinary One Health approach to help prevent future COVID-19 outbreaks.","Parry, Nicola M.

"Are we facing a crashing wave of neuropsychiatric sequelae of COVID-19? Neuropsychiatric symptoms and potential immunologic mechanisms","The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic is a significant psychological stressor in addition to its tremendous impact on every facet of individuals’ lives and organizations in virtually all social and economic sectors worldwide. Fear of illness and uncertainty about the future precipitate anxiety- and stress-related disorders, and several groups have rightfully called for the creation and dissemination of robust mental health screening and treatment programs for the general public and front-line healthcare workers. However, in addition to pandemic-associated psychological distress, the direct effects of the virus itself (several acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2), and the subsequent host immunologic response, on the human central nervous system (CNS) and related outcomes are unknown. We discuss currently available evidence of COVID-19 related neuropsychiatric sequelae while drawing parallels to past viral pandemic-related outcomes. Past pandemics have demonstrated that diverse types of neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as encephalopathy, mood changes, psychosis, neuromuscular dysfunction, or demyelinating processes, may accompany acute viral infection, or may follow infection by weeks, months, or longer in recovered patients. The potential mechanisms are also discussed, including viral and immunological underpinnings. Therefore, prospective neuropsychiatric monitoring of individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 at various points in the life course, as well as their neuroimmune status, are needed to fully understand the long-term impact of COVID-19, and to establish a framework for integrating psychoneuroimmunology into epidemiologic studies of pandemics.","Troyer, Emily A.; Kohn, Jordan N.; Hong, Suzi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.027","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-27","",519,""

"Mental Health and Psychosocial Problems of Medical Health Workers during the COVID-19 Epidemic in China","OBJECTIVE: We explored whether medical health workers had more psychosocial problems than nonmedical health workers during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: An online survey was run from February 19 to March 6, 2020; a total of 2,182 Chinese subjects participated. Mental health variables were assessed via the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the Symptom Check List-revised (SCL-90-R), and the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4), which included a 2-item anxiety scale and a 2-item depression scale (PHQ-2). RESULTS: Compared with nonmedical health workers (n = 1,255), medical health workers (n = 927) had a higher prevalence of insomnia (38.4 vs. 30.5%, p < 0.01), anxiety (13.0 vs. 8.5%, p < 0.01), depression (12.2 vs. 9.5%; p< 0.04), somatization (1.6 vs. 0.4%; p < 0.01), and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (5.3 vs. 2.2%; p < 0.01). They also had higher total scores of ISI, GAD-2, PHQ-2, and SCL-90-R obsessive-compulsive symptoms (p = 0.01). Among medical health workers, having organic disease was an independent factor for insomnia, anxiety, depression, somatization, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (p < 0.05 or 0.01). Living in rural areas, being female, and being at risk of contact with COVID-19 patients were the most common risk factors for insomnia, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and depression (p < 0.01 or 0.05). Among nonmedical health workers, having organic disease was a risk factor for insomnia, depression, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (p < 0.01 or 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 outbreak, medical health workers had psychosocial problems and risk factors for developing them. They were in need of attention and recovery programs.","Zhang, Wen-Rui; Wang, Kun; Yin, Lu; Zhao, Wen-Feng; Xue, Qing; Peng, Mao; Min, Bao-Quan; Tian, Qing; Leng, Hai-Xia; Du, Jia-Lin; Chang, Hong; Yang, Yuan; Li, Wei; Shangguan, Fang-Fang; Yan, Tian-Yi; Dong, Hui-Qing; Han, Ying; Wang, Yu-Ping; Cosci, Fiammetta; Wang, Hong-Xing","https://doi.org/10.1159/000507639","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-27","",521,""

"PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS: THEIR POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO COVID-19","Background : Insufficient housing quality is associated with stress and mental health impacts. Crowding, pollution, noise, inadequate lighting, lack of access to green spaces, and other environmental factors associated with slums can exacerbate mental health disorders, including depression, anxiety, violence, and other forms of social dysfunction. Method : The studies were identified using large-sized newspapers with international circulation. Results : Experts say that people who sleep in shelters or on the streets already have lower life expectancy, suffer from addiction, and have underlying health conditions that put them at greater risk should they develop the virus. There are just so many competing and unmet needs, which makes it much harder for homeless to contend with all of this. If exposed, people experiencing homelessness might be more susceptible to illness or death due to the prevalence of underlying physical and mental medical conditions and a lack of reliable and affordable health care. Nevertheless, without an urgent solution, people experiencing homelessness will remain in limbo. Conclusions : Many people living on the streets already have a diminished health condition, higher rates of chronic illnesses or compromised immune systems, all of which are risk factors for developing a more serious manifestation of the coronavirus infection. Those suffering from mental illness may have difficulty in recognizing and responding to the threat of infection. Homeless people have less access to health care providers who could otherwise order diagnostic testing and, if confirmed, isolate them from others in coordination with local health departments.","Lima, Nádia Nara Rolim; de Souza, Ricardo Inácio; Feitosa, Pedro Walisson Gomes; Moreira, Jorge Lucas de Sousa; da Silva, Claudio Gleidiston Lima; Neto, Modesto Leite Rolim","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112945","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-27","",524,""
"Generalized anxiety disorder, depressive symptoms and sleep quality during COVID-19 outbreak in China: a web-based cross-sectional survey","China has been severely affected by Coronavirus Disease 2019(COVID-19) since December, 2019. We aimed to assess the mental health burden of Chinese public during the outbreak, and to explore the potential influence factors. Using a web-based cross-sectional survey, we collected data from 7,236 self-selected volunteers assessed with demographic information, COVID-19 related knowledge, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), depressive symptoms, and sleep quality. The overall prevalence of GAD, depressive symptoms, and sleep quality of the public were 35.1%, 20.1%, and 18.2%, respectively. Young people reported a significantly higher prevalence of GAD and depressive symptoms than older people. Compared with other occupational group, healthcare workers were more likely to have poor sleep quality. Multivariate logistic regression showed that age (< 35 years) and time spent focusing on the COVID-19 (= 3 hours per day) were associated with GAD, and healthcare workers were at high risk for poor sleep quality. Our study identified a major mental health burden of the public during the COVID-19 outbreak. Young people, people spending too much time thinking about the outbreak, and healthcare workers were at high risk of mental illness. Continuous surveillance of the psychological consequences for outbreaks should become routine as part of preparedness efforts worldwide.","Huang, Yeen; Zhao, Ning","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112954","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-27","",525,""
"Traumatic stress in the age of COVID-19: A call to close critical gaps and adapt to new realities","THE ISSUE: Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) is transforming every aspect of our lives. Identified in late 2019, COVID-19 quickly became characterized as a global pandemic by March of 2020. Given the rapid acceleration of transmission, and the lack of preparedness to prevent and treat this virus, the negative impacts of COVID-19 are rippling through every facet of society. Although large numbers of people throughout the world will show resilience to the profound loss, stress, and fear associated with COVID-19, the virus will likely exacerbate existing mental health disorders and contribute to the onset of new stress-related disorders for many. RECOMMENDATIONS: The field of traumatic stress should address the serious needs that will emerge now and well into the future. However, we propose that these efforts may be limited, in part, by ongoing gaps that exist within our research and clinical care. In particular, we suggest that COVID-19 requires us to prioritize and mobilize as a research and clinical community around several key areas: (a) diagnostics, (b) prevention, (c) public outreach and communication, (d) working with medical staff and mainstreaming into nonmental health services, and (e) COVID-19-specific trauma research. As members of our community begin to rapidly develop and test interventions for COVID-19-related distress, we hope that those in positions of leadership in the field of traumatic stress consider limits of our current approaches, and invest the intellectual and financial resources urgently needed in order to innovate, forge partnerships, and develop the technologies to support those in greatest need.

"Impact Of Sars-Cov-2 And Its Reverberation In Global Higher Education And Mental Health","Background : According to UNESCO's monitoring, more than 160 countries implemented nationwide closures, which impacted over 87% of the world's student population. Several other countries implemented localized school closures; should these closures become nationwide, millions of additional learners will experience education disruption. Universities from around the world have been uncertain about how long the coronavirus crisis will last and how it might affect the mental health of students and faculty. The psychological impact has been a critical disruptor, creating anxiety and uncertainty. Method : The data were cross-checked with information from the main international newspapers. Results : By discussing online and distance education, the coronavirus opens an important and urgent issue that affects mental health – these are virtually unexplored topics, and their results have not been validated yet. Online education is not limited to distance education, as it regards a grouping of learning/teaching procedures completed in cyberspace. Blended learning was, thus, introduced as a tool in personalized learning to adjust to new realities. These are unprecedented circumstances, and we understand they create stress, favoring anguish and a fierce search for new knowledge acquisition. Conclusions : Current research highlights that anxiety and depression, exacerbated by uncertainties and intensification of the information flow, will grow extensively. Negative physiological consequences of stress will manifest. For instance, loneliness, which will increase under these circumstances, seems to have a negative impact on education and, therefore, on psychological pain and suffering.","Araújo, Francisco Jonathan de Oliveira; de Lima, Ligia Samara Abrantes; Cidade, Pedro Ivo Martins; Nobre, Camila Bezerra; Neto, Modesto Leite Rolim","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112977","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-27","",529,""

The virus is prone to nervous and anxious psychological reactions. In the objective environment of complex and densely populated hospitals, it is a high-risk area for virus-transmitted infections and children generally have lower immunity who are more likely to develop infections. The results showed that the mental health problems of parents of hospitalized children during the epidemic were more serious, and the anxiety and depression were more obvious.","Yuan, Rong; Xu, Qian-hui; Xia, Cui-cui; Lou, Chun-yan; Xie, Zhen; Ge, Qian-min; Shao, Yi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112953","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-27","",534,""

"COVID-19 and Union Prevention","One month ago, few people could have foreseen the scope and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time of this writing for the current issue of Management Report, the United States has the most confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the world, the death toll is climbing, and experts say the situation will get worse before it gets better. Commerce in large areas of the country, including California and the Northeast, has largely shut down. The U.S. secretary of the treasury recently suggested that the U.S. unemployment rate could reach as high as 20 percent. Some economists have said it could go as high as during the economic devastation of the Great Depression, when the unemployment rate peaked at nearly 25 percent in 1933. Other economists have said it may reach 30 percent. It has been predicted that 37 million jobs may be the subject of temporary layoffs during this crisis, and 10 million may be lost permanently.","Wich, Scott","https://doi.org/10.1002/mare.30595","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-27","",536,""
"Coronavirus Epidemic and Geriatric Mental Healthcare in China: How a Coordinated Response by Professional Organizations Helped Older Adults During an Unprecedented Crisis","During these unprecedented times, Chinese professional organizations brought together geriatric mental healthcare teams of diverse disciplines and coordinated psychosocial support for older adults and their caregivers affected by the coronavirus epidemic. Learning lessons from China may empower the world to address the mental health needs of older people in a timely manner during the COVID-19 pandemic and emergency crisis. Why Old Adults Became More Vulnerable In the Chinese example there was a convergence of many factors that led to the development of mental health and behavioral problems. First, older adults had low awareness and limited access to accurate information and facts about the COVID-19 outbreak. This resulted in either excessive worries or in obliviousness to the warnings. Second, older adults attended family gatherings during the Chinese New Year. Such types of social activities increased their risk of being exposed to virus transmission which then resulted in quarantine and isolation in case of suspected or confirmed cases of the virus. Third, the strict security measures in the community prevented outdoor social activities, such as square dancing, park exercises, and parties. Fourth, the extended lock-down rules in nursing homes blocked face-to-face communications between older adults and their families (Ministry of Civil Affairs of China, 2020). Last, but not least, some older adults who lived alone or did not have close relatives lost their domestic helpers who were prohibited from travelling, or were in quarantine themselves, upon returning from lockdown areas.","Wang, Huali; Li, Tao; Gauthier, Serge; Yu, Enyan; Tang, Yanqing; Barbarino, Paola; Yu, Xin","https://doi.org/10.1017/S1041610220000551","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-27","",537,""
"A Longitudinal Study on the Mental Health of General Population during the COVID-19 Epidemic in China","In addition to being a public physical health emergency, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) affected global mental health, as evidenced by panic-buying worldwide as cases soared. Little is known about changes in levels of psychological impact, stress, anxiety and depression during this pandemic. This longitudinal study surveyed the general population twice - during the initial outbreak, and the epidemic's peak four weeks later, surveying demographics, symptoms, knowledge, concerns, and precautionary measures against COVID-19. There were 1738 respondents from 190 Chinese cities (1210 first-survey respondents, 861 second-survey respondents; 333 respondents participated in both). Psychological impact and mental health status were assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), respectively. IES-R measures PTSD symptoms in survivorship after an event. DASS -21 is based on tripartite model of psychopathology that comprise a general distress construct with distinct characteristics. This study found that there was a statistically significant longitudinal reduction in mean IES-R scores (from 32.98 to 30.76, p<0.01) after 4 weeks. Nevertheless, the mean IES-R score of the first- and second-survey respondents were above the cut-off scores (>24) for PTSD symptoms, suggesting that the reduction in scores was not clinically significant. During the initial evaluation, moderate-to-severe stress, anxiety and depression were noted in 8.1%, 28.8% and 16.5%, respectively and there were no significant longitudinal changes in stress, anxiety and depression levels (p>0.05). Protective factors included high level of confidence in doctors, perceived survival likelihood and low risk of contracting COVID-19, satisfaction with health information, personal precautionary measures. As countries around the world brace for an escalation in cases, Governments should focus on effective methods of disseminating unbiased COVID-19 knowledge, teaching correct containment methods, ensuring availability of essential services/commodities, and providing sufficient financial support.","Wang, Cuiyan; Pan, Riyu; Wan, Xiaoyang; Tan, Yilin; Xu, Linkang; McIntyre, Roger S.; Choo, Faith N.; Tran, Bach; Ho, Roger; Sharma, Vijay K.; Ho, Cyrus","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.028","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-27","",538,""
"COVID-19: Hygiene and Public Health to the front","Public Health professionals and academics have been on the frontline of Italian history during the COVID-19 response like they never did before. Ancient professors of Hygiene such as Celli, Pagliani, Sclavo, Petragnani, Seppilli and Giovanardi flanked politicians in other critical moments. They helped them to manage healthcare reforms, earthquakes response, Seveso Dioxin disaster, cholera and poliomielitis epidemics and other health threats. The ongoing COVID-19 epidemic has highlighted the paramount importance of the practical application of basic concepts of public health, which were considered so far became obsolete, such as personal hygiene, quarantine, individual protective devices or basic epidemiological measures. Hygiene and Public Health used to have a targeted audience in professionals and lecturers. Nowadays, these topics are critical and of concern of a much larger audience. Public Health women and men are now asked to act in task forces, media broadcasts, webinars and consulting activities. In phase 2 of this epidemic - which is about to begin when this volume is to be published - the role of Public Health professionals could become even more relevant. However, this unexpected season must be managed with seriousness and intelligence, capitalizing it also for the future. If our Post-Graduate Schools of Public Health (""Igiene e Medicina Preventiva""), our scientific associations, our academic lecturers and our officers do not prove to be up to the situation, a dull future for the discipline might very well be. On the contrary, if as we all hope, we will be able to ride the wave of a dramatic health crisis, transforming it into a relevant scientific and professional opportunity, then we will be able to build on the post-COVID-19 a cutting-edge, a more attractive, relevant and modern discipline. This Supplement of Acta Biomedica, planned before the onset of the epidemic emergency in Italy, but already successful in presenting two papers on COVID-19, is further proof of how current and lively our discipline is.","Signorelli, Carlo; Fara, Gaetano Maria","https://doi.org/10.23750/abm.v91i3-S.9507","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-27","",539,""

The money, which an N.C.

The LME/MCOs manage care for beneficiaries receiving mental health, developmental disabilities and substance abuse services who are on Medicaid, uninsured or underinsured. The letter also gave the LME/MCOs authority to use up to 15% of risk reserves to support contracted providers, but with a significant qualifier. The agencies, the DHHS said, would be able to use their reserves to support providers that are “maintaining consumers in their existing residential placements, utilizing telehealth capabilities to the maximum extent possible, providing services that keep consumers from needing access to emergency departments and inpatient services, and otherwise making efforts to deliver high-quality services during this crisis.” The department's caveat that local providers make every effort to keep their clients out of hospitals is part of a concerted campaign to maintain as much bed space and equipment as possible as the number of COVID-19 cases rises.","","https://www.doi.org/10.1002/mhw.32310","20200403",NA,"PMC","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-27","",582,""

METHODS: Using a general questionnaire, a self-designed new coronavirus pneumonia knowledge and cognitive behavior questionnaire, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), we conducted an internet-based questionnaire survey of 3881 college students in Guangdong Province. A multinomial-logistic regression model was used to analyze the collected data. RESULTS: The survey showed that 69.47% of the college students had a high level of awareness of COVID-19; the overall incidence of anxiety was 26.60%, and the incidences of mild, moderate and severe anxiety were 23.19%, 2.71%, and 0.70%, respectively.

"Conduites addictives: faits cliniques*","Résumé Malgré les fréquentes comorbidités psychiatriques, le trouble de l’usage de substance doit être appréhendé comme une pathologie autonome par ses déterminants, sa sémiologie et ses modalités évolutives spontanées ou sous traitement. De multiples produits de synthèse sont désormais accessibles via internet : associé à la créativité des chimistes cela a participé à l'émergence de pratiques inédites allant du chemsex au purple drank. Les conduites addictives résultent d’un ensemble de facteurs individuels (vulnérabilités biologique et psychique) et contextuels (disponibilité et banalisation du toxique dans l’environnement). Les pathologies mentales autres sont des facteurs de vulnérabilité à la pathologie addictive, tout comme les conduites addictives peuvent révéler une pathologie émotionnelle ou psychotique. Le médecin se doit d’entendre l’impuissance du malade face au besoin irrépressible de consommer (craving) et proposer une thérapeutique qui peut être chimique (y compris traitement de substitution) et psychologique. Dans la majorité des cas un accompagnement social s’impose pour corriger les effets désocialisants du trouble de l’usage de substances ou des comportements addictifs. Abstract Despite the frequency of psychiatric comorbidities, substance use disorder must be understood as an autonomous pathology due to its own determinants, semiology and possibilities of evolution, either spontaneous or under treatment. The ease of access to multiple synthetic products via the Internet combined with the creativity of chemists are contributing to the emergence of novel practices ranging from chemsex to purple drank. Addictive behaviours result from a combination of individual factors (biological and psychological vulnerability) and contextual factors (availability and triviality of the toxicant in the environment). Other mental disorders are factors of vulnerability to addictive pathology as well as the addictive behaviours can reveal an emotional or psychotic pathology. The physician needs to hear the patient powerlessness hidden behind the craving and propose a therapy that may be chemical (including substitution treatment) and psychological. Most of the time, social support is necessary to correct the desocializing effects of substance use disorder or addictive behaviours.","Lucet, C.; Olié, J.P.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.banm.2020.04.005","20200415",NA,"Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-27","",585,""
"Ensuring mental health care during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in France: a narrative review","Abstract Objective: The lack of resources and coordination to face the coronavirus epidemic raises concerns for the health of patients with mental disorders in a country where we still have memories of the dramatic experience of famine in psychiatric hospitals during the Second World War. This article aims to propose guidance to ensure mental health care during the SARS-CoV epidemic in France. Methods: The authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature and in local initiatives in France. Results: We identified four types of major vulnerabilities among patients with mental disorders during this pandemic: 1) medical comorbidities that are more frequently found among patients with mental disorders (cardiovascular and pulmonary pathologies, diabetes, obesity, etc.) which are risk factors for severe covid-19 infection; 2) age (the elderly form the population most vulnerable to the coronavirus); 3) cognitive and behavioural disorders, which can hamper compliance with confinement and hygiene measures and finally and 4) psychosocial vulnerability as a result of stigmatization and/or socio-economic difficulties. Furthermore, the mental health healthcare system is more vulnerable than other healthcare systems. Current government plans are poorly suited to psychiatric establishments in a context of major shortages of organizational, material and human resources. In addition, a certain number of structural aspects make the psychiatric institution particularly vulnerable: many beds have been closed, wards have high densities of patients, mental health community facilities are closed, and medical teams are understaffed and poorly trained to face infectious diseases. There are also major issues when referring patients with acute mental disorders to intensive care units. To maintain the continuity of psychiatric care in this pandemic situation, several directions can be considered, in particular with the creation of ""COVID+ units"". These units are under the dual supervision of a psychiatrist and an internist / infectious disease specialist; all new entrants are placed in quarantine for 14 days; the nursing staff receives specific training, daily medical check-ups and close psychological support. Family visits are prohibited and replaced by videoconference. At the end of hospitalization, in particular for the population of patients in compulsory ambulatory care situations, specific case-management are organized with the possibility of home visits, in order to support patients when they get back home and to help them cope with the experience of confinement, which is liable to induce recurrences of mental disorders. The total or partial closure of community mental health facilities is particularly disturbing for patients, but a regular follow-up is possible with telemedicine and should include the monitoring of suicide risk and psycho-education strategies; developing support platforms could also be very helpful in this context. Private practice psychiatrists also have a crucial role of information towards their patients on confinement and barrier measures, and also on measures to prevent the psychological risks inherent in confinement: maintenance of regular sleep r, physical exercise, social interactions, stress management and coping strategies, prevention of addictions, etc. They should also be trained to prevent, detect and treat early warning symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, because their prevalence was high in the regions of China most affected by the pandemic. Discussion: French mental healthcare is now facing a great and urgent need for reorganization and must also prepare in the coming days and weeks to face an epidemic of emotional disorders due to the confinement of the general population.","Chevance, A; Gourion, D; Hoertel, N; Llorca, P-M; Thomas, P; Bocher, R; Moro, M-R; Laprévote, V; Benyamina, A; Fossati, P; Masson, M; Leaune, E; Leboyer, M; Gaillard, R","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.005","20200422",NA,"Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-27","",586,""
"Conséquences psychopathologiques du confinement","Abstract The psychological effects of isolation have already been described in the literature (polar expeditions, submarines, prison). Nevertheless, the scale of confinement implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented. In addition to reviewing the published studies, we need to anticipate the psychological problems that could arise during or at a distance from confinement. We have gone beyond the COVID-19 literature in order to examine the implications of the known consequences of confinement, like boredom, social isolation, stress, or sleep deprivation. Anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, suicidal or addictive behaviours, domestic violence are described effects of confinement, but the mechanisms of emergence of these disorders and their interrelationships remain to be studied. For example, what are the mechanisms of emergence of post-traumatic stress disorders in the context of confinement? We also remind the reader of points of vigilance to be kept in mind with regard to eating disorders and hallucinations. Hallucinations are curiously ignored in the literature on confinement, whereas a vast literature links social isolation and hallucinations. As with domestic violence, we need to look for these symptoms in order to enable management. Due to the broad psychopathological consequences, we have to look for these various symptoms to manage them. We quickly summarize the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches already in place, such as telemedicine, which is undergoing rapid development during the COVID-19 crisis.","Mengin, Amaury; Alle, Mélissa; Rolling, Julie; Ligier, Fabienne; Schroder, Carmen; Lalanne, Laurence; Berna, Fabrice; Jardri, Renaud; Vaiva, Guillaume; Geoffroy, Pierre A; Brunault, Paul; Thibaut, Florence; Chevance, Astrid; Giersch, Anne","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.007","20200422",NA,"Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-27","",587,""
"Les professionnels de santé face à la pandémie de la maladie à coronavirus (COVID-19): quels risques pour leur santé mentale?","RÉSUMÉ Objectifs: La pandémie de la maladie à coronavirus (COVID-19) a provoqué une crise sanitaire majeure et mis en quarantaine la moitié de la population planétaire. En France, elle a provoqué une réorganisation en urgence de l’offre de soins mobilisant les soignants dans un climat d’incertitude. L'objectif du présent article est de faire le point sur les risques associés à l’exposition des soignants au COVID-19 pour leur santé mentale. Méthodes: Les auteurs ont conduit une revue de la littérature internationale tenant compte des données des précédentes épidémies (SARS-CoV-1, H1N1) et des données plus récentes concernant le COVID-19. Résultats: Les caractéristiques de cette pandémie (rapidité de diffusion, connaissances incertaines, sévérité, morts de soignants) ont installé un climat anxiogène. Des facteurs organisationnels peuvent être source de stress : déficit d’équipement de protection individuel, réaffectation de postes, manque de communication, manque de matériels de soins, bouleversement de la vie quotidienne familiale et sociale. D’autres facteurs de risque sont identifiés comme l’absence de soutien, la crainte de contaminer un proche, l’isolement ou la stigmatisation sociale, le haut niveau de stress au travail, ou les patterns d’attachement insécure. Les soignants ont ainsi un risque augmenté d’anxiété, de dépression, d’épuisement, d’addiction et de trouble de stress post-traumatique. Conclusions: Cette crise sanitaire devrait nous aider à mieux comprendre la vulnérabilité des soignants à la souffrance psychologique afin de renforcer les stratégies de prévention primaire et la formation aux enjeux psychologiques des soins, de la relation, et de la gestion des situations de crises sanitaires. ABSTRACT Objectives: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused major sanitary crisis worldwide. Half of the world has been placed in quarantine. In France, this large-scale health crisis urgently triggered the restructuring and reorganization of health service delivery to support emergency services, medical intensive care units and continuing care units. Health professionals mobilized all their resources to provide emergency aid in a general climate of uncertainty. Concerns about the mental health, psychological adjustment, and recovery of health care workers treating and caring for patients with COVID-19 are now arising. The goal of the present article is to provide an up-to-date information on potential mental health risks associated with exposure of health professionals to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature considering previous epidemics of 2003 (SARS-CoV-1) and 2009 (H1N1) with the more recent data about the COVID-19 pandemic. We highlighted most relevant data concerning the disease characteristics, the organizational factors and personal factors that may contribute to developing psychological distress and other mental health symptoms. Results: The disease characteristics of the current COVID-19 pandemic provoked a generalized climate of wariness and uncertainty, particularly among health professionals, due to a range of causes such as the rapid spread of COVID-19, the severity of symptoms it can cause in a segment of infected individuals, the lack of knowledge of the disease, and deaths among health professionals. Stress may also be caused by organizational factors, such as depletion of personal protection equipment, concern about not being able to provide competent care if deployed to new area, concern about rapidly changing information, lack of access to up-to-date information and communication, lack of specific drugs, the shortage of ventilators and intensive care unit beds necessary to care for the surge of critically ill patients, and significant change in their daily social and family life. Further risk factors have been identified, including feelings of being inadequately supported, concerns about health of self, fear of taking home infection to family members or others, and not having rapid access to testing through occupational health if needed, being isolated, feelings of uncertainty and social stigmatization, overwhelming workload, or insecure attachment. Additionally, we discussed positive social and organizational factors that contribute to enhance resilience in the face of the pandemic. There is a consensus in all the relevant literature that health care professionals are at an increased risk of high levels of stress, anxiety, depression, burnout, addiction and post-traumatic stress disorder, which could have long-term psychological implications. Conclusions: In the long run, this tragic health crisis should significantly enhance our understanding of the mental health risk factors among the health care professionals facing the COVID-19 pandemic. Reporting information such as this is essential to plan future prevention strategies. Protecting health care professionals is indeed an important component of public health measures to address large-scale health crisis. Thus, interventions to promote mental well-being in health care professionals exposed to COVID-19 need to be immediately implemented, and to strengthen prevention and response strategies by training health care professionals on mental help and crisis management.","El-Hage, Wissam; Hingray, Coraline; Lemogne, Cédric; Yrondi, Antoine; Brunault, Paul; Bienvenu, Thomas; Etain, Bruno; Paquet, Claire; Gohier, Bénédicte; Bennabi, Djamila; Birmes, Philippe; Sauvaget, Anne; Fakra, Eric; Prieto, Nathalie; Bulteau, Samuel; Vidailhet, Pierre; Jollant, Fabrice; Camus, Vincent; Leboyer, Marion; Krebs, Marie-Odile; Aouizerate, Bruno","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.008","20200422",NA,"Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-27","",588,""

"Emergency mental health legislation in response to the Covid-19 (Coronavirus) pandemic in Ireland: Urgency, necessity and proportionality","Abstract Many countries have enacted, or are in the process of enacting, emergency mental health legislation in response to the global pandemic of Covid-19 (coronavirus). In Ireland, the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act, 2020 amends the Mental Health Act 2001 to permit the Mental Health Commission to request an independent psychiatric report about an involuntary patient from any consultant psychiatrist who is not treating the patient (and not just those on its designated panel). This independent examination may occur ‘in person’, ‘by other appropriate means’, or even, ‘due to the exigencies of the public health emergency’, not occur at all, once this is explained in the resultant report. The 2020 Act acknowledges that ‘the exigencies of the public health emergency’ might hamper the independent psychiatrist's work and requires a written report from the patient's treating psychiatrist ‘no earlier than the day before’ the tribunal, in lieu of the psychiatrist physically attending a tribunal hearing, although, if possible, they will attend (i.e. phone in to) a tribunal held by conference call. The 2020 Act permits the Mental Health Commission to, if necessary, appoint tribunals ‘consisting of one member who shall be a practising barrister or solicitor’. Such a tribunal shall, if possible, consult with a consultant psychiatrist if the reports from the independent psychiatrist and treating psychiatrist conflict or if it is otherwise ‘necessary in the interest of the patient’. A tribunal can extend an involuntary order by a second period of 14 days ‘of its own motion if the tribunal, having due regard to the interest of the patient, is satisfied that it is necessary’. Tribunals for current involuntary patients will be prioritised over retrospective tribunals for discharged patients; a tribunal can direct a witness to provide ‘a written statement’ rather than attending; and the patient can make written representation to the tribunal instead of physically attending a tribunal hearing, although they may attend (i.e. phone in to) a tribunal held by conference call. Psycho-surgery for involuntary patients is banned. While it is clear that revisions are urgent and necessary in light of Covid-19, the proportionality of these changes will depend on how, and the extent to which, they are used in practice. With good communication, efficient team-working and close adherence to professional codes of practice and ethics, it is hoped that these amendments will result in a review system that is as reasonable, robust and reassuring as the current, highly unusual circumstances permit.","Kelly, Brendan D.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijlp.2020.101564","20200422",NA,"Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-27","",590,""

"Generalized anxiety disorder, depressive symptoms and sleep quality during COVID-19 outbreak in China: a web-based cross-sectional survey","Abstract China has been severely affected by Coronavirus Disease 2019(COVID-19) since December, 2019. We aimed to assess the mental health burden of Chinese public during the outbreak, and to explore the potential influence factors. Using a web-based cross-sectional survey, we collected data from 7,236 self-selected volunteers assessed with demographic information, COVID-19 related knowledge, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), depressive symptoms, and sleep quality. The overall prevalence of GAD, depressive symptoms, and sleep quality of the public were 35.1%, 20.1%, and 18.2%, respectively. Young people reported a significantly higher prevalence of GAD and depressive symptoms than older people. Compared with other occupational group, healthcare workers were more likely to have poor sleep quality. Multivariate logistic regression showed that age (< 35 years) and time spent focusing on the COVID-19 (= 3 hours per day) were associated with GAD, and healthcare workers were at high risk for poor sleep quality. Our study identified a major mental health burden of the public during the COVID-19 outbreak. Young people, people spending too much time thinking about the outbreak, and healthcare workers were at high risk of mental illness. Continuous surveillance of the psychological consequences for outbreaks should become routine as part of preparedness efforts worldwide.","Huang, Yeen; Zhao, Ning","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112954","20200412",NA,"Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-27","",593,""
"When basic supplies are missing, what to do? Specific demands of the local street population in times of coronavirus – a concern of social psychiatry","Abstract Background Homeless experts and some federal housing officials are sounding the alarm that the patchwork of government efforts to address the coronavirus outbreak risks leaving out one group of acutely vulnerable people: the homeless. In terms of isolation, it is too unclear what that looks like if you normally sleep on the streets. In this tough moment, when people should be turned away, not only it feels inhumane, but it is also a big public health risk, because where are they going to go? Method The studies were identified using large-sized newspapers with international circulation Results With more cities suspecting community transmission of the novel coronavirus, people who sleep in shelters or hunker down outside already have a lower life expectancy and often have underlying health conditions that put them at greater risk if they develop COVID-19 (Global News, 2020). These people face lack of sleep, malnutrition, and “extreme stress levels just to meet their daily needs”, all of which weakens the immune system. Along with mental illness or substance abuse disorders, they are “incredibly vulnerable to this virus”. Conclusions Health organizations are well aware of the risks involved in mental health. A large population of homeless people experience their pain and psychological distress intermittently. For low-income patients, the various borderline situations related to health/illness involve growing expectations regarding the basic needs. This is a serious concern when linked to the pandemic.","Neto, Modesto Leite Rolim; de Souza, Ricardo Inácio; Quezado, Rosa Magda Martins; Mendonça, Elayne Cristina Santos; de Araújo, Tallys Iury; Luz, Dayse Christina Rodrigues Pereira; de Santana, Willma José; Sampaio, Juliana Ribeiro Francelino; Carvalho, Poliana Moreira de Medeiros; Arrais, Tereza Maria Siqueira Nascimento; Landim, José Marcondes Macedo; da Silva, Claúdio Gleideston Lima","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112939","20200630",NA,"Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-27","",594,""

"PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS: THEIR POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO COVID-19","Abstract Background : Insufficient housing quality is associated with stress and mental health impacts. Crowding, pollution, noise, inadequate lighting, lack of access to green spaces, and other environmental factors associated with slums can exacerbate mental health disorders, including depression, anxiety, violence, and other forms of social dysfunction. Method : The studies were identified using large-sized newspapers with international circulation. Results : Experts say that people who sleep in shelters or on the streets already have lower life expectancy, suffer from addiction, and have underlying health conditions that put them at greater risk should they develop the virus. There are just so many competing and unmet needs, which makes it much harder for homeless to contend with all of this. If exposed, people experiencing homelessness might be more susceptible to illness or death due to the prevalence of underlying physical and mental medical conditions and a lack of reliable and affordable health care. Nevertheless, without an urgent solution, people experiencing homelessness will remain in limbo. Conclusions : Many people living on the streets already have a diminished health condition, higher rates of chronic illnesses or compromised immune systems, all of which are risk factors for developing a more serious manifestation of the coronavirus infection. Those suffering from mental illness may have difficulty in recognizing and responding to the threat of infection. Homeless people have less access to health care providers who could otherwise order diagnostic testing and, if confirmed, isolate them from others in coordination with local health departments.","Lima, Nádia Nara Rolim; de Souza, Ricardo Inácio; Feitosa, Pedro Walisson Gomes; Moreira, Jorge Lucas de Sousa; da Silva, Claudio Gleidiston Lima; Neto, Modesto Leite Rolim","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112945","20200411",NA,"Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-27","",596,""
"When health professionals look death in the eye: the mental health of professionals who deal daily with the 2019 coronavirus outbreak","Abstract Background : The fact that COVID-19 is transmissible from human to human and associated with high morbidity and potentially fatality can intensify the perception of personal danger. In addition, the foreseeable shortage of supplies and an increasing flow of suspected and real cases of COVID-19 contribute to the pressures and concerns of health professionals. Method : The studies were identified in well-known international journals found in two electronic databases: Scopus and Embase. The data were cross-checked with information from the main international newspapers. Results : Work-related stress is a potential cause of concern for health professionals. It has been associated with anxiety including multiple clinical activities, depression in the face of the coexistence of countless deaths, long work shifts with the most diverse unknowns and demands in the treatment with patients with COVID-19. Therefore, it is an important indicator of psychic exhaustion. Conclusions : As coronavirus cases increase and deaths surge in Italy, new figures show an ""enormous"" level of contagion among the country's medical personnel. At least 2,629 health workers have been infected with coronavirus since the outbreak onset in February, representing 8.3% of total cases. The percentage of infected health workers has almost doubled the number registered in China throughout the epidemic. Intensive care unit physicians are on their stress limit, especially when dealing with older patients and with death prospects. Doctors, not a relative, are inevitably the last people a dying COVID-19 patient will see.","Neto, Modesto Leite Rolim; Almeida, Hiure Gomes; Esmeraldo, Joana D'arc; Nobre, Camila Bezerra; Pinheiro, Woneska Rodrigues; de Oliveira, Cícera Rejane Tavares; Sousa, Itamara da Costa; Lima, Onélia Maria Moreira Leite; Lima, Nádia Nara Rolim; Moreira, Marcial Moreno; Lima, Carlos Kennedy Tavares; Júnior, Jucier Gonçalves; da Silva, Claúdio Gleideston Lima","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112972","20200413",NA,"Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-27","",597,""
"Impact Of Sars-Cov-2 And Its Reverberation In Global Higher Education And Mental Health","Abstract Background : According to UNESCO's monitoring, more than 160 countries implemented nationwide closures, which impacted over 87% of the world's student population. Several other countries implemented localized school closures; should these closures become nationwide, millions of additional learners will experience education disruption. Universities from around the world have been uncertain about how long the coronavirus crisis will last and how it might affect the mental health of students and faculty. The psychological impact has been a critical disruptor, creating anxiety and uncertainty. Method : The data were cross-checked with information from the main international newspapers. Results : By discussing online and distance education, the coronavirus opens an important and urgent issue that affects mental health – these are virtually unexplored topics, and their results have not been validated yet. Online education is not limited to distance education, as it regards a grouping of learning/teaching procedures completed in cyberspace. Blended learning was, thus, introduced as a tool in personalized learning to adjust to new realities. These are unprecedented circumstances, and we understand they create stress, favoring anguish and a fierce search for new knowledge acquisition. Conclusions : Current research highlights that anxiety and depression, exacerbated by uncertainties and intensification of the information flow, will grow extensively. Negative physiological consequences of stress will manifest. For instance, loneliness, which will increase under these circumstances, seems to have a negative impact on education and, therefore, on psychological pain and suffering.","Araújo, Francisco Jonathan de Oliveira; de Lima, Ligia Samara Abrantes; Cidade, Pedro Ivo Martins; Nobre, Camila Bezerra; Neto, Modesto Leite Rolim","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112977","20200412",NA,"Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-27","",598,""

"Are we facing a crashing wave of neuropsychiatric sequelae of COVID-19? Neuropsychiatric symptoms and potential immunologic mechanisms","Abstract The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic is a significant psychological stressor in addition to its tremendous impact on every facet of individuals’ lives and organizations in virtually all social and economic sectors worldwide. Fear of illness and uncertainty about the future precipitate anxiety- and stress-related disorders, and several groups have rightfully called for the creation and dissemination of robust mental health screening and treatment programs for the general public and front-line healthcare workers. However, in addition to pandemic-associated psychological distress, the direct effects of the virus itself (several acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2), and the subsequent host immunologic response, on the human central nervous system (CNS) and related outcomes are unknown. We discuss currently available evidence of COVID-19 related neuropsychiatric sequelae while drawing parallels to past viral pandemic-related outcomes. Past pandemics have demonstrated that diverse types of neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as encephalopathy, mood changes, psychosis, neuromuscular dysfunction, or demyelinating processes, may accompany acute viral infection, or may follow infection by weeks, months, or longer in recovered patients. The potential mechanisms are also discussed, including viral and immunological underpinnings. Therefore, prospective neuropsychiatric monitoring of individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 at various points in the life course, as well as their neuroimmune status, are needed to fully understand the long-term impact of COVID-19, and to establish a framework for integrating psychoneuroimmunology into epidemiologic studies of pandemics.","Troyer, Emily A.; Kohn, Jordan N.; Hong, Suzi","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.027","20200413",NA,"Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-27","",607,""
"A Longitudinal Study on the Mental Health of General Population during the COVID-19 Epidemic in China","Abstract In addition to being a public physical health emergency, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) affected global mental health, as evidenced by panic-buying worldwide as cases soared. Little is known about changes in levels of psychological impact, stress, anxiety and depression during this pandemic. This longitudinal study surveyed the general population twice - during the initial outbreak, and the epidemic's peak four weeks later, surveying demographics, symptoms, knowledge, concerns, and precautionary measures against COVID-19. There were 1738 respondents from 190 Chinese cities (1210 first-survey respondents, 861 second-survey respondents; 333 respondents participated in both). Psychological impact and mental health status were assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), respectively. IES-R measures PTSD symptoms in survivorship after an event. DASS -21 is based on tripartite model of psychopathology that comprise a general distress construct with distinct characteristics. This study found that there was a statistically significant longitudinal reduction in mean IES-R scores (from 32.98 to 30.76, p<0.01) after 4 weeks. Nevertheless, the mean IES-R score of the first- and second-survey respondents were above the cut-off scores (>24) for PTSD symptoms, suggesting that the reduction in scores was not clinically significant. During the initial evaluation, moderate-to-severe stress, anxiety and depression were noted in 8.1%, 28.8% and 16.5%, respectively and there were no significant longitudinal changes in stress, anxiety and depression levels (p>0.05). Protective factors included high level of confidence in doctors, perceived survival likelihood and low risk of contracting COVID-19, satisfaction with health information, personal precautionary measures. As countries around the world brace for an escalation in cases, Governments should focus on effective methods of disseminating unbiased COVID-19 knowledge, teaching correct containment methods, ensuring availability of essential services/commodities, and providing sufficient financial support.","Wang, Cuiyan; Pan, Riyu; Wan, Xiaoyang; Tan, Yilin; Xu, Linkang; McIntyre, Roger S.; Choo, Faith N.; Tran, Bach; Ho, Roger; Sharma, Vijay K.; Ho, Cyrus","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.028","20200413",NA,"Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-27","",608,""
"A Multinational, Multicentre Study on the Psychological Outcomes and Associated Physical Symptoms Amongst Healthcare Workers During COVID-19 Outbreak","Abstract Objective Since the declaration of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak as pandemic, there are reports on the increased prevalence of physical symptoms observed in the general population. We investigated the association between psychological outcomes and physical symptoms among healthcare workers. Methods Healthcare workers from 5 major hospitals, involved in the care for COVID-19 patients, in Singapore and India were invited to participate in a study by performing a self-administered questionnaire within the period of February 19 to April 17, 2020. Healthcare workers included doctors, nurses, allied healthcare workers, administrators, clerical staff and maintenance workers. This questionnaire collected information on demographics, medical history, symptom prevalence in the past month, Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) instrument. The prevalence of physical symptoms displayed by healthcare workers and the associations between physical symptoms and psychological outcomes of depression, anxiety, stress, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were evaluated. Results Out of the 906 healthcare workers who participated in the survey, 48 (5.3%) screened positive for moderate to very-severe depression, 79 (8.7%) for moderate to extremely-severe anxiety, 20 (2.2%) for moderate to extremely-severe stress, and 34 (3.8%) for moderate to severe levels of psychological distress. The commonest reported symptom was headache (32.3%), with a large number of participants (33.4%) reporting more than four symptoms. Participants who had experienced symptoms in the preceding month were more likely to be older, have pre-existing comorbidities and a positive screen for depression, anxiety, stress, and PTSD. After adjusting for age, gender and comorbidities, it was found that depression (OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.54-5.07, p=0.001), anxiety (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.36-3.48, p=0.001), stress (OR 3.06, 95% CI 1.27-7.41, p=0.13), and PTSD (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.12-4.35, p=0.023) remained significantly associated with the presence of physical symptoms experienced in the preceding month. Linear regression revealed that the presence of physical symptoms was associated with higher mean scores in the IES-R, DASS Anxiety, Stress and Depression subscales. Conclusions Our study demonstrates a significant association between the prevalence of physical symptoms and psychological outcomes among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 outbreak. We postulate that this association may be bi-directional, and that timely psychological interventions for healthcare workers with physical symptoms should be considered once an infection has been excluded.","Chew, Nicholas W.S.; Lee, Grace K.H.; Tan, Benjamin Y.Q.; Jing, Mingxue; Goh, Yihui; Ngiam, Nicholas J.H.; Yeo, Leonard L.L.; Ahmad, Aftab; Ahmed Khan, Faheem; Napolean Shanmugam, Ganesh; Sharma, Arvind K.; Komalkumar, R.N.; Meenakshi, P.V.; Shah, Kenam; Patel, Bhargesh; Chan, Bernard P.L.; Sunny, Sibi; Chandra, Bharatendu; Ong, Jonathan J.Y.; Paliwal, Prakash R.; Wong, Lily Y.H.; Sagayanathan, Renarebecca; Chen, Jin Tao; Ying Ng, Alison Ying; Teoh, Hock Luen; Tsivgoulis, Georgios; Ho, Cyrus S.; Ho, Roger C.; Sharma, Vijay K.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.049","20200421",NA,"Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-27","",609,""
"Affective temperament, attachment style, and the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak: an early report on the Italian general population","Abstract The outbreak of COVID-19 is severely affecting mental health worldwide, although individual response may vary. This study aims to investigate the psychological distress perceived by the Italian general population during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to analyze affective temperament and adult attachment styles as potential mediators. Through an online survey, we collected sociodemographic and lockdown-related information and evaluated distress, temperament, and attachment using the Kessler 10 Psychological Distress Scale (K10), the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego-Autoquestionnaire short version (TEMPS-A) and the Attachment Style Questionnaire (ASQ). In our sample (n=500), 62% of the individuals reported no likelihood of psychological distress, whereas 19.4% and 18.6% displayed mild and moderate-to-severe likelihood. Cyclothymic (OR: 1.24; p<0.001), depressive (OR: 1.52; p<0.001) and anxious (OR: 1.58; p=0.002) temperaments, and the ASQ “Need for approval” (OR: 1.08; p=0.01) were risk factors for moderate-to-severe psychological distress compared to no distress, while the ASQ “Confidence” (OR: 0.89; p=0.002) and “Discomfort with closeness” were protective (OR: 0.92; p=0.001). Cyclothymic (OR: 1.17; p=0.008) and depressive (OR: 1.32; p=0.003) temperaments resulted as risk factors in subjects with moderate-to-severe psychological distress compared to mild distress, while the ASQ “Confidence” (OR: 0.92; p=0.039) and “Discomfort with closeness” (OR: 0.94; p=0.023) were protective. Our data indicated that a relevant rate of individuals may have experienced psychological distress following the COVID-19 outbreak. Specific affective temperament and attachment features predict the extent of mental health burden. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first data available on the psychological impact of the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic on a sizeable sample of the Italian population. Moreover, our study is the first to investigate temperament and attachment characteristics in the psychological response to the ongoing pandemic. Our results provide further insight into developing targeted intervention strategies.","Moccia, Lorenzo; Janiri, Delfina; Pepe, Maria; Dattoli, Luigi; Molinaro, Marzia; De Martin, Valentina; Chieffo, Daniela; Janiri, Luigi; Fiorillo, Andrea; Sani, Gabriele; Di Nicola, Marco","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.048","20200420",NA,"Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-27","",610,""

"Ayurveda and COVID-19: where psychoneuroimmunology and the meaning response meet","Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has led to high levels of psychological distress in the general public, including symptoms of anxiety and depression. Such distress is associated with alterations in immune function, including an elevated risk of viral respiratory tract infections. In this light, the possible effects of Ayurveda, a traditional system of medicine promoted by the Indian government as an “immune booster”, are examined from the point of view of psychoneuroimmune mechanisms as well as the “meaning response” described by Moerman. It was found that many of the measures advocated in their guidelines could positively influence immunity either by direct effects on symptoms of depression or anxiety, or through their symbolic significance. Therefore, it is possible that such traditional practices could be beneficial both in terms of psychological quality of life, and in terms of moderating the risk of infection.","Rajkumar, Ravi Philip","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.056","20200422",NA,"Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-27","",613,""

In this case report, we present a case of an 81-year-old solitary woman who received one year of visiting care service with Korean medicine treatments in a public health setting. During the one year, her pain severity (measured using numeric rating scale) remained moderate after her initial decline and her depressive symptoms and cognitive function scales (Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form Korean and the Korean version of the Mini-Mental State Examination for Dementia Screening) remained almost unchanged; however, another cognitive function scale (Korean version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment) showed noticeable improvements.

"Safety signals for QT prolongation or Torsades de Pointes associated with azithromycin with or without chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine","Abstract Background Combinations of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin have been promoted as treatments for COVID-19 based on small, uncontrolled clinical trials that have not assessed potential risks. Risks of treatment include QT segment prolongation, Torsades de Pointes (TdP), and death. This comparative pharmacovigilance analysis evaluated the risk of these events. Methods Data from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) (>13 million total reports) were used. Queries extracted reports based on exposures of HCQ/chloroquine (CQ) alone, azithromycin alone, HCQ/CQ + azithromycin, amoxicillin alone, HCQ/CQ + amoxicillin alone. Amoxicillin served as a control. Events of interest included death and TdP/QT prolongation as well as accidents/injuries and depression as control events. Proportional Reporting Ratios (PRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated where a lower limit of the of 95% CI (Lower95CI) value of =2.0 is interpreted as a potential safety signal. Results Lower95CIs for HCQ/CQ alone showed no potential safety signals for TdP/QT prolongation, death, or any of the control events included. The PRRs and 95% CIs for TdP/QT prolongation was 1.43 (1.29–2.59) with HCQ/CQ use alone and 4.10 (3.80–4.42) for azithromycin alone. For the combined HCQ/CQ + azithromycin group, the PRR and 95% CI was 3.77 (1.80–7.87). For the control of amoxicillin, there were no safety signals when used alone or in combination with HCQ/CQ. Conclusions HCQ/CQ use was not associated with a safety signal in this analysis of FAERS data. However, azithromycin used alone was associated with TdP/QT prolongation events and should be used with caution.","Sarayani, Amir; Cicali, Brian; Henriksen, Carl H.; Brown, Joshua D.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.04.016","20200419",NA,"Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-27","",616,""

"COVID-19 and mental health: A review of the existing literature","Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic is a major health crisis affecting several nations, with over 720,000 cases and 33,000 confirmed deaths reported to date. Such widespread outbreaks are associated with adverse mental health consequences. Keeping this in mind, existing literature on the COVID-19 outbreak pertinent to mental health was retrieved via a literature search of the PubMed database. Published articles were classified according to their overall themes and summarized. Preliminary evidence suggests that symptoms of anxiety and depression (16–28%) and self-reported stress (8%) are common psychological reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic, and may be associated with disturbed sleep. A number of individual and structural variables moderate this risk. In planning services for such populations, both the needs of the concerned people and the necessary preventive guidelines must be taken into account. The available literature has emerged from only a few of the affected countries, and may not reflect the experience of persons living in other parts of the world. In conclusion, subsyndromal mental health problems are a common response to the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a need for more representative research from other affected countries, particularly in vulnerable populations.","Rajkumar, Ravi Philip","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102066","20200831",NA,"Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-27","",619,""

"Multidisciplinary research priorities for the COVID-19 pandemic: a call for action for mental health science","Summary The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is having a profound effect on all aspects of society, including mental health and physical health. We explore the psychological, social, and neuroscientific effects of COVID-19 and set out the immediate priorities and longer-term strategies for mental health science research. These priorities were informed by surveys of the public and an expert panel convened by the UK Academy of Medical Sciences and the mental health research charity, MQ: Transforming Mental Health, in the first weeks of the pandemic in the UK in March, 2020. We urge UK research funding agencies to work with researchers, people with lived experience, and others to establish a high level coordination group to ensure that these research priorities are addressed, and to allow new ones to be identified over time. The need to maintain high-quality research standards is imperative. International collaboration and a global perspective will be beneficial. An immediate priority is collecting high-quality data on the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic across the whole population and vulnerable groups, and on brain function, cognition, and mental health of patients with COVID-19. There is an urgent need for research to address how mental health consequences for vulnerable groups can be mitigated under pandemic conditions, and on the impact of repeated media consumption and health messaging around COVID-19. Discovery, evaluation, and refinement of mechanistically driven interventions to address the psychological, social, and neuroscientific aspects of the pandemic are required. Rising to this challenge will require integration across disciplines and sectors, and should be done together with people with lived experience. New funding will be required to meet these priorities, and it can be efficiently leveraged by the UK's world-leading infrastructure. This Position Paper provides a strategy that may be both adapted for, and integrated with, research efforts in other countries.","Holmes, Emily A; O'Connor, Rory C; Perry, V Hugh; Tracey, Irene; Wessely, Simon; Arseneault, Louise; Ballard, Clive; Christensen, Helen; Cohen Silver, Roxane; Everall, Ian; Ford, Tamsin; John, Ann; Kabir, Thomas; King, Kate; Madan, Ira; Michie, Susan; Przybylski, Andrew K; Shafran, Roz; Sweeney, Angela; Worthman, Carol M; Yardley, Lucy; Cowan, Katherine; Cope, Claire; Hotopf, Matthew; Bullmore, Ed","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/s2215-0366(20)30168-1","20200415",NA,"Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-27","",629,""

"Medically unexplained symptoms in the times of Covid-19 pandemic: a case-report","Abstract In early 2020, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) leading to a potentially fatal condition was discovered. Since then, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread worldwide becoming a pandemic. Beyond the risks strictly related to the infection, concerns have been expressed for the psychological impact that COVID-19 may have, especially on vulnerable individuals with pre-existing mental health conditions. Somatic symptom disorder (SSD) is characterized by a dysfunctional preoccupation with physical symptoms leading to excessive and unnecessary healthcare utilization. Despite being quite common, such condition remains underrecognized. We report a detailed clinical case of a 16 years old adolescent, who presented with a history suggestive of COVID-19 infection and associated psychological distress. Despite testing negative for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, his extreme and persisting health preoccupations required an inpatient admission to the Child and Adolescent Neuropsychiatric Unit. He responded rapidly to a low dose of antipsychotic and an antidepressant. Based on his medical history and current presentation, he received a diagnosis of SSD. When COVID-19-like symptoms occur, we highlight the importance of differentially diagnosing a possible exacerbation of a pre-existing SSD, triggered by fear of being infected. This may help preventing further burden to the healthcare system.","Colizzi, Marco; Bortoletto, Riccardo; Silvestri, Marta; Mondini, Federica; Puttini, Elena; Cainelli, Chiara; Gaudino, Rossella; Ruggeri, Mirella; Zoccante, Leonardo","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2020.100073","20200419",NA,"Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-27","",633,""

"Prevalence and predictors of PTSS during COVID-19 outbreak in China hardest-hit areas: Gender differences matter","Abstract The outbreak of COVID-19 in China in December 2019 has been identified as a pandemic and a health emergency of global concern. Our objective was to investigate the prevalence and predictors of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in China hardest-hit areas during COVID-19 outbreak, especially exploring the gender difference existing in PTSS. One month after the December 2019 COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan China, we surveyed PTSS and sleep qualities among 285 residents in Wuhan and surrounding cities using the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) and 4 items from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Hierarchical regression analysis and non-parametric test were used to analyze the data. Results indicated that the prevalence of PTSS in China hardest-hit areas a month after the COVID-19 outbreak was 7%. Women reported significant higher PTSS in the domains of re-experiencing, negative alterations in cognition or mood, and hyper-arousal. Participants with better sleep quality or less frequency of early awakenings reported lower PTSS.

Data source A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, by using the expressions: “community-acquired pneumonia” AND “child” AND “etiology” OR “diagnosis” OR “severity” OR “antibiotic”. All articles retrieved had the title and the abstract read, when the papers reporting the latest evidence on each subject were identified and downloaded for complete reading. Data synthesis In the era of largely implemented bacterial conjugate vaccines and widespread use of amplification nucleic acid techniques, respiratory viruses have been identified as the most frequent causative agents of community-acquired pneumonia in patients under 5 years. Hypoxemia (oxygen saturation = 96%) and increased work of breathing are signs most associated with community-acquired pneumonia. Wheezing detected on physical examination independently predicts viral infection and the negative predictive value (95% confidence interval) of normal chest X-ray and serum procalcitonin < 0.25 ng/dL was 92% (77-98%) and 93% (90-99%), respectively. Inability to drink/feed, vomiting everything, convulsions, lower chest indrawing, central cyanosis, lethargy, nasal flaring, grunting, head nodding, and oxygen saturation < 90% are predictors of death and can be used as indicators for hospitalization. Moderate/large pleural effusions and multilobar infiltrates are predictors of severe disease. Orally administered amoxicillin is the first line outpatient treatment, while ampicillin, aqueous penicillin G, or amoxicillin (initiated initially by intravenous route) are the first line options to treat inpatients. Conclusions Distinct aspects of childhood community-acquired pneumonia have changed during the last three decades. Resumo Objetivo Fornecer informações de ponta para o manejo de crianças menores de cinco anos com pneumonia adquirida na comunidade, com base nas evidências mais recentes publicadas na literatura. Fonte de dados Uma pesquisa abrangente foi feita no PubMed, com as expressões: “community-acquired pneumonia” + “child” + “etiology” ou “diagnosis” ou “severity” ou “antibiotic”. Todos os artigos encontrados tiveram o título e o resumo lidos e os artigos que relatavam as evidências mais recentes sobre cada assunto foram identificados e recuperados para leitura completa. Síntese dos dados Na era das vacinas bacterianas conjugadas amplamente usadas e do uso difundido de técnicas de amplificação de ácidos nucléicos, os vírus respiratórios foram identificados como os agentes causadores mais frequentes de pneumonia adquirida na comunidade em pacientes com menos de cinco anos. A hipoxemia (saturação de oxigênio = 96%) e o aumento do esforço respiratório são os sinais mais associados à pneumonia adquirida na comunidade. A sibilância detectada ao exame físico prediz de forma independente a infecção viral e o valor preditivo negativo (intervalo de confiança de 95%) da radiografia de tórax normal e a procalcitonina sérica < 0,25 ng/dL foi de 92% (77-98%) e 93% (90-99%), respectivamente. Incapacidade de beber e se alimentar, vomitar todo o alimento, convulsões, retração torácica subcostal, cianose central, letargia, aleteo nasal, estridor e saturação de oxigênio < 90% são preditores de óbito e podem ser usados como indicadores de hospitalização. Derrames pleurais moderados/grandes e infiltrados multilobulares são preditores de doença grave. A amoxicilina administrada por via oral é a opção de primeira linha para tratar pacientes ambulatoriais e a ampicilina ou penicilina cristalina G ou amoxicilina (administrada inicialmente por via intravenosa) são as opções de primeira linha para tratar pacientes hospitalizados. Conclusões Aspectos distintos da pneumonia adquirida na comunidade durante a infância mudaram durante as últimas três décadas.","Nascimento-Carvalho, Cristiana M.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpedp.2019.08.002","20200430",NA,"Elsevier","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-04-27","",636,""
