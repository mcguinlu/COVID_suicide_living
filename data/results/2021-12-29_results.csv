"How did the COVID-19 pandemic affect older adults? Investigation in terms of disability, state-trait anxiety and life satisfaction: Samsun, Turkey example","The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected the physical and mental health of individuals. The elderly are a special group that is affected by this condition. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on older adults in terms of disability, state-trait anxiety and life satisfaction. The population of this cross-sectional study consisted of individuals aged 65 and over who presented to a family health centre in Samsun a province of Turkey on the Black Sea coast (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 3950). The study data were collected with the following five forms: Personal Information Form, Quality of Life Questionnaire, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Brief Disability Questionnaire and Life Satisfaction Scale. In the analysis of the study data, descriptive statistics, Student's t-test, paired t-test, analysis of variance, Pearson correlation and multiple regression analysis were used. The mean age of the participants was 70.88Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.818Ã¢â‚¬â€°years. There was a significant difference between the participants' pre- and post-pandemic health status and quality of life levels. In the study, a significant relationship was determined between the scores obtained from the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Brief Disability Questionnaire and between the scores obtained from the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and the variables such as income and marital status (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). A significant result of the study is that the older adults' perceptions of health status and quality of life were adversely affected by the pandemic. Another significant result is that disability increased the level of anxiety. The other significant result of the study is that socioeconomic status was an important determinant of anxiety.","Ãƒâ€“zpÃ„Â±nar, BayÃƒÂ§elebi, Demir, YazÃ„Â±cÃ„Â±oÃ„Å¸lu","https://doi.org/10.1111/psyg.12801","20211228","COVID-19; disability; older adults; quality of life; satisfaction with life; state-trait anxiety","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-29","",24414,""
"Partner delivered relaxation massage to support mild antenatal anxiety; views of participants","Approximately one-fifth of pregnant women suffer from anxiety and/or depression. These mental health conditions are associated with increased infant and maternal morbidity. Relaxation massage has the potential to improve mental health and may provide a vaulable option for pregnant women. This paper reports on participants' experiences of partner delivered massage as a technique to manage mild antenatal anxiety. We conducted a feasibility study with 44 pregnant women who self-assessed as mildly anxious. The women were randomised into massage therapy (14 women/partner dyads) or to an active control group (13 women). 4-6 weeks after the birth of their baby, massage group participants were invited to be interviewed about their experiences; twelve women and four partners agreed. The qualitative data was analysed using reflective thematic analysis. Four themes emerged from the data; Supporting mental health, Connecting, Useful and adaptable and Making it happen. Partner delivered massage was an accessible and practical method to manage mild anxiety for pregnant women in this study. The massage program also provided useful skills for participants to apply in their lives after the birth of their child, which has the potential to continue to support maternal mental health as well as partner connection. Partner delivered massage offers low-cost, accessible option for pregnant women to manage their mild anxiety. These findings have particular relevance in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, where anecdotal reports indicate that antenatal stress is increasing and women may have limited access to healthcare services.","Hall, Lauche, Fogarty, Kloester, Carr, Munk","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.midw.2021.103229","20211228","Anxiety; Massage therapy; Midwifery; Pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-29","",24415,""
"Veterans Health Administration staff experiences with suicidal ideation screening and risk assessment in the context of COVID-19","Universal screening for suicidal ideation in primary care and mental health settings has become a key prevention tool in many healthcare systems, including the Veterans Healthcare Administration (VHA). In response to the coronavirus pandemic, healthcare providers faced a number of challenges, including how to quickly adapt screening practices. The objective of this analyses was to learn staff perspectives on how the pandemic impacted suicide risk screening in primary care and mental health settings. Forty semi-structured interviews were conducted with primary care and mental health staff between April-September 2020 across 12 VHA facilities. A multi-disciplinary team employed a qualitative thematic analysis using a hybrid inductive/deductive approach. Staff reported multiple concerns for patients during the crisis, especially regarding vulnerable populations at risk for social isolation. Lack of clear protocols at some sites on how to serve patients screening positive for suicidal ideation created confusion for staff and led some sites to temporarily stop screening. Sites had varying degrees of adaptability to virtual based care, with the biggest challenge being completion of warm hand-offs to mental health specialists. Unanticipated opportunities that emerged during this time included increased ability of patients and staff to conduct virtual care, which is expected to continue benefit post-pandemic.","Newell, Denneson, Rynerson, Rabin, Elliott, Bahraini, Post, Dobscha","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0261921","20211228","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-29","",24416,""

"Screen Use and Mental Health Symptoms in Canadian Children and Youth During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Longitudinal research on specific forms of electronic screen use and mental health symptoms in children and youth during COVID-19 is minimal. Understanding the association may help develop policies and interventions targeting specific screen activities to promote healthful screen use and mental health in children and youth. To determine whether specific forms of screen use (television [TV] or digital media, video games, electronic learning, and video-chatting time) were associated with symptoms of depression, anxiety, conduct problems, irritability, hyperactivity, and inattention in children and youth during COVID-19. A longitudinal cohort study with repeated measures of exposures and outcomes was conducted in children and youth aged 2 to 18 years in Ontario, Canada, between May 2020 and April 2021 across 4 cohorts of children or youth: 2 community cohorts and 2 clinically referred cohorts. Parents were asked to complete repeated questionnaires about their children's health behaviors and mental health symptoms during COVID-19. The exposure variables were children's daily TV or digital media time, video game time, electronic-learning time, and video-chatting time. The mental health outcomes were parent-reported symptoms of child depression, anxiety, conduct problems and irritability, and hyperactivity/inattention using validated standardized tools. This study included 2026 children with 6648 observations. In younger children (mean [SD] age, 5.9 [2.5] years; 275 male participants [51.7%]), higher TV or digital media time was associated with higher levels of conduct problems (age 2-4 years: ÃŽÂ², 0.22 [95% CI, 0.10-0.35]; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001; age Ã¢â€°Â¥4 years: ÃŽÂ², 0.07 [95% CI, 0.02-0.11]; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.007) and hyperactivity/inattention (ÃŽÂ², 0.07 [95% CI, 0.006-0.14]; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.04). In older children and youth (mean [SD] age, 11.3 [3.3] years; 844 male participants [56.5%]), higher levels of TV or digital media time were associated with higher levels of depression, anxiety, and inattention; higher levels of video game time were associated with higher levels of depression, irritability, inattention, and hyperactivity. Higher levels of electronic learning time were associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety. In this cohort study, higher levels of screen use were associated poor mental health of children and youth during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"The Role of Program Evaluation in Keeping Army Health ""Army Strong"": Translating Lessons Learned Into Best Practices","Service Members and military beneficiaries face complex and ill-structured challenges, including suicide, sexual violence, increasing health care costs, and the evolving coronavirus pandemic. Military and other government practitioners must identify effective programs, policies, and initiatives to preserve the health and ensure the readiness of our Force. Both research and program evaluation are critical to identify interventions best positioned to prevent disease, protect the public's health, and promote health and well-being within our ranks to retain a medically ready force and reduce the global burden of disease. While military and medical leaders are typically well versed in research and understand the role of research in evidence-informed decisions, they may be less aware of program evaluation. Program evaluation is the systematic application of scientific methods to assess the design, implementation, improvement, or outcomes of a program, policy, or initiative. Although program evaluators commonly utilize scientific or research methods to answer evaluation questions, evaluation ultimately differs from research in its intent. Several recently published federal and Department of Defense policies specifically reference program evaluation, emphasizing its importance to the military and government as a whole. The Army is uniquely positioned to conduct medical and public health evaluation activities and there are several Army organizations and entities that routinely perform this work. For example, the United States Army Public Health Center (APHC) is among recognized military experts in public health assessment and program evaluation. Given the breadth of our work, the APHC understands the challenges to conducting evaluation studies in the Army and we have thoughtfully examined the conditions common to successful evaluation studies. In this commentary, we share our lessons learned to assist military colleagues, potential partners, and others in successfully evaluating the programs, policies, and initiatives necessary to keep our Service Members and beneficiaries healthy and ready. There are several challenges to executing evaluation studies in the Army that may be relevant across all Services. These include but are not limited to frequent Army leadership transitions, urgency to report study results, lack of program documentation and adequate planning for evaluation, expectation management to ensure stakeholders are well-informed about the evaluation process, and a disorganized data landscape. These challenges may hinder the successful execution of evaluation studies, or prevent them from being attempted in the first place, depriving Army leaders of quality, actionable information to make evidence-informed decisions. Despite the aforementioned challenges, we have identified a number of best practices to overcome these challenges and conduct successful evaluation studies. These facilitators of successful evaluations can be summarized as: collaboration with engaged stakeholders who understand the value of evaluation, evaluation studies aligned with larger strategic priorities, agile methodology, thoughtful evaluation planning, and effective communication with stakeholders. We wholeheartedly recommend and encourage program evaluation at every opportunity, and we anticipate the call for evaluation and evidence-informed decisions to continually increase. Our hope is that others - to include partners and stakeholders within and external to the military - will be able to leverage and apply this information, especially the identified best practices, in their evaluation efforts to ensure success.","Santo, Brown, Gomez, Shirey","https://doi.org/10.1093/milmed/usab516","20211228","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-29","",24419,""
"Telepsychology May Improve Treatment Adherence in Patients with Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizures","<b><i>Introduction:</i></b> <i>Access to mental health care is a significant challenge in patients with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES). Telepsychology can curb the access barriers and improve adherence but the role of telepsychology in improving adherence has not been well investigated. The current study examines the utility of telepsychology during the COVID-19 pandemic and treatment adherence in PNES patients.</i> <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> <i>Patients with PNES admitted to a 12-week counseling program were offered two visit types: telepsychology and in-office. Visit type, visit status, and demographic information were obtained from department database. Follow-up visits in 6 months were used to examine the effect of visit type on visit status. Adherence to treatment was measured by higher attendance of scheduled visits and less cancellation and no-show rates.</i> <b><i>Results:</i></b> <i>Two hundred fifty-seven (</i>n<i>) patients who scheduled virtual or telepsychology visits were included in the study. After adjusting for demographic variables, and accounting for repeated measures, telepsychology visits were significantly more likely to be attended (odds ratio [OR]Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.40, 95% confidence interval [CI]Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.69-3.41,</i> p <i>&lt; 0.001) and were significantly less likely to be canceled (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.43, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.29-0.64,</i> p <i>&lt; 0.001). The regression model showed patients in the telepsychology visit group attended more than three times as many visits as in-office patients (incidence rate ratiosÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.16, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.13-4.73,</i> p <i>&lt; 0.001).</i> <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> <i>Patients with PNES have logistical and psychological barriers that can impede their ability to attend counseling treatment. Receiving care remotely may have been associated with higher engagement with mental health treatment compared to having to travel to counseling clinics. Considering the symptom-related restrictions patients with PNES have and the barriers presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, telepsychology played a key role for continuation of mental health treatment.</i>","Tilahun, Thompson, Bautista, Sankary, Stanton, Punia","https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2021.0463","20211228","CBT; conversion disorder; psychogenic nonepileptic seizures; telehealth; telemedicine; telemental health; telepsychology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-29","",24420,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on HIV testing rates across four geographically diverse urban centres in the United States: An observational study","Non-emergent clinical services were limited or suspended during the early stages of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in the United States (U.S.). This could adversely impact epidemics of public health importance, such as HIV, and access to testing, which is a cornerstone of prevention efforts. In this observational study, we collected HIV testing and positivity rate clinical data from four geographically diverse U.S. healthcare systems in New Orleans, Louisiana; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Providence, Rhode Island; and, Seattle, Washington. Data from 2019 to 2020 were examined to assess changes in HIV testing in community-based, emergency department, and outpatient settings. Poisson regression was used to explore trends in HIV testing through phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. In outpatient settings, there was a 68-97% reduction in the number of HIV tests per week during each state's stay-at-home order period, compared to during the pre-stay-at-home order period in early 2020. HIV testing remained reduced 11-54% after states transitioned to advisory phases. The HIV positivity rate increased slightly at outpatient settings, except in New Orleans where it fell. We found a concerning trend of substantially decreased HIV testing across four geographically diverse sites. These findings suggest that new HIV infections within the U.S. may be undiagnosed and not yet linked to clinical care and services, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, augmented efforts to identify patients and link them to HIV services will be needed as healthcare settings return to full operation.

"Effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on maternity staff in 2020 - a scoping review","In the spring of 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 virus caused the Covid-19 pandemic, bringing with it drastic changes and challenges for health systems and medical staff. Among the affected were obstetricians and midwives, whose close physical contact with pregnant women, women who recently gave birth, and their children was indispensable. In the obstetric setting, births cannot be postponed, and maternity staff had to adapt to assure obstetric safety while balancing evidence-based standards with the new challenges posed by the pandemic. This scoping review gives a comprehensive overview of the effecs the Covid-19 pandemic had on maternity staff. We followed the evidence-based approach described by Arksey &amp; O'Malley: we searched several databases for English and German articles published between January 2020 and January 2021 that discussed or touched upon the effects the pandemic had on maternity staff in OECD countries and China. We found that structural challenges caused by the crisis and its subjective effects on maternity staff fell into two main topic areas. Structural challenges (the first main topic) were divided into five subtopics: staff shortages and restructuring; personal protective equipment and tests; switching to virtual communication; handling women with a positive SARS-CoV-2 infection; and excluding accompanying persons. The pandemic also strongly affected the staff's mental health (the second main topic.) Attempting to meet challenges posed by the pandemic while afraid of contamination, suffering overwork and exhaustion, and struggling to resolve ethical-moral dilemmas had severe negative subjective effects. Several studies indicated increased depression, anxiety, stress levels, and risk of post-traumatic stress symptoms, although the crisis also generated strong occupational solidarity. Care for pregnant, birthing, and breast-feeding women cannot be interrupted, even during a pandemic crisis that requires social distancing. Maternity staff sometimes had to abandon normal standards of obstetric care and were confronted with enormous challenges and structural adjustments that did not leave them unscathed: their mental health suffered considerably. Researchers should study maternity staff's experiences during the pandemic to prepare recommendations that will protect staff during future epidemics.","Schmitt, Mattern, Cignacco, Seliger, KÃƒÂ¶nig-Bachmann, Striebich, Ayerle","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-021-07377-1","20211228","Covid-19 pandemic; Scoping review; maternity staff; midwife; obstetrician","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-29","",24425,""

"Mental health of Turkish medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic","The coronavirus disease emerged in 2019, spread in Turkey as all over the world rapidly. In this process, young people began to experience some mental problems due to the fear of contagion, as well as some changes in their lifestyles. In this study it is aimed to investigate anxiety and depression levels of medical school students and the factors associated with these mental problems. The forms were sent over the internet to the officials responsible for medical education at universities in various regions of Turkey. A total of 2,778 medical faculty students were included in the study. Students were asked to fill out the sociodemographic data form, the Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 (PHQ-9), and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) Test. Students' 67.3% were female and 31.7% were male. About 90.2% of the students in the PHQ-9 scale had depressive symptoms in the major depressive disorder (MDD) dimension, and 44.5% in the GAD-7 scale had moderate/severe anxiety symptoms. Gender, being a preclinical student, history of psychiatric treatment in the past, currently receiving psychiatric treatment, death of someone due to pandemic, economic and health situation, perception of mental health were found associated with MDD and Moderate/Severe Anxiety symptoms. Students with Anxiety and MDD reported significantly more anxiety about contamination and negative beliefs about precautions' sufficiency. It was determined that medical school students in our country showed anxiety and depression at a remarkable level during the pandemic. Examining the underlying causes of these high rates will be beneficial in terms of taking precautions during the long-term pandemic. In literature, there are a limited number of studies on this subject in our country, we believe that our study will be useful in future studies to determine the underlying causes of mental illnesses and what can be done to help students.","Ãƒâ€¡imen, Alvur, CoÃ…Å¸kun, Ã…Å¾ÃƒÂ¼kÃƒÂ¼r","https://doi.org/10.1177/00207640211066734","20211228","COVID-19; Mental health; medical students; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-29","",24427,""

A prevalence of suicide risk was found in 5.3%, and it was associated with the interaction between living in rural area and less education (OR = 5.60, 95%CI 1.28-24.53), emotional dysregulation (OR = 3.54, 95%CI 1.77-7.09), and fatalistic beliefs (OR = 3.09, 95%CI 1.53-6.27). 5.3% of the population presented an elevated suicide risk. It was associated with less education, rural areas, fatalistic beliefs, and emotional dysregulation in the Colombian population during mandatory confinement due to SAR-CoV-2.","Caballero-DomÃƒÂ­nguez, Ceballos-Ospino, Campo-Arias","https://doi.org/10.1177/00302228211066385","20211228","SAR-CoV-2; adults; cross-sectional studies; emotional regulation; pessimism; suicide risk","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-29","",24428,""
"Trend and gender-based association of the Bangladeshi student suicide during the COVID-19 pandemic: a GIS-based nationwide distribution","Students are one of the most vulnerable groups to suicide. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, a Bangladeshi study was conducted assessing their suicide patterns regarding gender-based associations. But how has the pandemic changed the Bangladeshi students' suicide patterns is not studied yet, which is investigated herein. Besides, for the first time, this study provides GIS-based distribution of suicide cases across the country's administrative district. As Bangladesh has no suicide surveillance system, this study utilized media reporting suicide cases following the prior studies. A total of 127 students' suicide cases from March 2020 to March 2021 were finally analyzed after eliminating the duplicate ones, and data were synthesized following the prior studies. Arc-GIS was also used to distribute the suicide cases across the administrative district. Results revealed that female (72.4%; <i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°92/127) was more prone to die by suicide than males. About 42.5% of the cases were aged between 14 and 18Ã¢â‚¬â€°years (mean age 16.44Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.512Ã¢â‚¬â€°years). The most common method of suicide was hanging (79.5%; <i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°101), whereas relationship complexities (15.7%), being emotional (12.6%), not getting the desired one (11%), conflict with a family member (9.4%), academic failure (9.4%), mental health problem (8.7%), sexual complexities (6.3%), scolded or forbidden by parents (3.9%) were the prominent suicide causalities. In respect to gender and suicide patterns, only the suicide stressor was significantly distributed, whereas the method of suicide was significantly associated with GIS-based distribution. However, a higher number of suicide cases was documented in the capital (i.e. Dhaka) and the northern region than in its surrounding districts. The findings reported herein are assumed to be helpful to identify the gender-based suicide patterns and suicide-prone regions in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic to initiate suicide prevention programs of the risky students.","Mamun, Mamun, Hosen, Ahmed, Rayhan, Al-Mamun","https://doi.org/10.1177/00207640211065670","20211228","Bangladesh; COVID-19 suicide; Student suicide; gender and suicide; suicide risk factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-29","",24429,""
"Who Got Vaccinated for COVID-19? Evidence from Japan","Vaccination has been critical to reducing infections and deaths during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. While previous studies have investigated attitudes toward taking a vaccine, studies on the determinants of COVID-19 vaccination behavior are scant. We examine what characteristics, including socioeconomic and non-economic factors, are associated with vaccination behavior for COVID-19 in Japan. We use a large nationwide online survey with approximately 10,000 participants. As of September 2021, 85% of the respondents said that they had received or would receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Employing logistic regression analysis on vaccination behavior, we found that vaccination rates are higher among those who are older, married, educated, and/or work in a large company. On the other hand, vaccination rates tend to be lower among the self-employed, younger women, and those with poor mental health. Income did not significantly correlate with vaccination. Medical workers were found to have a relatively high rate of vaccination. Although attitude towards risk and time preference were not crucial factors for vaccination, fear of infection, infection prevention behavior, and agreement with government policies on behavioral restrictions in crisis situations positively correlated with vaccination.","Okubo, Inoue, Sekijima","https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9121505","20211228","COVID-19; Japan; socioeconomic factors; vaccination behavior","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-29","",24430,""
"Impact of Vaccination on the Sense of Security, the Anxiety of COVID-19 and Quality of Life among Polish A Nationwide Online Survey in Poland","The pandemic state has a destructive effect on the human psyche and induces fear for one's own health. By reducing the risk of severe COVID-19, vaccination may indirectly improve the mental state. This study aims to assess the effects of vaccination on respondents' mental well-being, their attitudes towards adherence to government recommendations limiting viral transmission, and to identify factors that may influence the decision to get vaccinated. The survey took the form of the authors' own, fully voluntary, anonymous, online questionnaire. Standardised psychometric tools were used in the survey: Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7) and Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life (MANSA). The survey involved 1696 respondents, the vast majority of whom were women, and were aged 18-29. The vaccination status was declared by 1677 respondents (98.9%), 430 (25.4%) of whom were vaccinated with at least one dose of vaccine, while 303 (17.9%) respondents were not only unvaccinated at all, and declared no intention to get vaccinated in the future. Fully vaccinated individuals were found to have lower levels of anxiety, higher MANSA scores and lower subjective anxiety about being infected with COVID-19 than those awaiting vaccination or those with an incomplete vaccination regimen (one dose). Those who are not willing to get vaccinated have the lowest sense of anxiety and fear of being infected and they have the lowest adherence to government recommendations limiting SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Conclusions: COVID-19 vaccination reduces the level of anxiety about being infected and anxiety due to COVID-19 disease in people from the immediate environment. Those who are not willing to get vaccinated have extreme attitudes that negate the pandemic as a whole, including the need for COVID-19 vaccination. Fully vaccinated individuals still adhere to the SARS-CoV-2 prevention policies in place.","Babicki, Malchrzak, Hans-Wytrychowska, Mastalerz-Migas","https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9121444","20211228","COVID-19 vaccination; GAD-7; attitudes towards vaccination; mental health; quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-29","",24431,""
