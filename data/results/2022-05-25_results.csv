"Measures implemented in the school setting to contain the COVID-19 pandemic","Background: In response to the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), governments have implemented a variety of measures to control the spread of the virus and the associated disease. Among these, have been measures to control the pandemic in primary and secondary school settings. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of measures implemented in the school setting to safely reopen schools, or keep schools open, or both, during the COVID-19 pandemic, with particular focus on the different types of measures implemented in school settings and the outcomes used to measure their impacts on transmission-related outcomes, healthcare utilisation outcomes, other health outcomes as well as societal, economic, and ecological outcomes. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and the Educational Resources Information Center, as well as COVID-19-specific databases, including the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and the WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease (indexing preprints) on 9 December 2020. We conducted backward-citation searches with existing reviews. Selection criteria: We considered experimental (i.e. randomised controlled trials;RCTs), quasi-experimental, observational and modelling studies assessing the effects of measures implemented in the school setting to safely reopen schools, or keep schools open, or both, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Outcome categories were (i) transmission-related outcomes (e.g. number or proportion of cases);(ii) healthcare utilisation outcomes (e.g. number or proportion of hospitalisations);(iii) other health outcomes (e.g. physical, social and mental health);and (iv) societal, economic and ecological outcomes (e.g. costs, human resources and education). We considered studies that included any population at risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 and/or developing COVID-19 disease including students, teachers, other school staff, or members of the wider community. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently screened titles, s and full texts. One review author extracted data and critically appraised each study. One additional review author validated the extracted data. To critically appraise included studies, we used the ROBINS-I tool for quasi-experimental and observational studies, the QUADAS-2 tool for observational screening studies, and a bespoke tool for modelling studies. We synthesised findings narratively. Three review authors made an initial assessment of the certainty of evidence with GRADE, and several review authors discussed and agreed on the ratings. Main results: We included 38 unique studies in the analysis, comprising 33 modelling studies, three observational studies, one quasi-experimental and one experimental study with modelling components. Measures fell into four broad categories: (i) measures reducing the opportunity for contacts;(ii) measures making contacts safer;(iii) surveillance and response measures;and (iv) multicomponent measures. As comparators, we encountered the operation of schools with no measures in place, less intense measures in place, single versus multicomponent measures in place, or closure of schools. Across all intervention categories and all study designs, very low- to low-certainty evidence ratings limit our confidence in the findings. Concerns with the quality of modelling studies related to potentially inappropriate assumptions about the model structure and input parameters, and an inadequate assessment of model uncertainty. Concerns with risk of bias in observational studies related to deviations from intended interventions or missing data. Across all categories, few studies reported on implementation or described how measures were implemented. Where we describe effects as 'positive', the direction of the point estimate of the effect favours the intervention(s);'negative' effects do not favour the intervention. We found 23 modelling studie","Krishnaratne, S.; Littlecott, H.; Sell, K.; Burns, J.; Rabe, J. E.; Stratil, J. M.; Litwin, T.; Kreutz, C.; Coenen, M.; Geffert, K.; Boger, A.

"Evidence-based suicide prevention strategies during and after the COVID-19 pandemic","This chapter is introduced to the textbook when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out during the spring of 2020. To include information on how the COVID-19 pandemic impacts risk and protective factors for suicide and evidence-based suicide prevention strategies became imperative. The COVID-19 pandemic is like no other, as many nations all over the world enforced strict lockdown and physical distancing measures to prevent the spread of the virus. As the pandemic will go on until effective vaccines will be in use, it is important to examine the positive and negative effects of pandemics and alert decision-makers as well as clinical and public health staff working in suicide prevention activities. In order to successfully combat the likely increase of suicide after the coronavirus crisis, the implementation of evidence-based strategies must be strengthened. Thus, the aim of this chapter is to inform governments, policymakers, and healthcare providers as well as the public to stimulate translation of these recommendations into actions. It describes the public health and healthcare suicide prevention strategies along with the effects of the pandemic on each strategy and recommended actions.

"Anxiety and depression among epilepsy patients in low-risk areas for COVID-19 in the northern part of Guizhou Province, China, during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background This study was aimed to investigate whether patients with epilepsy (PWE) have higher depression and anxiety levels than the normal population in low-risk areas for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the northern part of Guizhou Province, China, during the COVID-19 epidemic, toÂ evaluate their knowledge on COVID-19, and toÂ analyze related factors for the psychological distress of PWE at this special time. Methods The survey was conducted online from February 28, 2020 to March 7, 2020 viaÂ a questionnaire. PWE from the outpatient clinic of epilepsy of the Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University, and healthy people matched for age and sex, participated in this study. Mental health was assessed via a generalized anxiety self-rating scale (GAD-7) and the self-rating depression scale (PHQ-9). The knowledge of COVID-19 in both groups was investigated. Results There were no significant differences in the general demographics between the PWE and healthy control groups. The scores of PHQ-9 (P &lt; 0.01) and GAD-7 (P &lt; 0.001) were higher in the PWE group than in the healthy group. There was a significant difference in the proportions of respondents with different severities of depression and anxiety, between the two groups, which revealed significantly higher degree of depression and anxiety in PWE than in healthy people (P = 0, P = 0). Overwhelming awareness and stressful concerns for the pandemic and female patients with epilepsy were key factors that affect the level of anxiety and depression in PWE. Further, the PWE had less accurate knowledge of COVID-19 than healthy people (P &lt; 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the knowledge of virus transmission route, incubation period, susceptible population, transmission speed, clinical characteristics, and isolation measures on COVID-19 (P &gt; 0.05). PWE knew less about some of the prevention and control measures of COVID-19 than healthy people. Conclusions During the COVID-19 epidemic, excessive attention to the epidemic and theÂ female sex areÂ factors associatedÂ with anxiety and depression in PWE, even in low-risk areas.","Wang, Shen, Yang, Juan, Wei, Nian, Lv, Wenbo, Jiang, Zhigang, Huang, Hao, Zhang, Jun, Xu, Ping, Yu, Chang Yin, Xu, Zucai","https://www.google.com/search?q=Anxiety+and+depression+among+epilepsy+patients+in+low-risk+areas+for+COVID-19+in+the+northern+part+of+Guizhou+Province,+China,+during+the+COVID-19+pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Acta Epileptologica; 4(1), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-25","",31850,""
"Joy: Using strategic communication to improve well-being and organizational success","As I write the introduction to this latest book in the European Public Relations Education and Research Association (EUPRERA) Congress series for Emerald, I cannot help but hold some sense of irony. Our excellent Congress in Zagreb - held during early October 2019 - was another annual celebration of international exchanges of research and new ideas in the scholarship of public relations and strategic communication. The theme of the congress was 'Joy'. And yet, as I compose these introductory thoughts and reflections for the book, my fellow editors and I are each sitting in our home offices as many of you will have done. All of us experiencing for the first time in our lives an extraordinary, enforced lockdown during the COVID-19 (coronavirus) crisis in the spring of 2020. As such 'joy' may not be the first emotion academics and research students think of when reflecting on this challenging period of our lives, but it is perhaps poignant to recall the discussions and debates we held in Zagreb and the fascinating papers we shared during the Congress. Whilst many of the papers touched literally on the issue of joy, others explored related emotions and in some papers the flip or opposing sensations to positivity. In essence the theme of the 2019 Congress is perhaps never more appropriate than in times of stress, international emergency and genuine societal challenge. We need to be able to understand how and where we can sense happiness, well-being, social cohesion, togetherness, appreciation of others and, arguably, attributes of joy. Even before this exceptional year of 2020, it would have been possible to argue that we are living in an era of societal pessimism. That challenging viewpoint appears only to have been reinforced and heightened by the international experiences of the COVID-19 crisis. As we observe our everyday academic worlds, it is possible to see that everyone potentially has a voice, and in the contemporary climate it is very often used to criticize. Publics see problems and discuss them in multifarious ways and on a plethora of platforms and media outlets. And, in turn, academic research reflects this and often views the world through a negative lens and focuses on difficulties, issues and bad practices. With this meeting of the international public relations and strategic communication research community, it was the ambition of the Congress organizers from the University of Zagreb and the EUPRERA Board to encourage and promote some optimism in both the public discourse and academic research about the discipline.

"""Effect of online 1-day cognitive behavioral therapy-based workshops plus usual care vs usual care alone for postpartum depression: A randomized clinical trial"": Correction","Reports an error in ""Effect of online 1-day cognitive behavioral therapy-based workshops plus usual care vs usual care alone for postpartum depression: A randomized clinical trial"" by Ryan J. Van Lieshout, Haley Layton, Calan D. Savoy, June S. L. Brown, Mark A. Ferro, David L. Streiner, Peter J. Bieling, Andrea Feller and Steven Hanna (JAMA Psychiatry, 2021[Nov], Vol 78[11], 1200-1207). In the originally published article, 2 pieces of data were incorrectly presented in the third paragraph of the Results section, where the denominator and percentage in the first sentence were incorrect. That sentence should have appeared as follows: ""The intervention was well tolerated, with 10 of 161 participants in the experimental group (6%) expressing a preference that it be delivered differently (eg, in half-days)."" This article was corrected online. (The  of the original article appeared in record 2022-41504-002). Importance: Postpartum depression (PPD) affects as many as 20% of mothers, yet just 1 in 10 of these women receives evidence-based treatment. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased PPD risk, reduced treatment access, and shifted preferences toward virtual care. Objective: To determine whether an online 1-day cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based workshop added to treatment as usual improves PPD, anxiety, social support, mother-infant relationship quality, and infant temperament more than treatment as usual alone. Design, setting, and participants: This randomized clinical trial included 403 women with PPD who were recruited across Ontario, Canada, during the COVID-19 pandemic (April 20 to October 4, 2020). Women with Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) scores of at least 10 who were 18 years or older and had an infant younger than 12 months were eligible. Interventions: Women were randomly assigned to receive a live, interactive online 1-day CBT-based workshop delivered by a registered psychotherapist, psychiatrist, or clinical psychology graduate student in addition to treatment as usual (n = 202) or to receive treatment as usual and wait-listed to receive the workshop 12 weeks later (n = 201). Main outcomes and measures: The primary outcome was change in PPD (EPDS scores) in experimental and wait list control groups 12 weeks after baseline. Secondary outcomes included maternal anxiety (7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire [GAD-7]), social support (Social Provisions Scale), quality of the mother-infant relationship (Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire), and infant temperament (Infant Behavior Questionnaire-Revised Very Short Form). Results: Participants all identified as women with a mean (SD) age of 31.8 (4.4) years. The workshop led to significant mean (SD) reductions in EPDS scores (from 16.47 [4.41] to 11.65 [4.83];B = -4.82;P &lt; .001) and was associated with a higher odds of exhibiting a clinically significant decrease in EPDS scores (odds ratio, 4.15;95% CI, 2.66-6.46). The mean (SD) GAD-7 scores decreased from 12.41 (5.12) to 7.97 (5.54) after the workshop (B = -4.44;95% CI, -5.47 to -3.38;P &lt; .001) and participants were more likely to experience a clinically significant change (odds ratio, 3.09;95% CI, 1.99-4.81). Mothers also reported improvements in bonding (B = -3.22;95% CI, -4.72 to -1.71;P &lt; .001), infant-focused anxiety (B = -1.64;95% CI, -2.25 to 1.00;P &lt; .001), social support (B = 3.31;95% CI, 1.04 to 5.57;P &lt; .001), and positive affectivity/surgency in infants (B = 0.31;95% CI, 0.05 to 0.56;P &lt; .001). Conclusions and relevance: In this randomized clinical trial, an online 1-day CBT-based workshop for PPD provides an effective, brief option for mothers, reducing PPD and anxiety as well as improving social support, the mother-infant relationship, and positive affectivity/surgency in offspring.

"Prevention of Depression and Anxiety in Subclinical Adolescents: Effects of a Transdiagnostic Internet-Delivered CBT Program","Anxiety and depressive symptoms are common problems in adolescence that could be addressed by means of preventive interventions. Even though transdiagnostic cognitive behavior therapy (T-CBT) is potentially an ideal strategy to deal with anxiety and depression, it has rarely been used for preventive purposes. In addition, so far, no study has used internet-delivered T-CBT to prevent anxiety and depression in adolescents. This study aimed to examine the utility of AMTE, an internet-delivered T-CBT program, for the indicated prevention of anxiety and depression in adolescents. AMTE was applied to 30 adolescents (56.7% females, age range = 12â€“18 years, Mage = 14.00, SDage = 1.89) who showed subclinical symptoms of anxiety and/or depression. Participants were assessed at pre- and post-treatment and follow-up (3 months). We found that after the program, the symptoms of self-reported anxiety and depression, clinician-rated symptom severity, and self-reported and parent-reported severity of the main problems had significantly improved. In addition, there were significant improvements in anxiety sensitivity and emotional avoidance. Finally, we found high feasibility and acceptability of the program. AMTE is feasible and potentially effective for the indicated prevention of anxiety and depression as well as of clinical transdiagnostic factors, in adolescents.","Schmitt, Julia C.; Valiente, Rosa M.; GarcÃ­a-Escalera, Julia, ArnÃ¡ez, Sandra, Espinosa, Victoria, Bonifacio, SandÃ­n, Chorot, Paloma","https://www.google.com/search?q=Prevention+of+Depression+and+Anxiety+in+Subclinical+Adolescents:+Effects+of+a+Transdiagnostic+Internet-Delivered+CBT+Program","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(9):5365, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-25","",31853,""
"Love in the time of COVID: Reflections on retaining attunement through a period of shared trauma","The treatment room for mental health practitioners has transformed drastically since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the complications of moving therapy online further compounded by the stressors of a public health emergency and, in many cases, increasing racist rhetoric and violence toward minority communities. For many LGBTQ+ clients, feelings of anxiety, insecurity, and shame were already exacerbated by a contentious political climate in place well before the pandemic. No one was untouched by the effects of the spread of the virus;individual emotional and behavioral responses vary as we know from trauma research and the clinician's subjective experience of the pandemic will likely affect their practice in several ways. Though each clinical encounter is uniquely affected, the intersubjective dynamics created by a shared trauma put an onus on the clinician to adapt frequently to stay empathically attuned with a client. This paper will draw on concepts from motivational systems theory to help understand a composite case vignette involving a gay Asian American client with a history of relational trauma and a gay white therapist. Motivational Systems theory will be used to help elucidate how the client may be affected by the current moment, the affected intersubjective, gay-affirmative therapeutic dynamic, and how clinicians can maintain their attunement to clients in a way that allows them to respond effectively.

"Psychological readiness to normalization process and burnout level of healthcare workers of pediatric clinic after three months of COVID-19 pandemic","Since December 2019, a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 spread rapidly worldwide within months and caused stress and anxiety both in public and healthcare workers (HCWs). This study was conducted to determine psychologic effect of COVID-19 outbreak on and burnout level among HCWs of Pediatric Clinic while entering normalization process of pandemic. This cross-sectional study was carried out between June 10, 2020 and June 15, 2020 with participation of 261 HCWs. Questionnaire about demographic data, Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21), Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II (AAQ-II), Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) were self-reported by the participants. The mean age of participants was 29+/-9.88 years, 78.9% of them was female, 33% were physicians, 40.2% were nurses. In general, psychological outcomes of the participations were determined as depressive symptoms in 143 (54.8%), anxiety in 129 (49.4%), and stress in 87 (33.3%). Being female, having direct contact with COVID-19 patients increased the risk for anxiety, depression, stress, and psychological inflexibility. Younger age, less work experience, and longer working hours had a significant correlation with burnout as well as a its significant correlation with depression, anxiety, stress, psychological inflexibility. In multiple regression analysis psychological inflexibility, stress levels and working hours showed significant predictive effect on burnout. And also, predictive effects of psychological parameters on burnout were found more stronger than the environmental parameters. Psychological factors showed a stronger relationship with burnout scores compared to environmental factors. Even so, organizational strategies like limiting working hours, and doing a fair shift for HCWs who work on the front line and have direct contact with COVID-19 patients will help to reduce the psychological pressure on HCWs.

"Young Peoplesâ€™ Construction of DIY Dirt Jumps in Melbourne, Australia, Throughout the Covid-19 Lockdowns","Access to public space is critically important for young people, providing key opportunities for self-expression, independence, identity development and relationship building. The Covid-19 pandemic has profoundly affected how young people can engage with public spaces. In Melbourne, Australia, young people have experienced 262Â days in lockdown, contributing to escalating anxiety and depression, social isolation, physical health impacts and increased exposure to family conflict and family violence. Throughout this time, there has been a proliferation of young people constructing DIY dirt jumps across Melbourne. This article analyses this unstructured production of public space, focusing on one case study and drawing from council responses. I suggest that through this practice, young people challenge adult interpretations of public space, intentionally or unintentionally, resisting adult control of public space at a time when young people have been denied opportunities for independence and autonomy.","Oâ€™Keeffe, Patrick","https://www.google.com/search?q=Young+Peoplesâ€™+Construction+of+DIY+Dirt+Jumps+in+Melbourne,+Australia,+Throughout+the+Covid-19+Lockdowns","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Applied Youth Studies;: 1-18, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-25","",31857,""
"Physical Healthcare, Health-Related Quality of Life and Global Functioning of Persons with a Severe Mental Illness in Belgian Long-Term Mental Health Assertive Outreach Teams: A Cross-Sectional Self-Reported Survey","Research shows that care delivery regarding somatic health problems for patients with a severe mental illness (SMI) in community and mental health is difficult to establish. During the last decade, long term mental health outreach teams in Belgium were implemented to provide treatment and follow-up at home. This study aimed to map physical health status, care professionals, health related quality of life and global functioning in persons with SMI in Belgian long term outreach teams for mental health. Using a self-administered questionnaire, 173 persons, 58.1% female with a mean age of 48.3, were questioned. Our findings suggest an undertreatment of somatic comorbid conditions, with only half of physical health complaints being addressed. Although treatment rates for hypertension, when detected were high, treatment of respiratory complaints, pain and fatigue was lacking. Although the majority of respondents responded to have a GP or psychiatrist, contact rates were rather limited. Other disciplines, such as primary care nurses, when present, tend to have more contact with people with SMI. Notably, having regular contacts with GPs seems to improve physical health complaints and/or treatment. Being treated by an outreach team did not show significant correlations with physical health complaints and/or treatment suggesting a more proactive approach by outreach teams or primary care providers is desirable.","Martens, Nicolaas, Destoop, Marianne, Dom, Geert","https://www.google.com/search?q=Physical+Healthcare,+Health-Related+Quality+of+Life+and+Global+Functioning+of+Persons+with+a+Severe+Mental+Illness+in+Belgian+Long-Term+Mental+Health+Assertive+Outreach+Teams:+A+Cross-Sectional+Self-Reported+Survey","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(9):5522, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-25","",31858,""
"Mounting restlessness: Changes in attitudes to the COVID-19 threat","Background: Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, many scientific papers have described the medical aspects and treatment of the virus infection and its symptoms. There are also many studies on how pandemics of this magnitude affect psychological wellbeing. Despite the spread of COVID-19, it has remained a rather  threat for many people in Poland. They have often expressed disbelief and negative attitudes toward social restrictions. The study aimed to investigate changes in attitudes to the COVID-19 threat in young people and the psychological repercussions of social isolation. Material/Methods: The present study examined the changes in young people's attitudes, ones not directly affected by COVID19, over a period of a month. It comprised 41 individuals aged 21 to 60. The participants were asked to fill out a specially designed Internet questionnaire. This consisted of 5 open questions concerning their attitudes, values, feelings, reactions, and vision of the future. They were also encouraged to give their own remarks. Results: At first, 46.6% of participants reported a feeling of discomfort, while 48.4% treated the situation as an opportunity to temporarily slow down the pace of life. However, negative moods and deterioration of mental state arose over time, and 58.7% of respondents reported discomfort in the second study. It shows that counter-arguing against information that causes discomfort and fear does not work for long. Moreover, the majority of them believed that the epidemic would result in the deterioration of their psychological wellbeing. Conclusions: The study revealed that psychological restlessness was almost imperceptible at first, and many participants reported a feeling of relief. Nevertheless, deterioration of mental state arose gradually, often leading to a lack of motivation, feelings of loneliness, helplessness, and, consequently, aggressive behaviors. The neuropsychological and biological aspects of long-term stress are also discussed.

"Effects of Environmental Features in Small Public Urban Green Spaces on Older Adultsâ€™ Mental Restoration: Evidence from Tokyo","Exposure to small public urban green spaces (SPUGS) has been demonstrated to have mental benefits for older adults. However, studies on identifying the objective environmental features of SPUGS and their effects on mental restoration for older adults remain limited. This study employed a multilevel regression model to investigate the restorative and vitalizing effects of the environmental features of 11 SPUGS in Tokyo. Onsite measurements were conducted in Kita-Ku, and 202 older adults were surveyed. The results showed that: (1) The fitting curve of the green view index and Restoration Outcome Scale (ROS) score showed an inverted U shapeâ€”both green view index and boundary enclosure had a strong impact on the mental restoration of older adults;(2) The colorfulness index showed the strongest relationship with the vitalizing effect. (3) The sky view factor and number of seats only influenced the ROS score, while the results of revitalization suggest that large areas of water should be avoided. (4) Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET) was also confirmed to have negative effects on the mental restoration of older adults in autumn. These empirical findings can be used as a resource to promote the mental health of older adults in the design of SPUGS in high-density Asian countries.","Lu, Shan, Oh, Wonseok, Ooka, Ryozo, Wang, Lijun","https://www.google.com/search?q=Effects+of+Environmental+Features+in+Small+Public+Urban+Green+Spaces+on+Older+Adultsâ€™+Mental+Restoration:+Evidence+from+Tokyo","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(9):5477, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-25","",31860,""
"The Impact of COVID-19 on the Health and Experience of the Carers of Older Family Members Living with Dementia: An Italianâ€“Hungarian Comparative Study","This quantitative study (n = 370) compares the pandemic-related experiences of the family carers of older people living with dementia during the first wave of the pandemic, in two countries with different care regimes: Italy (Mediterranean) and Hungary (Eastern European). It aims at answering the following research questions: (1) How did the pandemic affect the subjective health of carers, and what were their experiences with care-related worries and workload? (2) What factors significantly predicted negative changes in these experiences? (3) What were carersâ€™ main difficulties during the first pandemic wave? Results have shown that carers in both samples reported a worsening in mental health (Italy/Hungary: M = 2.25/2.55, SD = 0.93/0.99), and Italian carers also in general health (M = 2.54, SD = 0.98) (on a scale of 1 to 5, with values under â€œ3â€ representing deterioration). Carers in both samples experienced high worry levels (Italy/Hungary: M = 4.2/3.7, SD = 0.93/0.89) and feeling overwhelmed with care tasks (M = 3.2/3.7, SD = 1.3/1.3) (on a scale of 1 to 5, higher values representing higher worry/work overload). In regression models, all of the above negative experiences were predicted by a combination of factors. Two of these factors stood out in importance due to being a predictor of more than one type of negative experience: a decline in the carerâ€“care receiver relationship, predicting work overload, as well as general and mental health deterioration and being the child of the care receiver, predicting both high worry and subjective work overload. The top five encountered problems were the unavailability of medical and social care, difficulties with shopping (medicine included), restricted freedom, isolation, and anxiety.","LÃ¡szlÃ³ ÃrpÃ¡d, KostyÃ¡l, SzÃ©man, Zsuzsa, VirÃ¡g, ErzsÃ©bet AlmÃ¡si, Fabbietti, Paolo, Quattrini, Sabrina, Socci, Marco, Gagliardi, Cristina","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Impact+of+COVID-19+on+the+Health+and+Experience+of+the+Carers+of+Older+Family+Members+Living+with+Dementia:+An+Italianâ€“Hungarian+Comparative+Study","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(9):5329, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-25","",31861,""
"We Are (Not) in the Same Boat: Sociodemographic Differences in Mental and Social Health during the First Year of Coronavirus Pandemic","The study explores changes in mental and social health over two time points during the first year of the coronavirus pandemic, as well as differences in mental and social health among five sociodemographic groups determined by gender, age, socioeconomic status, education and employment status. The online survey was conducted during August and September 2020, and again during January 2021 on a probabilistic sample of adults in Croatia. A total of 958 adults participated in both time points. Our results indicate that, when there are any, changes in mental health are small, while changes in social health are slightly larger. Moreover, the coronavirus pandemic seems to disproportionately affect different socioeconomic groups. Women, young adults, people with low socioeconomic status, with primary education and unemployed generally had worse mental health in the first year of the coronavirus pandemic. Also, some social health indicators deteriorated more among older participants, people with low socioeconomic status, primary education and unemployed.

On the basis of the existing national research and experiences in these countries, we propose five lessons learned. (1) There is no evidence of a mental health pandemic so far in the countries in focus. No increase in severe mental disorders but some increase in the symptoms of common mental health disorders are observable. More high-quality longitudinal studies are needed to understand the mental health burden of the pandemic. (2) The pandemic affects countries (including the mental health situation) differently, depending on the level of the exposure, management policies, pre-pandemic structural characteristics, and healthcare resources. (3) The pandemic affects people differently: the exposure severity to pandemic-related stressors differs between individuals, as well as individual resources to cope with these stressors. There are winners and losers as well as identifiable at-risk groups that need particular attention. (4) Besides the negative consequences, the pandemic has had a positive impact. The rapidly applied innovations within the system of healthcare responses provide a window of opportunity for positive changes in mental healthcare policies, strategies, and practices. The increased focus on mental health during the pandemic may contribute to the prioritization of mental health issues at policy-making and organizational levels and may reduce stigma. (5) A stress- and trauma-informed response to COVID-19 is required. The European community of psychotraumatologists under the leadership of ESTSS plays an important role in promoting stress- and trauma-informed healthcare and policies of pandemic management. Based on the lessons learned, we propose a stepped-care public mental health model for the prevention of adverse mental health outcomes during pandemics. HIGHLIGHTS Population mental health is affected differently in the COVID-19 pandemic: there are winners and losers, as well as identifiable at-risk groups that need particular attention. A stress- and trauma-informed public mental health stepped-care model can address pandemic-related mental health burden in a systematic way.","Javakhishvili, Jana D.; Arnberg, Filip, Greenberg, Neil, Kazlauskas, Evaldas, Lotzin, Annett, Xavier, Miguel","https://www.google.com/search?q=Dealing+with+the+COVID-19+pandemic+in+Europe:+five+lessons+from+the+European+Society+for+Traumatic+Stress+Studies+Lidiando+con+la+pandemia+COVID-19+en+Europa:+Cinco+lecciones+de+la+Sociedad+Europea+de+Estudios+del+EstrÃ©s+TraumÃ¡tico+<U+5E94><U+5BF9><U+6B27><U+6D32>+COVID-19+<U+75AB><U+60C5>:<U+6B27><U+6D32><U+521B><U+4F24><U+5E94><U+6FC0><U+7814><U+7A76><U+5B66><U+4F1A><U+7684><U+4E94><U+4E2A><U+7ECF><U+9A8C><U+6559><U+8BAD>","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European Journal of Psychotraumatology; 13(1), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-25","",31863,""
"Characteristics of registered clinical trials evaluating the role of e-cigarettes in cessation or reduction of cigarette smoking","The public health effect of e-cigarettes is debated because of their uptake by youth and potential benefit for adults who smoke.

Our findings update prior research, raising concern about the continued disease burden experienced by Black adults. Greater experiences of discrimination, racism, and disparities in access to and quality of mental health treatment may partly explain our findings. These pathways are amenable to clinical and policy intervention that could buffer the links between mental illness, disability, and premature death. These considerations are especially salient as we continue to endure the COVID-19 pandemic, which has disproportionately affected minoritized racial and ethnic groups and elevated their need formental health treatment.

"The Effectiveness of Mental Health Literacy Curriculum among Undergraduate Public Health Students","Mental health literacy (MHL) plays an important role in public health. Improving MHL can promote mental health at the individual and public levels. To date, no published studies have assessed the effectiveness of MHL curriculum interventions among undergraduate public health students. The participants in this study were undergraduate public health students (n = 48) who were enrolled in an 18-week MHL curriculum for 100 min per week. MHL was assessed using the Mental Health Literacy Scale for Healthcare Students. A paired sample t-test was performed to examine the immediate and delayed effects of the MHL curriculum. The total MHL score significantly improved, and a moderate effect size was found directly after the intervention and six weeks later. There were significant differences in the recognition of mental illness (p &lt; 0.01), help-seeking efficacy (p &lt; 0.05), and help-seeking attitude (p &lt; 0.05) in the five components of MHL between pre- and post-test.

"The Effects of the Opioid Crisis on Agricultural Industries","Opioid use remains a significant public health crisis. However, few quantitative or qualitative data exist on the prevalence of opioid use and associated mental health conditions in agricultural industries and how it affects the industries themselves. Data on opioid use and associated consequences were collected among agricultural business owners and workers using both quantitative (n = 129) and qualitative assessment (n = 7). The prevalence of opioid use, pain, stress, and depressive symptoms as well as associated hazards were characterized among individuals who work in horticulture (nursery and landscape) and those who work in food production (livestock and crops). Qualitative interviews were also conducted to better understand individual experiences with opioid use. Opioid use was significantly higher among horticultural industries compared to food production. Pain and depressive scores were higher among those who had used opioids although stress did not differ. Importantly, substantial percentages of participants who reported opioid use also reported consequences associated with their use, including missing work, being injured at work while using, and having difficulty in completing daily tasks. These results provide initial evidence that opioid use is substantially affecting agricultural industries in terms of mental health, personal health, labor availability, and productivity.","Heidi Liss, Radunovich, Younker, Terasa, Rung, Jillian M.; Berry, Meredith S.","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Effects+of+the+Opioid+Crisis+on+Agricultural+Industries","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(9):5343, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-25","",31867,""
"Using Co-Design to Develop a Health Literacy Intervention with Socially Disadvantaged Adolescents","The aim of this study was to initiate a co-design process with adolescents to inform the development of a targeted health literacy intervention for implementation in designated socioeconomically disadvantaged post-primary schools in Ireland. Purposely developed vignettes were explored in a series of eight workshops that were conducted separately with staff (n = 26) and students (n = 33) across four schools. Data was analysed using content analysis. A number of key health topics were identified as important and influential for the participants in this context: food choices, mental health and wellbeing, physical activity and sedentary behaviour, sleep and substance misuse. Participants also suggested many health-related capacity building actions. Participants recognized that many of these health topics and capacity building actions were intertwined and also highlighted that some of these actions may be more feasible and/or impactful than others. For example, students and school staff both indicated the need to use relevant, applied and engaging approaches to improve health literacy and subsequent health behaviour. The co-design process adopted empowered stakeholders to actively engage in the design and development of future intervention strategies, which may increase the likelihood of acceptability, effectiveness and sustainability of the resulting intervention.","Goss, Hannah R.; Smith, Craig, Hickey, Laura, Issartel, Johann, Morrissey, Janis, Murrin, Celine, Spillane, Ailbhe, Belton, Sarahjane","https://www.google.com/search?q=Using+Co-Design+to+Develop+a+Health+Literacy+Intervention+with+Socially+Disadvantaged+Adolescents","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(9):4965, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-25","",31868,""

Method 1) Cross-sectional study and 2) longitudinal prospective study on health professionals who worked directly with patients affected by COVID-19 pandemic during the period between March-June 2020 in a tertiary hospital in Barcelona. Baseline (July-November 2020) and follow-up (November 2020-March 2021) data were collected. Data related to the job and toxic habits were collected with ad hoc questionnaires, and data related to perceived stress, post-traumatic stress, depression, and anxiety using validated questionnaires. Results In the baseline group (cross-sectional study), 90 professionals participated, 76% nurses. More than a third were on sick leave or took drugs to manage stress. Half of smokers increased tobacco use, and one in 5 increased alcohol consumption.

"Health-Related Quality of Life According to Sociodemographic Characteristics in the South Korean Population","Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) concerns satisfaction with life and happiness with regard to physical, mental, and social factors. RAND-36 is a publicly available, self-administered questionnaire that examines eight health dimensions. This study evaluated the HRQoL of the South Korean population using the RAND-36 questionnaire and compared HRQoL across sociodemographic characteristics. From May 2015 to May 2019, South Koreans who visited public places aged 19â€“80 years were recruited and the RAND-36 questionnaire was administered. Overall, 1002 participants were recruited (mean age 45.34 years, 52% men). Men scored better than women in both physical and mental health (p &lt; 0.05). There were significant differences in bodily pain (p &lt; 0.05), general health perception (p &lt; 0.05), and energy/fatigue (p &lt; 0.05) dimensions according to the participantsâ€™ health condition. The HRQoL of South Koreans was lower than average in most dimensions compared with other countries. As the first study to assess this, its data can be used in future studies that apply RAND-36 to evaluate the HRQoL of diseased individuals, as they can compare their findings with those of our study population.","Chan-Hee, Park, Park, Eunhee, Hyun-Min, Oh, Su-Jin, Lee, Park, Sun-Hee, Tae-Du, Jung","https://www.google.com/search?q=Health-Related+Quality+of+Life+According+to+Sociodemographic+Characteristics+in+the+South+Korean+Population","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(9):5223, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-25","",31871,""
"Examining the factors that impact utilization of school-based mental health services for Mexican American adolescents from a rural, borderland community during the time of COVID-19: A quantitative study","Contemporary educational practices comprise of the integration of school based health centers for the treatment of physical and mental health conditions of their student populations. These conditions must be addressed as they greatly impact academic performance and functioning. However, Mexican American adolescents continue to be a population at risk of missing out on these services because they face unique barriers to accessing them. This study examined factors that impacted the use of mental health services for this group and parental attitudes about mental health services surfaced as an area requiring further exploration as these attitudes can impact service engagement for this group. This quantitative cross sectional study included a convenience sample of 274 parents with the majority identifying as Hispanic or Latino (n = 227) and reporting they live in either Luna or Dona Ana Counties (n = 212). Data was collected via self-administered completion of the Parental Attitudes Towards Psychological Services Inventory (PATPSI) and by completion of a demographic survey. Results revealed a statistically significant multivariate effect for both income and language on the combined PAPSI subscales (Help Seeking Attitudes, Help Seeking Intentions and Stigmatization). Results also indicated that there are differences in parental attitudes about mental health services in parents that make less than 30k per year and identify as non-Latino/Hispanic. This study highlights the idea that parents are essential gatekeepers of mental health services of Mexican American adolescents and educational leaders should inventory these attitudes in order to create more equitable access to school based mental health services for this group.

"Beyond social mobility: A student-centered analysis of the aspirations of rural Latinx students","Aspirations predict students' trajectories, and knowledge of how youth develop and achieve goals is crucial to supporting success. However, rural students may encounter constraining conditions that can curtail their aspirations, and students of color often face institutional barriers that impact their postsecondary pathways. Guided by theories focused on ecosystems (Bronfenbrenner, 1979), habitus (Bourdieu, 1990), community cultural wealth (Yosso, 2005), and ethical frameworks for studying aspirations (Zipin et al., 2015), as well as novel methods centered on transformation, this study foregrounds students' identities in understanding their future orientations. Through empowering qualitative case study methods, data were collected over one school year via 50 in-depth interviews with five high school seniors who self-identified as Mexican, low-income, and first-generation college-going students. All participants completed a college preparatory program at a large comprehensive public high school, located in a remote, agricultural, border community in Southern California. This study utilized a motivational interviewing approach, which cultivated dialogue spaces for students to make sense of how salient experiences in their lives affected their future orientations. In analyzing the data, explanation building was used for within-case analysis of interviews conducted with each student, and cross-case analysis explored patterns spanning individual perspectives. Findings reveal how youths' aspirational beliefs and choices were mediated by academic and personal experiences in their school and community, which included mental health, relationships, college preparatory activities, and growth opportunities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although their college pathways deviated from those encouraged by adults, as only one of the five students chose to attend a four-year university immediately after high school, students remained committed to their visions for holistic, multidimensional futures. In constructing academic, personal, and social scaffolds to support their success, students made intentional choices about their journeys towards crafting their future lives. Findings also show how student-centered interviews fostered reflective and imaginative spaces for participants to explore possible life pathways. This study expands existing theory on aspirations and has important implications for scholars and practitioners striving to support students' postsecondary trajectories.

"Responding to COVID-19 related mental health impacts among elite athletes","The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted considerably on elite athletes' performance. In this paper, we aim to examine how the psychosocial effects of COVID-19 may impact on athletes. First, mental health problems are as common among elite athletes as among the general population. Second, the mental health effects of COVID-19 are common in adolescents and young adults. Third, there are recognised gender differences in mental health related help-seeking behaviour. There is emerging evidence that these issues may be exacerbated by the pandemic. While there is little evidence on what interventions may help to address this problem, it is possible that optimising the identification and treatment of mental health problems (in an appropriate and acceptable manner) and promoting team cohesion and interaction may be effective. Addressing this issue is important for all team doctors and healthcare professionals associated with sports teams (both elite and non-elite).","Broughan, J.; Roe, M.; Crowley, T.; Cullen, W.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Responding+to+COVID-19+related+mental+health+impacts+among+elite+athletes","","Database: GIM; Publication type: article; Publication details: Irish Medical Journal; 114(9), 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-25","",31874,""
"Proposing a â€œBrain Health Checkup (BHC)â€ as a Global Potential â€œStandard of Careâ€ to Overcome Reward Dysregulation in Primary Care Medicine: Coupling Genetic Risk Testing and Induction of â€œDopamine Homeostasisâ€","In 2021, over 100,000 people died prematurely from opioid overdoses. Neuropsychiatric and cognitive impairments are underreported comorbidities of reward dysregulation due to genetic antecedents and epigenetic insults. Recent genome-wide association studies involving millions of subjects revealed frequent comorbidity with substance use disorder (SUD) in a sizeable meta-analysis of depression. It found significant associations with the expression of NEGR1 in the hypothalamus and DRD2 in the nucleus accumbens, among others. However, despite the rise in SUD and neuropsychiatric illness, there are currently no standard objective brain assessments being performed on a routine basis. The rationale for encouraging a standard objective Brain Health Check (BHC) is to have extensive data available to treat clinical syndromes in psychiatric patients. The BHC would consist of a group of reliable, accurate, cost-effective, objective assessments involving the following domains: Memory, Attention, Neuropsychiatry, and Neurological Imaging. Utilizing primarily PUBMED, over 36 years of virtually all the computerized and written-based assessments of Memory, Attention, Psychiatric, and Neurological imaging were reviewed, and the following assessments are recommended for use in the BHC: Central Nervous System Vital Signs (Memory), Test of Variables of Attention (Attention), Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory III (Neuropsychiatric), and Quantitative Electroencephalogram/P300/Evoked Potential (Neurological Imaging). Finally, we suggest continuing research into incorporating a new standard BHC coupled with qEEG/P300/Evoked Potentials and genetically guided precision induction of â€œdopamine homeostasisâ€ to diagnose and treat reward dysregulation to prevent the consequences of dopamine dysregulation from being epigenetically passed on to generations of our children.","Braverman, Eric R.; Dennen, Catherine A.; Gold, Mark S.; Abdalla, Bowirrat, Gupta, Ashim, Baron, David, Roy, A.

"Modeling di (2-ethylhexyl) Phthalate (DEHP) and Its Metabolism in a Bodyâ€™s Organs and Tissues through Different Intake Pathways into Human Body","Phthalate esters (PAEs) are ubiquitous in indoor environments as plasticizers in indoor products. Residences are often exposed to indoor PAEs in the form of gas, particles, settled dust, and surface phases. To reveal the mechanism behind the accumulation of PAEs in different tissues or organs such as the liver and the lungs when a person exposed to indoor PAEs with different phases, a whole-body physiologically based pharmacokinetic model for PAEs is employed to characterize the dynamic process of phthalates by different intake pathways, including oral digestion, dermal adsorption, and inhalation. Among three different intake pathways, dermal penetration distributed the greatest accumulation of DEHP in most of the organs, while the accumulative concentration through oral ingestion was an order of magnitude lower than the other two doses. Based on the estimated parameters, the variation of di-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) and mono (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) concentration in the venous blood, urine, the liver, the thymus, the pancreas, the spleen, the lungs, the brain, the heart, and the kidney for different intake scenarios was simulated. The simulated results showed a different accumulation profile of DEHP and MEHP in different organs and tissues and demonstrated that the different intake pathways will result in different accumulation distributions of DEHP and MEHP in organs and tissues and may lead to different detrimental health outcomes.","Ao, Li, Kang, Lingyi, Li, Runjie, Wu, Sijing, Liu, Ke, Wang, Xinke","https://www.google.com/search?q=Modeling+di+(2-ethylhexyl)+Phthalate+(DEHP)+and+Its+Metabolism+in+a+Bodyâ€™s+Organs+and+Tissues+through+Different+Intake+Pathways+into+Human+Body","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(9):5742, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-25","",31876,""
"Is there Anything Good about the COVID-19 Pandemic? Perceptions of the Positive Consequences at the Beginningof the Pandemic","The aim of this paper was to investigate the experience of possible positive consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and their connection with indicators of mental health and well-being, and to identify themes by which people describe the positive consequences of the pandemic. As part of a broader longitudinal project, participants completed a comprehensive online survey on various aspects of the pandemic. This paper presents the results obtained from 1,201 adult participants (50.1% women) on a quantitative measure of the experienced positive consequences, and on the qualitative answers to an open question about the positive aspects of the pandemic. The quantitative measure was created for the purposes of this research. Measures of sociodemographic factors, mental health (DASS-21) and well-being (WHO-5) were also used. The results show that participants experience positive consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic through three factors: Awareness of life values, More time for oneself, and New job opportunities. Awareness of life values was ranked as the most important, then More time for oneself, and finally New job opportunities. Participants who were more aware of these three aspects of the positive effects of COVID-19 also showed significantly greater subjective well-being and resilience, while associations with depression, anxiety, and stress were negligible or low. Women were more aware of changes in their life values than men, while men had a greater experience of new job opportunities. The results of the qualitative responses show that 83.4% of participants recognised some form of positive consequences of the pandemic on their lives, on the lives of other people, and on society. Analyses revealed seven themes: better family relationships, reflection and personal growth, social well-being, digitalisation of work and education, improved personal life, environmental effects, and competent pandemic management. Together, the results point to the importance of thinking about and exploring positive consequences of crisis events in the context of individual resilience and well-being.","Ajdukovic, Marina, Bagaric, Ines Rezo, Ajdukovic, Dean","https://www.google.com/search?q=Is+there+Anything+Good+about+the+COVID-19+Pandemic?+Perceptions+of+the+Positive+Consequences+at+the+Beginningof+the+Pandemic","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychological Topics; 31(1):1-25, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-25","",31877,""
"Smartphones, the Epidemic of the 21st Century: A Possible Source of Addictions and Neuropsychiatric Consequences","Background and Objectives: Phonoholism is the excessive and harmful use of a smartphone. We are now observing this phenomenon among adults more often. Using a smartphone for several hours may lead to somatic and psychological symptoms, such as headaches and depression. The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of phonoholism and to assess the association between smartphone overuse and neuropsychiatric disorders. Materials and Methods: A total of 368 people (70.1% were woman), aged between 19 and 82 years (average age 26.1), took part in an anonymous questionnaire consisting of the following elements: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Mobile Phone Problem Use Scale (MPPUS-9), and original questions regarding headaches and sleep quality, along with a subjective assessment of the use of smartphones and an objective evaluation based on data from the applications â€œStay Freeâ€ and â€œScreen Timeâ€. Results: A total of 61 respondents (16.6%) obtained a score on the MPPUS-9 scale, which revealed their problematic use of mobile devices. Patients with phonoholism had significantly more headaches (85% vs. 58.7%, p = 0.027). Subjects with phonoholism had significantly shorter mean sleep duration (7.14 h vs. 7.42 h, p = 0.0475) and were less likely to feel sleepy during the day (43.33% vs. 59.73%, p = 0.0271). The group with phonoholism had significantly higher scores on the HADS-A anxiety scale (8.29 vs. 10.9, p = 0.015), but a statistical significance was not confirmed for depressive symptoms.

"Impact of Providing Peer Support on Medical Studentsâ€™ Empathy, Self-Efficacy, and Mental Health Stigma","Background: Peer-support programs in medical school can buffer feelings of inadequacy, anxiety, social isolation, and burnout, drawing upon the benefits of near-peer-support resources. This study examined the effects of providing support to students in a medical school peer-support program. Methods: Using a pre-post, quasi-experimental study design, the investigators surveyed medical students who were peer supporters in their second through fourth years of medical school with four measures assessing (1) empathy, (2) self-efficacy, (3) mental health stigma, and (4) likelihood to assist peers with mental health problems to examine if serving as a volunteer peer supporter had any effect. Participants included 38 medical students that were actively enrolled peer supporters during the 2020â€“2021 year at a United States allopathic medical school. Results: Medical students who participated as peer supporters were found to have higher ratings of empathy scores (Z = -1.964, p = 0.050, r = 0.34) and self-efficacy scores (Z = -2.060, p = 0.039, r = 0.35) after participation in the program. No significant changes were noted for mental health stigma or likelihood to assist peers with mental health problems. Discussion: Peer-support programs present a low-cost, sustainable modality to promote wellbeing in medical students. There is a growing body of literature documenting the benefits of peer-support services. This brief, novel study examined the effects of providing peer support on the peer supporters and found higher self-reported ratings of empathy and self-efficacy after participation. These findings underscore peer-support programs as a valuable wellness resource not only for medical students who use the services but for those who provide them as well.","Abrams, Matthew P.; Salzman, Joshua, Andrea Espina, Rey, Daly, Katherine","https://www.google.com/search?q=Impact+of+Providing+Peer+Support+on+Medical+Studentsâ€™+Empathy,+Self-Efficacy,+and+Mental+Health+Stigma","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(9):5135, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-25","",31879,""
"Disability advocates call on CDC to reinstate indoor mask guidelines","Dozens of advocacy groups are calling for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to walk back major changes to its mask guidance, arguing that the new recommendations are harmful to people with disabilities, Disability Scoop reported March 7. In a letter to CDC Director Rochelle Walensky late last week, over 100 groups and advocates asked the federal agency to again urge Americans to mask indoors in order to protect the most vulnerable. Under the new recommendations, which are based on a revised set of metrics, the CDC says more than 90% of Americans live in areas with low or medium COVID-19 risk and can go mask-free in most circumstances. The advocacy groups are asking Walensky to urge everyone to wear the highest-quality masks available in all indoor public settings, including schools. â€œDespite acknowledging that some disabled, chronically ill, immunocompromised, people of color, and older people require additional protections, the new guidance does not address the needs of disabled people and older adults â€” as well as children with and without disabilities under five who are still not eligible for vaccines,â€ wrote the National Council on Independent Living, the National Disability Rights Network and numerous other groups, including The Arc and the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law. â€œThis new guidance will not work for these communities and places us and our friends and families in danger.â€ The CDC did not respond to a request for comment.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Disability+advocates+call+on+CDC+to+reinstate+indoor+mask+guidelines","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Mental Health Weekly; 32(11):8-8, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-25","",31880,""

"Associations of childhood neglect, difficulties in emotion regulation, and psychological distresses to COVID-19 pandemic: An intergenerational analysis","Although individuals' psychological responses to trauma are varied, significant associations between parental and offspring's reactions have been documented among trauma-exposed families. Common susceptible factors originated from intergenerational transmission may be underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon. This study aimed to investigate the intergenerational transmission of depression and anxiety during early outbreak of COVID-19 and further examined whether the transmission of child neglect and difficulties in emotion regulation (ER) was associated with the transmission of psychological distresses. Self-reported questionnaires of depression, anxiety, COVID-19 related worries, difficulties in ER, physical and emotional neglect suffered in childhood were completed by 2011 Chinese parent - offspring dyads. Path analysis was used to examine hypothesized relationships. The proportions of physical neglect and emotional neglect were 31.2% and 16.9% respectively among parents, while 28.6% and 20.8% respectively among offspring. There were remarkably similar in response patterns between parents and offspring. Parents' COVID-19 related worries, depression and anxiety levels were significantly associated with offspring's COVID-19 related worries, depression and anxiety. Difficulties in ER not only impacted psychological distresses directly, but also mediated the relationships between childhood neglect and psychological distresses among both parents and offspring. Difficulties in ER and childhood neglect, as important risk factors, were modestly transmitted from parent to offspring. Family members shared a certain degree of similarity in psychological reactions to trauma. Transmitted susceptible factors from parents to offspring may contribute to this similarity. Family therapy may be suitable for family members exposed to the same traumatic events.","Zhang, Zhan, Long, Xie, Geng","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2022.105674","20220524","COVID-19; Child; Childhood trauma; Emotion regulation; Family study; Psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-25","",31883,""
"Lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic to improve the health and social care and wellbeing of minoritised ethnic groups with chronic conditions or impairments: protocol for the mixed methods intersectional asset-based study CICADA","The pandemic has inequitably impacted the experiences of people living with ill health/impairments or from minoritised ethnic groups across all areas of life. Given possible parallels in inequities for disabled people and people from minoritised ethnic backgrounds, their existence before the pandemic and increase since, and the discriminations that each group faces, our interest is in understanding the interplay between being disabled AND being from a minoritised ethnic group. The overarching aim of the CICADA project, building on this understanding, is to improve pandemic and longer-term support networks and access to and experiences of care, services and resources for these under-served groups, both during the pandemic and longer term, reducing inequities and enhancing social, health and wellbeing outcomes. This mixed methods study involves three 'sweeps' of a new UK survey, secondary analyses of existing cohort and panel surveys, a rapid scoping review, a more granular review, and qualitative insights from over 200 semi-structured interviews including social network/map/photo elicitation methods, and two subsequent sets of remote participatory research workshops. Separate stakeholder co-creation meetings, running through the study, will develop analyses and outputs. Our longitudinal study design enables us to explore significant relationships between variables in the survey data we collect, and also changes in variables with time, including consideration of varying pandemic contexts. The qualitative data will provide more granular detail. We will take a strengths and assets-based approach, underpinned by the social model of disability and by intersectional considerations, to challenge discrimination. Our exploration of the social determinants of health and wellbeing is framed by the social ecological model. The CICADA project was funded by the Health and Social Care Delivery Research (HSDR) Programme of the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) in March 2021 and began in May 2021. Further work within the project (84 interviews) was commissioned in March 2022, focussing on mental health specifically in North-East England, Greater Manchester and the North-West Coast. Data collection began in August 2021, with the last participants due to be recruited in September 2022. As of January 2022, 5,792 survey respondents and 227 interviewees had provided data. From April 2022, the time of article submission, we will recruit participants for the sub-study and wave 2 of the surveys and qualitative work. We expect results to be published by winter 2022.

This study aims to investigate the pandemic impact on pregnancy experience, rates of primary childhood immunisations and the differences in birth outcomes in during 2020 to those of previous years. Self-reported pregnancy experience: 215 expectant mothers (aged 16+) in Wales completed an online survey about their experiences of pregnancy during the pandemic. The qualitative survey data was analysed using codebook thematic analysis. Population-level birth outcomes in Wales: Stillbirths, prematurity, birth weight and Caesarean section births before (2016-2019) and during (2020) the pandemic were compared using anonymised individual-level, population-scale routine data held in the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank. Uptake of the first three scheduled primary childhood immunisations were compared between 2019 and 2020. The pandemic had a negative impact on the mental health of 71% of survey respondents, who reported anxiety, stress and loneliness; this was associated with attending scans without their partner, giving birth alone, and minimal contact with midwives. There was no significant difference in annual outcomes including gestation and birth weight, stillbirths, and Caesarean sections for infants born in 2020 compared to 2016-2019. There was an increase in late term births (Ã¢â€°Â¥42 weeks gestation) during the first lockdown (OR: 1.28, p = 0.019) and a decrease in moderate to late preterm births (32-36 weeks gestation) during the second lockdown (OR: 0.74, p = 0.001). Fewer babies were born in 2020 (N = 29,031) compared to 2016-2019 (average N = 32,582). All babies received their immunisations in 2020, but there were minor delays in the timings of immunisations. Those due at 8-weeks were 8% less likely to be on time (within 28-days) and at 16-weeks, they were 19% less likely to be on time. Whilst the pandemic had a negative impact on mothers' experiences of pregnancy. Population-level data suggests that this did not translate to adverse birth outcomes for babies born during the pandemic.","Jones, Seaborne, Cowley, Odd, Paranjothy, Akbari, Brophy","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0267176","20220524","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-25","",31885,""
"""Appreciate the Little Things"": A Qualitative Survey of Men's Coping Strategies and Mental Health Impacts During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has presented a suite of circumstances that will simultaneously affect mental health and mobilize coping strategies in response. Building on a lack of research specifically exploring men's mental health impacts during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study presents the results of a qualitative survey exploring men's self-reported aspects of the pandemic giving rise to mental health challenges, alongside their diverse coping strategies applied during this time. The sample comprised 555 men from North America (age <i>M</i> = 38.8 years; <i>SD</i> = 13.5 years), who participated via an online survey with two open-ended qualitative questions assessing, respectively, the aspects of the pandemic affecting their mental health, and the strategies used to manage these challenges. Free-text responses were coded using inductive content analysis. Results pertaining to the mental health impacts of COVID-19 were categorized into two overarching themes: <i>far-reaching ramifications of COVID-19</i> encompassing consequences for lifestyle, work, and functioning, alongside <i>novel anxieties</i> related to health risks and daily uncertainty. In addition, coping strategies reported were categorized into two broad themes: efforts to <i>avoid, dull or distract</i> oneself from distress, alongside <i>adapting and doing things differently</i>, which encompassed largely approach-oriented efforts to flexibly ameliorate distress. Results signal the far-reaching impacts of COVID-19, alongside profound flexibility and diverse enactments of resilience among men in adapting to unprecedented challenges. Findings have implications for mental health promotion that should aim to leverage men's adaptive coping to encourage opportunities for social connectedness in response to the mental health impacts of the various psychosocial challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Wilson, Seidler, Oliffe, Toogood, Kealy, Ogrodniczuk, Walther, Rice","https://doi.org/10.1177/15579883221099794","20220524","COVID-19; coping; masculinity; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-25","",31886,""
"Covid-19-related stressors, mental disorders, depressive and anxiety symptoms: a cross-sectional, nationally-representative, face-to-face survey in Serbia","The Covid-19 pandemic may be associated with an increase in mental disorders and mental distress. However, there are no representative studies testing the impact of stressors directly related to Covid-19. We aimed to determine whether Covid-19-related stressors were associated with mental disorders, depressive and anxiety symptoms in the second year of the pandemic. This cross-sectional observational epidemiological survey was conducted from June to October 2021. We interviewed a representative sample of the adult population in Serbia (18-65 years) in the second year of the pandemic, at a time when large parts of the population had been affected by the pandemic in different ways. A multistage probabilistic household sampling of the adult population in 60 municipalities was used. Mental disorders were assessed by in-person interviews using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were measured by PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scales. Covid-19-related stressors (Sars-CoV-2 infection, the infection of a close relative, self-isolation and lack of protective equipment at work), as well as other stressors during the pandemic (not directly related to the risk of the infection), were measured. The associations with mental disorders, depressive and anxiety symptoms were explored through univariable and multivariable regression analyses. In total, 1203 individuals (mean age 43.7 Ã‚Â± 13.6 years, 48.7% male) were interviewed. Most respondents (67.8%) of the sample had already experienced Covid-19-related stressors (20.1% had Sars-CoV-2 infection; 43.2% had a close relative member who had Covid-19; 28.2% reported lack of appropriate protection; 27.5% had been quarantined) and about 50% had already been vaccinated. The prevalence of any mental disorder was 15.2% (95% CI 13.2-17.2): mood disorders 4.6%, anxiety disorders 4.3% and substance use disorders 8.0%. Mean PHQ-9 was 3.2 Ã‚Â± 3.8 and GAD-7 was 2.1 Ã‚Â± 3.1. In this study, one Covid-19 stressor, i.e. lack of protective equipment, was weakly associated with a greater frequency of anxiety disorders (p = 0.023), while the other stressors had significant associations with several groups of mental disorders and symptom levels. Our study did not provide any evidence that the prevalence of mental disorders exceeds the range of pre-pandemic data reported in the literature. Covid-related stressors, although frequently reported, did not dramatically influence the prevalence of mental disorders. The provision of the appropriate equipment at workplaces might lead to the reduction of anxiety disorders.","MariÃ„â€¡, LazareviÃ„â€¡, Priebe, MihiÃ„â€¡, PejoviÃ„â€¡-MilovanÃ„ÂeviÃ„â€¡, TerziÃ„â€¡-Ã…Â upiÃ„â€¡, ToÃ…Â¡koviÃ„â€¡, VukoviÃ„â€¡, TodoroviÃ„â€¡, KneÃ…Â¾eviÃ„â€¡","https://doi.org/10.1017/S2045796022000117","20220524","Common mental disorders; mental health; population survey; risk factors; stresful life events","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-25","",31887,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on provision of HIV/AIDS services for key populations","The COVID-19 pandemic has aggravated the obstacles forÃ‚Â HIV/AIDS programs in limited-resource countries like Vietnam to achieve the HIV/AIDS-related Sustainable Development target. The paper aims to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the provision of HIV/AIDS services-a pathway to achieving universal health coverage for key populations (KPs). Employing mix-methods, we conducted a desk study, one focus group discussion, and ten in-depth interviews with participants from the Ministry of Health, Provincial Centres for Disease Control, and HIV/AIDS-related facilities. The results showed the reduced coverage of KPs with access to prevention (i.e., harm-reduction services, counselling), testing, and treatment services (i.e., antiretroviral therapy, isoniazid preventive therapy). It also showed the reduced coverage of quality essential services, mainly in skipping consultation and testing, delaying un-emergency services, and redirecting KPs to non-HIV-specialised facilities. There was a gap in providing support for mental health, violence/abuse, and reproductive health. Financial risk protection for KPs was reduced due to uncertain local budgetÃ‚Â allocation; decreasing their ability to pay for HIV/AIDS-related services and social health insurance premiums; and increased out-of-pocket payments to comply with the COVID-19 control measures. This paper provides recommendations for strategic planning to ensure universal health coverage for KPs in the post COVID-19 era, especially for limited-resource countries like Vietnam.","Nguyen Thu, Nguyen Quynh, Khuat Hai, Le Thi Thanh, Nguyen Thanh","https://doi.org/10.1002/hpm.3508","20220524","HIV/AIDS; key population; limited-resource countries; the COVID-19 pandemic; universal health coverage","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-25","",31888,""
"COVID-19 citation pandemic within the psychological knowledge domain","Presented study explores the knowledge domain of psychological research published in 2020 and 2021. Metadata from 156,942 psychology papers available in Scopus were analyzed using citation analysis and bibliographic mapping techniques. Having in mind the ubiquity of the COVID-19 pandemic and the numerous ways it has affected people's lives, the fact that COVID-19-related papers represent only 2% to 7% of the total academic production in psychology may seem rather low. However, these papers have attracted much more attention from the public than non-COVID papers. They were also cited two to eight times more frequently, depending on the measure used, and account for 16% to 19% of total citations to psychology papers. Results show that early-stage researchers and those who had fewer articles in Scopus have benefited more from publishing COVID papers. They have managed to boost their average citation rates to the level of their colleagues who were much longer active and previously had higher citedness. Results indicate that the authors citing behavior largely follows the cumulative advantage pattern. Psychological research in general is mainly focused on mental health, anxiety, depression, and stress. This trend is even more fostered due to the pandemic since some of these topics are often analyzed as typical emotional reactions to COVID-19. Other relevant issues are also very well covered, except for the question how scientific results are communicated to the public.

"Disparities among smokers during the COVID-19 pandemic: Examination of COVID-19-related worries by sociodemographic factors in a US Nationally representative survey","Low-socioeconomic status (SES) and certain racial/ethnic minority groups disproportionately experience tobacco-related disease and death. Underserved populations of smokers may be at disproportionate risk for elevated stress and worry related to basic needs and healthcare during the pandemic, which could impede smoking cessation and exacerbate health disparities. This study examined whether experiences with stress and worry among smokers during the COVID-19 pandemic differed by sociodemographic factors, and whether these factors predicted serious psychological distress (SPD). Data came from an October-November 2020 U.S. national representative survey of 1,223 current cigarette smokers. Analyses examined associations between sociodemographic factors with COVID-19-related worries and past-month SPD. Worry in most domains (e.g., food, housing, finances, healthcare) was more prevalent among participants with less than high school education, income less than $30,000, and those who were unemployed. Women and participants aged 30-44, with income less than $30,000, with less than high school education, not working/disabled, or on Medicaid were more likely to experience SPD. Examined separately, each COVID-19 worry predicted higher likelihood of SPD. In adjusted models, COVID-19 worries about finances (aORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2.3) and isolation/loneliness (aORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 3.0) uniquely predicted SPD. Among U.S. adult smokers during the COVID-19 pandemic, those with lower SES indicated disproportionately high worry about access to basic needs and were more likely to experience SPD. Policies and interventions that address basic needs and mental health among marginalized populations of tobacco users are needed.","Fairman, Weaver, Nyman, Popova, Massey, Reynolds, Spears","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmedr.2022.101835","20220524","COVID-19; Health disparities; Mental health; Tobacco use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-25","",31890,""
"The psychological impact of the covid-19 pandemic on radiotherapy cancer patients","In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a pandemic. The aim of this study was to evaluate the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy. Were enrolled 210 patients in treatment and in follow-up who had access to the Radiation Oncology Department of the Campus Bio-Medico University Hospital Foundation between April and May 2020. The sample was subjected to structured interview and validated questionnaires. 37<i>%</i> of patients showed significant levels of distress; depressive symptoms were reported by 22.4<i>%</i> of patients and 99% of sample had clinically significant anxiety symptoms. All patients anxiety worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic (<i>p=&lt; 0.001</i>). Patients on active treatment had higher levels of distress (3.5Ã‚Â vs 2.6; <i>p</i>Ã‚Â <i>=</i>Ã‚Â <i>0.04</i>) and anxiety (3.5Ã‚Â vs 2.6; <i>p</i>Ã‚Â <i>=</i>Ã‚Â <i>0.04</i>). Lung cancer patients appeared to be more afraid of COVID-19 than other patients (24.2Ã‚Â vs 22.2). This study highlights the presence of clinically significant anxiety in 99<i>%</i> of sample. This conclusion reflects the condition of emotional distress present during the pandemic which makes it necessary to treat patients in a multidisciplinary perspective that includes psychological support in the care plan.","Vicinanza, Ippolito, Sisto, Santo, Fiore, Trodella, Silipigni, Quintiliani, Ramella","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tranon.2022.101457","20220524","Anxiety; Covid-19; Depression; Distress; Radiotherapy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-25","",31891,""
"Progressivism, Old and New: The Spiritual Moorings of Progressive Reforms","With the tide of progressive reforms facing strong headwinds today, this essay offers a retrospective look at the progressive movement in the U.S.A. and reflects on the lessons to be learned from its triumphs and failures. The case is made that major advances in the progressive agenda came at historical junctions precipitated by dramatic events. The stretch between 1900 and 1920 saw the first wave of social reforms following the late nineteenth century recessions and upsurge in labor unrest. The New Deal took shape in the 1930s in the aftermath of the Great Depression. The Civil Rights movement burst onto the scene in the 1960s in the face of bitter attempts to shore up segregationist practices in southern states. And the 2020s spike in progressive activism gained momentum against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic and the January 6 Capitol riots.

"The Psychological Impact of Quarantine During the COVID-19 Pandemic on Quarantined Non-Healthcare Workers, Quarantined Healthcare Workers, and Medical Staff at the Quarantine Facility in Saudi Arabia","COVID-19 is a viral infectious disease that spreads quickly through droplets. It is highly contagious and could overwhelm the health system. Because of that, many governments established health quarantines for suspected infected people to minimize the spread of this disease. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms and to address the associated risk factors among quarantined non-healthcare workers, quarantined healthcare workers, and medical staff in the Ministry of Health quarantine facility. We conducted an analytical cross-sectional study at the health quarantine in Jazan, Saudi Arabia. The total number of participants was 301 individuals. Furthermore, the study questionnaire was composed of three sections, the first two were the background and clinical characteristics, and the last one was DASS 21 scale. Also, we used SPSS software to analyze the data. Lastly, we implemented logistic regression to assess the predictors of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms among quarantined non-healthcare workers were 51.9%, 60.2%, and 40.6%, respectively. These prevalences were 25.0%, 29.8%, and 16.9% among quarantined healthcare workers and 20.5%, 20.5%, and 27.3% among the medical staff. The predictors of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms among the study participants were female gender, perceived COVID-19 stigma, presence of other relatives in quarantine, comorbidities, and abnormal sleep duration. Health quarantine is an environment that could negatively affect people's mental health. The quarantined non-healthcare workers were the most affected study participants inside this environment. Therefore, the availability of mental health services there could minimize their depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms. Moreover, a home quarantine would be better to reduce these negative symptoms whenever possible.","Alfaifi, Darraj, El-Setouhy","https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S362712","20220524","anxiety; depression; prevalence; risk factors; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-25","",31893,""
"Digital screening for postnatal depression: mixed methods proof-of-concept study","Depression during the postnatal year is prevalent in mothers (17%) and fathers (9%), and suicide is the leading cause of maternal death in this period. Lifelong costs and consequences of untreated postnatal depression (PND) are high due to impacts on infants as well as parents. We aimed to improve access to PND treatment using digital screening. We developed a smartphone app (ClinTouch DAWN-P) that allows parents to monitor their mood daily with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), uploading responses in real-time to a secure server. We evaluated the app's feasibility, acceptability, validity and safety in a proof-of-concept study. Pregnant women (Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°36Ã‚Â weeks gestation) and partners were recruited from antenatal services and invited to complete daily EPDS assessments via the ClinTouch DAWN-P app until 6Ã‚Â weeks postpartum. Participants completed standard paper-based EPDS at two time points for validity comparisons. We examined app acceptability and usability at 6Ã‚Â weeks postpartum with qualitative interviews, examined using framework analysis, and the abridged Mobile App Rating Scale (convergent mixed methods design). Most (96%) eligible pregnant women approached were keen to try the app. Participating mothers (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°15) and partners/fathers (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°8) found the app easy to use, and 91% continued to use it for the full study period. Overall, 67% of daily app-based assessments were completed, with a history of depression predicting lower app usage. Participants suggested modifications to the app and its deployment to improve usability (e.g., extending the response window and including feedback and parenting advice). The validity of app-based responses was confirmed by high agreement with standard EPDS. App-based and paper-based ratings showed perfect agreement in identifying cases of likely PND. There were no serious adverse events relating to app use. Digital PND screening appears feasible, acceptable, valid and safe. It also benefits from being remotely delivered: we enrolled all participants remotely during the first COVID-19 lockdown. Use of digital screening could address known shortcomings of conventional health visitor-delivered screening such as limited staff time, parental unwillingness to disclose difficulties to a professional, lack of partner/father screening, and language barriers. The study was prospectively registered (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT04279093 ).","Eisner, Lewis, Stockton-Powdrell, Agass, Whelan, Tower","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-022-04756-2","20220523","Digital mental health; Framework analysis; Maternal mental health; Mixed methods; Postnatal depression; Screening; Smartphone; mHealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-25","",31894,""
"[Post-COVID syndrome-Focus fatigue]","The World Health Organization (WHO) defines post-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as aÃ‚Â condition which occurs in individuals with aÃ‚Â history of probable or confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus typeÃ‚Â 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection 3Ã‚Â months after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms, lasts for at least 2Ã‚Â months and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis. Core symptoms of post-COVID syndrome are fatigue, dyspnea and cognitive dysfunction, which have an impact on everyday functional level. Neuropsychiatric late sequelae are common in COVID-19 patients, with incidence rates over 30%. Beside the abovementioned core symptoms, sleep disorders, depression and anxiety show increased incidences. According to current opinion, associated neuropsychiatric symptoms are subsumed under the term post-COVID syndrome but are also interpreted as comorbidities, which can promote the manifestation of aÃ‚Â post-COVID syndrome. The key symptom fatigue shows symptom overlapping and comorbidity with psychiatric disorders. Imaging studies indicate an organic correlate of fatigue in post-COVID patients. Furthermore, psychosocial aspects and psychiatric comorbidities, such as depression and anxiety disorders as modulating and therefore potentially treatable factors were identified. Treatment of fatigue consists of pharmacological management with stimulants and antidepressants as well as nonpharmacological strategies, most notably cognitive behavioral therapy and exercise-focused interventions. The evidence for this comes from meta-analyses of tumor-associated or post-viral fatigue. Die Weltgesundheitsorganisation (WHO) definiert Post-COVID-19(Ã¢â‚¬Å¾coronavirus disease 2019Ã¢â‚¬Å“) als Zustand, der bei Personen mit einer anamnestisch wahrscheinlichen oder bestÃƒÂ¤tigten SARS-CoV-2(Ã¢â‚¬Å¾severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus typeÃ‚Â 2Ã¢â‚¬Å“)-Infektion 3Ã‚Â Monate nach Beginn der COVID-19-Symptome und mindestens 2Ã‚Â Monate andauernd vorhanden ist und durch eine alternative Diagnose nicht erklÃƒÂ¤rbar ist. Kernsymptome des Post-COVID-Syndroms umfassen Atemnot, Fatigue und kognitive Dysfunktion, welche das alltÃƒÂ¤gliche Funktionsniveau beeinflussen. Neuropsychiatrische SpÃƒÂ¤tfolgen sind bei COVID-19-Patienten mit Inzidenzraten von ÃƒÂ¼ber 30Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% hÃƒÂ¤ufig. Neben den genannten Kernsymptomen zeigen SchlafstÃƒÂ¶rungen, Depression und Angsterkrankungen erhÃƒÂ¶hte Inzidenzen. Nach gegenwÃƒÂ¤rtiger Meinung werden assoziierte neuropsychiatrische Symptome sowohl unter dem Begriff Post-COVID-Syndrom subsumiert, aber auch als KomorbiditÃƒÂ¤ten interpretiert, welche die Manifestation eines Post-COVID-Syndroms begÃƒÂ¼nstigen kÃƒÂ¶nnen. So zeigt das Kernsymptom Fatigue SymptomÃƒÂ¼berlappung und KomorbiditÃƒÂ¤t mit psychischen Erkrankungen. Bildgebungsstudien deuten auf ein organisches Korrelat der Fatigue bei Post-COVID-Patienten hin, darÃƒÂ¼ber hinaus wurden psychosoziale Aspekte und psychiatrische KomorbiditÃƒÂ¤ten wie Depression und Angsterkrankungen als modulierende und damit potenziell behandelbare Faktoren identifiziert. Die Therapie der Fatigue umfasst neben dem pharmakologischen Management mit u.Ã¢â‚¬Â¯a. Stimulanzien und Antidepressiva auch nichtpharmakologische Strategien, hier vor allem die kognitive Verhaltenstherapie sowie kÃƒÂ¶rper- und bewegungsfokussierte Interventionen.

"A multisystem, cardio-renal investigation of post-COVID-19 illness","The pathophysiology and trajectory of post-Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) syndrome is uncertain. To clarify multisystem involvement, we undertook a prospective cohort study including patients who had been hospitalized with COVID-19 (ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT04403607 ). Serial blood biomarkers, digital electrocardiography and patient-reported outcome measures were obtained in-hospital and at 28-60Ã¢â‚¬â€°days post-discharge when multisystem imaging using chest computed tomography with pulmonary and coronary angiography and cardio-renal magnetic resonance imaging was also obtained. Longer-term clinical outcomes were assessed using electronic health records. Compared to controls (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°29), at 28-60Ã¢â‚¬â€°days post-discharge, people with COVID-19 (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°159; mean age, 55 years; 43% female) had persisting evidence of cardio-renal involvement and hemostasis pathway activation. The adjudicated likelihood of myocarditis was 'very likely' in 21 (13%) patients, 'probable' in 65 (41%) patients, 'unlikely' in 56 (35%) patients and 'not present' in 17 (11%) patients. At 28-60Ã¢â‚¬â€°days post-discharge, COVID-19 was associated with worse health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L score 0.77 (0.23) versus 0.87 (0.20)), anxiety and depression (PHQ-4 total score 3.59 (3.71) versus 1.28 (2.67)) and aerobic exercise capacity reflected by predicted maximal oxygen utilization (20.0 (7.6) versus 29.5 (8.0) ml/kg/min) (all PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01). During follow-up (mean, 450Ã¢â‚¬â€°days), 24 (15%) patients and two (7%) controls died or were rehospitalized, and 108 (68%) patients and seven (26%) controls received outpatient secondary care (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.017). The illness trajectory of patients after hospitalization with COVID-19 includes persisting multisystem abnormalities and health impairments that could lead to substantial demand on healthcare services in the future.","Morrow, Sykes, McIntosh, Kamdar, Bagot, Bayes, Blyth, Briscoe, Bulluck, Carrick, Church, Corcoran, Findlay, Gibson, Gillespie, Grieve, Hall Barrientos, Ho, Lang, Lennie, Lowe, Macfarlane, Mark, Mayne, McConnachie, McGeoch, McGinley, McKee, Nordin, Payne, Rankin, Robertson, Roditi, Ryan, Sattar, Allwood-Spiers, Stobo, Touyz, Veldtman, Watkins, Weeden, Weir, Welsh, Wereski, Mangion, Berry, Basu, Brown, Butler, Dobbin, Dougherty, Dymock, Fallon, Gilmour, Hopkins, Lees, McInnes, McLennan, Savage, Siebert, Tynan, Woodward","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-022-01837-9","20220523","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-25","",31896,""
"Requested to do right things excessively: how citizenship pressure/future focus influence health-related work outcomes inÃ‚Â health organizations during the pandemic","Public health practitioners face citizenship pressure when requested to engage in more extra-roles behaviors during the pandemic. The purpose of the study is to reveal the potential influence mechanism of citizenship pressure on the health and work outcomes of practitioners. The authors completed a three-wave survey from a public healthcare organization during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) delta-variant epidemic. Results of polynomial regression and response surface showed that increased (versus decreased) and consistently high (versus low) level of citizenship pressure induced citizenship fatigue, which in turn increases negative affect/turnover intention. These negative effects of citizenship pressure are weaker among practitioners with a higher level of future focus. Providing counseling service to health care practitioners in adopting a future time perspective of citizenship behaviors is important for public health organizations. This study is among the earliest attempts to reveal the potential dark side of excessive request of conducting organization citizenship behavior which is more commonly seen within public health organizations in the context of pandemic.","Lan, Gong, Yuan","https://doi.org/10.1108/JHOM-10-2021-0374","20220523","Citizenship fatigue; Citizenship pressure; Future focus; Negative affect; Polynomial regression; Turnover intention","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-25","",31897,""
