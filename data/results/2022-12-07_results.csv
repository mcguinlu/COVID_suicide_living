"Factors Associated with Long Covid Symptoms in an Online Cohort Study","Importance: Prolonged symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infection, or Long COVID, is common, but few prospective studies of Long COVID risk factors have been conducted. Objective: To determine whether sociodemographic factors, lifestyle, or medical history preceding COVID-19 or characteristics of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection are associated with Long COVID. Design: Cohort study with longitudinal assessment of symptoms before, during, and after SARS-CoV-2 infection, and cross-sectional assessment of Long COVID symptoms using data from the COVID-19 Citizen Science (CCS) study. Setting: CCS is an online cohort study that began enrolling March 26, 2020. We included data collected between March 26, 2020, and May 18, 2022. Participants: Adult CCS participants who reported a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result (PCR, Antigen, or Antibody) more than 30 days prior to May 4, 2022, were surveyed. Exposures: Age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, employment, socioeconomic status/financial insecurity, self-reported medical history, vaccination status, time of infection (variant wave), number of acute symptoms, pre-COVID depression, anxiety, alcohol and drug use, sleep, exercise. Main Outcome: Presence of at least 1 Long COVID symptom greater than 1 month after acute infection. Sensitivity analyses were performed considering only symptoms beyond 3 months and only severe symptoms. Results: 13,305 participants reported a SARS-CoV-2 positive test more than 30 days prior, 1480 (11.1% of eligible) responded to a survey about Long COVID symptoms, and 476 (32.2% of respondents) reported Long COVID symptoms (median 360 days after infection). Respondents' mean age was 53 and 1017 (69%) were female. Common Long COVID symptoms included fatigue, reported by 230/476 (48.3%), shortness of breath (109, 22.9%), confusion/brain fog (108, 22.7%), headache (103, 21.6%), and altered taste or smell (98, 20.6%). In multivariable models, number of acute COVID-19 symptoms (OR 1.30 per symptom, 95%CI 1.20-1.40), lower socioeconomic status/financial insecurity (OR 1.62, 95%CI 1.02-2.63), pre-infection depression (OR 1.08, 95%CI 1.01-1.16), and earlier variants (OR 0.37 for Omicron compared to ancestral strain, 95%CI 0.15-0.90) were associated with Long COVID symptoms. Conclusions and Relevance: Variant wave, severity of acute infection, lower socioeconomic status and pre-existing depression are associated with Long COVID symptoms.","Matthew S Durstenfeld; Michael J Peluso; Noah D Peyser; Feng Lin; Sara J Knight; Audrey Djibo; Rasha Khatib; Heather Kitzman; Emily O'Brien; Natasha Williams; Carmen Isasi; John Kornak; Thomas W Carton; Jeffrey E Olgin; Mark J Pletcher; Gregory M Marcus; Alexis L Beatty","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.12.01.22282987","20221206","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-07","",42061,""
"Involvement of fatigue in the effect of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on depression following COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination: a before-after study","Background: Patients recovering from COVID-19 often suffer long-term Long-COVID (e.g., depression, poor concentration, anxiety, sleep disturbances, and fatigue). Similar symptoms also rarely seem to occur after COVID-19 vaccination. There is still no effective treatment for these symptoms. We have had a clinical experience that patients presenting with psychiatric/physical symptoms due to COVID-19 or COVID-19 vaccination (defined as Long-COVID and Post-Vaccine patients) often recover after transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and that TMS poorly heals depression in strongly fatigued patients. Aims: 1. Determine whether there are differences in background characteristics and symptoms between Long-COVID and Post-Vaccine patients; 2. Examine whether TMS led to an improvement in their symptoms; 3. Test the involvement of fatigue in the recovery of depression of Long-COVID and Post-Vaccine patients with TMS. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis using the medical records of the outpatient clinic of Tokyo TMS Clinic. Results: 1. We found no differences in initial symptoms and courses of treatment between Long-COVID and Post-Vaccine patients. 2. All psychiatric/physical symptom scores after TMS were significantly better than before. Though these results are of before-and-after studies, numerous reports have suggested that TMS effectively improves depression, insomnia, anxiety, and related neuropsychiatric symptoms, which were also primary complaints of patients in this study. We thus attributed the improvement in QIDS, PHQ9 (Both indices of depression), and GAD7 (anxiety indicator) to TMS. 3. The recovery rate of depression in Long-Covid and Post-Vaccine patients with TMS decreased with the severity of fatigue. Conclusions: This is the first report to elucidate the efficacy of TMS and the factors affecting it for psychiatric symptoms after COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination. Our study may lead to further validation of the effectiveness and mechanisms of TMS in patients suffering from Long-COVID and COVID-19 vaccine long-term adverse reactions.","Ayane Kamamuta; Yuki Takagi; Mizuki Takahashi; Kana Kurihara; Hibiki Shibata; Kanata Tanaka; Katsuhiko Hata","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.12.02.22282982","20221205","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-07","",42062,""
"Back to School: COVID-19 Post-Lockdown Classroom Anxiety","Student psychopathology has been a topic of increasing concern globally in recent years. During the COVID-19 pandemic, students' lives were heavily disrupted due to the change to remote learning. Now that learning is returning to normal, the turbulent changes students have experienced over the past few years may have impacted their mental health. The purpose of this study was to investigate COVID-19-related anxiety and stress levels in students shortly after the resumption of on-campus classes at a private university in Saudi Arabia. A questionnaire-based cross-sectional survey design was used. Three hundred twenty-six participants were a part of the study. Results indicated that a significant number of students reported being occupied with worry and stress related to COVID-19 and that it negatively affected their comfort while on-campus, in their classroom participation, in their social interactions and in their overall university experience. The findings from this study may be valuable to higher education institutions, academic administrators, lecturers and students themselves in helping to minimize friction during the process of students' return to campus.","Rashid, Shaista, Shaikh, Sumayyah, Mardini, Laila, Saad, Farah Samir","https://doi.org/10.3390/educsci12110800","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Education Sciences; 12(11):800, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-07","",42063,""
"Caregiver and Youth Mental Health during COVID-19: Risk and Resilience Factors in a Large National Sample in Peru","The present study examined the prevalence and correlates of psychosocial impairment in a large, national sample of Peruvian children and adolescents (ages 5.0&ndash;17.9) during the COVID-19 pandemic in late 2020. A sample of 8263 online questionnaires were completed by caregivers in Peru between October 23rd&ndash;November 26th, 2020. In addition to sociodemographic and pandemic-related factors, the survey administered the Peruvian Spanish version of the Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC-17) to assess child psychosocial risk. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Kessler-6 (K-6), and Brief Resilience Scale (BRS-6) assessed caregiver depression, psychological distress, and resilience, respectively. In this case, 33% of the children were at overall risk on the PSC-17. In adjusted models, caregiver distress, depression, and low resilience, as well as having a family member with a health risk factor were the strongest predictors of child psychosocial risk, accounting for nearly 1.2 to 2.1 times the likelihood of risk individually and 2.4 to 3.4 times the likelihood of risk when summed. Due to the opt-in sampling method, the obtained sample was likely skewed toward more advantaged families, suggesting that the study's high prevalence of PSC-17 positivity might have been even higher in a more economically representative sample. Given the prevalence of psychosocial problems in Peruvian youth during COVID-19, preventive interventions, with a special focus on family-level approaches that involve and support parents as well as children, are clearly warranted.","Caballero-Peralta, July, Antiporta, Daniel A.; CutipÃ©, Yuri, Vargas-Machuca, RocÃ­o, Rojas, Carlos, Cortez-Vergara, Carla, Vega-Dienstmaier, Johann M.; Benheim, Talia S.; Dutta, Anamika, Holcomb, Juliana M.; PeÃ±a, Felipe, Jellinek, Michael, Murphy, J.

"The potential effects of COVID-19 lockdown and the following restrictions on the status of eight target stocks in the Adriatic Sea","The COVID-19 pandemic had major impacts on the seafood supply chain, also reducing fishing activity. It is worth asking if the fish stocks in the Mediterranean Sea, which in most cases have been in overfishing conditions for many years, may have benefitted from the reduction in the fishing pressure. The present work is the first attempt to make a quantitative evaluation of the fishing effort reduction due to the COVID-19 pandemic and, consequently, its impact on Mediterranean fish stocks, focusing on Adriatic Sea subareas. Eight commercially exploited target stocks (common sole, common cuttlefish, spottail mantis shrimp, European hake, red mullet, anchovy, sardine, and deepwater pink shrimp) were evaluated with a surplus production model, separately fitting the data for each stock until 2019 and until 2020. Results for the 2019 and 2020 models in terms of biomass and fishing mortality were statistically compared with a bootstrap resampling technique to assess their statistical difference. Most of the stocks showed a small but significant improvement in terms of both biomass at sea and reduction in fishing mortality, except cuttlefish and pink shrimp, which showed a reduction in biomass at sea and an increase in fishing mortality (only for common cuttlefish). After reviewing the potential co-occurrence of environmental and management-related factors, we concluded that only in the case of the common sole can an effective biomass improvement related to the pandemic restrictions be detected, because it is the target of the only fishing fleet whose activity remained far lower than expectations for the entire 2020.","Scarcella, G.; Angelini, S.; Armelloni, E.

"The Impact of The COVID-19 Pandemic on the Management of Chronic Disease in South Africa: A Systematic Review","Introduction: The abrupt development of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has posed a threat to persons with chronic diseases' compliance with treatment, which is critical to improving their health, life expectancy, and lowering death and morbidity rates. The public health control measures for the pandemic have been heavily politicized. The focus on the COVID-19 epidemic has resulted in a neglect for chronic disease management. As a result, the goal of this study was to review the literature in order to gain a broader perspective on how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted chronic disease management, as well as to investigate various strategies to deal with similar occurrences in the future when faced with medical emergencies, in order to reduce the potential harm of these measures to non-communicable disease control. Methodology: To analyze and identify full-text studies relevant to the influence of COVID-19 on the management of chronic diseases conducted in an African environment from 2019 to 2021, the suggested reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses were used. Six databases were searched to find relevant studies, which include CINAHL Plus (EBSCO), PubMed, Google Scholar, Medline, ProQuest, and APA PsychINFO. Researchers performed a quality assessment for each included paper prior to data synthesis, as well as a formal risk-of-bias assessment. Result(s): Out of 119 s reviewed, 17 full-text studies were included. Three themes were identified: the impact of COVID-19 on the healthcare system;the psychological impact on people with chronic diseases and healthcare providers;and the digitalization of healthcare services. The majority of studies were conducted in South Africa and other African countries in collaboration with western countries. The majority of studies focused on lessons learned during periods of strict public health measures, however a few empirical investigations of patients or healthcare providers were done. It is recommended that African countries should develop an integrated community-based non-communicable disease (NCD) and infectious disease care model and protocols, initiate innovative ways of central dispensing, pre-packaging and home delivery of medications to stable patients, use of telemedicine, and emphasize mental health services during medical emergencies. Contribution: The study's findings could improve policy implementation regarding the management of chronic diseases during a medical emergency;in this case, COVID-19. It could also improve self-care management. The main goal is to maintain adherence and compliance with treatment to reduce complications and the disease burden. The study mainly focused on the African context. Conclusion(s): The literature revealed that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a severe impact on the management of chronic diseases and disrupted access to related healthcare services in terms of prevention, diagnosis, routine clinical care, and self-care. In addition, the mental health of both patients and healthcare providers has been affected. Chronic diseases should also be considered a public health emergency and should be given the same attention and priority as infectious diseases during a pandemic to reduce the burden of disease, especially in low and middle-income African countries already experiencing a shortage of resources. Rather than depending on the researcher's opinion, viewpoint, and notes taken during the COVID-19 lockdown, primary investigations should be done to address the inadequacies brought to light on the management of chronic diseases due to COVID-19.

"Exploring the gendered mental health experiences of adolescents in Gaza during the Covid-19 pandemic","Adolescent mental health is increasingly recognized as a critical concern. Globally, suicide is among the top 5 causes of death for 15â€“19-year-olds (girls and boys). In the Middle East and North Africa, the prevalence of mental disorders (17.3% for girls and 16.8% for boys) is the second highest in the world. The Covid-19 pandemic has exacerbated adolescentsâ€™ vulnerabilities, particularly through the impacts of lockdowns and school closures. This article explores adolescent experiences in Gaza, drawing on mixed-methods research carried out in late 2020 in refugee camps (29%) and urban settings (71%). The sample involved phone surveys with 505 adolescent girls and boys (12â€“19 years) and their caregivers, in-depth interviews with a subsample of 77 adolescents, and 9 key informant interviews with service providers. Using the Patient Health Questionnaire-8, 9% of adolescents show signs of moderate-to-severe depression, and 19% reported moderate-to-severe anxiety, according to the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, with older adolescents (15â€“19 years) more vulnerable overall, and older girls more prone to self-harm ideation. However, older boys were significantly more likely to turn to substance use as a coping mechanism than older girls (18% vs. 6%). The drivers of these negative mental health impacts during the pandemic include deepening household economic vulnerabilities, heightened intra-family tensions (boys and men spending more time at home, increasing domestic work burdens on girls and women), and isolation from peer networks, especially for girls. We conclude by discussing implications for policy and programming, in line with Sustainable Development Goal 3, to promote mental health and well-being for all. Measures include investing in age- and gender-responsive interventions (including social protection) to support positive coping repertoires among adolescents, mitigating risks of substance abuse, investing in counseling services (online and in-person), and paying particular attention to the most disadvantaged adolescents, especially those out of formal education.","Abu Hamad Bassam, A.; Jones, Nicola A.; Baird, Sarah J.; Abuhamad, Shoroq H.; Diab, Riyad A.; Oakley, Erin M.; Malachowska, Agnieszka M.","https://doi.org/10.1525/agh.2022.1730691","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Advances in Global Health; 1(1), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-07","",42067,""
"Adapting Cognitive Remediation Group Therapy as an Online or Hybrid Intervention for People Aging With HIV and Cognitive Concerns: Focus Group Protocol","""Cognitive impairment is a significant health issue for people aging with HIV/AIDS. Cognitive challenges can include forgetfulness, trouble concentrating, and increasing struggles to learn new skills, all of which contribute to poorer mental health and decreased quality of life. Although there is no specific drug therapy that can reverse the brain impairment, group therapies may help people aging with HIV and cognitive challenges to better cope with their symptoms when combined with their usual medical treatment and follow-up. This community-based study will involve peer-led focus groups to discuss cognitive remediation group therapy â€“ a combination of mindfulness-based stress reduction and brain training activities tested in a pilot randomized, controlled trial â€“ as an in-person intervention for people aging with HIV in 2019. Via a brief demographic survey and technology-mediated focus groups (n = 40) in Ontario and Saskatchewan, we will determine how the intervention could be adapted in an online or hybrid format considering the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Content analysis will be employed whereby a team of independent coders will code the focus group transcripts in line with the co-design framework and """"Double Diamond"""" model of developing interventions, including intervention structure, content, and mode of delivery. Given the aging of the HIV population in Canada, increasing support will be required in addition to medical care to improve quality of life, and proactively address concerns about cognition.

"Demystifying quantum blockchain for healthcare","The healthcare industry and the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic are two areas where blockchain technology might be useful. In this study, blockchain's significance is examined. Blockchain technology and related procedures will be used in future healthcare systems for collecting sensor data, automated patient monitoring, and safe data storage. Because it can store a large amount of data in a dispersed and secure way and provide access whenever and wherever it is needed, this technology greatly simplifies the process of carrying out activities. The advantages of quantum computing, such as the speed with which patients can be found and monitored, may he fully used with the help of quantum blockchain. Quantum blockchain is an additional resource that may be used to safeguard the veracity, integrity, and availability of stored information. Combining quantum computing with blockchain technology may allow faster and more secure medical information processing. In this research, the authors examine the potential uses of blockchain and quantum technology in the healthcare industry.

"Investing in the health workforce, protecting mental health: policy and action taken by WHO : Tomas Zapata","Background The COVID-19 pandemic and the current war in Ukraine have presented opportunities to increase national leadership on mental health, including support health and care workers. Member States across the region have worked closely with the WHO to strengthen their policy levers to support the mental health and occupational safety policies for the workforce at various levels including government, organization and local service levels. To complement these policies, the WHO will launch the WHO Global Health and Care Compact at the Seventy-fifth World Health Assembly in May 2022. Methods The WHO has convened Member States to discuss the policy levers that can support the mental health of health and care workers. These include online multistakeholder webinar series, national policy dialogs, ministerial discussions during the Regional Committee, preparatory consultations for the World Health Assembly to discuss priority areas and policy. More recently with the crisis in Ukraine, the WHO has been working closely with the UN Interagency Steering Committee (IASC) Reference Group on Mental Health and Psychosocial Support in Emergency Settings rolling out services for refugees, including health workers in these settings. Results A number of important policy recommendations are emerging from this work: (1) strengthening national and political leadership;(2) adopting stepped approaches;(3) facilitating collaboration across professions, sectors and levels of syste for more effective responses;(4) strengthening capacity and expertise;(5) monitoring effectiveness for continuous improvement;(6) ensuring acceptability and accessibility. Conclusions Promoting health and well-being and mental health support to the health and care workforce has become a key priority for health systems to enable sustainable national health workforces.

"Health workforce governance during the COVID-19 pandemic: learning lessons from Europe : Gemma Williams","Background This study considers some of the effective governance tools that have been utilised to mobilise, redeploy and repurpose the health workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic to create surge capacity, protect workforce health and wellbeing and ensure effective implementation of vaccination programmes. Methods Data were systematically extracted from the Observatory/WHO Europe/European Commission Health System and Response Monitor, covering the period from March 2020 to May 2021 with a focus on four dimensions of health workforce governance: national/regional government policies;legislation;regulation;the role and remit of employers and management. Results A wide-range of governance actions across all levels were required to ensure the health workforce could provide effective pandemic responses. Creating surge capacity, for example, often required adoption of emergency legislation to facilitate exceptional hiring procedures and the changing of (re-)registration requirements, as well as additional training and development of new competencies among other actions. Putting in place physical and mental health support meanwhile required defining infection control policies, monitoring PPE supply and distribution, ensuring access to free mental health support, and implementation of breaks. Some countries also allowed â€œnewâ€ types of workers to vaccinate;online or in person training;adjustments to payment mechanisms;and creating new supervision requirements. Conclusions Pandemic responses have broken up sclerotic governance structures which have hampered past health workforce development and reform, new training programmes have been rapidly developed, leadership roles have been delegated to a wider-range of health professionals than before and monitoring systems that provide more rapid data on staffing levels have been put into place. Learning from and evaluating these changes will be important to help inform future pandemic responses.","Williams, G.; Buchan, J.; Zapata, T.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Health+workforce+governance+during+the+COVID-19+pandemic:+learning+lessons+from+Europe+:+Gemma+Williams","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; 32(Suppl 3), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-07","",42076,""
"Vaccines for older adults;the low-hanging fruit of disease prevention : Manuela Wennekes","Background The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the significance of vaccination for older adults (OA), however, more health benefits could be gained with vaccination against influenza, pneumococcal disease, herpes zoster and tetanus as their uptake remains rather low. As healthcare professionals (HCP) play an important role in the vaccination decision making of OA, this study identifies obstacles in vaccination communication between HCP and OA. Methods 80 in-depth structured interviews have been conducted with HCPs in Hungary (HU), Italy (IT), the Netherlands (NL) and France (FR). Participants were general practitioners, medical specialists, public health physicians, occupational physicians, pharmacists, geriatricians, specialists elderly care and nurses. The interview included questions on HCPsâ€™ perceptions regarding information provision to OA on vaccines. Data were analyzed cross-country, using thematic analysis. Results Preliminary results reveal that a factor hindering HCPs to initiate conversations with OA on vaccines was lack of time (FR, IT, HU, NL). In hospitals this was often due to (acute) clinical problems taking precedence over discussing vaccines (IT, NL). In ambulatory settings the high number of patients waiting to be seen prevented discussing vaccines with OA (HU). Moreover, HCPs sometimes forgot to discuss vaccines with OA (NL, HU, IT). Patient factors hindering the conversation of HCPs on OA vaccines were a negative attitude (IT, HU) and lack of understanding the information provided (IT, HU). Also, misinformation on vaccines (FR, HU), as well as anti-vax beliefs from patients (NL) or their relatives (FR, IT) hampered the conversation on vaccines. HCPs mentioned their need to learn communication skills to convince OA on vaccines (FR, IT, HU). Conclusions HCPs encounter various obstacles in communicating with OA about vaccines. Lack of time and not recognizing the opportunity to discuss vaccines are important barriers for initiating vaccine conversations. Key messages â€¢ Providing HCPs with communication strategies is important to support HCPs in discussing vaccines with OA. â€¢ Reminder systems are important to help HCPs remember address vaccination.","Wennekes, M.

"Mental health surveillance of German adults in the COVID-19 pandemic: trends in depressive symptoms : Lena Walther","Background While literature on mental health in the COVID-19 pandemic has grown rapidly, studies reporting on developments beyond the first wave using continuous, population-based data are still scarce. We examined monthly estimates of depressive symptom levels in Germanyâ€™s adult population covering almost two years of the pandemic and the year prior. Methods We analyzed representative data from two population-based telephone surveys of German adults: â€œGerman Health Update (GEDA)â€ and â€œCOVID-19 vaccination rate monitoring in Germany (COVIMO).â€ Core symptoms of depression measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) were observed in approximately 1,000 randomly sampled participants monthly from April 2019 to December 2021. We estimated three-month moving means and proportions as well as smoothing curves to produce time series graphs. Statistical comparisons between specific time periods were used to verify results of visual inspection. Analyses were stratified by gender, age and level of education to assess potential time trend differences between subgroups. Results Both the mean population depressive symptom score and the proportion of the population with a positive PHQ-2 depression screen first decreased to below 2019 levels between the first wave and summer of the pandemic and then increased from autumn 2020, reaching levels significantly above 2019 in 2021 and remaining elevated. 2021 saw a 2.2% increase in positive screens compared to 2019. Women, the youngest and eldest adults, and those with a high level of education experienced a particular increase in depressive symptoms between 2019 and 2021. However, we found no corresponding changes in symptom level differences between population subgroups. Conclusions Our finding of elevated depressive symptoms among Germanyâ€™s adults following an increase in the second wave of the pandemic demonstrate the importance of continued surveillance to assess the further development of mental health in the ongoing crisis. Key messages â€¢ Monthly data from April 2019 to December 2021 suggests that depressive symptoms decreased at the start of the pandemic and then increased from autumn 2020, reaching levels above 2019 in 2021. â€¢ Continued mental health surveillance is needed to assess the further development of mental health indicators in the ongoing crisis and its aftermath.","Walther, L.; Junker, S.; Kersjes, C.; Damerow, S.; Mueters, S.; Thom, J.; Mauz, E.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Mental+health+surveillance+of+German+adults+in+the+COVID-19+pandemic:+trends+in+depressive+symptoms+:+Lena+Walther","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; 32(Suppl 3), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-07","",42079,""
"Positive mental health and COVID-19 pandemic in Slovenia : Matej Vinko","Background The COVID-19 pandemic is having a major impact on mental health. In contrast to studies on mental disorders, our study contributes to the under-researched area of the impact of the pandemic on positive mental health. We compare the prevalence of positive mental health before and during the pandemic and identify factors associated with flourishing and languishing mental health during the pandemic. Methods We used data from two nationally representative cross-sectional surveys of Slovenian adults conducted in 2019 and 2021. Outcome included positive mental health (Mental Health Continuum - Short Form). Cross-sectional prevalence estimates were calculated and logistic regression assessed associations between positive mental health and the COVID-19 specific and other health-related factors. Results In 2021, 38.6% (95% CI, 37.0%-40.2%) had flourishing mental health, compared to 61,5% (95% CI, 60.5%-62.5%) before the pandemic. In contrast, the share of people in languishing mental health during the pandemic (8.0%;95% CI, 7.1%-8.9%) was nearly two times higher than in 2019 (4,5%;95% CI, 4.1%-4.9%). Both flourishing and languishing were significantly associated with changes in family relations, social interactions and dietary habits, resilience and COVID-19 literacy. Conclusions Positive mental health in Slovenia worsened drastically during the pandemic compared with before. Results indicate important role of family relationships, social interactions and dietary habits on positive mental health. Both prevention of mental disorders and mental health promotion need to be considered in order to address the full range of public mental health needs, with increased attention to strengthening resilience and health literacy.

"Factors associated with post-COVID-19 confinement vape use in young adults : Josue Eli Villegas Dominguez","Introduction The use of Vape has increased during the pandemic due to the changes generated by it. Currently we have finished the conditions of confinement, so it is important to identify Objective: To determine the factors associated with post-COVID-19 confinement vape consumption in young adults Methods A cross-sectional, prospective study was carried out between January and April 2022, including men and women residents of Veracruz aged between 18 and 35 years, excluding participants with addiction treatment or with a diagnosis of a lung disease. A survey was applied through Google Forms to identify the factors associated with Vape consumption after confinement by COVID-19, including depression, anxiety and stress evaluated with the DASS-21 instrument (Cronbachâ€™s alpha between 0.79 and 0.87). For data analysis, SPSS v22 software was used, X2 test with Odds Ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI95%) and MannWhitney U test, assigning statistical significance with p &lt; 0.05. Results 514 participants were included, with a prevalence of vape use of 28.5%. Physical activity, cigarette consumption by a family member, levels of anxiety, depression and stress showed a value of p &gt; 0.05 for Vape consumption, while other factors (OR/95%CI) such as being female (0.6/0.4-0.9), identifying vape advertising on Facebook (0.35/0.19-0.65), having a family member who vapes (2.4/1.5-3.6), consuming cigarettes (4.2/2.7-6.4) and identifying vape advertising on Instagram (1.5/ 1.0-2.3) had values of p &lt; 0.05 Conclusions Post-pandemic vape use is not affected by anxiety, stress or depression, identifying other factors that favor its use such as the environment in which it develops, such as being someone with a history of tobacco use, in addition to the family smoker and advertising on Instagram, which is a social network that often works as an aspirational image for users, a situation contrary to what is shown on Facebook. Key messages â€¢ Vape consumption continues to be a post-pandemic public health problem, so it is necessary to reinforce educational measures on the subject and the post-Covid complications of its use. â€¢ It is necessary to regulate vape advertising on social networks, as has been done with tobacco in different countries, since it can become a risk factor by showing aspirational images for users.","Villegas Dominguez, J.

"COVID-19 impact on familial relationships and mental health in a representative sample of adults : Giacomo Pietro Vigezzi","Background Benefits of the stay-at-home order imposed in Italy to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission need to be weighed against its impact on citizensâ€™ health. In a country with a solid familial culture and where welfare relies on households, confinement drastically decreased support provided by elder relatives, which may have worsened mental health. Methods A web-based cross-sectional study (LOST in Italy) was conducted on a representative sample of Italian adults during lockdown (27th of April-3rd of May 2020). We asked 3156 subjects to report on reduced help in housework and childcare from retired parents to assess confinement impact on mental health through validated scales before and during the lockdown. Results Overall, 1484 (47.0%) subjects reported reduced housework help from parents, and 769 (64.0%, of the 1202 subjects with children) diminished babysitting support. Subjects reporting reduced housework help had worsened sleep quality (multivariate odds ratio, OR 1.74, 95% confidence interval, CI 1.49-2.03) and quantity (OR 1.50, 95%CI 1.28-1.76), depressive (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.14-1.53) and anxiety symptoms (OR 1.53, 95%CI 1.32-1.78), compared to those reporting unreduced help. Worsening in sleep quality (OR 2.32, 95%CI 1.76-3.05) and quantity (OR 1.80, 95%CI 1.36-2.37), depressive (OR 1.79, 95%CI 1.39-2.31) and anxiety symptoms (OR 1.90, 95%CI 1.48-2.46) was also associated with reduced babysitting help. In subjects with poorer housing and teleworking, mental health outcomes were worse. Conclusions Confinement came along with reduced familial support from parents, negatively impacting mental health. Social networks and support within families provided by older relatives act as a resilience factor and a potential vulnerability that affects mental health outcomes. Health and social services response should be designed to address mental health needs and mitigate long-term health costs caused by the pandemic's unprecedented stressfulness and unknown duration. Key messages National lockdown measures came along with reduced housework help supply for a large proportion of adult parents who presented increased mental health symptoms with unsatisfactory quality of life. A global, multi-level socioeconomic interdisciplinary approach is needed to inform evidence-based family and welfare policies and prevention strategies centred on population wellbeing.","Vigezzi, G.

"Impact of COVID-19 on University Studentsâ€™ Quality of life and mental health in Greece : Apostolos Vantarakis","COVID-19 has a serious impact on peopleâ€™s physical health and mental health. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted an increasing deterioration of university studentsâ€™ quality of life and mental health due to several factors. The COVID-19 pandemic forced university students to take online classes, which may have bad impacts on studentsâ€™ learning. In addition, the students lost many job opportunities during the pandemic. Faced with employment and study pressure and worried about the epidemic, university students were prone to increased overall negative emotion, anxiety and depression. Our study aims to conduct a timely assessment of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the quality of life and mental health of University students. We conducted a cross sectional study using an online interview survey in students at public universities in Greece to better understand the effects of the pandemic on their quality of life and mental health. Three questionnaires were used (WHOQOL-BREF, IES-R and HADS). The data were analyzed with IBM SPSS 26. 1.266 university students from public Greek Universities participated in the study, 73.1% of which were female, 26,3% were male. We observed that 55,8% had a score lower in psychological domain and 52,3% in social domain of WHOQOL-BREF. Also 46.6% of the respondents had a score of 37+ on the IES-R questionnaire, 45% of the respondents had abnormal results regarding anxiety and 33.6% had abnormal results regarding depression. Due to the long-lasting pandemic and onerous measures such as lockdown and stay-at-home orders, the COVID-19 pandemic brings negative impacts on University education and quality of life of students. The findings of our study highlight the urgent need to develop interventions and preventive strategies to address the quality of life and mental health of University students. Key messages â€¢ There is a need for preventative measures for university students to ensure that their mental health and quality of life do not suffer. â€¢ Female students reached higher levels of anxiety in the COVID-19 pandemic period.","Vantarakis, A.; Fotini Tsami, F.; Kanellopoulou, A.; Alexopoulou-Prounia, L.; Tsapara, A.; Alexopoulos, P.; Katsadoros, K.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Impact+of+COVID-19+on+University+Studentsâ€™+Quality+of+life+and+mental+health+in+Greece+:+Apostolos+Vantarakis","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; 32(Suppl 3), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-07","",42083,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on psychosocial work factors and emotional exhaustion among healthcare workers : Fleur van Elk","Background Healthcare workers are at risk to develop mental health problems and to experience adverse psychosocial working conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to investigate across subgroups of healthcare workers i) differences in psychosocial working conditions and emotional exhaustion, ii) changes in psychosocial working conditions and emotional exhaustion during the pandemic compared to the situation before, and iii) impact of different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of hospital pressure on psychosocial working conditions and emotional exhaustion. Methods Data on psychosocial working conditions and emotional exhaustion of five measurements from 1,915 healthcare workers participating in the longitudinal study â€˜the Netherlands Working Conditions Survey- COVID-19â€™ were used. Three subgroups were defined: working with COVID-19 patients, working with other patients, and not working with patients. For each measurement, hospital pressure was determined. Linear mixed models were fitted to analyze the differences across subgroups of healthcare workers. Results Healthcare workers working with patients, in particular COVID-19 patients, had more unfavorable psychosocial working conditions than those not working with patients. Psychosocial working conditions deteriorated among those working with patients compared to pre-COVID-19, but no changes were found for emotional exhaustion. An increasing hospital pressure resulted in improved job autonomy and emotional demands among healthcare workers working with COVID-19 patients, but did not result in differences in other working conditions and emotional exhaustion. Conclusions Psychosocial working conditions deteriorated for healthcare workers working with (COVID-19) patients during the pandemic compared to the situation before the pandemic, while emotional exhaustion did not change in these subgroups. This shows the importance of interventions to improve working conditions of healthcare workers. Key messages Healthcare workers working with (COVID-19) patients experience unfavorable psychosocial working conditions, which deteriorated during COVID-19.

"Mental health of healthcare workers during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands : Maaike van der Noordt","Purpose In March 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Previous virus outbreaks, such as the SARS outbreak in 2003, appeared to have a great impact on the mental health of healthcare workers. The aim of this paper is to study to what extent mental health of healthcare workers differed from non-healthcare workers during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We used data from a large-scale longitudinal online survey conducted by the Corona Behavioral Unit in the Netherlands. Eleven measurement rounds were analyzed, from April 2020 to March 2021 (N = 16,657;number of observations=64,316). Mental health, as measured by the 5-item Mental Health Inventory, was compared between healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers over time, by performing linear GEE-analyses. Results Mental health scores were higher among healthcare workers compared to non-healthcare workers during the first year of the pandemic (1.29 on a 0-100 scale;95%-CI=0.75-1.84). During peak periods of the pandemic, with over 100 hospital admissions or over 25 ICU admissions per day and subsequently more restrictive measures, mental health scores were observed to be lower in both healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers. Conclusions During the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, we observed no relevant difference in mental health between healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers in the Netherlands. To be better prepared for another pandemic, future research should investigate which factors hinder and which factors support healthcare workers to maintain a good mental health. Key messages â€¢ During the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, we observed no relevant difference in mental health between healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers in the Netherlands. â€¢ During peak periods of the pandemic, mental health was observed to be poorer in both healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers.","van der Noordt, M.; Proper, K.

"Resilience and life quality of health professionals in capital of Turkey during COVID-19 pandemic : Ã–zge Tonbuloglu Altiner","Background COVID-19 pandemic has had significant effects on physical and mental health of health professionals. It is thought that resilience protects individuals against mental illness and helps individuals cope with difficulties and stress more effectively. In this study, it was aimed to evaluate resilience, life quality and related factors of health professionals during COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A cross-sectional study was performed among health professionals working at a tertiary hospital in Turkeyâ€™s capital Ankara. An occupation based stratified sampling was done with taking alpha 0.05 and 1-beta 0.80. A questionnaire that consists of sociodemographic information, COVID-19 Impact on Quality of Life Scale and Connor Davidson Resilience Scale was used to collect data. The results of scales were divided into two parts by taking the median values as cut off points. Descriptive/inferential statistics and logistic regression were performed on IBMâ€™s SPSS 27.0 program. Results A total of 987 participants were surveyed. 66% of them were female, and the average age was 36. Multivariate logistic regression analysis results that physicians (OR:1.48, 95% CI:1.05-2.07, p = 0.024) and nurses (OR:1.46, 95% CI:1.08-1.97, p = 0.013) have lower resilience. The impact of COVID-19 on quality of life was higher for the following groups;physicians (OR:2.07, 95% CI:1.43-3, p &lt; 0.001), nurses (OR:1.61, 95% CI:1.10-2.36, p = 0.013), who have bachelor/higher degrees (OR: 1.54,95% CI: 1.02-2.31,p=0.038), infected with COVID-19 (OR:1.33, 95% CI:1.02-1.74, p = 0.034), have COVID-19 related relative lost (OR:1.42, 95% CI:1.06-1.89, p = 0.016), and live with risk groups (OR:1.31, 95% CI:1.01-1.71, p = 0.042). Conclusions Physicians and nurses who take care of patients one-on-one have lower resilience and higher decrease in life quality due to COVID-19 impacts. This result indicates a significant quality drop in health services is inevitable during pandemics and should be considered by the policy makers.

"Incidence of Eating Disorders During COVID-19: A Retrospective Review","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has had marked effects on mental health, including in pediatric populations. Pediatric patients have faced mental health concerns at increased rates including anxiety and depression. Furthermore, patients with eating disorders represent a vulnerable group who have been negatively impacted as well, as a result of lack of support, loss of in-person follow-up and increased relapse. In our centre, and nationally, clinicians have noted a trend towards increased eating disorder referrals and increased hospitalizations during the pandemic. Objectives The objective of this study was to determine the incidence, severity and triggers for eating disorders in the adolescent population during the COVID-19 pandemic and how it compares to the year prior. As well, the subset of patients who were hospitalized for medical stabilization were further analyzed to determine severity of illness. Design/Methods A retrospective chart review compared the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020-March 2021), to the previous 12 months. Inclusion criteria included referrals to an eating disorder clinic and inpatient admissions to pediatrics or mental health services during the specified time frame. Data collected included age of onset, triggers, comorbid mental health conditions, and weight measures. Among hospitalized patients, orthostatic vital changes, need for NG feeds, length of medical stabilization and length of mental health hospitalization were included. Results Overall, 76 patients were included in the study. 44 (57.9%) were referred after COVID, which was significantly increased from the prior year (p=0.05). On average, patients presented at a younger age (14.2 Â± 2.3 vs. 14.9 Â± 1.9;p=0.08). Pre-COVID, approximately 44% of referrals were from family physicians and 19% from pediatrics. During COVID, approximately 39% were from family doctors and 25% from pediatricians. There was an increase in the number of patients requiring hospitalization for treatment (16 vs. 3), with 50% of the post-COVID admissions being direct from the ED Clinic on initial assessment. The reason for hospitalization was unstable vitals/ bradycardia in 68.7% of admissions;self-harm comprised the majority of the other admissions. Conclusion Our results support national and international reports that eating disorder incidence has increased during COVID-19. Patients described loss of routine, anxiety, and isolation as triggers related to the pandemic. Disruptions to daily life including school, sports, recreation, and relationships had profound effects on the mental health of children. The effect of social media on body image has also contributed. It is important for clinicians to screen for mental health conditions, including eating disorders at all available opportunities. Furthermore, this study demonstrates the need for increased services at our centre. Limitations for this study include that it is a single-centre study with a relatively small patient population. As well, it does not capture patients who may have been referred only to psychiatry.","Thevaranjan, Netusha, Lang, Astrid, Oluwole, Oluwafemi, Barba, Rosario Hernandez, Kurji, Ayisha","https://www.google.com/search?q=Incidence+of+Eating+Disorders+During+COVID-19:+A+Retrospective+Review","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Paediatrics & child health; 27(Suppl 3):e3-e3, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-07","",42088,""
"Sharp Increase in Eating Disorders among University Students since the COVID-19 Pandemic : Marie-Pierre Tavolacci","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has caused stress, required lockdowns, curfews and social restriction and thus may have altered physical activity and eating habits among university students. The objectives were to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Eating Disorders (ED) among university students. Methods Between 2009 and 2021, five repeated on line cross-sectional studies were conducted among university students. ED were identified using the French version of the five-item â€œSick, Control, One stone, Fat, Foodâ€ (SCOFF) questionnaire. The ExpaliTM-validated algorithmic tool, combining SCOFF and body mass index, was used to screen EDs into four diagnostic categories: bulimic, hyperphagic and restrictive ED. Results With the five studies, 8981 university students were included in total, 67.3% female with a mean age of 20.7 years. The prevalence of ED was stable between 2009 and 2018 and significantly increased from 31.8% in 2018 to 51.8% in 2021 for women (p trend &lt; 0.0001), and from 13.0% in 2009 to 31.3% in 2021 for men (p trend &lt; 0.0001). Lower food security scores were associated with a higher risk for all ED categories. Depression and academic stress due to COVID-19 were associated with ED regardless of category. Regarding health behaviors, a high adherence to the National nutrition recommendation was a protective factor for the risk of bulimic ED, hyperphagic ED and restrictive ED. A lower frequency of moderate and vigorous physical activity was associated with a higher risk of hyperphagic ED. Discussion Our study has shown a high screening of ED among the students of a French university fourteen months after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. By disrupting academic learning, jobs and social life, the COVID-19 pandemic could have exacerbated existing ED or contributed to the onset of new ED. Initiatives to reinforce early screening of ED to implement targeted interventions in the student population are urgently needed. Key messages â€¢ This finding underlines the need to extensively screen for ED in students population and identify vulnerable individuals at risk of ED. â€¢ By disrupting academic learning, jobs and social life, the COVID-19 pandemic could have exacerbated existing ED or contributed to the onset of new ED.","Tavolacci, M.; Ladner, J.; DÃ©chelotte, P.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Sharp+Increase+in+Eating+Disorders+among+University+Students+since+the+COVID-19+Pandemic+:+Marie-Pierre+Tavolacci","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; 32(Suppl 3), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-07","",42089,""
"Classification and risk factors of Post COVID-19 condition: a longitudinal study in the Belgian population : Pierre Smith","Background Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, most research has focused on the pathophysiology and management of the acute symptoms of COVID-19, yet some people tend to experience symptoms beyond the acute phase of infection, that is, Post COVID-19 condition (PCC). However, evidence on the prevalence of PCC, its symptoms, and mechanisms are still scarce. This study aimed to assess the distribution, patterns of symptoms, and associated factors of PCC in adult with confirmed COVID-19 infection in Belgium. Methods This is a longitudinal cohort study of Belgian adult population with recent COVID-19 infection confirmed via a molecular test and systematically recruited via national tracing call centers. A total of 5181 people were followed-up using online questionnaires at the time of their infection and 3 months later (from April 2021 to February 2022). Their physical, social and mental health was evaluated as well as their acute COVID-19 symptoms and persistent PCC symptoms. These different variables were self-reported. Results Half of the participants reported PCC (49.6%). The most frequent persistent symptoms 3 months after infection were fatigue (28%), headache (18%), and memory problems (12%). Women (OR = 1.67,CI95%=1.40-1.99), people with a lower level of education (OR = 1.23,CI95%=1.02-1.48), obese people (OR = 1.23,CI95%=1.02-1.48), people with chronic disease (OR = 1.97,CI95%=1.40-2.77), and people with a higher number of acute COVID-19 symptoms (OR = 2.56, CI95%=1.83-3.58) or hospitalised (OR = 2.19,CI95%=1.25-3.82) were more likely to report PCC. Finally, a latent class analysis on the 29 PCC symptoms highlighted 3 different classes of symptoms. Conclusions With the growing number of people infected with COVID-19, PCC is becoming an important public health issue. To allow people with PCC to recover, it is essential to have a multidisciplinary approach and to provide early post-acute physical and psychological rehabilitation interventions according to symptom patterns.","Smith, P.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Classification+and+risk+factors+of+Post+COVID-19+condition:+a+longitudinal+study+in+the+Belgian+population+:+Pierre+Smith","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; 32(Suppl 3), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-07","",42090,""
"Self-reported anxiety and depression among COVID-19 patients: A prospective cohort study from Turkey : Ã–ykÃ¼ TurunÃ§","Background It has been shown that COVID-19 can cause symptoms and diseases such as insomnia, depression, and anxiety. This study aimed to describe prevalence of feeling anxious or depressive among COVID-19 patients in six months of follow-up time and its association with baseline independent factors. Methods This prospective cohort study included patients aged =18 years who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at Dokuz Eylul University Hospital, Turkey between November 1, 2020 and May 31, 2021. Participants were interviewed by telephone calls on the 1st, 3rd and 6th months after diagnosis. The dependent variable of the study was self-reported moderate or severe anxiety or depression based on EQ-5D-3L general quality of life scale. Generalized estimating equations were used to identify the factors associated with feeling anxious and depressive after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results In total 5446 patients agreed to participate in the study. Frequency of feeling anxious or depressive at the 1st, 3rd and 6th months after diagnosis were 18.5%, 17.9% and 15.4%, respectively. Older age (=65 years;odds ratio-OR:1.17, 95% confidence interval-CI: 0.95-1.44), female gender (OR:1.76 (1.58-1.96)), bad economic status (OR: 1.62 (1.34-1.97)), having more symptoms (4-5, OR:1.48 (1.21-1.81);=5, OR:1.65 (1.35-2.01)), having more underlying health conditions (1-2, OR:1.35 (1.19-1.54);=3: OR:1.50 (1.13-1.99)), intensive care unit admission (OR: 2.58 (1.70-3.90)) were associated with self-reported anxiety and depression. Conclusions Feelings of anxiety and depression are common in COVID-19 patients and may persist in the long term. Anxiety and depression were associated with gender, economic status and disease severity. Determination of vulnerable groups for anxiety and depression after COVID-19 can be helpful for early diagnosis and initiation of mental care services. Key messages â€¢ As a consequence of Covid-19, anxiety and depression in Covid-19 survivors are common generally. It shouldn't be overlooked or underestimated for the public mental well-being. â€¢ Covid-19 mental effects on the population have a correlation with social determinants of health. Therefore, determining vulnerable groups is a key to planning mental care services.","Siyve, N.; Emecen, A. N.; Keskin, S.; Basoglu, E.; TurunÃ§, Ã–, SÃ¼ner, A.

"Digital coping of parents in conflict-affected communities: a path to maintain health and well-being : Stav Shapira","Background Mobile apps such as WhatsApp have become significant resources for information and social support in times of crisis. Little is known about the role WhatsApp groups play in the context of living in conflict-affected regions. Living in such areas is associated with myriad mental health impacts, and recent studies have identified parents of young children as highly vulnerable in this regard. The studyâ€™s aim was to examine parentsâ€™ digital coping with political violence in southern Israel. Methods In-depth interviews were conducted with 21 parents of young children (&lt;17) residing in communities near the Israel-Gaza border and who are members of local online parentsâ€™ groups on WhatsApp. Data were analyzed to answer questions regarding the benefits and disadvantages that parents assign to online groups;and regarding the role of digital communication in maintaining health and well-being. Results The findings reveal that online groups are often discussed as a shared and ubiquitous coping resource that supports mental health and well-being. Parents report they use the group to share ways to deal with the situation effectively and exchange social support, and as a space that facilitates community cohesion. Furthermore, during escalations, members perceived the group as the most trustworthy source of information. The groupsâ€™ continuous availability had drawbacks as well. Some participants pointed to digital stress caused by the fear of missing out on information, or by information overload. Conclusions Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of digital environments in helping parents cope with a collective stressor: a particularly worthy goal given that social media apps now constitute the primary online connection for most individuals. This has broad impacts on health promotion efforts for mental health issues related to political violence as well as other large-scale health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Key messages â€¢ Digital environments can serve as a platform for successful coping with collective stressors. â€¢ Health practitioners should consider drawbacks when planning digital support efforts.","Shapira, S.; Yeshua Katz, D.; Braun-Lewensohn, O.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Digital+coping+of+parents+in+conflict-affected+communities:+a+path+to+maintain+health+and+well-being+:+Stav+Shapira","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; 32(Suppl 3), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-07","",42092,""

"Health interventions for migrants and refugees in host Southeast Asian countries: a systematic review : Khatia Antia","Background Understanding the different types of health interventions that have been conducted for migrants and refugees is crucial for the improvement and implementation of future health interventions for these populations. This systematic review aimed to identify and to look at the scope and outcomes of health interventions focused on migrants and refugees in the main host counties in Southeast Asia which are Thailand, Singapore, and Malaysia. Methods This study was conducted in line with the PRISMA guidelines and its protocol has been submitted to PROSPERO. The following databases were searched until June 2021: PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct, Cochrane, and Google Scholar. Studies were excluded if: 1) they were conducted outside Thailand, Singapore, and Malaysia;2) had only had qualitative results;3) were non-peer reviewed;4) not written in English. Results The search yielded 8,266 studies, out of which 33 were included in the review. The majority of the studies (79%) were conducted in Thailand of which most were focused on migrants or refugees from Myanmar (85%). Besides two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of mental health interventions, most Thai studies were observational (81%) and focused on infectious disease-related interventions (33%) or the evaluation of health-related programs (29%). Six studies were conducted in Malaysia (18%) of which 4 assessed mental health interventions in refugees. Three of these studies were RCTs, whereas 1 was an observational study. Only 1 study was situated in Singapore and was an RCT evaluating treatments for COVID-19 in migrant workers. Even in studies with similar interventions, outcomes were too diverse to conduct a meta-analysis. Conclusions The low number of studies highlights the gap in literature on health interventions for migrants and refugees, especially in Malaysia and Singapore. More rigorous and cohesive intervention-related research needs to be conducted in Southeast Asia. Key messages â€¢ More intervention-related research for migrant and refugee populations in the main Southeast Asian host countries is needed. â€¢ Interventions for migrant and refugee populations in host countries in Southeast Asia often do not follow the gold standard RCT study design, limiting the knowledge on their effectiveness.","Sappyabanphot, J.; Aye, T.

"Anxiety and depression disorders in Portugal during the COVID-19 pandemic : Juan Rachadell","Background Mental disorders are a major contributor to the global burden of disease. During the first year of the pandemic by COVID-19, increases of 25% in the prevalence of anxiety and depression were reported globally. In Portugal, studies conducted during lockdown showed an increase in the prevalence of these disorders. However, previous studies have shown that negative life events, such as exposure to disasters or grief, later lead to resilience or recovery. It is therefore necessary to study the evolution of these disorders in order to adapt mental health measures. Methods The number of patients registered with â€œP76 - Depressive Disorderâ€ and â€œP74 - Anxiety Disorder/anxiety stateâ€, according to ICPC-2 criteria, and the total number of patients registered in the Portuguese Health Centers for the months of January 2019 to 2022 were obtained from the Portuguese NHS Information and Monitoring System (SIM@SNS). We calculated the percentage of patients with each of the disorders, individually and combined. Data by health regions were also obtained in order to compare the evolution within each region (North, Center, Lisbon and Tagus Valley, Alentejo and Algarve). Results Between January 2019 and 2022, the proportion of patients with anxiety disorder increased linearly from 8% to 9%. Similarly, the proportion of patients with depressive disorder increased from 11% to 12%. When considered together, anxiety and depression disorders affected 21% of users in mainland Portugal at the beginning of 2022. The Alentejo and Center regions have the highest prevalence of anxiety and depression (24.9% and 24%, respectively) and the Algarve region has the lowest (16.74%). The increases were consistent across health regions, with the largest increase in the North region (2.6%) and the smallest in the Central region (1.7%). Conclusions Anxiety and depression disorders increased in mainland Portugal during the years of the COVID-19 pandemic.

"The impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on cause-specific- mortality: a systematic literature review : Davide Golinelli","Background Although investigating the patterns of COVID-19 excess mortality (EM) is relevant, understanding the effects of the pandemic on cause-specific mortality is even crucial and should also be assessed, as this metric allows for a more detailed analysis of the true impact of the pandemic. The aim of this systematic literature review is to estimate the impact of the pandemic on different causes of death, providing a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the phenomenon. Methods We searched MEDLINE to identify studies that reported cause-specific mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. We adopted several inclusion criteria: original article;assessed at least one cause-specific mortality during the pandemic;assessed causes of deaths using the ICD-10 classification;reporting of at least one of the following outcomes: cause-specific mortality estimates or cause-specific EM;full-length articles. Several relevant data were extracted (e.g. publication year, data stratification, territory, country income level, all-cause EM, and cause-specific mortality, etc.). Results The search identified 548 articles. After title,  and full-text screening, we extracted relevant data from the final set of 14 articles. Cause-specific mortality was reported using different units of measurement. Only 9 studies reported the statistical significance and/or confidence intervals. The most frequently analyzed causes of death were cardiovascular diseases (n = 11), cancer (n = 7), diabetes (n = 6), and suicide (n = 5). We found very heterogeneous patterns of cause-specific mortality, for all the specific causes of deaths, except for suicide and road accident. Conclusions The impact of the pandemic on cause-specific deaths has been very heterogeneous and the analyses conducted so far are not exhaustive. We advocate for the urgent need to find a consensus to define uniform methodological approaches to establish the true burden of the COVID-19 pandemic on non-COVID-19 mortality. Key messages â€¢ We reviewed the body of literature to estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on different causes of death, and to provide a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the phenomenon. â€¢ We did not identify unique patterns of cause-specific mortality due to too varied approaches in terms of disease classification and coding, and methodologies used for estimating mortality.","Sanmarchi, F.; Esposito, F.; Adorno, E.; Fantini, M.

"Risk factors associated with depression among French university students during covid-19 lockdown : Thibaut Sabatier","Background During the COVID-19 pandemic studentsâ€™ lives changed drastically, especially regarding their mental health. Social isolation, induced by lockdown, could be the cause of the development of mental disorders in this population. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify factors associated with depression during French first Covid-19 lockdown among university students. Methods This cross-sectional study, which is a part of the COVID-19 International Student Well-Being Study (ISWS consortium), used the validated CES-D 8 score (Center for Epidemiologic Studies - Depression Scale) to measure depression levels. Data on socio-demographics, curriculum, living condition, academic environment and social interactions were collected few days after the first lockdown in France, from 13 to 31 May 2020. The potential impact of risk factors on depression was studied by multinomial logistic regression. Results A total of 3593 students were included. The CES-D 8 mean score was 8.65 (SD = 5.08). Literature students had the highest average CES-D 8 score (9.47, SD = 5.16). Independent factors associated with the higher scores of depressions included having limited financial resources (AOR=2.49, 95% CI = 1.84-3.38) having academic concerns, including students worried about not completing the academic year (AOR=2.93, AOR=2.37-3.64) and stressed with changes in teaching methods (AOR=3.55, 95% CI = 2.82-4.46). Otherwise, living with parents during lockdown and being in a relationship were significant protective factors against depression. Conclusions This study highlights the impact of changing social network, living conditions, and academic environment on depression among university students. Preserving students from social isolation must be a critical priority for universities. Future universitiesâ€™ policy strategy could combine on-site teaching with online courses and consider the role of studentsâ€™ social contacts, with a particular emphasis on mental health.

"Health protection among own account and platform workers during COVID19 in Chile The PWR project : Marisol Ruiz","Background In the last decades, non-standard employment has grown globally. Especially for own account workers (OAW), this implies the self-management of economic, health and other work-related risks. In the context of COVID19, this management was stressed by lockdowns and the novel health risks imposed by an unknown and highly contagious virus, demanding the incorporation of new knowledge and preventive actions. As part of a six-country multiple case qualitative study on non-standard workers (NSW), we explore their experiences and strategies deployed to protect their health while continuing to work. Methods We performed 40 in-depth interviews to NSWs between October 2020 and February 2021, identified through the PWR online-survey and selected through an intentional sampling strategy according to levels of precarity (high-low), gender (male/female) and age (18-39/40-55). Interviews were analysed through abductive thematic analysis. Results We observed a significant transfer to platform, Uber-like jobs in the delivery of goods during lockdown (n = 7). In the absence of institutional prevention programs and provision of protective equipment, OAWs (n = 13) refer the self-provision of COVID19 prevention to protect themselves and their families while continuing to work, deploying a series of strategies amidst limited understanding of both mode of transmission of the virus and actual effective preventive measures. This had serious consequences for them and their families, expressed in anguish, sense of lack of control, fear, and fragility in the face of a major health risk given their constant potential exposure to the virus, leading to both physical and mental health problems, as well as COVID19 infection. Conclusions The substantial growth worldwide of gig delivery work during lockdowns magnified a pressing public health problem, critically requiring social security for gig and OAWs and the development of more equitable and accessible occupational health for all.

"Health, wellbeing, and the impact of Corona in older adults in Dresden, Germany: the LAB60+ study : Karla Romero Starke","Introduction As the proportion of older people increases, it is necessary to evaluate their health and well-being to identify measures to promote healthy ageing. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted older adultsâ€™ health- not just through the infection itself, but also due to infection protection ordinances. Methods LAB60+ is a population-based cross-sectional study investigating, among other things, the physical and mental health of older adults. Residents of Dresden aged 60 years and older were invited to participate in the first half of 2021. Participants answered questions on their habits, health status and wellbeing, using, among others, the Short Form-8 Health Survey and the WHO wellbeing index. Results 2399 people participated in the study (40% response). Participants assessed their physical health similar to the German population. The most common chronic conditions were hypertension (54%), chronic pain (32%) and osteoarthritis (31%). 42% of the participants were overweight and 20% were obese. One-fifth did not engage in physical activity: this number increased with age and decreased socioeconomic status. Participants reported lower levels of wellbeing compared to the German population (58 vs. 67 pts.). One-third had higher levels of depressiveness and half reported an increase in their experienced loneliness due to the pandemic. 34% participated in risky alcohol consumption, but it did not markedly change during the pandemic. The greatest negative impact of the pandemic on health behaviors was physical activity: more than one-third exercised less compared to the time before the pandemic. Conclusions Physical health was comparable to the German population, while depressivity was higher, perhaps due to the pandemic. Age-appropriate interventions should especially target an increase in physical activity. It is important to take measures to reduce the possible negative effects of the pandemic, such as increased loneliness or reduced physical activity. Key messages â€¢ This is the first study on health and wellbeing on older adults (60+ years) in the city of Dresden, Germany. â€¢ The COVID-19 pandemic had a high impact on older adultsâ€™ physical activity and loneliness.","Romero Starke, K.; Hegewald, J.; Schmauder, S.; Kaboth, P.; Uhlmann, L.; Wegge, J.; Marquardt, G.; Seidler, A.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Health,+wellbeing,+and+the+impact+of+Corona+in+older+adults+in+Dresden,+Germany:+the+LAB60++study+:+Karla+Romero+Starke","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; 32(Suppl 3), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-07","",42099,""
"Monitoring COVID-19 related changes in population mental health : Carmen RodrÃ­guez-BlÃ¡zquez","Background The COVID-19 pandemic, and its consequences in terms of control measures and restrictions to normal life, has affected the population mental health. One of the four case studies from the Population Health Information Research Infrastructure (PHIRI) for COVID-19 is focused on mental health with the objective to measure changes in incidence of mental health problems associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in several European countries. Methods Using electronic health records (EHR), data on new episodes of depression or anxiety, prescription of antidepressants and anxiolytics, and visits to primary care, specialized care or emergency units with an episode of depression/anxiety, were collected by participant data hubs at national/regional level for the period 2017-2021. A common data model to collect the data was defined for all participating data hubs and analysis of status prior and during the COVID-19 pandemic was performed using R. Results Data hubs from Austria, Finland, Spain (Aragon), and United Kingdom (Wales) were able to provide aggregated results from raw individual-level data. Preliminary analysis of trends suggests a decrease in new cases of depression and anxiety in the pandemic period (2020-2021) in comparison with previous years. Different trends were observed between data hubs regarding prescription of drugs and the number of primary/specialized care visits due to depression or anxiety. Issues in the access to data in some of the participating data hubs were observed, related to ethical and legal matters, and the lack of centralized registers and of private consultations statistics. Conclusions The results of this use case show that EHR for the secondary use can be retrieved in a common way across Europe to analyse and compare the impact of COVID-19 in population mental health in European countries. However, the process is more complicated and time consuming than expected.","RodrÃ­guez-BlÃ¡zquez, C.; Aldridge, S.; Bernal-Delgado, E.; Dolanski-Aghamanoukjan, L.; EstupiÃ±Ã¡n-Romero, F.; Garriga, C.; Gissler, M.; Lyons, R.

"Mental well-being of healthcare workers in two hospital districts with differing COVID-19 incidence : Noora Rantanen","Objectives Healthcare systems and healthcare workers have been under considerable strain during the COVID-19 pandemic in many countries. Our study aimed to assess the mental well-being of Finnish healthcare workers from two hospital districts with differing COVID-19 incidence rates (HUS, Hospital district of Helsinki and Uusimaa/Helsinki University Hospital;and Kymsote, Social and Health services in Kymenlaakso region) during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in spring 2020. Material and methods The data of this prospective survey study was collected during summer 2020, and a total of 996 healthcare workers (HUS N = 862, Kymsote N = 134) participated. Mental health symptoms were self-reported, and symptom criteria followed ICD-10 classification, excluding duration criteria. We divided participants into symptom categories â€œoften/sometimesâ€ (those who met the diagnostic criteria), and â€œrarely/neverâ€ (those not meeting the diagnostic criteria), and compared these groups to sociodemographic factors and factors related to work, workload, and well-being. Results Despite differences in COVID-19 incidence, the degree of mental health symptoms did not differ between HUS and Kymsote districts (p = 1). A significant relationship was found between self-reported diagnostic mental health symptoms and experiences of insufficient instructions for protection against COVID-19 (in HUS cohort, p &lt; 0.001), insufficient recovery from work (p &lt; 0.001), and subjective increased workload (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions These findings show the importance of sufficient, well-designed instructions for protection from SARS-CoV-2 for healthcare workers, indicating their need to feel safe and protected at work. The workload of healthcare workers should be carefully monitored to keep it moderate and ensure their adequate recovery from work. Sufficient control of the epidemic to keep the burden of the healthcare system as low as possible is essential for healthcare workersâ€™ well-being. Key messages Workload of healthcare workers should be carefully monitored during a pandemic to keep it moderate and ensure adequate recovery in all regions, regardless of the local disease burden. The importance of sufficient, well-designed instructions for healthcare workers and their need to feel safe and protected at work.","Rantanen, N.; Lieslehto, J.; Oksanen, L. Mah, Oksanen, S.

"Multi-method analysis of gender differences in psychological distress among the elderly during COVID : Ieva Reine","As COVID swept through Europe, and the world, with high rates of illness and death, so did symptoms of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, stress, and psychological distress. This study examines the relationship between gender and psychological distress among Latvians over 50 years old within the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Data from Wave 8 COVID-19 data of the Survey of Health, Aging, and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) as an early data version of the SHARE Corona survey conducted between June and August 2020. It features the data collected by telephone (CATI) on topics related to COVID-19 for a large sub-sample of SHARE panel respondents. This study examined a sample of 980 adults over 50 years old in Latvia. Bivariate analysis were performed utilizing the Pearson chi-square test for association to examine differences in symptoms of psychological distress by gender during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Level of significance was determined by the p-value test statistic. Alpha level was established at .05. A chi-square test for association shows that there were statistically relationships between gender and feeling nervous (X2 (2, N = 976) = 22.11, p &lt; .001), feeling depressed (X2 (3, N = 976) = 10.95, p &lt; .01), and trouble sleeping (X2 (2, N = 976) = 20.40, p &lt; .001). This study rejects the null hypothesis that no differences exist between the genders, as women reported greater psychological distress during the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional multi-method analysis is consistent with these findings and concludes that this is due to the greater concern women report for family, and the burden which placed limitations on meeting their children and grandchildren. Key messages Gender differences exist in experiences of psychological distress during the early COVID-19 pandemic among the aging population in Latvia. With the high rates of illness and death associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, so were symptoms of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, stress, and psychological distress.","Queen, C.; Pasupathy, R.; Reine, I.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Multi-method+analysis+of+gender+differences+in+psychological+distress+among+the+elderly+during+COVID+:+Ieva+Reine","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; 32(Suppl 3), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-07","",42102,""
"The Prevalence of Premenstrual Syndrome and Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder during Covid- 19 Pandemic on Late Adolescents","The impact of premenstrual syndrome and its more severe form of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) are not well characterized among the Indian population. Previous studies reported that menstrual-related issues and women's mental health had been severely affected due to pandemic stress. We conducted a cross-sectional study to estimate the prevalence of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic among late adolescent college students living in the Karnataka region of South India. The respondents' demographic data and Premenstrual Symptom Screening Tool (Steiner et al., 2003) were used as assessment tools. The purposive sampling method was used for gathering the data, and 400 students participated in the study. This study identified a significant level of the upsurge in the prevalence of around 19% having premenstrual dysphoric disorder and 43.25% having premenstrual syndrome during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Germany vs Austria: country-specific differences in becoming parents during the COVID-19 pandemic : Jasmin PreiÃŸ","Background Becoming parents can be a big challenge, but how is this experience affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and its measures? Methods Between 18.05.2021 and 01.07.2021, we conducted an online-survey to gain insight into becoming parents during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany and Austria. The sample mentioned in this report consists of biological mothers living in Austria (n = 952) and Germany (n = 1012) who gave birth between the 16th of March 2020 (the beginning of the first lockdown in Austria) and the time of completion of the study. The mothersâ€™ current stress levels were assessed with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and postnatal depression symptoms were quantified with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Furthermore, we included questions to measure perceived social support and pandemic-related stress. Results Current stress levels (U = 555677.50, z = 5.90, p &lt; .001) and postnatal depression symptoms (U = 546354.00, z = 5.15, p &lt; .001) were significantly higher in the German sample as compared to the Austrian sample. Yet, Austrian mothers reported higher social support as compared to the German mothers (U = 387834.00, z = -7.48, p &lt; .001). Furthermore, we found higher levels of perceived social support to be associated with lower current stress levels (rs = -.40, p &lt; .001). On average, perceived stress was moderately high in both samples (MGermany = 18.58, SDGermany = 6.60;MAustria = 16.76, SDAustria = 6.57). Conclusions Stress levels and depression symptoms seem to be high and prevalent due to the pandemic and it is highly indicated to take action such as supporting families in need and emphasising social support in order to reduce mental health problems of parents as well as their children in the aftermath of the pandemic. Key messages â€¢ Findings underpin the protective role of social support against psychological distress in new parents and show the high strain at current. â€¢ Action needs to be taken in order to support parents and children at risk.","PreiÃŸ, J.; Florea, C.; Angerer, M.; Schabus, M.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Germany+vs.+Austria:+country-specific+differences+in+becoming+parents+during+the+COVID-19+pandemic+:+Jasmin+PreiÃŸ","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; 32(Suppl 3), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-07","",42104,""
"Ambulatory care visits and admissions for suicidal ideation and self-harm in Canadian adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic: a population-based analysis","Database, and Hospital Morbidity Database. The primary outcome was ambulatory care visits for a composite of suicidal ideation, intentional self-poisoning, and intentional self-harm. Results were stratified by age and sex and expressed as a rate (proportion of encounters with an outcome per 100 encounters). We compared the differences (delta) in slopes (average increase in outcomes) between April 1, 2015, to March 31, 2020, and April 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021 to determine if the expected rate (pre-pandemic) differed significantly from the observed rate (pandemic). Results From April 1, 2020, to March 31, 2021, compared to April 1, 2015, to March 31, 2020, the rate of ambulatory care visits and admissions for all conditions decreased. The average quarterly rate of ambulatory care visits for the composite among males 10-14 years, increased by 40.3%, from 0.57 to 0.8 (slope delta=0.1;95% CI: 0.02, 0.18;p=0.012). Among females 10-14 years, the rate increased by 85.1%, from 1.81 to 3.35 (slope delta=0.7;95% CI: 0.43, 0.97;p&lt;0.001). Among males 15-18 years, the rate increased by 29.5%, from 1.56 to 2.02 (slope delta=0.13;95% CI: -0.02, 0.28;p=0.078). Among females 15-18 years, the rate increased by 33.6%, from 3.18 to 4.25 (slope delta=0.26;95% CI: -0.16, 0.68;p=0.192). The average quarterly rate of admissions was significant for females 10-14 years and increased by 27.7%, from 8.59 to 10.97 (slope delta=1.99;95% CI: 0.57, 3.41;p=0.017). Conclusion The proportion of ambulatory care visits and admissions for emotional symptoms, suicidal ideation, and self-harm during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic increased compared to pre-pandemic rates among adolescents 10-14 years in Canada.

"Primary health care reforms in Slovenia: leveraging existing structures to expand care : Pia Vracko","Primary health care (PHC) in Slovenia is delivered mainly by a network of 63 public community-based primary health care centres (CPHCs), serving as entry points to the health system. Here, multidisciplinary teams provide an array of preventative, diagnostic, therapeutic, palliative, and health promotion services under one roof. Since 2011, several reforms in PHC highlight integrated care. A national scale-up of Family Medicine Practices is underway, where all family medicine teams include a 0.5 FTE registered nurse to improve prevention, early diagnosis and care coordination of chronic patients. Health promotion centers (HPCs) are being introduced in CPHCs to support people in healthy lifestyle, with currently 28 HPCs managed by CPHCs and supported operationally by the National Institute of Public Health. New mental health centers facilitate access to comprehensive mental health care. In 2020, dedicated temporary COVID-19 units in CPHCs played a key role in treating mild/moderate cases and shielding hospitals from overburden. Regarding implementation, pilots have been critical to creating a strong evidence base to enable sustainable (sometimes external) financing, while innovations capitalize on existing links between Slovenia's primary care and public health functions and the Ministry of Health for governance and the flexibility of the multidisciplinary, multiple-practice care model represented by CPHCs. Though this has eased their initial introduction into existing structures, challenges remain. These include dissatisfaction among family physicians due to high administrative burden and an outdated CPHC governance model that limits managersâ€™ authority as well as workforce shortages in public health and primary care. Financial incentives, task shifting, and adjustments to education and training have been used to mitigate these issues. Slovenia's experience may serve as a case study for countries interested in improving their primary healthcare services.","Polin, K.; Scarpetti, G.; Albreht, T.; Petric, V.; Vracko, P.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Primary+health+care+reforms+in+Slovenia:+leveraging+existing+structures+to+expand+care+:+Pia+Vracko","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; 32(Suppl 3), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-07","",42106,""
"Parental perception about the pandemic impact on mental health of children: a cross-sectional study : Sonia Pinto","Background The pandemic may increase mental issues among children. This study aimed to explore parental perceptions on the pandemic impact on the health status of their children, with a focus on mental health. Methods An online nationwide cross-sectional study has been conducted amongst Italian parents (from April 2022-ongoing). The survey included: Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), Kessler-6 (K6) for parent's psychological distress, and pandemic-related items. The outcomes were: child's SDQ above the clinical cut-off and perceived child's worsening of sleep, appetite, physical and mental health during the pandemic. Multivariable regressions were run (p &lt; 0.05 as significant). Results Up to date, participants were 333 (88% female). Mean age was 40.7 years (SD = 6.7). Considering their children, 52.9% were female and mean age was 6.62 (SD = 4.3). A total of 12.6% of children passed the SDQ cut-off. Having parents who are healthcare workers (adjOR=4.1), having parents positive for K6 (adjOR=4.0) and having a poor economic situation (adjOR=3.9) were significantly associated with a higher probability of passing the cut-off. Considering the pandemic, 15.4% declared their child had worse sleep, 12.2% lower appetite, 6.6% more physical issues, and 22.9% more mental issues. Using electronic devices more than before the pandemic was significantly associated with worsening of sleep (adjOR=2.9) and appetite (adjOR=6.9). Having parents who are healthcare workers was significantly associated with worsening of sleep (adjOR=2.3) and mental health (adjOR=2.4). Having parents positive for K6 was significantly associated with worsening of mental health (adjOR=5.3). Conclusions This study suggested a perceived substantial worsening of children's health, especially considering mental health. Exploring how parents recognize their children's health and how the COVID-19 has changed daily habits should be considered as a public health priority in Europe. Key messages Children having parents who are healthcare workers, having parents positive for K6 and having a poor economic situation had a higher risk to pass the clinical cut-off of SDQ.

"The 2009-2014 economic crisis and deaths by suicide in Portugal: time series analysis : Vera Pinheiro","Introduction Population health, including mental health, is influenced by its socioeconomic context. After the 2008 global economic crisis, studies found contradicting results: some showed an increased risk for self-harm and suicidal behavior, while others found the opposite association. To the best of our knowledge, there is no research in Portugal on the subject. Thus, our aim was to estimate the impact of the Portuguese economic crisis of 2009-2014 on the death rate by suicide and self-inflicted injury in Portugal. Methods A retrospective ecological study with an interrupted time series analysis of deaths by suicide and self-inflicted injury (data from the National Statistics Institute) in mainland Portugal, in 2003-2014, was performed. Resident population data was also retrieved from the National Statistics Institute. Binomial negative generalized linear models were used to compare rates and trends before (2003-2008) and during (2009-2014) the economic crisis. All rates were stratified and adjusted for seasonality. Results The economic crisis was associated with 13% a step increase in the death rate due to suicide and self-inflicted injury, with unemployment playing a significant mediating role, being negatively associated to the outcome. Differences between groups exist, with males, working-age groups and the North and Centre regions being the most impacted, globally. Conclusions Economic downturns pose risks for suicidal behavior. Unemployment may play a role in this association. Employment protection schemes can prevent this impact, so urgent action is needed to prevent economic crisis leading to additional suicides, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic crisis it caused. Key messages â€¢ The Portuguese economic crisis of 2009-2014 was associated with an increased death rate due to suicide, especially in males, working-age groups and the North and Centre regions. â€¢ Unemployment may play a role in this association, and active labour market programmes can prevent the negative impacts of economic crisis leading to additional suicides.","Pinheiro, V.; Caetano, C.; Pereira da Silva, S.; Nunes, B.","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+2009-2014+economic+crisis+and+deaths+by+suicide+in+Portugal:+time+series+analysis+:+Vera+Pinheiro","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; 32(Suppl 3), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-07","",42108,""
"Decolonising global health in Africa: research agendas in public health, law, and human rights : David Patterson","Background In recent years the Groningen Centre for Health Law (â€˜GCHLâ€™ - formerly the Global Health Law Groningen Research Centre), Netherlands, has held annual summer schools on global health, law, and human rights. Responding to calls to decolonise global health (Fofana, 2021), in February 2022 GCHL convened an online academic colloquium to explore the issues in Africa. Panellists and discussants comprised leading African academics and advocates for public health, law, and human rights. Objectives 1. Identify priority current and emerging issues in global health, law, and human rights in the African region with, where possible, reference to the climate crisis. 2. Explore opportunities for identifying academic institutions, networks, and researchers working these issues across Africa. 3. Identify opportunities to support collaboration between institutions, networks and researchers and other actors to address the issues identified across the region Results Top public health issues identified for further research included: public health law frameworks in Africa;One Health and climate change;inequality in the distribution of the determinants of health and disease;international trade and public health;the right to benefit from scientific progress (e.g. in accessing vaccines for COVID-19);gender-based violence;public health and agri-food systems;noncommunicable diseases;healthy diets;poverty;mental health;social protection;and plastic pollution. The first meeting of the network on health, law and human rights in Africa was held in May 2022. The second academic colloquium was held in July 2022, co-hosted with Moi University and the University of Nairobi, Kenya. Conclusions Public health and legal academics in Africa are ready to engage systematically with European partners to address key health-related law and human rights issues of global interest. Research agendas should reflect African priorities, and collaboration should be led by African institutions.

"Changes in university student health behaviors since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic : Marie-Pierre Tavolacci","Background The COVID-19 pandemic lead many upheavals in the life habit whith lockdowns and curfews since March 2020 and possibly in the health behaviours of university students could be impacted. The objective of the study was to assess the evolution of the health behaviors of university students between before the COVID-19 period and May 2021. Methods Two retrospectives online studies of a university students in France were in May 2020 and May 2021 were conducted. Socio demographics and academics environment data, tobacco smoking, binge drinking, cannabis use, and vigorous physical activity were collected in a declarative way. Results In 2020, 3483 (72.5% of women, mean age 20.9 (SD = 2.46)) and in 2021, 3504 (74.4 of women, mean age 20.73 (SD = 2.32)) university students were included. After logistic regression, in 2020 compared to the pre-COVID19 period, the regular vigorous physical activity didn't change significantly while there appears to be a study period effect with a decrease of the regular binge drinking (AOR=0.24 IC95% [0.20,0.29]). In 2021 compared to the pre-COVID19 period, the regular vigorous physical activity and the regular binge drinking decreased respectively, (AOR=0.53;IC95% [0.48,0.59]) and (AOR=0.60 IC95% [0.52,0.70]). Regular tobacco smoking and cannabis use didn't change significantly in 2020 and 2021 compared to the pre-COVID period. Discussion: The decrease of binge drinking and physical activity between preCOVID-19 and 2021 could be attribute by the restricting mobility and social interactions.

"Inequalities in psychological distress before and during the COVID-19 pandemic among UK adults : Kishan Patel","Background Evidence about how population mental health has evolved from before and over the COVID-19 pandemic remains mixed, with impacts on mental health inequalities being unclear. We investigated changes in mental health and sociodemographic inequalities from before and across the first year of the pandemic. Methods Data from 11 UK longitudinal population-based studies with pre-pandemic measures of psychological distress were analysed, estimates pooled, and stratified by age, sex, ethnicity, country and lone household status. Trends in the prevalence of poor mental health were assessed before the pandemic (TP0) and across the pandemic at three time periods (initial lockdown (TP1), easing of restrictions (TP2), and a subsequent lockdown (TP3)). Results In total, 49,993 adult participants were analysed across the 11 cohort studies. There was an overall worsening in mental health from pre-pandemic scores across all three pandemic timepoints, (TP1 Standardised Mean Difference: 0.15 (95% CI: 0.06 - 0.25);TP2 SMD: 0.18 (0.09 - 0.27);TP3 SMD: 0.21 (0.10 - 0.32)) with no evidence of improvement during the period of eased lockdown restrictions in summer 2020. Changes from pre-pandemic psychological distress were higher in females during the pandemic (TP3 SMD: 0.23 (0.11 - 0.35)), amongst those with degree-level education (TP3 SMD: 0.26 (0.14 - 0.38)), and adults aged 25-44 years. We did not find evidence of changes in distress differing by ethnicity, lone household status or UK nation. Conclusions The substantial deterioration in mental health seen in the UK during the first lockdown did not reverse when lockdown lifted and a sustained worsening was observed across the pandemic. Mental health declines have been unequal across the population and these results have implications for policy, including the need for specific investment for support for those most affected to mitigate the effects of the pandemic and measures to reduce inequalities within these specific groups. Key messages â€¢ A sustained deterioration in mental health was observed from before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and did not recover when social restrictions were eased. â€¢ Deterioration in mental health varied by sociodemographic factors, namely age, sex, and education, and highlights a need for improved mental health care provision to minimise widening inequalities.","Patel, K.; Robertson, E.; Kwong, A.

"Interventions to improve teamwork and wellbeing in primary care settings: a mixed method review : Maria Panagioti","Background General practices are experiencing increasing pressures due to rising demand, declining staff numbers, and knock-on impacts on patient care. The COVID-19 pandemic has added further challenges and reinforced the importance of teamwork and organisational settings. We undertook a mixed-method systematic review to explore which interventions can improve teamwork within primary care and improve inter-sector partnerships with other health and social care services. Methods Five major bibliographic databases were systematically searched for relevant studies from inception to February 2022. We included controlled intervention study designs and linked qualitative studies. For amenable data, meta-analysis is being undertaken using random effects models taking into account the between study heterogeneity (quantified using the I2 statistic) and potential publication bias (funnel plots and Egger's test). The qualitative studies are analysed using thematic analyses. Results The original search yield of 3012 studies, of which 14 studies with 1,534 participants were include in our analyses. Most of the evaluated interventions focused on improving non-technical skills and provided evidence of improvements in the quality of teamwork in primary care. Meta-analysis and narrative synthesis is undertaken to examine the impact of the teamwork interventions on staff outcomes (team attitudes, knowledge, and functioning;wellbeing), and patient outcomes (e.g. quality of patient care, patient satisfaction/experience). Conclusions The findings provide information of immediate importance for the mental health and wellbeing and teamwork support of professionals entering primary care and for the organisation of primary care services.","Panagioti, M.; Tyler, N.; Hodkinson, A.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Interventions+to+improve+teamwork+and+wellbeing+in+primary+care+settings:+a+mixed+method+review+:+Maria+Panagioti","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; 32(Suppl 3), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-07","",42112,""
"Non-standard employment and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain: a qualitative study : Eva Padrosa","Background The COVID-19 pandemic entailed a deep economic crisis that affected working populations globally. However, non-standard workers (NSW, understood as workers with temporary contracts, not working full-time, self-employed or not paying taxes/making active pension contributions) were more severely hit than workers with more stable and protected jobs. The aim of this study thus was to explore the experiences of NSW during the pandemic and how these affected their mental health in Spain, one of the countries in Europe with the highest shares of temporary and self-employment and the one that applied the most restrictive containment measures during the first waves of the pandemic. Methods As part of a larger multi-country study, 41 semi-structured interviews with NSW aged 25-55 were conducted between March-July 2021 and analyzed thematically. Results Analyses revealed that job loss or insecurity and subsequent reductions in income were central to the experience of NSW during the pandemic in Spain, which affected their mental health negatively. Both the existing social protection framework and the policies deployed during the pandemic to outweigh these consequences were perceived by NSW as insufficient or could not access them due to their condition of NSW. This was particularly the case for self-employed and temporary agency workers. Moreover, NSW expressed that containment measures and reductions in income prevented them from engaging in activities to cope with such adversities, aggravating their mental health. Conclusions These findings suggest that, in Spain, the pandemic intensified but also made more visible the defenselessness of NSW (especially self-employed and temporary agency workers) in terms of social protection in the event of sudden unemployment or reductions in income. This situation had harmful consequences for their mental health. Yet, new policies and measures fall short in fitting the necessities of an increasing share of the workforce. Key messages â€¢ In Spain, non-standard workers are more vulnerable to and defenseless against sudden unemployment or reductions in income. â€¢ The pandemic intensified this problem and put them at higher risk of suffering from poor mental health.","Padrosa, E.; JuliÃ , M.; BolÃ­bar, M.; GutiÃ©rrez-Zamora, M.; Escrig-PiÃ±ol, A.; The, P.

"COVID-19 as a wake-up call Potential for more sustainable attitudes and behaviors in Poland","Poland has been quite hesitant to adopt changes (both systematic and on the individual level) necessary to mitigate climate change. The country's economy is heavily dependent on coal mining, which is supported by a very powerful Silesian (main coal region in Poland) culture, with the miner being the most respected profession in society. In addition, there being a rather ""young"" European democracy, paradigms of economic growth and consumerism are still dominant development drivers. In this context, introducing a societal change to support the necessary energy transitions and drastically cutting fossil fuels emissions seem extremely challenging. However, COVID-19 pandemic has forced certain, at least temporary, changes to people and the economy. In our study, we have investigated what potential comes from redefining people's everyday rituals for fighting climate change. We have focused on different behaviors with high-carbon footprints, such as daily transport, travel, consumption, and food waste. It turned out that some of these changes could be introduced in the future. What is more, the health crisis and the lockdown inspired sort of national reckoning on "" what is really important"" and, to some extent, reconnection with nature. If appropriately supported, it gives a great potential for societal change towards sustainable living. The study was conducted in April and May 2020, during the so called `first national quarantine'. It was based on the combination of qualitative and quantitative methods. For purposes of this paper, we focus on the results of the former method only, which provides much better insights into the narratives of the Anthropocene in the Silesian region. The survey was based on 150 in-depth interviews conducted via online communication tools. Although such a sample is not representative by definition, it aims to display diverse strategies and changing habits of various subjects in different regions of Poland, as well as various life situations in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic (families with kids, pensioners, young adults, etc.).","Orlowska, J.; Piekarz, A.","https://www.google.com/search?q=COVID-19+as+a+wake-up+call.+Potential+for+more+sustainable+attitudes+and+behaviors+in+Poland","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Narratives in the Anthropocene Era;: 285-301, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-07","",42114,""
"Assessment of Psychological Impact of Covid Pandemic on Frontline workers at Points of Entry,Pakistan : Nadia Noreen","Background The unprecedented public health crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused heightened levels of stress and fear among health care workers.With the advent of COVID-19 in Pakistan,frontline workers of POEs have been under physical and psychological pressure including a high risk of infection, abnormal levels of workload, prolonged working hours, lack of personal protective equipment for safety from contagion, isolation, exhaustion, and lack of contact with family.The study aims to assess the impact of Covid-19 on the mental health of frontline healthcare workers. Methods A descriptive study was conducted among HCWs across points of entry from 1st October 2020 to 31st December 2020.Data was collected using a structured questionnaire.Depression, anxiety, and stress scale (DASS-21)was used for the assessment of depression, stress, anxiety. Descriptive analysis of socio-demographic and professional factors was done. Multivariable logistic regression analysis (MLRA) was performed using SPSS version 23.0. Results A total of 628 participants (586 males and 42 females) completed questionnaire.The mean age of the participants was 42.6 Â± 45.9 years. The majority of the respondents were married (94.3%). The frequency of depression, anxiety, and stress in the HCWs was 12.1%, 42.3%, and 22.1 %, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis found that the depression in HCWs was significantly associated with the profession and age (P &lt; 0.001). The anxiety in HCWs was associated with their age and gender (P &lt; 0.005). The stress in HCWs was significantly associated with their age (P &lt; 0.05). Conclusions The HCWs at the Points of entry across Pakistan showed mild to moderate symptoms of DAS.

"COVID-19 and its impact on the school psychology internship","School psychologists and their interns were required to adapt their practices and the delivery of comprehensive school psychological services as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. With an already existing gap in the literature regarding supervision in school psychology, an even larger gap exists due to COVID-19. The present study aimed to promote a better understanding about how university training programs prepared school psychology interns during the COVID-19 pandemic in the 2020-2021 academic year to develop competency along the 10 domains of practice listed in the NASP (2020) Practice Model. Ten participants from NASP-approved school psychology training programs were interviewed using a semi-structured interview protocol to gain an understanding of the commonalities of how they prepared interns during the COVID-19 pandemic. A thematic analysis was conducted and revealed six overarching themes that, when put together, tell a story about COVID-19's effect on the school psychology internship. The themes are represented with direct quotes from participants: (1) ""They had such an unusual and highly disrupted experience,"" (2) ""We did whatever we needed to do to make it work,"" (3) ""While very different, it still mimicked the original plan,"" (4) ""We had to support them as they navigated these challenges,"" (5) ""I think we're talking more than ever about mental health,"" and (6) ""It's not all bad.""

"Political consciousness, agency and mental health Students in the Covid 19-Pandemic : Yasemin Niephaus","Introduction The influence of social crises in their objective quality as well as their subjective processing on health well-being has been researched many times. The loss of agency that can be observed in the course of social crises is considered to be a negative mediating factor between both variables. The Corona pandemic was also associated with a loss of options and routines for action for most of the population. Methods We conducted two quantitative surveys on mental health in the pandemic in spring 2020 and autumn 2021. While the first international comparative survey was conducted under the auspices of the University of Antwerp, the second was carried out at five German universities. Results The quantitative data show the negative impact of the pandemic on studentsâ€™ mental health - CES-D 8 (0 to 24) (xÂ¯2020=9.22, xÂ¯2021=9.38). They also show a negative correlation between whether studentsâ€™ concerns are sufficiently considered by policy makers in the pandemic and depressive symptomatology (r=-0.146, p &lt; 0.01). That is, the less satisfied students are with political measures, the lower the depressive symptomatology. Conlusion Against the background of the socio-psychological inequality study â€˜Die Arbeitslosen von Marienthal', which is considered a classic, this connection is far less paradoxical than might initially be assumed if one interprets political awareness as a correlate of a subjectively perceived power to act, which has a positive effect on mental health. Based on this thesis, we have opted for a mixed-methods design and are conducting qualitative interviews on subjective crisis processing, the results of which we will be able to present at the conference. Key messages â€¢ Subjectively perceived agency reduces the health-reducing effect of social crises. â€¢ Students are a relevant group to learn from for capacity building.","Niephaus, Y.; Nink, T.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Political+consciousness,+agency+and+mental+health.+Students+in+the+Covid+19-Pandemic+:+Yasemin+Niephaus","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; 32(Suppl 3), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-07","",42117,""
"Mapping Mobile Health Clinics in Canada: Delivering Equitable Primary Care to Children and Vulnerable Populations","Background Low-income and racially diverse populations often have multiple barriers in accessing healthcare and are at increased risk of poor health outcomes. COVID-19 exacerbated these health inequities: decreased in-person appointments, difficult access to virtual care and deprioritization of elective clinical activity led to delays in well-child visits and vaccination. This public health emergency highlighted a need to develop alternative models to enable access to primary care for vulnerable children. While mobile clinics are well-established in the United States, little is known about them in Canada. Objectives This study aims to characterize Canadian mobile clinics providing primary care health services to vulnerable populations, including children, and seeks to inform the implementation of a pediatric mobile clinic under development. Design/Methods This environmental scan screened scientific databases and the grey literature using a combination of terms designating mobile health clinics and Canadian locations. Relevant Canadian primary care mobile clinic initiatives were subsequently included. We defined primary care mobile clinics as movable health care units providing primary healthcare services delivered by general medical practitioners (pediatricians and family physicians). Examples of excluded initiatives were mobile clinics focused on education/literacy, dental care, vision care, endocrinology, cancer screening, safe injection sites, vaccination, physical rehabilitation and urgent care. Descriptive statistics and qualitative analysis were performed. Results 29 clinics were identified, of which 26 are still active. Most clinics were located in Ontario (n=11), followed by British Columbia (n=8), Alberta (n=5), Quebec (n=2) and the Maritimes (n=2). The first mobile clinic in Canada was launched in 1996, with an increasing number of new clinics in 2021. While all clinics served vulnerable populations, some targeted specific groups, such as children, people experiencing homelessness, immigrants, LGBTQ+ individuals and Indigenous peoples. We identified three pediatric mobile clinics, two of which targeted teenagers. Onboard the clinics, physicians often worked with nurses, outreach workers and social workers. These professionals provided primary care services, as well as healthcare navigation, sexual education, mental health care, harm reduction supplies, vaccination and emergency care. All mobile clinics partnered with their local government, charities or businesses to fund their initiative. Conclusion Mobile health clinics are a growing model of primary care in Canada. They are the result of a multidisciplinary collaboration between healthcare providers, social workers and outreach workers. To this date, Canadian pediatric mobile clinics remain a handful and represent an interesting avenue to address health inequities in children, during the pandemic and beyond.","Nguyen, Anne Xuan-Lan, Kevorkov, Alexander, Li, Patricia, Benkelfat, Rislaine","https://www.google.com/search?q=Mapping+Mobile+Health+Clinics+in+Canada:+Delivering+Equitable+Primary+Care+to+Children+and+Vulnerable+Populations","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Paediatrics & child health; 27(Suppl 3):e43-e44, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-07","",42118,""
"Change in the financial situation of students during COVID-19 and its impact on depressive symptoms : Sarah Negash","Background Students faced unique challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic that may have affected their financial situation as well as their mental health. This study sought to examine whether changes in financial situation before and during the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with depressive symptoms among German university students. Methods The cross-sectional COVID-19 German Student Well-being Study (C19 GSWS;N = 7,267) was implemented at five German universities between 27.10. and 14.11.2021. Students were asked if they had had sufficient financial resources to cover monthly expenses before the pandemic, as well as during the first and third waves of the pandemic. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the CES-D 8 (score ranges 0-24) and the PHQ-2 (0-6);higher scores indicating more severe depressive symptoms. Linear regression models were used to examine associations between variables. Results A worsened financial situation between the first and the third wave of the pandemic was associated with a one point (0.95) increase on the CES-D 8 scale (95% CI: 0.61, 1.29) and an improved financial situation with a decrease by 0.81 points (95% CI: -1.20, -0.42). A worsened financial situation was associated with a 0.26-point increase in PHQ-2 (95% CI: 0.14, 0.37) and an improved financial situation with a -0.12-point decrease (95% CI: -0.25, 0.01). Similarly, worsened financial situation in the third wave compared to prior to the pandemic, was also associated with an increase in CES-D 8 score and PHQ-2 and an improved financial situation with a decrease in CES-D 8 and PHQ-2. Conclusions Our findings suggest associations between studentsâ€™ financial situation during the COVID-19 pandemic and their mental health. Due to their instable financial situation, students are a vulnerable group in need of mental and financial support during pandemic crises. Key messages This study revealed associations between studentsâ€™ financial situation and depressive symptoms.

"Long COVID and NCDs: the Elephant in the Room : Iveta Nagyova","Issue/problem COVID-19 has now emerged as a public health concern that not only disrupted healthcare services of people living with non-communicable diseases (NCDs) but likely also increase the burden of NCDs. Description of the problem Before the pandemic, SDG target 3.4, which calls for a reduction in premature mortality from NCDs by one third by 2030, was expected to be achieved by 17.5% of countries, and a further of 23% could achieve the target with a slight acceleration in decline. Currently, most countries are off track due to disruption of healthcare services for people with NCDs, overstretched health systems, and fewer resources than before the pandemic. In addition, only around one in four people who had COVID-19 reported feeling fully recovered within a year of being discharged from hospital. The adverse health effects from long COVID range from â€˜invisible symptomsâ€™ such as fatigue and difficulty concentrating, to neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms, respiratory and cardiovascular problems, and metabolic disease. Results The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that siloed programmes are increasingly unfit, and the bidirectional relationships between communicable diseases and NCDs underscore the need to dismantle disease-specific silos, emphasising reforms and investments that improve a wide range of health outcomes. Cost-effective, feasible, and relevant interventions that target both physical and mental health impairments are urgently required. Lessons By 2030, ministries of health would need to contribute about 20% of their budgets to high-priority NCD interventions. Protecting current investments and scaling up cost-effective public health interventions is especially crucial in the context of long haul COVID and NCDs. Policy makers and planners will need concrete guidance for making progress on SDG target 3.4, often with overburdened health systems and scarcer resources.","Nagyova, I.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Long+COVID+and+NCDs:+the+Elephant+in+the+Room+:+Iveta+Nagyova","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; 32(Suppl 3), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-07","",42120,""
"Suicide amongst doctors","Mental health conditions are a significant part of the national burden of disease.1 Burnout, depression and anxiety are increasingly common diseases amongst doctors that impair their ability to perform at home and at work, as well as cope with life stressors.2'3 Burnout has been documented to affect 45% in a consultant survey in one New Zealand hospital prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and this is likely to have increased with the present frustrating work environment.4 Overseas counties have found increased mental health issues amongst doctors in the present phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.5'6 Documentation of increased suicide risk among doctors dates back to the nineteenth century. The first published systematic review in 2004 estimated doctors relative risk at 1.41 (95% CI 1.21-1.65) for men and 2.27 (95% CI 1.90-2.73) for women compared with the general population.7 However, a second more recent systematic review and meta-analysis reported that male physicians had a lower rate compared with men in general (0.67;95% CI 0.55-0.79), and while female physicians still had a higher rate (1.46;95% CI 1.02-1.91), it was considerably less than that reported 15 years prior. Defences that are useful in surviving medical practices such as intellectualisation, dissociation and sublimation may make it harder to create attachments to others, or to recognise when the emotional burden of work becomes too much, therefore contributing to the spiralling of discontent and increased risk of suicide.11 In addition, doctors tend to neglect their own need for psychiatric, emotional, or medical help, and are more critical of themselves and others.7 They are more likely to blame themselves for their illnesses and feel they have failed by becoming mentally unwell. A survey of doctors, comparing those with recent or current complaints, found that they were more than twice as likely to report thoughts of self-harm or suicidal ideation and, of those referred to the General Medical Council in the UK, around one in four had moderate to severe depression and/or anxiety.13 In summary, suicide in doctors appears to be associated with multiple factors including: organisational and occupational stressors, such as long working hours, increasing administration, lack of support, and dealing with death;individual differences, such as personality, coping style, and skill set);and life stressors, such as relationship breakups and complaints and litigation.","Mulder, Roger, Frizelle, Frank","https://www.google.com/search?q=Suicide+amongst+doctors","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: The New Zealand Medical Journal (Online); 135(1564):7-9, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-07","",42121,""
"Assessing determinants of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a large older adult representative sample : Giansanto Mosconi","Most COVID-19-related deaths occurred in older adults, however to date, evidence on determinants of SARS-CoV-2 infection in this population is limited and mostly based on case series without a comparison group. A telephone-based cross-sectional study was conducted in November 2020 on a representative sample of 4,400 people aged =65 years from the Italian region of Lombardy. We determined the prevalence of participants reporting a SARS-CoV-2 infection in the period between the onset of the pandemic and the time of the interview. To investigate the determinants of the infection, we estimated odds ratios (OR) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) thorough unconditional multiple logistic models. We further evaluated if the infection was a determinant of a worsening in mental health wellbeing. Overall, 4.9% of participants reported a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. No significant relationship between sex and infection was observed. SARS-CoV-2 infection was less frequently reported in subjects aged =70 (OR = 0.55;95% 0.41-0.74) compared to 65-69 years. We didn't observe any trend after 70 years of age. Participants reporting at least one chronic condition had a lower infection rate compared to healthy subjects (OR = 0.68 95% CI: 0.49-0.93). Separated/divorced subjects more frequently reported infection than married/cohabiting ones (OR = 2.33 95% CI: 1.29-4.20).

"Sleep quality in the Croatian adult population during the COVID-19 pandemic : Ivan Miskulin","Background The COVID-19 pandemic as a worldwide public health issue is a traumatic event that has affected both the sleep and mental health of the general population. This study aimed to evaluate the quality of sleep in the Croatian adult population during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This cross-sectional questionnaire study was conducted from February to June 2021 period. A validated, anonymous questionnaire that contained questions regarding demographic data, as well as Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) was self-administered to a convenient sample of Croatian adults from central and northwestern Croatia. Results The study sample included 939 subjects with, median age of 42 years (interquartile range 35-48), 35.4% males, and 64.6% females. At the PSQI 22.6% of subjects presented sleep disturbances while at the CAS 0.4% of subjects presented dysfunctional anxiety associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Sleep disturbances were more frequent among females (p &lt; 0.001), inhabitants of the Croatian capital Zagreb (p = 0.001), subjects who were not infected with COVID-19 virus (p = 0.042), subjects who had fear of coronavirus infection in the workplace (p &lt; 0.001), subjects who had fear of coronavirus infection during daily life activities (p &lt; 0.001), subjects who had fear of coronavirus infection during daily physical activities (p &lt; 0.001), subjects who worked with limited social contact (p = 0.005), and subjects with dysfunctional anxiety associated with the COVID-19 pandemic (p = 0.003). Conclusions Poor sleep quality is common during the COVID-19 pandemic in Croatia. Identifying factors associated with poor sleep would help develop specific intervention programs that enhance mental health and sleep quality during pandemics. Key messages â€¢ The COVID-19 pandemic has a significant negative influence on the mental health of the Croatian general population. â€¢ Appropriate supportive programs and interventional approaches directed toward the general population are needed to address mental health problems in Croatia during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Miskulin, I.; Fotez, I.; Miskulin, M.; Milas, J.; Palenkic, H.; Kristic, M.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Sleep+quality+in+the+Croatian+adult+population+during+the+COVID-19+pandemic+:+Ivan+Miskulin","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; 32(Suppl 3), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-07","",42123,""
"Risk factors for mental health disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain: A cohort study : Pere Castellvi","Background Data comparing the populationsâ€™ mental health from before, during and after the pandemic is needed. We aim to assess the risk factors for the first-onset and persistence of major depressive disorder (MDD) and suicidal thoughts and behaviours (STB) during the first year of the pandemic among the Spanish general population. Methods Cohort study through two online surveys from before the pandemic (N = 2,005, October/November 2019) and 12-months later (N = 1,357) on an adult Spanish, nationally representative, population-based sample. Multiple logistic regression models were used to assess the association between socio-demographic, COVID-19 related variables and healthcare received during the pandemic with the onset and persistence of MDD and STB. Results Women have more than 3-fold risk for the onset (OR 3.18;CI95% 1.40 -7.22) and persistence (OR 8.62;CI95% 1.74-42.48) of MDD. Studying and working at the same time (OR 10.13;CI95% 2.17-47.35) and having close relatives/friends with COVID-19 infection (OR 14.84;CI95% 1.91-115.18) or death (OR 5.26;CI95% 1.56-17.73) due to COVID-19 are risk factors for MDD onset. Sick-leave (OR 17.19;CI95% 2.65-112.56) and unemployment (OR 7.01;CI95% 1.85-26.43) increased the risk for MDD persistence. Death of friends/colleagues due to COVID-19 (OR 8.40;CI95% 1.47-48.07) increased the risk for STB onset, and being on sick-leave (OR 7.91;CI95% 1.80-34.66) for STB persistence. Conclusions During the COVID-19 pandemic, women were consistently more at risk of having worse mental health than men. Direct and indirect consequences caused or aggravated by the pandemic are common risk factors for the increased risk for the onset and persistence of both MDD and STB. Identification of high-risk subgroups and risk factors for MDD and STB among the Spanish general population will allow the developing and implementing of evidence-driven strategies for reducing the long-term impact of the pandemic in populationsâ€™ mental health. Key messages â€¢ The pandemic consequences, whether due to having had COVID-19, having close people affected or who have died from the infection and the social consequences increase the risk for worse mental health. â€¢ Evidence-driven strategies for reducing the long-term impact of the pandemic in populationsâ€™ mental health should be a public health priority.","Miranda-Mendizabal, A.; Piqueras, J.; CastellvÃ­, P.; Ãlvarez, S.; DÃ­az, S.; GÃ³mez, L.; Recoder, S.; SÃ¡nchez, N.; GarcÃ­a DurÃ¡n, E.; Forero, C.

"Ukrainian refugee crisis: the experience of the Roman Local Health Authority â€œASL Roma 1â€ : Andriy Melnyk","Problem On February 24th, 2022, Ukraine was invaded by Russian forces, forcing many Ukrainians to flee from their homes as refugees. More than 55,000 Ukrainians have since arrived on Italian territory. In response to the humanitarian crisis, the Roman Local Health Authority â€œASL Roma 1â€ provided socio-sanitary assistance through first reception centers to more than 7700 refugees, prioritizing people with high social vulnerability. Ukraineâ€™s vaccine hesitancy and different epidemiological landscape represented a major hurdle to be overcome. Practice ASL Roma 1â€™s practice served to ensure infectious diseases prevention and control, as well as continuity of care for non-communicable diseases and mental health issues. It consisted of repurposing resources, such as COVID-19 Hubs and their personnel, stipulating Public-Private Partnerships and collaborations with the local Ukrainian community, massive training, creating a centralized multidisciplinary team (with Ukrainian members) and a dedicated database/IT system. Results ASL Roma 1 empowered local Ukrainian communities by providing equipment, medical and administrative staff and socio-sanitary assistance. Ukrainian volunteers helped bridge the cultural gap for essential service provision, such as COVID-19 screening, enrolment in the NHS, health and social orientation, vaccinations and a tailored care pathway. Thus, more than 7700 refugees were assisted, with 1830 COVID-19 vaccinations administered and 170 in critical conditions promptly receiving specialized care. Lessons The multidisciplinary and cross-cultural interaction between doctors, nurses, cultural mediators, social workers, and other key actors was essential in ensuring a holistic care pathway. Services catered to Ukrainian refugees need complete integration between primary and centralized care. Flexibility and resilience are fundamental to foster an ecosystem of innovation and optimization of healthcare provision on all levels, from local to supranational. Key messages â€¢ The multidisciplinary and cross-cultural interaction between all medical and non-medical key actors is essential in ensuring a holistic care pathway and complete social integration of asylum seekers. â€¢ Health system flexibility, resilience and an ecosystem of innovation and optimization of healthcare provision on all levels are fundamental components of preparedness for future refugee crises.","Melnyk, A.; Barone, L.

"Cannabis vaping among college students","Introduction: Vaping is a growing industry that has gained popularity among college students (Jones, Hill, Pardini, & Meier, 2016). Current trends indicate that college students frequently use these devices to vape cannabis (Kenne, Fischbein, Tan, & Banks, 2017). Detrimental health effects of vaping are emerging, including the cannabis vaping-related inflammatory disease referred to as Electronic-cigarette, or Vaping, Associated Lung Injury (EVALI) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020). Research is lacking on the perceptions and attitudes of cannabis vaping among college students. Additionally, the Integrated Behavioral Model may be useful in explaining and predicting cannabis vaping among this population. Both of the aforementioned issues are addressed in this dissertation.Purpose: This alternative dissertation includes two separate studies. The first study was a qualitative design, which was completed with the purpose of exploring factors that influence college students to initiate and continue to vaporize cannabis instead of traditional combustible cannabis practices. The second study was a result of the first and utilized a quantitative design to determine if the IBM is useful in explaining and predicting cannabis vaping among college students.Methods: (Study 1) Individual telephone interviews were conducted, transcribed, and analyzed for common themes (n=21). (Study 2) An online survey was deployed via Amazon Mechanical Turk containing 35 items to measure the primary constructs of the IBM, including Experiential Attitude, Instrumental Attitude, Injunctive Norms, Descriptive Norms, Perceived Control, Self-Efficacy, and Behavioral Intention (n=423). Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling were used to determine whether the data fit the proposed IBM model. Inclusion criteria for both studies included college undergraduates, aged 18-25, who self-reported vaping cannabis at least once in the past 30 days.Results: (Study 1) Six primary themes and eighteen subthemes were identified. Main themes included 1) Convenience, 2) Discreetness, 3) Euphoric Experience, 4) Social Acceptability, 5) Health and Safety, and 6) COVID-19 Pandemic Impact. (Study 2) Obtained fit indices confirmed that the data fit the proposed model, accounting for 54.2% of the variance. Structural equation modeling demonstrated the strongest path coefficients between Behavioral Intention and Experiential Attitude, Instrumental Attitude, Injunctive Norms, and Descriptive Norms. There was a weak, positive relationship between vaping cannabis and smoking cannabis within the sample.Conclusions: College students who use cannabis tend to both vape and smoke (dual-use), depending largely on social and physical environment. Overall, the participants tended to underestimate the risks associated with both cannabis and vaping. Additionally, the strongest predictors of vaping were descriptive norms and experiential attitude. The findings indicate that the development of interventions and educational programming specific to this demographic is warranted.

"The Effect of Decreased Physical Activity on Physical and Mental Health of School-Aged Children During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background School-aged children are recommended to complete at least one hour of moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity per day. North American data has shown that due to COVID-19 restrictions placed on in person schooling and extracurricular activities, children were not meeting recommended levels of physical activity. Additional barriers to activity during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic included lack of access to public facilities including community centers, parks, and outdoor recreation. Decreased physical activity in children has been shown to have a negative impact on both physical and mental health, and childhood development. However, there is a paucity of literature on parentsâ€™ perceptions of the association between physical activity and physical and mental health. Objectives The objective of this study was to gain a better understanding of the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on levels of physical activity and parentsâ€™ perceptions surrounding physical activity and physical and mental health. Design/Methods An online survey was distributed to parents of school-aged children aged 4-13 in Ontario. The survey included questions regarding demographics, childrenâ€™s physical activity prior to and during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, and parental perceptions regarding the pandemicâ€™s impact on mental and physical health. This study received ethics approval, was hosted on the REDCapTM platform, and distributed from February-June 2021 through a local school board, the Pediatrics section of the Ontario Medical Association, and through social media. Results Of 361 participants, 90.4% strongly agreed that physical activity was important for mental health, and 92.2% strongly agreed that physical activity was important for physical health. There was a statistically significant decrease in the overall mean number of hours of physical activity per week between pre-COVID and the first wave of COVID (mean difference = 9.34 hours, SD = 10.06, p&lt;0.001). Additionally, parents of children with decreased physical activity reported a statistically significant negative impact on physical and mental health as compared to parents whose children had no change in amount of physical activity. Decreased energy, poor sleep, increased anxiety, mood disturbances, and disruptive behaviour were noted by over 50% of respondents. Conclusion This survey highlights that parents themselves perceived a significant negative impact on childrenâ€™s mental and physical well-being with decreased physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic. This emphasizes the importance of retaining access to recreational facilities and extracurricular activities. Future research includes identifying ways to re-engage parents and children with physical activity during times of decreased access.","McCann, Maggie, Kumar, Kriti, Lepore, Natasha, Metivier, Emma, Lahey, Kelcie, Barootes, Hailey, Holyer, Karissa, Miller, Michael, Lim, Rod","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Effect+of+Decreased+Physical+Activity+on+Physical+and+Mental+Health+of+School-Aged+Children+During+the+COVID-19+Pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Paediatrics & child health; 27(Suppl 3):e3-e4, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-07","",42127,""
"Introducing walkable cities as a Public Health intervention : Vlatka Matkovic","COVID-19 pandemic yet again showed that health crises and epidemics are introducing urban planning as a public health response. Globally, we saw a renewed interest in urban environment and healthy living and the changes in urban environments which can make for a healthier living. Even before the pandemic, various urban concepts and models that take as basis a health-oriented, holistic approach are being implemented in many cities. To name a few: car-free centres or neighbourhoods, the so-called â€˜Superblocksâ€™, neighbourhoods with low-speed traffic, walkable and cyclable cities aiming at all amenities being easy reach so-called â€˜15 Minutes cityâ€™. COVID-19 crisis only accelerated many of these initiatives and brought them to global level need and attention. Such interventions are being introduced to demotivate the use of polluting cars, to ease up and to promote healthy and active transportation such as walking and cycling. As a consequence, those interventions not only are hoped to lead to an increase in physical activity, but also better air quality, reduction of noise. Cities have accelerated urban transformations of the space for active transportation such as the introduction of more cycling lanes in their networks, transforming â€˜carâ€™ streets to mix use streets, etc. Particularly during the pandemic, the streets that were previously dominated by car use, parking lots, parking spaces, and car lanes have shifted their focus to the pedestrians, healthy and active mobility. Though, not so optimistic continuation of the speed of the changes in urban planning are seen at the end of the pandemic. It is still clear that spaces for people, spaces promoting mental health such as green spaces, green islands, green pedestrian streets and healthy mobility, are missing. Lockdown measures of reducing the car traffic and increasing the walkable spaces for citizens were primarily imposed to save public health but had one important co-benefit - improved air quality in many areas.","Matkovic, V.; Jevtic, M.; Kusturica, M.

"Mental health of migrants during the COVID-19 pandemic: additional stressors, increased inequalities : Ana Gama","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an unprecedent range of negative mental health outcomes across populations worldwide. Such effects are increasingly being documented, however an evidence gap persists on the consequences on most vulnerable groups, as certain subgroups of migrants. These populations already suffer from increased psychological burden, and the pandemic effects may potentially exacerbate adverse experiences and outcomes. This study aims to uncover the perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of migrants in Portugal and the associated sociodemographic aspects. A survey was conducted with a community-based sample of 1126 adult migrants in Portugal, assessing sociodemographics, migration-related characteristics and the perceived impact of the pandemic on mental health. Association between sociodemographics and mental health indicators was measured through bivariable analysis. In total, 1126 adult migrants were surveyed: 53.4% female, mean age of 35.8 years (range 18-77), 48.9% from African countries, 29.5% from Middle East/Asian countries, 21.6% from Brazil. Most participants (80%) reported feelings of agitation, anxiety or sadness during the pandemic period with 26.4% experiencing these feelings most days. The pandemic had a disproportionate impact on women (86.9% reported negative impact compared to 72.5% of men, p &lt; 0.05), those undocumented (83.3% vs 75.4%, p &lt; 0.05), those whose financial situation got worse since the pandemic (82.8% vs. 77.3%, p &lt; 0.05) and those who had increased food shortages (84.4% vs 79%, p &lt; 0.05). Migrants perceived an elevated deterioration of their mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, particular groups such as women and those with a more insecure income or residence status are particularly susceptible to experiencing negative mental health outcomes. Key messages â€¢ There is a need to recognize the detrimental mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on particular migrant groups and to develop interventions that target their unique needs. â€¢ Investigating sociodemographic and migration aspects could help identifying migrants at a higher risk of experiencing mental health distress.","Marques, M.

"The COVID-19 HL School Principal Survey (Wales) linked to routinely collected anonymised health data : Emily Marchant","Background Evidence before the pandemic suggests that school headteachers report high work-related stress and psychological/physical burden compared to other professional groups (1). There is an evidence gap exploring the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on senior leaders in schools who have experienced high demands as a result of COVID-19. This is important because in the UK, teacher retention is policy priority. Methods The COVID-19 HL: School Leadership Survey aimed to explore the burden and stress that school leaders in Wales, UK experienced during COVID-19, part of a global study with the COVID-HL network (3). 172 school leaders (62% female) from 130 primary (age 3-11) and 30 secondary schools (age 11-16) completed an online survey between July-Nov 2021, exploring topics such as work-related stress and mental health. A unique aspect is the use of data linkage using the SAIL (Secure Anonymised Information Linkage) Databank. SAIL is data repository containing individual-level, anonymised population-scale data for Wales. Results Initial descriptive findings show 54% of senior leaders have depression (WHO-5), and lower wellbeing scores compared to other UK professions. 83% report moderate-high perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale) and physical (38%) and mental (57%) work exhaustion. The next stage of this study is to perform data linkage of survey responses to health records and administrative data. Logistic regression analyses will examine wellbeing and work-related stress with outcomes including mental health (e.g. anxiety/depression) diagnosis and time off work. Conclusions Preliminary results show high levels of stress, exhaustion and low wellbeing amongst school leaders in Wales. The next part of this study will examine this in greater detail using data linkage of routine records.

"Project SELfit: training socio-emotional skills in a school environment in Porto : Filipa Malcata","Issue/Problem Mental disorders are the main cause of years lived with disability (YLD) in 5-14-year-old people around the world, in Western Europe, and particularly in Portugal. Young people who experience anxiety during childhood have a 3,5-fold likelihood of suffering from depression or anxiety during adulthood. COVID-19 has aggravated this situation, namely regarding socio-emotional competencies. Description of the problem SELfit, a project based on the Socio-emotional learning (SEL) methodology, aims promoting mental health, by training teachers and community nurses to develop socio-emotional skills in students from primary schools. The project includes a theoretical and a practical/training session, and monthly supervision sessions by a team that includes a psychologist, a public health doctor and public health nurses. The period of implementation is between February to July 2022. Results A total of 8 community nurses and 13 teachers from 3 primary schools in Porto enrolled in this project, which corresponds to a total around 272 students from 5 to 8-year-old. Knowledge of nurses and teachers regarding mental health literacy, and social emotional learning was assessed, before and after the theoretical session. The mean percentage of correct answers before was 49% (54% regarding nurses and 45% teachers) compared to 84% (92% regarding nurses and 78% teachers) after. Concerning socio-emotional skills of the primary school students, possible improvement will be evaluated at the end of the project (July 2022). Lessons Mental health literacy and social emotional learning knowledge increased 35%, which highlights the importance of these theoretical sessions promoting mental health literacy. By the end of this project, it is expected to exist an improvement on socio-emotional skills of the primary school students. This is a very important project, expected to be implement and replicated in other schools in Porto and in Portugal. Key messages â€¢ Mental disorders are the main cause of years lost due to disability (YLD) in primary school students in Portugal;hence, it was chosen for this mental health promotion project. â€¢ This is a pioneer project in Porto, involving both community nurses and primary teachers, in which all are involved in training and promoting social-emotional learning in a school context.","Malcata, F.; Rodrigues, A.; Machado, A.; Saraiva, M.

"Long COVID in France: prevalence, management and long-term impact : Tatjana Makovski","Certain percentage of population experiences persistent symptoms months after an acute Covid-19 episode (Long-COVID), with a significant impact on daily-life. Few studies exist on its prevalence and its impact among the general population. The main objective of this survey was to estimate the prevalence of Long COVID among the general adult population in France. Secondary objectives were to evaluate Long COVID management and to assess impact of this clinical condition on quality of life and mental health. Cross-sectional study was performed in March-April 2022 using an online self-administered questionnaire. The sample was selected by the quota method from a panel of volunteers. Its representativeness was ensured by appropriate weighting. Three groups were described: Long-COVID, COVID without persistent symptoms, never COVID. Post COVID-19 condition as defined by the WHO was applied for prevalence estimation. The prevalence was calculated by age and sex. Health care consumption and impact of Long COVID on quality of life and mental health will be studied comparing the three groups, using weighted adjusted polytomic regressions. Here, we present preliminary findings on Long COVID prevalence. There were 27,537 respondents, 52% females, mean age (SD) 49 (Â±16.5). Confirmed or probable COVID-19 was reported by 33.9% of participants;of whom 85.1% had confirmed laboratory test. Majority (65.1%) had COVID-19 &lt;3 months ago. Long COVID concerned 1,086 (4%) participants. Prevalence was higher for females 4.6% vs. 3.3% for males, and among younger population for both sex groups. Overall, prevalence of Long COVID by age group was: 18-34 (6%), 35-49 (4.7%), 50-64 (3.4%), =65 (1.8%). This is a first estimation of Long COVID prevalence among the French population. Representativeness of the sample should be interpreted with caution due to a sample based on volunteersâ€™ response. Ongoing analyses will provide clearer understanding of the impact of Long COVID. Key messages â€¢ This is a first estimation of Long COVID prevalence among the French population. â€¢ There is a significant portion of the French population impacted by persisting or reoccurring symptoms defined by Long COVID;its impact and care management will be further evaluated.","Makovski, T.

"Etiologic and prognostic roles of frailty, multimorbidity and socioeconomic characteristics in the development of SARS-CoV-2 infection and related severe health outcomes: systematic reviews of population-based studies : Tatjana Makovski","The study had 2 objectives, to: 1) evaluate the etiologic roles of frailty, multimorbidity and socioeconomic status on SARS-CoV-2 infection probability, hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation and COVID-19 related mortality;2) investigate the prognostic roles of mentioned risk factors on the likelihood of hospitalization, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, COVID-19 mortality, functioning, quality of life, disability, mental health and work absence. Three systematic reviews were performed, for each risk factor. The reviews shared first screening steps relying on a common population-based approach. Initial search took place on 7 April 2021 in PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO and WHO Covid-19 database. An update was performed for frailty only, on 1 February 2022, due to the scarce literature retained initially. Prospero registration number: CRD42021249444.

Finally, the total number of included studies was: for multimorbidity, objective 1 N = 2, objective 2 N = 13;frailty, objective 1 N = 2, objective 2 N = 3;socioeconomic characteristics, objective 1 N = 57, objective 2 N = 30. The risk of severe short-term outcomes such as mortality, ICU admission or hospitalization increased with increasing disease burden and socioeconomic deprivation. Literature on long-term impacts was not identified. The evidence indicates a dose-effect association across all risk factors and outcomes. There is a lack of work conducted on population-based representative samples accounting for frailty and multimorbidity. Measures of multimorbidity and frailty were heterogeneous between studies. Most of the studies observing socioeconomic determinants were performed in the USA and the UK;hence the need for more research in different contexts. Further evidence is required in order to estimate the impact of crisis among general population.","Makovski, T.; Ghattas, J.; Devleesschauwer, B.; Carcaillon-Bentata, L.; group, Phiri Wp working","https://www.google.com/search?q=Etiologic+and+prognostic+roles+of+frailty,+multimorbidity+and+socioeconomic+characteristics+in+the+development+of+SARS-CoV-2+infection+and+related+severe+health+outcomes:+systematic+reviews+of+population-based+studies+:+Tatjana+Makovski","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; 32(Suppl 3), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-07","",42133,""
"Technostress, Coping, and Anxious and Depressive Symptomatology in University Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic raised many challenges for university staff and students, including the need to work from home, which resulted in a greater reliance on technology. We collected questionnaire data from university students (N = 894) in three European countries: Greece, Italy, and the United Kingdom. Data were collected between 7th April 2020 and 19th June 2020, representing a period covering the first lockdown and university closures in these countries and across Europe generally. We tested the hypotheses that technology-related stressors (techno-overload, work-home conflict, techno-ease, techno-reliability, techno-sociality, and pace of change) would be associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms, and that coping styles (problem-focused, emotion-focused, and avoidance) would mediate these relationships. Results showed significant positive associations between techno-overload, work-home conflict and anxiety and depressive symptoms, and significant negative associations between techno-reliability, techno-ease and anxiety and depressive symptoms. A significant negative association was found between techno-sociality and depressive symptoms but not anxiety symptoms. No evidence was found for an association between pace of change and anxiety or depressive symptoms. Multiple mediation analyses revealed significant direct effects of techno-overload, work-home conflict and techno-ease on anxiety symptoms, and of work-home conflict and techno-ease on depressive symptoms. Work-home conflict had significant indirect effects on anxiety and depressive symptoms through avoidance coping. Techno-overload and techno-ease both had significant indirect effects on anxiety symptoms through problem- and emotion-focused coping. Techno-ease also had a significant indirect effect on depressive symptoms through problem-focused coping. The findings add to the body of evidence on technostress amongst university students and provide knowledge on how technostress translates through coping strategies into anxious and depressive symptoms during the disruption caused by the outbreak of a pandemic disease.","Galvin, John, Evans, Michael Scott, Nelson, Kenisha, Richards, Gareth, Mavritsaki, Eirini, Giovazolias, Theodoros, Koutra, Katerina, Mellor, Ben, Zurlo, Maria Clelia, Smith, Andrew Paul, Vallone, Federica","https://www.google.com/search?q=Technostress,+Coping,+and+Anxious+and+Depressive+Symptomatology+in+University+Students+During+the+COVID-19+Pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Europe's journal of psychology; 18(3):302-318, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-07","",42134,""

Therefore, it is crucial to investigate how the COVID-19 pandemic â€“ as a psychosocial stressor â€“ affected the aetiological processes of mental disorders. Previous research has shown that stress potentiates associative (fear) learning and analogue symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and that analogue PTSD symptoms can emerge in response to associative learning. Objective: We investigated whether distress in response to the COVID-19 outbreak support the development of intrusions and rumination after exposure to a non-COVID-19-related analogue trauma. Moreover, we examined if these effects are mediated by the strength of associative learning during analogue trauma. Method: 122 undergraduate university students participated in an online experiment between March and July 2020. They completed questionnaires measuring distress and rumination related to the COVID-19 outbreak. On a subsequent day, they went through an associative learning task, in which neutral stimuli were paired with the appearance of a highly aversive film clip. Subjective ratings were assessed as indicators of associative learning. On the next day, participants documented film-related intrusions and rumination. Results: COVID-19-related distress but not rumination was associated with post-film intrusion and rumination load. These effects were mediated by associative learning. Conclusions: The current findings are in line with the assumptions that stress enhanced both associative learning and PTSD symptoms. Specifically, they indicate that prolonged psychosocial stress â€“ like during the COVID-19 outbreak â€“ is linked to individual differences in memory processing of aversive events. Further confirmatory research is needed to replicate these results. HIGHLIGHTS High distress related to the COVID-19 outbreak was associated with analogue PTSD symptom development. This effect was mediated by the strength of associative learning. Prolonged psychosocial stress like the COVID-19 outbreak might impact memory processing of aversive events.","Friesen, Edith, Michael, Tanja, SchÃ¤fer, Sarah K.; Sopp, M.

"The Significant Impact of Narcan Reversals on Overdose Mortality in Peoria County, IL","Objectives: Determine the impact of Narcan administrations in Peoria County, IL on the number of overdose deaths by testing the statistical significance of the association between monthly Narcan reversals and overdose mortality. As well as re-shedding the light on the opioid pandemic post-COVID. Methods: We collected data on Narcan reversals from hospital emergency departments, Emergency Medical Services (EMS), the County Sheriffâ€™s Office, local police departments, and other agencies that distributed and/or administered Narcan in Peoria County from January through December 2018. Data for the 2018 overdose mortality was collected through vital records at the Peoria City/County Health Department. Results: Results from simple linear regression suggest that a significant proportion of the total variation in overdose mortality over 2018 was predicted by the Narcan reversals, F(1, 11) = 5.872, p&lt; 0.05. MultipleÂ R2 indicates that approximately 30.7% of the variation in overdose mortality was predicted by the Narcan reversals. If there were 0 Narcan reversals, there would be 8.362 overdose deaths per month. Conclusions: Narcan is known to save lives in cases of opioid overdose, and the need for increased administration campaigns is warranted to further battle the opioid epidemic. As this study has proven, Narcan administration has the potential to significantly decrease overdose mortality.","Al-Tabbaa, Mohammad Mousbah, Bdiwi, Ehssan, Endress, Kathryn, Altarras, Khaled","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Significant+Impact+of+Narcan+Reversals+on+Overdose+Mortality+in+Peoria+County,+IL","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Cureus; 14(10), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-07","",42136,""
"Poster No 137 A very evident pulmonary thrombus","Clinical case Female patient, 78 years-old, that complained of epigastric pain and intense fatigue for a week. While waiting in the urgency department, she became hypotensive, with refractory shock. Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm, 90 bpm, de novo right bundle block and infraST in the right precordial leads. The echocardiogram showed a dilated right ventricle (ratio RV/LV &gt; 1), with depressed function and major tricuspid regurgitation, RV/RA gradient of at least 55 mmHg. Left ventricle presented â€œD-shapeâ€, preserved function and no segmental kinetic changes. The pulmonary artery was dilated and a serpentiform mass was visible, protruding through the pulmonary valve;similar masses were also visible in its branches. The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) was assumed and fibrinolysis was started, given there were no contra-indications. One year before, she had an intermediate-risk PE in the context of COVID-19, with a similar echocardiographic presentation. She recovered RV function in the following months and stopped anticoagulation 3 months after that episode. Discussion PE can present with varying degrees of severity. Bedside echocardiography can be of major help in its diagnosis, especially in critical patients. The visualization of a thrombus in the pulmonary artery is rare, particularly in transthoracic echocardiogram. Echocardiogram is also useful for risk stratification and prognostic evaluation. This patient developed obstructive shock due to massive PE and the fibrinolytic treatment was paramount for her survival. A good echocardiogram helped in the differential diagnosis and enabled the Cardiologist to assist the patient in the best way.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Poster+No.+137+A+very+evident+pulmonary+thrombus","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Cardiovascular research; 118(Suppl 2), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-07","",42137,""

"The Lingering Effects: Examining Mental Health in India during a Period of Covid-19 Regression","PURPOSE: COVID-19 has been recognized as a contagious disease which can cause serious health problems, even proving to be fatal in some cases. The swift spread of COVID-19 epidemic shook the world which led to lockdowns, isolation, and social distancing for the general population so as to curb and contain the spread. This was found to lead to mental health disorders amongst people. This study examines the prevalence and severity of anxiety, stress perception, and well-being levels among the people at the time when the COVID-19 was in regression (decline) in India.METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 374 respondents' mental health was evaluated using three standardized questionnaires: Generalized Anxiety Disorder [GAD-7], Perceived Stress Scale [PSS-4], and Five Wellbeing Index [WHO-5].RESULTS: The study revealed that almost 82% of respondents had moderate to severe levels of stress while 66% of respondents had mild to moderate levels of anxiety. Overall, 60% of respondents had poor (low) mental well-being. A strong negative correlation was found between mental well-being and perceived stress, and mental well-being and level of anxiety, in comparison to the correlation between anxiety and perceived stress was positive and statistically significant.CONCLUSIONS: This study identified several long-term psychological effects of COVID. The presence of stress and anxiety and poorer mental well-being even at the time of decline in COVID-19 cases, highlights the need for serious attention to be given to psychological and psychiatric help and support throughout the duration and regression of such diseases. Health policymakers must ensure coherent and consistent plans for screening the mental health of the general population are in place to provide the required support in managing the long-term psychological and psychiatric effects of COVID.","Dhaliwal, A.","https://doi.org/10.24083/apjhm.v17i2.821","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Asia Pacific Journal of Health Management; 17(2), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-07","",42139,""
"Stories in Cloth: Exploring Contemporary Issues through Studentsâ€™ Embroidered Narratives","This project was designed for an undergraduate art education course to help students visually communicate ideas about contemporary issues through the use of cloth and embroidery. Students examined how historic embroidered visual narratives have been used to inform, advocate for, or protest local or global issues and events. Using peer feedback for developing visual literacy and dialogue to foster empathy, students explored and discussed the socially-responsive works of various artists while also learning to talk about their own work (and the work of their peers) critically to improve visual communication skills. Students researched local and global issues such as homelessness, food insecurity, mental health, COVID-19, the Black Lives Matter movement, and transgender rights, then designed visuals to inform, advocate for, or protest their chosen topics, embroidered in cloth. Outcomes from the project included responsive and empathetic dialogue with peers while building community, meaningful feedback noted in discussions and reflective writing, and improved visual communication skills evidenced in studentsâ€™ embroidered narratives.","Kristin Vanderlip, Taylor","https://doi.org/10.18848/2326-9944/CGP/v18i01/1-15","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: The International Journal of Arts Education; 18(1):1-15, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-07","",42140,""

"Acute Sarcopenia in Elderly with COVID-19: An Overlooked Problem","The coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic was announced in March 2020 by World Health Organization (WHO). Studies showed that the elderly had higher morbidity and mortality rates. Acute sarcopenia in the elderly with COVID-19 is an overlooked problem. Inflammation, malnutrition, immobilization, a side effect of COVID-19 treatment, depression, and hormonal dysregulation contributed to acute sarcopenia in COVID-19, especially in the elderly. Muscle quantity can be assessed with different techniques such as imaging or anthropometric measurements in diagnosing sarcopenia. Imaging such as CT scan was widely used in multiple studies. Still, anthropometric measurements are more fit in developing countries because they are widely available, safe, do not require special skills, and fit in low-resources facilities. Muscle strength can be assessed with grip strength. Acute sarcopenia was associated with immune dysregulation and cytokine storm, length of stay and readmission, and ICU admission and mechanical ventilation. These will contribute to high mortality in sarcopenic elderly with COVID-19.","Aryana, Igps, Daniella, D.; Kuswardhani, R. A.

"Relationships Between Gratitude and Mental Health Difficulties During the COVID-19 Pandemic in a Southern Region of the United States","Introduction: The extensive disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic have led to heightened concerns about mental health sequelae. There has been significant interest in identifying factors associated with psychosocial vulnerability or resilience. Aims: This study examined associations of trait gratitude with mental health difficulties among community residents in a southern state of the US. Methods: In this cross-sectional online investigation, 543 adults were assessed during an earlier phase of the pandemic, characterized by the reopening of facilities but mounting infection rates. Participants were evaluated using a validated measure of trait gratitude and clinically relevant screening assessments of depression, anxiety, and trauma symptoms. Results: After adjusting for a range of pandemicassociated burdens and sociodemographic factors, multivariable analyses indicated that gratitude was significantly related to diminished levels of depression, anxiety, and trauma. These effects remained significant after additional adjustment for other psychosocial resources (religiousness and perceived support). Conclusions: Findings provide novel information regarding relationships between gratitude and reduced mental health difficulties among community residents during a stressful period early in the pandemic. Results set the stage for longitudinal research. A disposition to identify and appreciate beneficial experiences might contribute to more favorable adaptation to communal crises, and warrants further investigation.

"Features of Anesthesiologists-Reanimatologistsâ€™ Emotional States in Different COVID-19 Pandemic Periods in Russia","Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the most stressful events in recent times. Medical professionals, including anesthesiologists-reanimatologists, suffered the main blow in this difficult and stressful environment. Aims: This study aimed at identifying the features of anesthesiologists-reanimatologistsâ€™ emotional states in different COVID-19 pandemic periods. Methods: The study was conducted through an anonymous questionnaire among anesthesiologists-reanimatologists in two periods. In the First stage â€“ which was carried out in May 2020 (during the first COVID-19 pandemic wave) â€“ 58 anesthesiologists-reanimatologists in the Arkhangelsk region took part. During the Second segment â€“ which took place in October 2020 (in the second COVID-19 pandemic wave) â€“ 43 anesthesiologists-reanimatologists were examined. Repeated questioning was carried out among the same participants. Results: In October 2020, compared to May, the number of doctors who noted a high intensity of professional activity increased. Regardless of the study period, one-third of the subjects experienced constant pronounced anxiety. Anesthesiologists-reanimatologists, whose professional activity was directly related to the patients in COVID-19 care, noted a poorer emotional state more frequently in October, accompanied by anxiety, depressed mood, irritability and a high burnout level, which may indicate a depletion of internal resources in this group. Conclusions: The study results showed that for anesthesiologists-reanimatologists, a further depletion of emotional resources accompanied the second pandemic wave. The anesthesiologists-reanimatologistsâ€™ emotional state was mediated by a number of social and gender factors, as well as specific labor organization features.

"Cross-Cultural Differences in Psychological Health, Perceived Stress, and Coping Strategies of University Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Introduction: COVID-19 has affected the entire world, including university students. Students are likely to experience COVID-19 related stress that might adversely affect their psychological health and result in various coping strategies. Aims: This studyâ€™s objectives were to examine cross-cultural differences and the relationships between stress, psychological health, and coping among university students during the pandemic. Furthermore, the study explored whether coping strategies mediated the relationship between psychological health and perceived distress for this population. Methods: University students (n = 703) were recruited via convenience sampling from Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Participants completed an online quantitative questionnaire consisting of demographics, the Perceived Stress Scale, the General Health Questionnaire, and the Brief-COPE. Results: Perceived psychological distress was significantly associated with poorer general psychological health and both were associated with dysfunctional coping. For all countries, psychological health mediated the relationship between perceived distress and dysfunctional coping. Students from individualistic cultures reported higher stress and poorer psychological health when compared to those from collectivistic countries. The latter tended to engage in more emotion-focused and problem-focused coping and used more dysfunctional coping strategies than the former. Conclusions: Future research should explore other mediators and moderators that affect university studentsâ€™ responses to pandemics and should include longitudinal studies with larger samples. Findings emphasize the need for providing university students with mental health support during and after COVID-19. It is important to develop and research empirically based strategies for reducing their stress and psychological distress through effective and culturally appropriate coping strategies.

"â€œThis doesnâ€™t feel like livingâ€: How the COVID-19 Pandemic Affected the Mental Health of Vulnerable University Students in the United Kingdom","Introduction: Concerns about student mental health have been rising globally. The COVID-19 pandemic triggered unprecedented disruption in higher education as universities were forced to close and adapt their education delivery. Understanding the impact of this on vulnerable students can inform higher educationâ€™s response to future similar events. Aims: To understand the lived experience of first year university students studying in the United Kingdom, who had a history of poor mental health and lived on a low income, we examined the inter-relatedness between mental health, financial strain, remote learning and engagement, and well-being. Methods: At the start of their first year of study, whilst the UK was in periods of lockdown, we conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews with 20 diverse first-year university students. We analyzed data using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Results: The pandemicâ€™s impact on student mental health, engagement and learning remained pervasive and serious. Key themes conveyed how isolation triggered past mental health difficulties and a perception that the universities â€“ and government â€“ had forgotten about them. Students also experienced greater difficulty in navigating the liminal threshold between being a child and an adult, and having the additional worry of financial instability left students with fewer coping resources. Conclusions: To mitigate the impact of future pandemic responses, constant and effective communication is needed between faculty and students to safeguard against isolation and low motivation. Vulnerable students need guidance in coping skills to manage mental health risks when they are away from family and familiar support networks.

"Feelings Related to the Academic Path in Virtue of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Testimonies from Portuguese Higher Education Students Attending Healthcare Courses","Introduction: In Portugal, two periods of confinement were implemented due to the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e., March 2020, January 2021), and closing the educational institutions was one of the containment measures adopted. Medical students felt the impact of these confinement periods because healthcare education has a very high practical component in the context of clinical teaching: it is impossible to teach these healthcare disciplines via distance learning methodology. Aims: This study aims to identify the feelings related to the academic path in higher education students attending healthcare courses as a consequence of confinement. Methods: The sample included 133 students, aged between 18 and 55 years, 77 (68.1%) were female. This was a qualitative and cross-sectional study using a content analysis approach. The measurement instrument included an online questionnaire. Results: From the results, demotivation, anxiety, insecurity and fear of being contaminated stand out as the most present and reported student feelings. All these new feelings led to a shift in the mental health status, which most students currently classify negatively as a result of all the changes experienced during this time. Most students expressed negative feelings resulting from the pandemic, asserting that confinement interfered with their academic path in a negative way regarding their mental health. Conclusions: The decrease in practical classes led to a feeling of insecurity and fear in patient care. It is suggested that the mental health of university students be monitored during epidemics in order to try to minimize the impacts caused on their mental health.

"Psychological Distress of High School Graduates During Social Distancing in Croatia","Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has influenced the whole world, thus also affecting the high school graduates in Croatia. Aims: The purpose of the study was to examine the psychological distress high school graduates experienced during the COVID-19 social distancing measures, more precisely to investigate gender and school type differences and to examine the relationship between psychological distress and self-regulated learning. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, an online questionnaire was administered to 13,037 high school graduates across Croatia. Results: The results show that girls exhibit higher levels of psychological distress compared to the boys, while the art school graduates show the highest distress, followed by gymnasium (i.e., secondary grammar school, prep school) graduates, and lastly vocational school graduates. Furthermore, a moderate negative correlation was found between self-efficacy and psychological distress, and significant, but small correlations were found between regulation of effort, management of work, time and environment, self-handicapping as well as elaboration and psychological distress. These results show that higher levels of self-regulation are connected to lower levels of psychological distress. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that a need exists for greater accessibility of mental health care for adolescents.

"Affective Symptoms and Traumatic Stress Among College Students at Risk for ADHD During the Second Lockdown in Greece","Introduction: Due to the pandemic, individuals with ADHD have been facing noticeable challenges in their daily life. Prolonged quarantine and isolation may contribute to higher affective and PTSD symptoms among college students with ADHD. Aims: The study aimed to explore the impact of COVID-19 on affective symptoms such as depression, anxiety, stress, along with loneliness and post-traumatic stress on college students at risk for ADHD in Greece during the second COVID-19 lockdown in November 2020. Methods: A sample of 362 students completed an online survey consisting of demographic questions and four instruments: the ADHD Self-Report Scale-V1.1 (ASRS-V1.1), the DASS-21, the UCLA Loneliness Scale, and the PTSD checklist (PCL-5). Results: Over 18% of the students met the criteria for being at risk of ADHD, which is higher than in other studies conducted prior to the pandemic. Students at risk for ADHD reported significantly higher (p &lt; .05) mean scores on all scales: depression, anxiety, stress, loneliness, and posttraumatic stress. A model to predict at-risk ADHD diagnosis indicated those who presented symptoms of depression, had low GPA, who were employed, were 46% more likely to struggle with ADHD. Conclusions: This study indicates that the pandemic may have adversely affected individuals at risk for ADHD. Recommendations for further.

"Physical Activity, Well-Being, and the Needs of Canadians with Disabilities during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background: This study examined self-reported physical activity (PA) participation, well-being, and perceived needs of Canadians with disabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we assessed physical and mental health and the extent to which pre-identified needs were being met or unmet. Methods: Two iterations of the COVID-19 Disability Survey were conducted during two pandemic timeframes: June&ndash;December 2020 (iteration 1, n = 599) and December 2020&ndash;September 2021 (iteration 2, n = 528). PA participation was assessed with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Physical and mental health were assessed with the PROMIS Global-10 questionnaire. A needs assessment was conducted on 11 needs pre-identified in partnership with community organizations. Results: Approximately 50% of respondents to both iterations reported that they did not do any moderate-vigorous intensity PA. While physical health was not different between timeframes, mental health was worse during iteration 2 than iteration 1 (p = 0.028). During both timeframes, access to recreation and leisure facilities was the greatest unmet need. Conclusion: These data highlight the low levels of PA and the perceived changes in PA, mental health, and recreational needs of Canadians with disabilities during the pandemic. The findings of the Survey were used to support policy change to remove barriers to PA participation for people with disabilities in Ontario.","Gee, Cameron M.; Hoekstra, Femke, Ãšbeda-Colomer, Joan, Knibbe, Tara Joy, DaSilva, Pinder, Ginis, Kathleen A.

"Influence of Classroom Colour Environment on College Students' Emotions during Campus Lockdown in the COVID-19 Post-Pandemic Era-A Case Study in Harbin, China","Campus lockdown during COVID-19 and the post-pandemic era has had a huge negative effect on college students. As a vital part of interior teaching spaces, colour deeply influences college students' mental health and can be used for healing. Nevertheless, research on this topic has been limited. Based on colour psychology and colour therapy, this paper discusses the relationship between interior teaching space colours (hue and brightness) and emotions among college students. The HAD scale and questionnaire survey method were used. It was concluded that: (1) Anxiety and depression were prominent among the college student population during the quarantine of the university due to the epidemic. (2) Warm colours have an advantage over both cold and neutral colours in creating pleasure, relaxation, and mental attention, with the second in line being the cold and the last being the neutral. Warm colours make it pleasant for individuals while cold colours boost attention. (3) When subjects have higher values of anxiety and depression, they are less satisfied with the colour of the teaching space. (4) In most cases, there is no significant difference in the colour preference of teaching spaces across the gender, grade, and major groups, with females having a higher preference for warm high-brightness classrooms than males. These findings provide crucial ideas for future interior teaching space design and enrich the theories in colour psychology.","Tao, Weiyi, Wu, Yue, Li, Weifeng, Liu, Fangfang","https://doi.org/10.3390/buildings12111873","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Buildings; 12(11):1873, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-07","",42152,""

"Changes in non-communicable diseases, diet and exercise in a rural Bangladesh setting before and after the first wave of COVID-19","Prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is high in rural Bangladesh. Given the complex multi-directional relationships between NCDs, COVID-19 infections and control measures, exploring pandemic impacts in this context is important. We conducted two cross-sectional surveys of adults 30-years in rural Faridpur district, Bangladesh, in February to March 2020 (survey 1, pre-COVID-19), and January to March 2021 (survey 2, post-lockdown). A new random sample of participants was taken at each survey. Anthropometric measures included: blood pressure, weight, height, hip and waist circumference and fasting and 2-hour post-glucose load blood glucose. An interviewer-administered questionnaire included: socio-demographics;lifestyle and behavioural risk factors;care seeking;self-rated health, depression and anxiety assessments. Differences in NCDs, diet and exercise were compared between surveys using chi2 tests, logistic and linear regression;sub-group analyses by gender, age and socio-economic tertiles were conducted. We recruited 950 (72.0%) participants in survey 1 and 1392 (87.9%) in survey 2. The percentage of the population with hypertension increased significantly from 34.5% (95% CI: 30.7, 38.5) to 41.5% (95% CI: 38.2, 45.0;p-value = 0.011);the increase was more pronounced in men. Across all measures of self-reported health and mental health, there was a significant improvement between survey 1 and 2. For self-rated health, we observed a 10-point increase (71.3 vs 81.2, p-value = 0.005). Depression reduced from 15.3% (95% CI: 8.4, 26.1) to 6.0% (95% CI: 2.7, 12.6;p-value = 0.044) and generalised anxiety from 17.9% (95% CI: 11.3, 27.3) to 4.0% (95% CI: 2.0, 7.6;p-value&lt;0.001). No changes in fasting blood glucose, diabetes status, BMI or abdominal obesity were observed. Our findings suggest both positive and negative health outcomes following COVID-19 lockdown in a rural Bangladeshi setting, with a concerning increase in hypertension. These findings need to be further contextualised, with prospective assessments of indirect effects on physical and mental health and care-seeking.","King, C.; Shaha, S.

"Knowledge, attitude, and practice of Bangladeshi urban slum dwellers towards COVID-19 transmission-prevention: a cross-sectional study","The first COVID-19 case in Bangladesh was detected on March 8, 2020. Since then, efforts are being made across the country to raise awareness among the population for preventing the spread of this virus. We aimed to examine the urban slum dwellers' knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) towards COVID-19 transmission-prevention. A phone-based cross-sectional survey was conducted in five slums of Dhaka City. Total 476 adult slum dwellers were interviewed between October 31 to December 1, 2020 using a pre-tested questionnaire. During an interview, information was collected on participants' demographic characteristics and KAP items towards COVID-19. We used quartiles for categorization of knowledge and practice score where the first quartile represents poor, the second and third quartiles represent average while the fourth quartile represents good. Attitude score was standardized using z-score and identified as positive and negative attitude. Multiple linear regression models were used separately to identify the socioeconomic predictors of the KAP scores. The results showed that 25% of the respondents had good knowledge and 25% had poor knowledge, 48% had a positive attitude and 52% had a negative attitude, and 21% maintained good practice and 33% maintained poor practice towards COVID-19 transmission-prevention. About 75% respondents relied on television for COVID-19 related information. Regression results showed that knowledge and attitude scores were significantly higher if respondents had primary or secondary and above level of education compared to the uneducated group. Female respondents maintained significantly good practice compared to their male counterparts (beta = 6.841;p&lt;0.01). This study has found that one third of the studied slum dwellers maintained poor practice and one fourth had poor knowledge towards COVID-19 transmission-prevention. As KAP domains are significantly correlated, efforts are needed to raise awareness of COVID-19 particularly targeting individuals with average and lower knowledge to improve attitude and practice for the prevention of COVID-19.","Hasan, M.

"Depression, anxiety, and stress among frontline health workers during the second wave of COVID-19 in southern Vietnam: a cross-sectional survey","Health workers around the world have taken on massive frontline roles in the fight against COVID-19, often under intense pressure and in the face of uncertainty. In this study, we determined the rates of depression, anxiety, stress and related factors among health workers in COVID-19 designated hospitals in southern Vietnam during the second wave of COVID-19. From July-September 2020, we collected self-administered surveys from 499 health workers in 14 hospitals that were designated for the care and treatment of patients with COVID-19. The survey included sections on demographics, co-morbid health conditions, symptoms experienced during patient care, a depression, anxiety and stress assessment (DASS-21), and other related factors. We used logistic regression models to identify factors associated with depression, anxiety and stress, and adjusted for confounding factors. 18%, 11.5%, 7.7% of participants had symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively with the majority at mild and moderate levels. The risk factors for increased mental health impact included long working hours, experiencing physical symptoms, fear of transmission to family, COVID-19 related stigma, and worry when watching media about COVID-19. Psychological counseling and training in infection prevention were protective factors that reduced the risk of mental health problems. Further exploration of the association between physical symptoms experienced by health workers and mental health may guide interventions to improve health outcomes. More routine COVID-19 testing among health workers could reduce anxieties about physical symptoms and alleviate the fear of transmitting COVID-19 to family and friends. Medical institutions need to ensure that health workers have access to basic trainings prior to initiation of work, and mental health support during the pandemic and into the future.","Anh Le Thi, Ngoc, Chinh Dang, Van, Phong Nguyen, Thanh, Lewycka, S.; Nuil, J.

"Corona virus fear among health workers during the early phase of pandemic response in Nepal: a web-based cross-sectional study","Health workers involved in the COVID-19 response might be at risk of developing fear and psychological distress. The study aimed to identify factors associated with COVID-19 fear among health workers in Nepal during the early phase of the pandemic. A web-based survey was conducted in April-May 2020 among 475 health workers directly involved in COVID-19 management. The Fear Scale of COVID 19 (FCV-19S) was used to measure the status of fear. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with COVID fear. The presence of COVID-19 fear was moderately correlated with anxiety and depression, and weakly correlated with insomnia. Nurses, health workers experiencing stigma, working in affected district, and presence of family members with chronic diseases were significantly associated with higher odds of developing COVID-19 fear. Based on the study findings, it is recommended to improve the work environment to reduce fear among health workers, employ stigma reduction interventions, and ensure personal and family support for those having family members with chronic diseases.","Khanal, P.; Paudel, K.; Devkota, N.; Dahal, M.; Mishra, S.

"Suicidal Ideation Amongst University Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Time Trends and Risk Factors","Examine time trends in suicidal ideation in post-secondary students over the first three waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada and identify subpopulations of students with increased risk. We analysed 14 months of data collected through repeated cross-sectional deployment of the World Health Organization (WHO) World Mental Health-International College Student (WMH-ICS) survey at the University of British Columbia. Estimated log odds weekly trends of 30-day suicidal ideation (yes/no) were plotted against time with adjustments for demographics using binary logistic generalized additive model (GAM). Risk factors for 30-day suicidal ideation frequency (four categories) were examined using the ordered logistic GAM, with a cubic smoothing spline for modelling time trend in obervation weeks and accounting for demographics. Nearly one-fifth (18.9%) of students experienced suicidal ideation in the previous 30 days. While the estimated log odds suggested that binary suicidal ideation was relatively stable across the course of the pandemic, an initial drop followed by an increasing trend was observed. Risk factors for suicidal ideation frequency during the pandemic included identifying as Chinese or as another non-Indigenous ethnic minority; experiencing current symptoms of depression or anxiety; having a history of suicidal planning or attempts; and feeling overwhelmed but unable to get help as a result of COVID-19. Older age was identified as a protective factor. The general university student population in our study was relatively resilient with respect to suicidal ideation during the first three waves of the pandemic, but trends indicate the possibility of delayed impact. Specific sub-populations were found to be at increased risk and should be considered for targeted support. Further analyses should be undertaken to continue monitoring suicidality trends throughout the remainder of the pandemic and beyond.","Jones, Vereschagin, Wang, Munthali, Pei, Richardson, Halli, Xie, Rush, Yatham, Gadermann, Pendakur, Prescivalli, Munro, Bruffaerts, Auerbach, Mortier, Vigo","https://doi.org/10.1177/07067437221140375","20221207","COVID-19; mental health; pandemic; student; suicidal ideation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-07","",42158,""
"Burnout Syndrome During COVID-19 Second Wave on ICU Caregivers","The main objective of this article is to evaluate the prevalence of burnout syndrome (BOS) among the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) healthcare workers. The COVID-impact study is a study conducted in 6 French intensive care units. Five units admitting COVID patient and one that doesn't admit COVID patients. The survey was conducted between October 20th and November 20th, 2020, during the second wave in France. A total of 208 professionals responded (90% response rate). The Maslach Burnout Inventory scale, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Impact of Event Revisited Scale were used to study the psychological impact of the COVID-19 Every intensive care unit worker. The cohort includes 208 professionals, 52.4% are caregivers. Almost 20% of the respondents suffered from severe BOS. The professionals who are particularly affected by BOS are women, engaged people, nurses or reinforcement, not coming willingly to the intensive care unit and professionals with psychological disorders since COVID-19, those who are afraid of being infected, and people with anxiety, depression or post-traumatic stress disorder. Independent risk factors isolated were being engaged and being a reinforcement. Being a volunteer to come to work in ICU is protective. 19.7% of the team suffered from severe BOS during the COVID-19 pandemic in our ICU.

"Differences in Household Preparedness and Adaptation for COVID-19","To quantify differences in preparedness for and adaptations to COVID-19 in a cohort sample of New York City residents. A proportional quota sample (n=1,020) of individuals residing in New York City during the COVID-19 pandemic participated in a Qualtrics web survey. Quotas were set for age, sex, race, and income to mirror the population of New York City based on the 2018 American Community Survey. Low self-efficacy, low social support, and low sense of community increased the odds of securing provisions to prepare for COVID-19. Being an essential worker, poor mental health, and children in the household reduced the likelihood of engaging in preparedness practices. Essential workers and individuals with probable serious mental illness were less likely to report preparedness planning for the pandemic. The findings contribute to evolving theories of preparedness. There are differences across the sample in preparedness types, and different kinds of preparedness are associated with different household characteristics. Findings suggest that public officials and others concerned with population wellbeing might productively turn attention to education and outreach activities indexed to these characteristics.","Clay, Kendra","https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2022.271","20221207","COVID-19; adaptation; disaster preparedness; household preparedness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-07","",42160,""

"Investigating the role of predictive death anxiety in the job satisfaction of pre-hospital emergency personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic","Pre-hospital emergency staffs as the frontline forces fighting against COVID -19 have been affected by this pandemic. Today, the occupational and mental health of these individuals is particularly important to the health care system. Death anxiety is one of the inevitable things in this job, and not paying attention to it can cause unwanted effects such as changing the level of job satisfaction of the personnel. The purpose of this study was to determine the role of predictive death anxiety in the job satisfaction of pre-hospital emergency personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted among pre-hospital emergency staffs in Qazvin Province, Iran in 2021-2022. Among the bases chosen by the census method, 198 samples were included in the study by the available method. Data collection tools included the Demographic Checklist, Templer's Death Anxiety scale, and the Minnesota Job Satisfaction Questionnaire. The data were analyzed with descriptive and inferential statistics and SPSS 20 software. The mean age of the samples was (33.14&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;6.77). 167 persons were male and the others were female. The average job satisfaction and death anxiety of the personnel were 55.07&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;11.50 and 8.18&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;1.96, respectively. Pearson's correlation coefficient between the two variables was r&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.126 And a null correlation coefficient hypothesis has been confirmed with p-value&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.077. The results showed a high level of death anxiety and average job satisfaction. Although these two variables do not have a significant relationship with each other, considering that they do not have the appropriate level, it needs more investigation and consideration.","Chegini, Soltani, Noorian, Amiri, Rashvand, Rahmani, Aliakbari, Senmar","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12873-022-00762-x","20221206","Anxiety; COVID-19; Death; Emergency medical service; Job satisfaction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-07","",42163,""
"Emotional wellbeing of student midwives during COVID-19","Mental health of students in higher education was affected during the COVID-19 pandemic. To examine the emotional wellbeing of midwifery students in the Netherlands and Flanders (Belgium) during COVID-19. A cross-sectional online-based survey with 619 Dutch and Flemish midwifery students. Sociodemographic details were obtained. Anxiety and depression were measured twice (T1, T2) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Flemish students had significantly higher mean depression and anxiety scores than Dutch students during the total period of study (p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;.001; p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;.001). Total group mean depression and anxiety scores were significantly higher at T2 compared to T1 (p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;.001; p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;.001). In the Dutch student group, there was a significant increase of depression from T1 to T2 (p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;.001). In the Flemish student group, both depression and anxiety scores significantly increased from T1 to T2 (p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;.001; p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;.001). A history of psychological problems predicted both depression and anxiety, irrespective of COVID-19 period or country (p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;.001; p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;.001). Being single (p.015) and having a job (p.046) predicted depression, irrespective of period or country. A history of psychological problems predicted depression (p.004; p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;.001) and anxiety (p.003; p.001) during the total period of study. Being single also predicted depression during T2 (p.024). These findings inform how emotional wellbeing of midwifery students was affected during the COVID-19 pandemic and identify those students that might need extra attention after the pandemic, during another pandemic or similar situations with social restrictions.","Kuipers, Mestdagh","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wombi.2022.11.012","20221206","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Education; Mental health; Midwifery students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-07","",42164,""
"Monitoring cognitive and psychological alterations in COVID-19 patients: A longitudinal neuropsychological study","SARS-COV-2 infection has been associated to long-lasting neuropsychiatric sequelae, including cognitive deficits, that persist after one year. However, longitudinal monitoring has been scarcely performed. Here, in a sample of COVID-19 patients, we monitor cognitive, psychological and quality of life-related profiles up to 22&#xa0;months from resolution of respiratory disease. Out of 657 COVID-19 patients screened at Manzoni Hospital (Lecco, Italy), 22 underwent neuropsychological testing because of subjective cognitive disturbances at 6&#xa0;months, 16&#xa0;months, and 22&#xa0;months. Tests of memory, attention, and executive functions were administered, along with questionnaires for depressive and Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, psychological well-being and quality of life. Cross-sectional descriptives, correlational, as well as longitudinal analyses considering COVID19-severity were carried out. A preliminary comparison with a sample of obstructive sleep apneas patients was also performed. Around 50% of COVID-19 patients presented with cognitive deficits at t0. The most affected domain was verbal memory. Pathological scores diminished over time, but a high rate of borderline scores was still observable. Longitudinal analyses highlighted improvements in verbal and non-verbal long term memory, as well as attention, and executive functioning. Depression and PTSD-related symptoms were present in 30% of patients. The latter decreased over time and were associated to attentional-executive performance. Cognitive dysfunctions in COVID-19 patients may extend over 1&#xa0;year, yet showing a significant recovery in several cases. Cognitive alterations are accompanied by a significant psychological distress. Many patients displaying borderline scores, especially those at higher risk of dementia, deserve clinical monitoring.","Diana, Regazzoni, Sozzi, Piconi, Borghesi, Lazzaroni, Basilico, Aliprandi, Bolognini, Bonardi, Colombo, Salmaggi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2022.120511","20221206","COVID-19; Cognitive functions; Long-COVID; Longitudinal assessment; Neuropsychology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-07","",42165,""
"Postnatal mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic: Impact on mothers' postnatal sense of security and on mother-to-infant bonding","The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic context imposed new living conditions which greatly modified women's experience of the postpartum period and brought significant changes to postnatal care. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic context on maternal sense of security and on mother-to-child bonding in the postpartum. This study had a mixed research design. We compared levels of mother-child bonding disturbances and of maternal emotional security amongst two samples of postnatal women recruited before and during the pandemic. Postnatal depression was also evaluated. A qualitative analysis of the participants' comments on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was performed with an open-coding approach. Two samples of French-speaking mothers in the first six months after their childbirth, recruited before the pandemic (N=874) and during the pandemic (N=721). Mother-child bonding disturbances measured with PBQ and levels of emotional security levels evaluated with PPSSi did not differ significantly between the samples. A high prevalence of women at risk of postnatal depression was found in both samples. However, participants' comments on their postnatal experience during the pandemic contrasted with their quantitative data. Fears of contamination, social isolation, and lack of support were the main factors of insecurity. Lack of closeness with relatives and friends, limited presence of the partner in the maternity ward, and early interactions with the newborn with a mask appear to have altered mother-child bonding during this pandemic period. The findings highlight the importance of considering social and environmental factors and needs when evaluating postnatal mental health and providing postnatal care to new mothers during a health crisis. Health services and professionals should pay particular attention to mothers' mental health and well-being and guarantee continuity of care to avoid parents' isolation in the sensitive postpartum period.","Schaming, Wendland","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.midw.2022.103557","20221206","COVID-19; Care; Mother-infant bonding; Postnatal; Postnatal sense of security; Postpartum","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-07","",42166,""
"MRTs Speak Up: The Professional Identity Crisis Brought on by COVID-19","The purpose of this study is to share the lived experience of Canadian medical radiation technologists (MRTs) in relation to their mental health during the pandemic by exploring the causes and impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the professional group within the workplace. Data from eight semi-structured interviews and one focus group were conducted between April and June 2021. Audio files were transcribed and uploaded to a qualitative data analysis computer software program (NVivo) where codebook thematic analysis was conducted. Participants identified mental health themes at work within the individual, relationship, organization and policy levels. The pandemic alone did not cause MRTs to burnout, the changing policies combined with individual, familial and organization factors merely highlighted the chronic and increasing mental health concerns that existed pre-pandemic. Understanding this snap shot in time may aid in developing appropriate resources and improve workplace culture and mental health seeking behaviours for MRTs. These findings elucidate the need for more timely and equitable funding/resources to ensure that all healthcare workers are recognized and supported.","Corrente, Zychia, Given, Mihailescu","https://www.google.com/search?q=MRTs+Speak+Up:+The+Professional+Identity+Crisis+Brought+on+by+COVID-19.","20221206","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-07","",42167,""
"Telerehabilitation program maintains functional capacity in patients with chronic lung disease during a period of social isolation owing to COVID-19: a quasi-experimental retrospective study","Pulmonary diseases represent a great cause of disability and mortality in the world and, considering the progression of these pathologies, pulmonary rehabilitation programs are proven to be effective. During the COVID-19 pandemic, telerehabilitation becomes an alternative for these patients. The aim of this study was to determine results in outcomes such as functional capacity and quality of life when comparing telerehabilitation to usual care in patients previously participating in face-to-face PRP. A quasi-experimental retrospective study realized between Abril 2020 to August 2021. Thirty-two patients with chronic diseases were included, divided between control and intervention groups. The intervention group performed telerehabilitation synchronously twice a week supervised by a physical therapist with breathing, strengthening and aerobic exercises. Dyspnea and legwear were adjusted by changing BORG. The control group did not perform any activity during the period of social isolation. Quality of life was assessed by the minute walk test and quality of life by the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form Health Survey. The telerehabilitation group reduced 39 meters in the six-minute walk test, while the control group reduced 120 meters. There was difference of 81 meters between the groups (p=0.02). In relation to the quality of life of telerehabilitation was shown improve in two domains, social functioning and mental health. Telerehabilitation program for these patients can ease the deleterious effects of disease progression and maintain functional capacity and improve aspects of quality of life.","Miozzo, Camponogara Righi, Yumi Shizukuishi, Marques Ferreira, Florian, da Costa Machado, Schardong, Della M&#xe9;a Plentz","https://doi.org/10.2196/40094","20221206","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-07","",42168,""
"Use of online health forums by people living with breast cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative analysis","At the time of the UK COVID-19 lockdowns, online health forums (OHFs) were one of the relatively few remaining accessible sources of peer support for people living with breast cancer. Cancer services were heavily affected by the pandemic in many ways including the closure of many of the customary support services. Previous research indicates that loneliness, anxiety, distress and depression caused by COVID-19 were common amongst people living with breast cancer, and this suggests that the role of the OHF in providing users with support, information and empathy could have been of increased importance at that time. The aim of this paper is to examine how people living with breast cancer shared information, experiences and emotions in an online health forum during the COVID-19 pandemic. This qualitative study thematically analysed posts from the discussion forums of an OHF provided by the UK charity, Breast Cancer Now. We selected 1,053 posts from the time of two UK lockdowns: 16 March - 15 June 2020 (Lockdown 1), and 6 January - 8 March 2021 (Lockdown 3) for analysis from two of the forum's boards (for recently diagnosed people and for those undergoing chemotherapy). We analysed the data using Braun &amp; Clarke's original six steps for thematic analysis, but following a 'codebook' approach. Descriptive statistics for posts were also derived. We found that COVID-19 amplified the forum's value to its users. As cancer patients, participants were in a situation that was 'bad enough already' and the COVID-19 pandemic heightened this. The forum's value, already high for the information and peer support it provided, increased because COVID-19 caused some special information needs that forum users were uniquely well-placed to fulfil, as people experiencing the combined effects of having breast cancer during the pandemic. The forum also met emotional needs generated by the COVID-19 pandemic, and was valued as a place where loneliness during the pandemic might be relieved and users' spirits lifted in a variety of ways specific to this period. We found some differences in usage between the two periods and the two boards: most noticeable was the greater fear and anxiety expressed at the start of Lockdown 1. Both the start and end of lockdown periods were particularly difficult for participants, with the ends seen as potentially increasing isolation. The forums were an important source of support and information to their users, with their value increasing during the lockdowns for a variety of reasons. Our findings will be helpful to organizations offering OHFs, and to healthcare workers advising people living with breast cancer on sources of support.","Sanger, Duffin, Gough, Bath","https://doi.org/10.2196/42783","20221206","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-07","",42169,""
"The course of psychiatric symptoms in older age bipolar disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic gives us the unique opportunity to study the course of psychiatric symptoms and resilience in older adults with bipolar disorder (OABD) whilst experiencing a collective long lasting stressor. The aim of this study was to investigate the course of depressive, manic and anxiety symptoms in OABD during the first six months of COVID-19 and how loneliness and mastery are associated with this course. Mastery is defined as the control one experiences over one's life and environment. Resilience is defined as adaptation to challenging life conditions encompassing several aspects of personal resources. In April 2020 (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;81), June 2020 (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;66) and September 2020 (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;51), participants were included from the Dutch Older Bipolars (DOBi) cohort study. Depressive, manic and anxiety symptoms increased over all timepoints. Participants with a higher sense of mastery experienced a greater increase in depressive and anxiety symptoms. Loneliness did not interact with the course of these symptoms. OABD were resilient in the first months of COVID-19 outbreak, however depressive, manic and anxiety symptoms increased as the pandemic continued. Treatment strategies in coping with long lasting stressful events should include the focus on sense of mastery.","Orhan, Korten, Kok, Loef, Kupka, Schouws, van Oppen, Dols","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40345-022-00274-4","20221206","Anxiety; Bipolar disorder; COVID-19; Depressive; Mania; Older adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-07","",42170,""

"Prepandemic Mental Health and Well-being: Differences Within the Health Care Workforce and the Need for Targeted Resources","Occupational stress and diminished well-being among health care workers were concerning even before the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic exacerbated existing stressors and created new challenges for this workforce. Research on the mental health of health care workers has focused on physicians and nurses, with less attention to other occupations. To assess pre-coronavirus disease mental health and well-being among workers in multiple health care occupations, we used 2017 to 2019 data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Across the health care workforce, insufficient sleep (41.0%) and diagnosed depression (18.9%) were the most common conditions reported. Counselors had the highest prevalence of diagnosed depression. Health care support workers had elevated prevalences for most adverse health conditions. Ensuring a robust health care workforce necessitates identifying and implementing effective occupation-specific prevention, intervention, and mitigation strategies that address organizational and personal conditions adversely affecting mental health.","Silver, Li, Marsh, Carbone","https://doi.org/10.1097/JOM.0000000000002630","20221206","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-07","",42172,""
"Psychometric properties of the depression, anxiety, stress scales-21 (DASS-21) in a sample of health care workers in Oman","Background Despite its wide usage among healthcare workers (HCWs), Depression Anxiety Stress Scales 21 (DASS-21) has received scant attention in terms of its psychometric properties among HCWs. The present study examined the factor structure of DASS-21 among representative HCWs in Muscat Region, Oman. The related aim is to examine factorial invariance across samples of males and females. Methods Confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to evaluate the latent structure of DASS-21. Factorial invariance between males and females was examined. The Cronbach alpha coefficients of DASS-21 were calculated to assess the internal consistency of the scale. Results The CFA of the DASS-21 indicated that the three-factor solution best fits the data. The results also showed that DASS21 had overall good-to-excellent reliability. Multigroup analysis did not indicate gender differences. Limitations The present research study was limited as the accrued sample was drawn from HCWs working in the urban area, the Muscat region. As the study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, this has the potential to constitute potential confounder to hamper the generalization of the present study. Conclusions The results supported the applicability of DASS-21 across cultures and sex. The present data provide initial support for the psychometric properties of Arabic DASS among HCWs.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadr.2022.100451","20221201","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-07","",42173,""
