"The Legal Responsibility to the Family for Shackling People with Mental Illness During the Covid-19 Pandemic","During the COVID-19 pandemic until June 2020, there were 277,000 mental health cases in Indonesia. The number increase compared to 2019. The number of shackling due to mental illness increased from 5,200 in 2019 to 6,200 in 2020. Shackling is strictly prohibited because it violates the law and human rights. Criminal sanctions in Article 333 of the Criminal Code are prepared for those who shackle people with mental illness. The punishment stipulated in this article is also applied to people who intentionally give space to the deprivation of other peopleâ€™s freedom.The program of â€œIndonesia Shackle-Freeâ€ was launched in 2010, the target was forced to be pushed back until 2019 and remains challenging to achieve. The number of shackling increases due to a lack of public understanding of mental health. This paper aims to explore further the relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and the condition of people with mental illnesses (ODGJ) in Indonesia. Another impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ODGJ is drug withdrawal because of the disruption of drug circulation during the pandemic. The allocation of health financing is also focused on dealing with the pandemic.Promotive efforts are expected to eliminate stigma, discrimination, and human rights violations for ODGJ in the community. Whereas, preventive efforts by developing parenting styles that support mental growth and development, communication, and education in the family are expected to provide appropriate mental health services for ODGJ when entering the rehabilitation stage.","Ariawan, Y.; Dewi, C.; Manuaba, R.

"Dry eyes and COVID-19: a narrative review","With the advent of the pandemic scenario caused by SARS-CoV-2 in the beginning of the year 2020, a vast clinical picture was noticed among the infected individuals. Among the most common eye symptoms caused by Covid-19, dry eye (DE) has become quite prevalent in this environment. The narrative review study seeks to assess the risk factors associated with the emergence or intensification of DE conditions in the population during the pandemic period. A literature review showed the influence of positive pressure ventilation, incorrect use of masks, as well as electronic screens, in addition to anxiety and depression as predisposing factors for the development of dry eye disease. However, the need for more explanatory studies and for establishing a direct relationship between the causality of the factors is still noted","da Cunha, C. E. X.; Castro, L. R.; MendonÃ§a, V. P.

"AN INVESTIGATION OF FACTORS RELATED TO SUBJECTIVE MEMORY COMPLAINTS OF OLDER ADULTS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC","Introduction: The purpose of this research was to determine the individual factors that predict the subjective memory complaints of older adults during the Covid-19 pandemic. Materials and Method: The sample of the study consisted of 356 older adults aged between 60 and 88 years (xÂ¯= 67.03, SD = 5.72). Subjective Memory Complaints Questionnaire, Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form, The Scale of Loneliness for the Elderly, Quality of Life Scale in Older People, and SocioDemographic Information Form were administered to the participants. In order to examine the relationships among the variables, correlation analysis was performed. In addition, a hierarchical regression analysis was conducted to determine the variables predicting subjective memory complaints. Results: The subjective memory complaints of this age group were found to be positively related to depression and loneliness levels, while they were discovered to be negatively associated with quality of life. The results of hierarchical regression analysis indicated that each of the variables of gender, perceived socioeconomic status, loneliness, quality of life, and depression included in the analysis at different steps were a significant predictors of subjective memory complaints. Conclusion: Our results showed that there is a need for interventions that will expand social support networks, improve quality of life, and reduce depression levels in order to prevent subjective memory complaints of elderly individuals during the Covid-19 pandemic.","Duman, F.; Ebeoglu Duman, M.","https://doi.org/10.31086/tjgeri.2022.287","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Turk Geriatri Dergisi; 25(2):291-300, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-09","",35737,""

"Acute and long-term neurological disorders in patients with coronavirus infection","Currently, patients who attribute their complaints and disorders to the past COVID-19 are turning to a neurologist for a consultation. One should consider dangerous complications of COVID-19 such as stroke, including cerebral venous thrombosis, autoimmune encephalitis and myelitis, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, Guillain-Barre' syndrome. Disorders of consciousness, disorders of smell and taste, headache and dizziness are significantly more often present in the acute period of COVID-19. Long-term persistence of complaints and disorders after COVID-19 is regarded as post-COVID syndrome (PCS). Neurological complaints and disorders in a patient who has had COVID-19 are often caused by the development or exacerbation of a comorbid disease, including primary headache, musculoskeletal pain in the neck and back, various vestibular disorders, Alzheimer's disease, anxiety and depressive disorders. Unfortunately, in real clinical practice, these diseases are often not diagnosed, patients are observed with a diagnosis of PCS, and it is not taken into account that the basis for diagnosing PCS is the exclusion of other diseases that can explain complaints and disorders in a patient who has suffered from COVID-19.","Parfenov, V.

"The Effectiveness of an Outpatient Personalized Multidisciplinary Intervention Model, Guided by Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment, for Pre-Frail and Frail Elderly","Background: Our study evaluates the efficacy of an outpatient personalized multidisciplinary intervention model guided by comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA), for pre-frail and frail elderly. Methods: A single-arm self-controlled study was conducted at the outpatient departments (OPD) of a medical center in Taiwan. Subjects received personalized multidisciplinary intervention, including physical therapy, psychotherapy, a nutritional consultation, precise medicine, and social resource linkage, as determined by the results of their CGAs. After 3 months of interventions, change in the proportions of the frail status (frail, pre-frail and robust), functional scores, depressive status, cognition, nutritional status, percentage of inappropriate medication used and social resource usage were analyzed. A logistic regression model was applied to determine the predictive factors associated with an improvement in frail severity. Results: A significant improvement in frail status was found (proportion of frail: 44.5% versus 23.1%, p &lt; 0.001). Physical function, depressive and nutritional status were also significantly improved. 18.5% of participants used inappropriate medications, with benzodiazepine hypnotics the most common (40.9%). 24.2% of subjects were successfully linked to social resources. The presence of the frail phenotypes exhaustion was significantly associated with an improvement in frail severity (odds ratio (OR) = 2.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.15â€“6.66, p = 0.023). There was a significant dose response relationship between the improvement of frail status and physical training times (proportion of improved frail status: 23.7%, 40.5% and 47.9% for 0, 1â€“3, and 4â€“6 times of physical training, p = 0.03). Conclusion: The reported CGA-based, personalized multidisciplinary intervention model was effective at improving frail severity among pre-frail and frail elderly in OPDs.","Hung, Y. Y.; Wang, W.

"Childhood Obesity in the Age of COVID: The Epidemic within the Pandemic","Childhood obesity (CO) is a health problem whose primary cause is positive energy balance (increased food intake and decreased physical activity) and which has been ag-gravated by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and by the measures put in place to mitigate it by inducing a more obe-sogenic environment, sedentary lifestyles and poor eating habits. Method and Purpose: Through a narrative review, we will describe the evidence of prevalence changes in CO during the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated factors. Findings: During the COVID-19 pandemic, significant in-creases in CO prevalence have been observed versus the pre-pandemic period, mainly affecting preschoolers. In addition, it has been possible to identify some elements possibly related to the changes observed such as screen time, eating habits, obesogenic environment, physical activity and sedentary lifestyle, depression and anxiety. Conclusiones: Despite the limited information from some countries regarding the behaviour of CO prevalence during the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an evident need to improve epidemiological surveillance systems and make rigorous investments to improve research in this area.","Mogrovejo, L.

"The Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Pre-School Age Children: A Retrospective Study","Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of pandemic conditions on the mental problems of pre-school age children. Methods: The file data of pre-school age children (aged 72 months or less) presenting to a child and adolescent psychiatry clinic between March 30, 2020, and March 30, 2021, were examined retrospectively. Results: Boys constituted 67.9% of the 249 children included in the study, and girls 32.1%. The youngest patient was aged 5 months, and the oldest, 72 months. The mean age of the entire patient group was 42.82 Â± 14.84 months. Mean age among boys was 42.44 Â± 15.06 months, and mean age among girls was 43.61 Â± 14.43 months (P = .561). Presentation symptoms frequently involved neurodevelopmental problems. Analy-sis showed that 76.7% of cases were not attending any educational institution. At least one diagnosis based on DSM-5 diagnostic criteria was present in 83.5% of cases. The most frequent diagnoses were general developmental delay (22.1%), developmental language disorder (16.5%), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (14.5%), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (11.6%), and childhood-onset fluency disorder (stuttering) (7.6%). Gender comparisons showed that ASD was significantly more common in boys than in girls (P = .004). Conclusion: The results of this study indicate a higher rate of diagnosis than in studies performed before the pandemic. In addition, presentations due to certain neurodevelopmental disorders seen more frequently in boys also increased among girls during the pandemic. Our study results will be useful in guiding the development of protective mental health services for pre-school children.","KiliÃ§aslan, F.; Bakirci, B.; Ayaydin, H.; KÃ¼tÃ¼k, M.

"Investigation of Anxiety Levels of Inpatients with a Diagnosis of COVID-19 and Depression, Hopelessness, Anxiety, and Perceived Social Support Levels of Their Parents","Objective: The aim of this study is to reveal the relationship between the anxiety levels of children diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 and who are hospitalized and their parentsâ€™ levels of depression, hopelessness, anxiety, and perceived social support. Methods: Childhood State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Hopelessness Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and Perceived Social Support Scale were applied. The control group consisted of 56 children hospitalized in the general pediatric service with the diagnosis of acute bronchitis, pneumonia, lower respiratory tract infection, and their accompanying parents. Results: Children hospitalized with the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 had significantly higher CSTAI scores and their parentsâ€™ BDI and STAI scores. In both groups, there was a positive significant relationship between the anxiety levels of the children and their parentsâ€™ depression, hopelessness, and anxiety levels. Conclusion: With the pandemic, mental afflictions were inevitable in children, but studies examining the psychological effects of children and their parents who have been diagnosed with the disease and are hospitalized are limited. The findings of the study show that children hospitalized with the diagnosis of COVID-19 and their parents are more psychologically affected.

"Internet addiction in adolescents: Role of family, personality and comorbid psychopathology in school children in Eastern India","Context: There is an increasing prevalence of internet addiction among adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic, but very few Indian studies have assessed and taken into account various factors that can explain internet addiction in this vulnerable population. Aims: We examine the differences in family functioning, temperament, character and psychopathology in adolescents with and without internet addiction. Settings and Design: 1000 adolescents from urban middle-class families were included in this cross-sectional, two-randomized-group designed, comparative study. Clinical and control group population were selected from high schools. Those with severe internet addiction were compared to those with no addiction. Methods and Materials: Internet Addiction Test, Temperament and Character Inventory, Devereux Scale of Mental Disorders and McMaster Family Assessment Device were administered along with General Health and CRAFFT Questionnaire as screening tool. Statistical Analysis Used: Mann-Whitney U test was done along with Spearman's rank-difference coefficient of correlation. Result: Adolescents with internet addiction had high novelty seeking and low persistence. Internet addiction was also associated with conduct problems and depression. There was a significant positive association between depression and years of internet usage. Family of adolescents with internet addiction had increased difficulty in problem solving, communication, affective responsiveness, affective involvement and behavior control. Conclusion: Adolescents with internet addiction have temperament difficulties, more psychopathology and belong to dysfunctional families. Since the family plays a central role in an Indian context, family-focused strategies must also be included in the management of internet addiction.","Rathi, M.; Guha, P.; Neogi, R.","https://doi.org/10.4103/indianjpsychiatry.indianjpsychiatry_783_21","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Indian Journal of Psychiatry; 64(4):408-414, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-09","",35745,""
"SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with increased odds of insomnia, RLS and dream enactment behavior","Background: Literature suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in poor sleep quality, especially among the infected population. However, literature regarding the effect of COVID-19 pandemic and SARS-CoV-2 infection on occurrence of insomnia, restless legs syndrome and dream enactment behavior is either scarce or unavailable. Methods: This study was planned to assess the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the occurrence of insomnia, restless legs syndrome (RLS) and dream enactment behavior (DEB). For this cross-sectional study, a questionnaire comprising of items related to demographic details, past medical history, and information related to SARS-CoV-2 infection was distributed through social media. Insomnia was diagnosed using clinical criteria. RLS, DEB, sleep quality, depression and anxiety were assessed using a validated questionnaire. Information regarding the use of hypnotic medications was also gathered. Results: Of the 1596 respondents, 37.2% reported disturbed sleep while insomnia was reported by 22.6% respondents. 27.3% of respondents reported RLS and 17.4% suffered DEB. The odds of insomnia were greater among males (OR = 1.27;95% CI: 1.03-1.58;P &lt; 0.02) and among those who had SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR = 1.76;95% CI = 1.42-2.19;P &lt; 0.001). Similarly, SARS-CoV-2 infection was also associated with increased odds of RLS (OR = 2.48;95% CI = 1.98-3.11;P &lt; 0.001) and DEB (OR = 1.58;95%CI = 1.21-2.06;P &lt; 0.001). Insomnia, RLS and DEB were more frequent among respondents who required oxygen therapy, those who experienced loss of taste and/or smell, depression and anxiety. Prevalence of insomnia, DEB and RLS was higher than said prevalence among respondents with no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but lower than that of those with positive history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 5.3% of respondents reported taking hypnotic medications before infection, 7% during infection and 5.3% after infection. Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2-infection-related factors in association with environmental factors have increased the prevalence of insomnia, DEB and RLS among subjects having infection. SARS-CoV-2-associated immunological changes, hypoxia and neurotropism may play a role in occurrence of insomnia, DEB and RLS.","Kumar, N.; Goyal, A.; Hussain, A.; Saini, L.; Chawla, O.; Arora, P.; Daga, R.; Tikka, S.; Goyal, S.; Kanchan, S.; Desai, S.; Ahmed, S.; Das, S.; Dubey, V.; Gupta, R.","https://doi.org/10.4103/indianjpsychiatry.indianjpsychiatry_586_21","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Indian Journal of Psychiatry; 64(4):354-363, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-09","",35746,""
"Trends in State Anxiety during the Full Lockdown in Italy: The Role Played by COVID-19 Risk Perception and Trait Emotional Intelligence","The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with mental health outcomes in the general population. This study assessed how state anxiety changed at different time points during the pandemic and how it was influenced by risk perception and trait emotional intelligence (trait EI). The study was conducted online in two data collections, at the beginning (wave 1, N = 1031) and at the end (wave 2, N = 700) of the lockdown. Participants were asked to self-report their state anxiety, risk perception of COVID-19 contagiousness, and trait EI. The interaction between risk perception and wave showed that, in wave 1 (but not in wave 2), anxiety increased as risk perception increased. Further, trait EI by wave interactions showed that effective (vs. ineffective) regulators experienced lower anxiety and this difference was larger in wave 2 than in wave 1. Because of the cross-sectional design of the study and the convenience sample we should be cautious when generalizing the present findings to the entire population. Our findings support the moderating role of trait EI on state anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. This knowledge provides further support for the importance of EI in coping with uncertain and stressful environmental conditions such as those posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Tedaldi, Elisa, Orabona, Noemi, Hovnanyan, Ani, Rubaltelli, Enrico, Scrimin, Sara","https://doi.org/10.3390/traumacare2030034","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Trauma Care; 2(3):418-426, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-09","",35747,""
"Exploring the Influence of Problematic Mobile Phone Use on Mathematics Anxiety and Mathematics Self-Efficacy: An Empirical Study during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Problematic mobile phone use is a pervasive issue globally and has aroused wide public concerns. Prior studies have indicated that problematic mobile phone use has a series of negative effects on individuals' physical and mental health. However, the effects on student learning have seldom been investigated. During the COVID-19 pandemic, home quarantine and social distancing have led to individuals' greater problematic mobile phone use, and it is essential to have a better understanding of individuals' problematic mobile phone use and its negative effects during this unprecedented period. Given this, the present study investigates the effects of university students' problematic mobile phone use on mathematics self-efficacy and mathematics anxiety, which play critical roles in mathematics learning. This study collected data from 420 students in March 2022, when a large-scale COVID-19 lockdown took place in Shanghai, China. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data. Our findings show that university students' problematic mobile phone use can significantly impact mathematics anxiety and indirectly-yet considerably-influence mathematics self-efficacy.

"Green Space for Mental Health in the COVID-19 Era: A Pathway Analysis in Residential Green Space Users","Residential green space is among the most accessible types of urban green spaces and may help maintain mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is insufficiently understood how residents use residential green space for exercise during the epidemic. The pathways between residential green space and mental health also merit further exploration. Therefore, we conducted an online study among Chinese residents in December 2021 to capture data on engagement with urban green space for green exercise, the frequency of green exercise, perceived pollution in green space, perceptions of residential green space, social cohesion, depression, and anxiety. Among the 1208 respondents who engaged in green exercise last month, 967 (80%) reported that green exercise primarily occurred in residential neighborhoods. The rest (20%) reported that green exercise occurred in more distant urban green spaces. The most common reasons that respondents sought green exercise in urban green spaces were better air and environmental qualities. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was then employed to explore the pathways between the perceived greenness of residential neighborhoods and mental health among respondents who used residential green space for exercise. The final model suggested that residential green space was negatively associated with anxiety (&beta;= &minus;0.30, p = 0.001) and depression (&beta;= &minus;0.33, p &lt; 0.001), mainly through indirect pathways. Perceived pollution and social cohesion were the two mediators that contributed to most of the indirect effects. Perceived pollution was also indirectly associated with green exercise through less social cohesion (&beta;= &minus;0.04, p = 0.010). These findings suggest a potential framework to understand the mental health benefits of residential green space and its accompanying pathways during the COVID-19 era.","Li, Hansen, Browning, Matthew H.

"Examining Perceived Stress and Coping Strategies of University Students during COVID-19: A Cross-Sectional Study in Jordan","COVID-19 has changed our lives in all arenas, including higher education and psychological well-being. Three objectives were set forth in this study. We started by examining issues related to online education during the pandemic in Jordan, particularly for students pursuing business studies. Second, we assessed academic, behavioural, and financial stressors that business students experience at Jordanian higher education institutions. Lastly, we examined the possible coping methods students employed to cope and adapt during the pandemic. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted based on the perceived stress scale distributed to 473 Jordanian undergraduate students (18&ndash;27 years of age), across both public and private universities. Results showed an association between academic, behavioural, and financial stressors and students' perceived stress. While students perceived various levels and types of stress during COVID-19, including academic, behavioural, and financial, they also experienced new online skills. However, despite coping with stress, some students (especially females) displayed more stress because of the deficient course content, which added to their perceived stress and left them feeling unmotivated. This study contributes to bettering the university students' mental health.","Alduais, Fahd, Samara, Abeer Ihsan, Al-Jalabneh, Heba Mustafa, Alduais, Ahmed, Alfadda, Hind, Alaudan, Rasha","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19159154","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(15):9154, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-09","",35750,""
"Education-Related COVID-19 Difficulties and Stressors during the COVID-19 Pandemic among a Community Sample of Older Adolescents and Young Adults in Canada","The COVID-19 pandemic created significant disruptions to the provision of education, including restrictions to in-person and remote learning. Little is known about how older adolescents and young adults experienced these disruptions. To address this gap, data were drawn from the Well-Being and Experiences study (the WE Study), a longitudinal community-based sample collected in Manitoba, Canada, from 2017&ndash;2021 (n = 494). Prevalent difficulties or stressors during in-person learning were less interaction with friends or classmates, worrying about grades, less interaction with teachers, and too much screen time (range: 47.3% to 61.25%). Prevalent difficulties or stressors for remote learning were less interaction with friends or classmates and teachers, less physical activity, worrying about grades, and too much screen time (range: 62.8% to 79.6%). Differences related to sex, education level, financial burden, and mental health prior to the pandemic were noted. From a public health perspective, efforts to re-establish social connections with friends, classmates, and teachers;strategies to manage stress related to worrying about grades or resources to improve grades that have declined;and approaches to reduce screen time in school and at home may be important for recovery and for any ongoing or future pandemics or endemics that impact the delivery of education.","Afifi, Tracie O.; Salmon, Samantha, Taillieu, Tamara, Pappas, Katerina V.; McCarthy, Julie-Anne, Stewart-Tufescu, Ashley","https://doi.org/10.3390/educsci12070500","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Education Sciences; 12(7):500, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-09","",35751,""
"Evaluation of General Health Status of Persons Living in Socio-Economically Disadvantaged Neighborhoods in a Large European Metropolitan City","Background: Living in socio-economically disadvantaged neighborhoods can predispose persons to numerous health conditions. The purpose of this study was to report the general health conditions of persons living in disadvantaged neighborhoods in Rome, Italy, a large European metropolitan city. Participants were reached through the mobile facilities of the primary care services of the Dicastery for the Charity Services, Vatican City. Methods: People living in disadvantaged neighborhoods were reached with mobile medical units by doctors, nurses, and paramedics. Demographic characteristics, degree of social integration, housing conditions, and history of smoking and/or alcohol use were investigated. Unstructured interviews and general health assessments were performed to investigate common acute and/or chronic diseases, and history of positivity to COVID-19. Basic health parameters were measured;data were collected and analyzed. Results: Over a 10-month period, 436 individuals aged 18&ndash;95 years were enrolled in the study. Most lived in dormitories, whereas a few lived in unsheltered settings. Most participants (76%) were unemployed. Smoking and drinking habits were comparable to the general population. The most common pathological conditions were cardiovascular diseases in 103 subjects (23.39%), diabetes in 65 (14.9%), followed by musculoskeletal system disorders (11.7%), eye diseases (10.5%), psychiatric conditions such as anxiety and depression (9.2%), and chronic respiratory conditions (8.7%). Conclusions: Subjects in our sample showed several pathologic conditions that may be related to their living conditions, thus encouraging the development of more efficient and effective strategies for a population-tailored diagnosis and treatment.","Iacoella, Claudia, De-Giorgio, Fabio, Palaia, Gaspare, Ferraioli, Mario, Arcangeli, Andrea, Ralli, Massimo","https://doi.org/10.3390/app12157428","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Applied Sciences; 12(15):7428, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-09","",35752,""
"Evil Challenges and the Economy of Ethiopia at the Era of COVID-19","This article aimed to investigate the challenges that Ethiopia faces during COVID-19. The article looks highly at COVID-19, political instability, desert locust and the ideal conflict between Ethiopia and Egypt on the great Ethiopian renaissance dam. Economic rescission, food insecurity and internal war are also the main topics clearly discussed. The results revealed that unemployment, inflation and income inequality are aggravated as pandemics arise. Thousands were killed and others were displaced due to internal political instability. Output reduction and famine resulted due to desert locust infestation. Bad political spirit is also one fact in Ethiopia due to ideal conflict with Egypt. Consequently, thousands have been arrested;killing innocent people, food insecurity, economic depression and displacement were highly aggravated. While other countries have been moving to prosperity, the Ethiopian economy has been challenged with stagnation. Therefore, the authors suggest that there should be strong intervention from both non-governmental organisation and the government of Ethiopia. Let Ethiopia?s recovery come to tell new development.","Wana, Hika, Ababulgu, Nasir, Kudama, Gezahagn, Gebissa, Bacha, Abajobir, Nugusa","https://doi.org/10.1177/09720634221114668","","Database: Sage; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Health Management;: 09720634221114668, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-09","",35753,""
"EXPANSION OF SEXUAL HEALTH OUTREACH DURING COVID","Introduction Our service expanded its outreach delivery in 2021 during the COVID pandemic. We commenced home visits, and in collaboration with other organisations delivered care in a mobile clinic and alternative non-clinical venues. Methods Retrospective electronic patient records review of patients seen in an outreach setting between March 2021 - March 2022. Results 134 patients were referred to outreach and 106 were seen. The most frequently encountered characteristics, or vulnerabilities, of patients referred to outreach are highlighted in the table. 53% of patients were of White British ethnicity;76% female. STI screening was offered to 104 patients and 43 had positive infections. Vaccinations were offered to 56 patients. Contraception was discussed with 59 patients and LARC initiated in 19. Discussion Implementing new modes of delivery of sexual health care has been possible during the pandemic, meeting the needs of vulnerable populations. There was a high rate of infection positivity and LARC uptake. By working with local organisations we provide holistic care by addressing multiple issues, such as mental health assessment and substance misuse support, in one visit.

"INEQUALITIES IN REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH OUTCOMES DURING COVID-19 IN BRITAIN: NATIONAL SURVEY (NATSAL COVID)","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic presented challenges to delivery of reproductive health services. To explore effects, we examined patterns of contraceptive use, service access and pregnancy planning in the year following the first UK lockdown. Methods The Natsal-COVID Wave 2 survey was conducted in March-April 2021, one year after the first lockdown began in Britain. We analysed a subset of sexually-active participants aged 18-44 years and described as female at birth. We estimated differences in outcomes by age and markers of vulnerability. We examined changing contraception use, access to and unmet need for contraceptive services, and London Measure of Unplanned Pregnancy scores (LMUP;range 0-12). Results Of 1,488 eligible participants, 78.0% were considered at risk of unplanned pregnancies. Of 441 at-risk participants who tried to access contraceptive services, 16.4% faced barriers. Young participants (18-24 years) were most likely to report trying to access contraceptive services (38.4%;(32.2, 45.0);vs 28.4% overall) and to face barriers doing so (OR: 2.87 (1.36, 6.06)). Encountering barriers was more likely among participants reporting no educational qualifications and those reporting symptoms of anxiety or depression. 199 participants reported a pregnancy in the last year. Pregnancies to young participants were less likely to be 'planned' (difference in mean LMUP score: -2.95;(-3.91, -1.99)). Less 'planned' pregnancies were associated with lower social grades and becoming unemployed. Discussion Young and vulnerable participants were more likely to report difficulties accessing reproductive services and less planned pregnancies during the pandemic. In navigating pandemic recovery, sexual health services should consider the needs of these at-risk groups.","Baxter, A.; Geary, R.; Dema, M. E.; PÃ©rez, R.

"COVID-19 VACCINATION UPTAKE AND COVERAGE REPORTED BY MEN WHO HAVE SEX WITH MEN (MSM) IN THE UK IN A LARGE, COMMUNITY SURVEY ('RIISHCOVID')","Introduction MSM are disproportionately affected by health inequalities which may be exacerbated by COVID-19 and pandemic- related restrictions. We examine uptake of the COVID- 19 vaccine in MSM and assess factors associated with vaccination status. Methods An online cross-sectional survey of MSM recruited via social media and dating applications for 3 weeks in November/December 2021. Questions included those on vaccine offer and uptake (1 dose/2 doses/2 doses+booster). Logistic regression assessed factors associated with reporting full vaccination status (=2 doses) by sociodemographic characteristics, HIV status, self-reported COVID history, and mental health indicators. Results Of 1,039 participants, 98.2% (n=1,020) reported everhaving been offered a COVID vaccine, of which 98.0% (1,000/1,020) reported =1 dose and 96.5% (985/1020) full vaccination status. In multivariate models, full vaccination status was associated with: age (aOR:1.04, 95%CI:1.01-1.06 per increasing year), gender (aOR: 0.26, 95%CI:0.09-0.72, gender minority vs cis male), degree-level education (aOR: 2.11,95% CI:1.12-3.98), employment since lockdown (aOR: 2.07,95% CI:1.08-3.94), single relationship status (aOR: 0.50,95% CI:0.25-1.00), self-reported COVID-19 history (aOR: 0.47, 95%CI:0.25-0.88), HPV vaccination history (aOR: 3.32, 95% CI:1.43-7.75), and self-reported low life-worth (aOR: 0.29, 95%CI:0.15-0.54). Conclusion This large community survey suggests COVID-19 vaccine uptake and coverage is high in MSM and exceeds general population vaccination estimates. However, inequalities appear to exist in some groups, including younger age-groups, gender minorities, and those with poorer mental health less likely to report full vaccination. Efforts are needed to limit COVID-related exacerbation of health inequalities in these groups who already experience a greater burden of poor health relative to other MSM.","Ogaz, D.; Allen, H.; Reid, D.; Brown, J.; Mohammed, H.; Saunders, J.; Hughes, G.; Mercer, C.","https://doi.org/10.1136/sextrans-BASHH-2022.18","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sexually Transmitted Infections; 98:A9, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-09","",35756,""
"Is our post-natal debrief clinic offering adequate care to ensure patient satisfaction?","Quality Improvement project on postnatal debrief clinic Objective: To evaluate the post-natal debrief clinic service in the Princess of Wales Hospital (Cwm Taf). Design: This project was a service evaluation, which involved the collection of quantitative and qualitative data. The use of multi-modal data was beneficial, as it provided an objective measure of the outcomes of the clinic, whilst also allowing patients to voice their subjective opinions. Additionally, this study design was adopted as it facilitated the measurement of the service without the need for comparison to a universal standard for post-natal debrief, which doesn't exist. Method: Data was manually extracted from clinic letters and quality of the clinic was assessed through patient feedback forms. A total of 84 patient's outcomes and 53 feedback forms were reviewed. The clinic was compared with national guidelines and services. 20 patients' feedback was collected separately to gauge opinions on telephone clinic (introduced since the start of the COVID pandemic) and face-to- face appointments. Patients were interviewed during this research to gain an individual understanding of the challenges posed to women after traumatic birth experiences. Results: Notable risk factors for attending debrief clinic were identified, such as induction of labour and emergency caesarean section. The majority of patients (67%) seen in the debrief clinic were discharged back to GP care and required no further mental health support. Feedback overwhelmingly shows good satisfaction, with patients highlighting the caring and honest staff who provided clear explanations of labour events and reassurance for future pregnancies. Some areas were identified that may require improvement, such as admin support, referrals and waiting times. Many patients noted all mothers should be offered this service. Comparisons indicate that the clinic is exceeding most peer-led services and national guidelines. 60% of patients felt they preferred telephone over face-to- face appointments. Conclusion: Traumatic birth experiences are relatively common. It is vital to review the debrief services available to patients following these experiences. The clinic has been constantly evolving since its inception, to meet the needs of the patients it cares for and will continue to do so in the future. This service evaluation shows the clinic is providing an excellent level of care, however further evaluations needed in future as we recently introduced offering the debrief service to all the postnatal patients.","Adcock, E.; Patel-Gadhia, R.","https://doi.org/10.1111/1471-0528.20_17178","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology; 129:166, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-09","",35757,""
"Consumo de drogas drogas legales e ilegales y sÃ­ntomas de depresiÃ³n en adultos mayores usuarios de Facebook durante la pandemia por SARS-Cov2 en MÃ©xico","Resumen Antecedentes: Los riesgos para la salud que enfrentan los adultos mayores son diversos;sin embargo, poco se ha explorado acerca del uso y abuso de sustancias psicoactivas en esta poblaciÃ³n. La reclusiÃ³n impuesta por la situaciÃ³n que prevalece debido al SARS-Cov2 ha incrementado los sentimientos de soledad, aislamiento y tristeza asociados a esta edad, que los convierte en un factor de riesgo para el consumo de drogas. Objetivo: Analizar el consumo de drogas legales e ilegales en el personas mayores de 60 aÃ±os usuarios de Facebook y su relaciÃ³n con sÃ­ntomas de depresiÃ³n durante la pandemia por SARS-Cov2. Material y mÃ©todos: Estudio realizado a 380 personas mayores, usuarios de Facebook, que respondieron un cuestionario publicado en lÃ­nea, que indagÃ³ sobre: datos sociodemogrÃ¡ficos, frecuencia y cantidad de consumo de drogas legales e ilegales y sintomatologÃ­a depresiva. Resultados: 50.26% fueron mujeres;la edad promedio fue de 66.79 aÃ±os (DS=5.81);31.05% consumieron alcohol en los Ãºltimos 30 dÃ­as, 22.63% tabaco, tranquilizantes sin prescripciÃ³n mÃ©dica 16.05% y mariguana 7.89%. El consumo de otras drogas ilegales no superaron al 2.6% de la poblaciÃ³n. Al comparar entre consumidores y no consumidores, resultÃ³ que el consumo en los Ãºltimos 30 dÃ­as fue ligeramente mayor en mujeres, en solteros y no se observaron diferencias en funciÃ³n del nivel de escolaridad. Los sÃ­ntomas de depresiÃ³n leve y grave se encontrÃ³ asociada con todas las drogas a excepciÃ³n de tabaco y opiÃ¡ceos. DiscusiÃ³n y conclusiones: Los resultados obtenidos demuestran la necesidad de visibilizar el consumo de drogas entre los adultos mayores y de desarrollar estrategias que disminuyan las alteraciones anÃ­micas que pueden estar experimentando, como el miedo, la angustia y la depresiÃ³n. Background: The health risks faced by older adults are diverse;however, little has been explored about the use and abuse of psychoactive substances in this population. The seclusion imposed by the situation that prevails due to SARS-Cov2 has increased the feelings of loneliness, isolation and sadness associated with this age, which makes them a risk factor for drug use. Objective: To analyze the consumption of legal and illegal drugs in people over 60 years of age who are Facebook users and its relationship with symptoms of depression during the SARS-Cov2 pandemic. Material and methods: Study carried out on 380 elderly people, Facebook users, who answered a questionnaire published online, which inquired about: sociodemographic data, frequency and amount of legal and illegal drug use, and depressive symptomatology. Results: 50.26% were women;the average age was 66.79 years (SD=5.81);31.05% consumed alcohol in the last 30 days, 22.63% tobacco, tranquilizers without medical prescription 16.05% and marijuana 7.89%. The consumption of other illegal drugs did not exceed 2.6% of the population. When comparing between users and non-users, it turned out that consumption in the last 30 days was slightly higher in women, in single people and no differences were observed depending on the level of schooling. Mild and severe depressive symptoms were found to be associated with all drugs except tobacco and opiates. Discussion and conclusions: The results obtained demonstrate the need to make drug use visible among older adults and to develop strategies that reduce the mood disorders they may be experiencing, such as fear, anguish and depression. When comparing between users and non-users, it turned out that consumption in the last 30 days was slightly higher in women, in single people and no differences were observed depending on the level of schooling.","Camacho, Kenya Elena Pinelo, PavÃ³n-LeÃ³n, Patricia, Salas-Garcia, Betzaida, Jorge-CÃ¡rdenas, XÃ³chitl De San, Sustaeta, Paulina Beverido, Mejorada-Fernandez, Jorge SÃ¡nchez","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.regg.2022.07.002","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Revista EspaÃ±ola de GeriatrÃ­a y GerontologÃ­a;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-09","",35758,""
"International PRISMA Scoping Review to Understand Mental Health Interventions for Depression in COVID-19 Patients","Preliminary research indicates that the COVID-19 illness affects the mental well-being of patients. This scoping review, thus, aims to examine the current state of research into mental health treatments for depression symptoms in COVID-19 patients. Select databases were searched on 7/1/2021. Full-text articles involved 1) mental health treatment 2) suicide and/or depression outcomes, 3) a quasi-experimental research trial, and 4) a primary analysis. 11 articles were included in this review. The studies spanned 5 countries, and demonstrated immediate positive effects of mental health treatments and tele-health as a treatment modality for depression in COVID-19 patients. 6 studies were randomized controlled trials. Various treatments were administered, including cognitive behavior therapy, mindfulness, and muscle relaxation. Most interventions were conducted in in-patient units and focused on acute symptoms. There were limitations in the design and description of methodology in many studies, which affects the generalizability and replicability of positive findings. Only two studies included a post-intervention follow-up and one study assessed suicide risk. Thus, this review found there is a pressing need for more research in the area, with greater rigor in study methodology, and for treatments targeting long-term symptoms and suicidality, and outpatient services.","Chennapragada, Lakshmi, Sullivan, Sarah R.; Hamerling-Potts, Kyra K.; Tran, Hannah, Szeszko, Jake, Wrobleski, Joseph, Mitchell, Emily L.; Walsh, Samantha, Goodman, Marianne","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2022.114748","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychiatry Research;: 114748, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-09","",35759,""
"Teachersâ€™ wellbeing, affects, and burnout during the pandemic in Chile","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a dramatic impact upon teachers across the world. In Chile, the confinement also had a negative effect on teachersâ€™ wellbeing. However, there are no studies assessing teachers' mental health, affect, burnout, or social support during this period. Consequently, our study tested a mediation moderation model with Macro from SPSS in a sample of 635 teachers examining subjective wellbeing with the Pemberton Happiness Index, their emotions using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, their burnout with the Questionnaire for the Evaluation of Burnout Syndrome and their social support with the Social Support Questionnaire-Short Form. The study results suggest that the impact of burnout on teachers' wellbeing is mediated by negative and positive emotions. Additionally, this mediation was moderated by social support levels perceived by teachers. These results confirm the importance of providing additional support to teachers during the Pandemic. Resumen La pandemia de COVID-19 ha tenido un impacto negativo en el profesorado de todo el mundo. En Chile, el confinamiento tambiÃ©n ha causado un efecto negativo en el bienestar de los profesores.

"Impact du 3iÃ¨me confinement liÃ© Ã  la COVID19 sur les Ã©motions des FranÃ§ais : Exploration textuelle de 481 601 flux Twitter","Objectif : Ce travail propose lâ€™investigation des rÃ©percussions Ã©motionnelles immÃ©diates des annonces du troisiÃ¨me confinement en France. Afin de rÃ©pondre Ã  cet objectif, nous nous intÃ©ressons aux rÃ©actions Ã©motionnelles exprimÃ©es sur le rÃ©seau social Twitter entre le 11 mars 2021 et le 08 avril 2021. MÃ©thode : 481 601 tweets ont Ã©tÃ© rÃ©cupÃ©rÃ©s via la bibliothÃ¨que rtweet du logiciel R. Une analyse automatisÃ©e du lexique Ã©motionnel a Ã©tÃ© conduite en Ã©tudiant sur le contenu des tweets jours aprÃ¨s jours. Les donnÃ©es ont donc Ã©tÃ© traitÃ©es selon deux approches : (i) lâ€™une transversale et (ii) lâ€™autre considÃ©rant longitudinalement lâ€™aspect dynamique des Ã©motions. RÃ©sultats : Lâ€™impact des annonces de confinement nâ€™est pas anodin. Si des Ã©motions positives peuvent Ãªtre observÃ©es, lâ€™impact reste majoritairement nÃ©gatif et global. Sur lâ€™ensemble de la pÃ©riode considÃ©rÃ©e, le mal-Ãªtre est le ressenti dominant. Il sâ€™illustre par un vÃ©cu de solitude, des sensations de tensions, de la souffrance et/ou de la frustration. Les affects dÃ©pressifs et la souffrance apparaissent Ã©galement de maniÃ¨re prÃ©pondÃ©rante sur lâ€™ensemble des tweets. Les analyses temporelles montrent que les Ã©motions varient dans leur nature et dans leur diversitÃ© selon la date Ã  laquelle les tweets ont Ã©tÃ© publiÃ©s. Les annonces de reconfinement sont ainsi principalement associÃ©es Ã  la haine, mais nâ€™apparaissent que de faÃ§ons transitoires. Discussion : Les rÃ©sultats sont discutÃ©s au regard des fonctions adaptatives que procurent des Ã©motions. Conclusion : L'analyse des messages postÃ©s sur ce rÃ©seau social nous apporte une comprÃ©hension en temps rÃ©el des rÃ©actions Ã©motionnelles en lien avec les annonces de reconfinement. Outre lâ€™examen du type dâ€™Ã©motions mobilisÃ©es, une lecture dynamique de celles-ci a contribuera Ã  faire Ã©merger la signification personnelle que le confinement a pu avoir. This work proposes the investigation of the immediate emotional repercussions of the announcements of the third containment in France. In order to respond to this objective, we are interested in the emotional reactions as they were communicated via the social network Twitter between March 11, 2021 and April 08, 2021. Method: 481,601 tweets were retrieved via the rtweet library of R software. An automated emotional lexicon analysis was conducted. The data were processed according to two approaches : (i) one cross-sectionally and (ii) the other one considering longitudinally the dynamic aspect of emotions by studying the content of tweets, day after day. Results: The impact of the containment announcements is not trivial. If positive emotions can be observed, the impact remains mostly negative and global. Over the whole period considered, the dominant feeling was one of discomfort. It is illustrated by an experience of loneliness, feelings of tension, suffering and/or frustration. Depression and suffering are also predominant in all the tweets. The temporal analyses show that the nature and diversity of emotions vary according to the date on which the tweets were published. The reconfinement announcements are thus mainly associated with hatred but appear to be only transient. Discussion: The results are discussed with respect to the adaptive functions of emotions. Conclusion: The analysis of the messages posted on social networks brings us information for a real-time understanding of the emotional reactions related to reconfinement announcements. In addition to examining the type of emotions mobilized, a dynamic reading of them will help to bring out the personal meaning that the confinement may have had.","Gouvernet, B.; GuÃ©nolÃ©, N.; Chapillon, P.; Combaluzier, S.; Gouvernet, C.; Plaie, T.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psfr.2022.07.003","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychologie FranÃ§aise;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-09","",35761,""
"Far ultraviolet-C radiation from a filtered KrCl lamp does not result in migration of Langerhans cells in human skin","There is global interest in both the beneficial and detrimental health effects of ultraviolet-C (UVC) radiation in the wavelength range 200-230 nm (known as Far-UVC). Technology using Far-UVC is proposed as a highly effective control measure for reducing the transmission of COVID-19. Far-UVC, and other wavelengths of UVC, are well-known to efficiently inactivate pathogens in air and on surfaces. Although studies have shown irradiation of skin with 254 nm UV results in DNA damage in the epidermal basal layer, irradiation with Far-UVC (222 nm) shows minimal DNA damage and only in the granular layer, which is comprised of non-proliferating keratinocytes. Therefore, accumulation of these DNA photoproducts would not be expected to be associated with cancer risk. It has also been shown that even high doses of Far-UVC exposure to human skin do not induce erythema. However, the effects of Far-UVC on the immune system are, to the best of our knowledge, unknown. It is well-reported that both ultraviolet B (UVB 280-315 nm) and ultraviolet-A (UVA 315-400 nm) have effects on cutaneous Langerhans cells (LC), inducing migration from the epidermis to the draining lymph nodes, thereby suppressing skin immune function. Here we present data generated in a range of skin types (Fitzpatrick II-V) demonstrating little or no impact of Far-UVC on the cutaneous immune system, as assessed by Langerhans cell migration, at doses of up to 3,000 mJ/cm2 (US daily limit is 450 mJ/cm2). These results support the safety of filtered Far-UVC use, which could have a transformative effect on public health, allowing effective virus inactivation and reduction of transmission independent of human behavior.

"Depression in healthcare workers: results from the nationwide AMADEUS survey","Background There is now a wealth of evidence showing that work is a major determinant of physical and mental health. Recent studies have suggested increased rates of depression in healthcare workers (HCWs) in the context of the Covid-19 pandemics, with direct impact on care quality and productivity. Aim To determine the rate of clinical depression in a national sample of HCWs in France during the post-Covid-19 area and to identify related factors (professional, individual and health-related risk behaviours) using a structural equation modelling analysis. Method A survey comprising of a number of standardized scales was sent to public and private national healthcare facilities through the mail or disseminated through emails from professional associations and social networks. Results 10325 participants were recruited;3122 (30.2%, 95% confidence interval [29.4-31.1]) met likely diagnostic criteria for clinical depression. Professional factors had the largest total effect (ÃŸ=0.57) (burn-out :ÃŸ=0.74, sustained bullying at the workplace ÃŸ=0.48 and decision-making latitude ÃŸ=-0.47). followed by individual factors (ÃŸ=0.30) (the main individual factor was recurrent major depression, path coefficient = 0.67). Professional factors had both direct (path coefficient = 0.38) and indirect (through health risk behaviours, path coefficient = 0.19) effect on depression. Individual factors had a direct (path coefficient 0.21) and indirect (through health risk behaviours (path coefficient = 0.09) effect on depression. Health risk behaviours had a direct effect on depression (path coefficient = 0.31). Interpretation These results provide potential explanations for the likely causes of poor psychological health amongst HCWs. We propose several potential interventions related to professional factors and health risk behaviours. Our results suggest that improving organizational issues, reducing exposure to potentially morally injurious events, promoting brief naps at work and provision of evidence-based prevention approaches have been reported to be helpful in supporting the mental health of hospital staff (not only relaxation or stress management but training in leadership aspects, increasing the knowledge and practice of giving efficient performance feedback, reducing conflicting demands and peer support programs such as Trauma Risk Management. Our data suggest that developing caregivers reported experience and outcomes measures (CREMs/CROMs) would be helpful to monitor work environment and its effect on depression in healthcare workers.","Fond, Guillaume, Fernandes, Sara, Lucas, Guillaume, Greenberg, Neil, Boyer, Laurent","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2022.104328","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Nursing Studies;: 104328, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-09","",35763,""
"Trends in utilization of antidepressants in twenty European Countries","Introduction: The use of antidepressants seems to be increasing in most countries worldwide, probably due to the increasing burden of stressful life (1). Apart from their therapeutic application, antidepressants are sometimes used as lifestyle drugs. Monitoring antidepressant usage is crucial to prevent unnecessary consumption and avoid adverse effects and additional costs (2). Objectives: The aim of this work was to study trends in antidepressants utilization in various European countries, and to note changes in their usage between the years 2013 and 2019, before the outbreak of COVID 19 pandemic. Methods: Data on antidepressants consumption in 20 European countries were collected from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) data bases. Antidepressants consumption was expressed in Defined Daily Doses (DDDs) per 1,000 inhabitants per day, and calculations referred to years 2013 and 2019. Changes in antidepressants use during this six-year period in each European country were assessed. The statistical package SPSS (Chicago, IL, USA) was used for calculations. Results: There was a huge variation in antidepressants usage among the 20 countries of our study. The mean consumption of antidepressants was 52.67 DDDs per 1,000 inhabitants per day in 2013 (range 10.2-113.7 DDDs) and 62.51 DDDs per 1,000 inhabitants per day in 2019 (range 17.6-146.0 DDDs), with a mean increase of 9.84 DDDs per 1,000 inhabitants per day (18.68%) in just six years. The countries with the highest consumption of antidepressants in 2013 were Iceland (113.7 DDDs), Portugal (87.5 DDDs), Sweden (84.3 DDDs), Belgium (72.1 DDDs), Finland (69.4 DDDs) and Spain (65.2 DDDs). The countries with the highest consumption of antidepressants in 2019 were Iceland (146.0 DDDs), Portugal (123.7 DDDs), Sweden (102.7 DDDs), Spain (83.6 DDDs) and Belgium (81.9 DDDs). The countries with the lowest consumption of antidepressants in 2013 were Latvia (10.2 DDDs), Estonia (21.4 DDDs), Lithuania (24.7 DDDs), and Hungary (27,5 DDDs). The countries with the lowest consumption of antidepressants in 2019 were Latvia (17.6 DDDs), Hungary (29.5 DDDs), Estonia (34,8 DDDs) and Lithuania (35,4 DDDs). The use of antidepressants was increased in all European countries in the study period. There was only one exception: Finland, being one the countries with the highest consumption of antidepressants, reduced their use by 13%. In the countries with the lowest consumption of antidepressants (Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania), the increase in antidepressants usage was higher than 40%. A similarly high increase (41.37%) was also observed in Portugal, which was second in antidepressant use in both years studied (2013 and 2019). The Countries with the lowest increase (less than 5%) were Austria, Norway and Luxemburg, which displayed an average consumption of antidepressants in the study period. Conclusion: There was a huge variation in antidepressants use among the 20 European countries of our study. A trend for increase in antidepressants use was observed in almost all countries during the six-year study period.","Papaioannidou, P.; Tsaluchidu, S.; Stergiopoulou, T.","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00228-022-03333","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: European Journal of Clinical Pharmacology; 78:S73, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-09","",35764,""
"Moxibustion for the Treatment of Distal Peripheral Neuropathy in Diabetes Mellitus: A Case Report","Distal sensory peripheral neuropathy (DSPN) in Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a painful chronic condition that affects oneâ€™s quality of life. People with DSPN experience pain, numbness, tingling, sensory loss, absent or reduced reflexes, and muscle weakness. Distal sensory peripheral neuropathy in T2DM is typically managed with tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants and opiates. However, side effects can occur with pharmaceuticals, therefore a non-invasive symptom management approach such as moxibustion is worthy of consideration. Unfortunately, moxibustion is often overlooked and not considered a viable method for managing symptoms associated with DSPN. This case report illustrates the success of six moxibustion treatments conducted twice weekly for three weeks. The treatments reduced pain related to DSPN and improved indices of neurosensory testing.","Anastasi, J. K.; Hackett, L.; Capili, B.; Dawes, N.

"Navigating the river(s) of systems change: a multi-methods, qualitative evaluation exploring the implementation of a systems approach to physical activity in Gloucestershire, England","Systems approaches aim to change the environments in which people live, through cross-sectoral working, by harnessing the complexity of the problem. This paper sought to identify: (1) the strategies which support the implementation of We Can Move (WCM), (2) the barriers to implementation, (3) key contextual factors that influence implementation and (4) impacts associated with WCM. A multi-methods evaluation of WCM was completed between April 2019 and April 2021. Ripple Effects Mapping (REM) and semi-structured interviewers were used. Framework and content analysis were systematically applied to the dataset. WCM-a physical activity orientated systems approach being implemented in Gloucestershire, England. 31 stakeholder interviews and 25 stakeholders involved in 15 REM workshops. A white-water rafting analogy was developed to present the main findings. The successful implementation of WCM required a facilitative, well-connected and knowledgeable guide (ie, the lead organisation), a crew (ie, wider stakeholders) who's vision and agenda aligned with WCM's purpose, and a flexible delivery approach that could respond to ever-changing nature of the river (ie, local and national circumstances). The context surrounding WCM further strengthened and hampered its implementation. Barriers included evaluative difficulties, a difference in stakeholder and organisational perspectives, misaligned expectations and understandings of WCM, and COVID-19 implications (COVID-19 also presented as a facilitative factor). WCM was said to strengthen cohesion and collaboration between partners, benefit other agendas and policies (eg, mental health, town planning, inequality), and improve physical activity opportunities and environments. This paper is one of the first to evaluate a systems approach to increasing physical activity. We highlight key strategies and contextual factors that influenced the implementation of WCM and demonstrate some of the wider benefits from such approaches. Further research and methodologies are required to build the evidence base surrounding systems approaches in Public Health.","Nobles, Fox, Inman-Ward, Beasley, Redwood, Jago, Foster","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2022-063638","20220808","health policy; organisation of health services; public health; qualitative research; social medicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-09","",35766,""
"The Effect of a Plastic Barrier Drape on Resuscitation Performance and Provider Contamination: A Randomized Controlled Simulation-Based Pilot Trial","Patient barriers to protect health care workers from COVID-19 exposure have been studied for airway management. Few are tested for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). We sought to determine whether a plastic drape barrier affects resuscitation performance and contamination risks for a simulated cardiopulmonary arrest scenario. This pilot trial randomized in-hospital resuscitation teams of 4 to 6 participants to a plastic drape or without a drape in an in situ cardiopulmonary arrest simulation. The mannequin's airway emanated simulated virus particles (GloGerm, Moab, UT), detectable through UV light. Primary outcomes included airway management and CPR quality measures. Secondary outcomes included visible contamination on personal protective equipment (PPE). We used the Non-Technical Skills (NO-TECHS) instrument to measure perceived team performance and the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) to measure individual workload. Outcome variables were analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with participant number as a covariate. Seven teams were allocated to the intervention (plastic drape) group and 7 to the control. Intubation and ventilation performance (ÃŽÂ·2 = 0.09, P &gt; 0.3) and chest compression quality (ÃŽÂ·2 = 0.03-0.19, P &gt; 0.14) were not affected by the plastic drape. However, mean contaminated PPE per person decreased with the drape (2.8 Ã‚Â± 0.3 vs. 3.7 Ã‚Â± 0.3, partial ÃŽÂ·2 = 0.29, P = 0.05). No differences in perceived workload nor team performance were noted (P &gt; 0.09). In this pilot study, the use of a plastic drape barrier seems not to affect resuscitation performance on simulated cardiopulmonary arrest but decreases health care worker contamination risk. Further implementation trials could characterize the true risk reduction and any effect on resuscitation outcomes.","Young, Lau, Buan, Duty, Herrera, Luu, Rake, Chan, Bragg, Langga, Guerrero, Chang","https://doi.org/10.1097/SIH.0000000000000679","20220808","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-09","",35767,""

Participants totaled 1,768, and were originally included in a community cohort study who responded to three online surveys related to COVID-19 (March 2020-March 2021). The K-means method was used to cluster trust and intention toward the COVID-19 vaccine. Baseline (2013-2018) sociodemographic characteristics, physical health status, and depressive symptoms were analyzed as exposure variables, and current mental health status was included in the analyses. Most participants were classified into the moderate trust and high intention cluster (838, 47.4%); those with high trust and high intention accounted only for 16.86%. They tended to be older, had high-income level, and regular physical activity at baseline (p &lt; 0.05); their sleep quality and psychological resilience were relatively high, compared to other groups.

"Drug use trajectories among US adults during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic","This study characterized the prevalence, sociodemographic characteristics, and behavioral health of U.S. adult subpopulations with distinct drug use trajectories during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Adult respondents (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 8306) in a nationally-representative longitudinal study completed 13 monthly web surveys (March 2020-March 2021). Frequency of past-week drug use, cannabis use, and alcohol use (range:0-7), as well as anxiety and depressive symptoms, were assessed at each survey. Growth mixture models were used to parse out distinct subpopulations with homogenous drug use trajectories based on mean drug use days over time. Four drug use trajectories were identified: Stable Abstinence (85.7% [95%CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 85.0-86.5] of the sample) with &lt;1 mean past-week drug use days; Escalating Infrequent Use (7.1% [95%CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 6.6-7.7]) with 0.2 March mean past-week drug use days and increases from April to October; Use Cessation (4.3% [95%CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 3.8-4.7]) with 1.1 March mean past-week drug use days that initially increased, then sharply decreased to near zero; and Stable Frequent Use (2.9% [95%CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2.5-3.3]) with between 2.4 and 3.5 past-week drug use days across the study period. Compared to the stable abstinence group, the other subgroups were more likely to be Hispanic or Black, younger in age, unemployed, below the federal poverty line, and less likely to have a college degree or be married. They also reported higher levels of alcohol and cannabis use, as well as higher anxiety and depressive symptoms. These results provide opportunities to optimize the targeted delivery of preventive interventions for substance use during the COVID-19 pandemic and future public health emergencies.","Riehm, Cho, Smail, Pedersen, Lee, Davis, Leventhal","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2022.07.055","20220808","COVID-19 pandemic; Drug use; Epidemiology; Substance use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-09","",35769,""
"One-year follow-up of depression, anxiety, and quality of life of Peruvian patients who survived COVID-19","To assess health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and its associated factors in patients who survived COVID-19 and to assess a prospective evaluation of the prevalence and severity of their depression and anxiety symptoms. We followed up a sample of hospitalized patients who survived COVID-19 at 3 and 12Ã‚Â months after discharge. We assessed HRQoL (Euroqol-5D-5L) through telephone interviews. Any problem in any dimension of Euroqol-5D-5L was considered as low HRQoL. The depression and anxiety symptoms were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 tools, respectively. We estimated the adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) to low HRQoL using Poisson regression and the changes on their depression and anxiety symptoms during the follow-up. We included 119 patients with a mean follow-up time of 363.6Ã‚Â days. 74% of the participants had low HRQoL at one year after hospital discharge and were associated with beingÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°41Ã‚Â years old (aPR: 1.95), having a previous history of psychiatric diagnoses before COVID-19 infection (aPR: 1.47), having any COVID-19 symptom during the follow-up at one year (aPR: 1.84), and having a family member who had died from COVID-19 during the first wave (aPR: 1.24). In addition, the clinically relevant depression symptoms were frequent, and they increased from 3 (14.3%) to 12Ã‚Â months (18.5%). One year after COVID-19 hospitalization discharge, patients had low HRQoL, and their depression symptoms increased. These findings acknowledge the need to provide services that adequately address mental health sequels and HRQoL to reduce the burden of the COVID-19.","Huarcaya-Victoria, Alarcon-Ruiz, Barzola-FarfÃƒÂ¡n, Cruzalegui-BazÃƒÂ¡n, Cabrejos-Espinoza, Aspilcueta-Montoya, Cornero-Quispe, Salazar-Bellido, Villarreal","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11136-022-03208-w","20220808","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Peru; Quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-09","",35770,""
"The late onset of emotional distress in people with progressive multiple sclerosis during the Covid-19 pandemic: longitudinal findings from the CogEx study","An earlier follow-up study from the CogEx rehabilitation trial showed little change in symptoms of depression, anxiety and psychological distress during the first COVID-19 lockdown compared to pre-pandemic measurements. Here, we provide a second follow-up set of behavioral data on the CogEx sample. This was an ancillary, longitudinal follow-up study in CogEx, a randomized controlled trial of exercise and cognitive rehabilitation in people with progressive MS involving 11 centres in North America and Europe. Only individuals impaired on the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) were included. Participants repeated the COVID Impact survey administered approximately a year later and completed self-report measures of depression, anxiety and MS symptoms that had been obtained at the trial baseline and during the first COVID Impact survey. Participants who completed the second COVID Impact follow-up were included. To identify predictors of the participants' ratings of their mental and physical well-being, step-wise linear regression was conducted. Of the 131 participants who completed the first COVID impact survey, 74 participants completed the second follow-up survey (mean age 52 (SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°6.4) years, 62.2% female, mean disease duration 16.4 (SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°9.0) years, median EDSS 6.0). Pandemic restrictions prevented data collection from sites in Denmark and England (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°57). The average time between measurements was 11.4 (SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.56) months.

"The influence of emotional burnout and resilience on the psychological distress of nursing students during the COVID-19 pandemic","The aim of this study was to measure and analyse the association of emotional burnout and resilience with the psychological distress of students who finished their nursing studies after the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The mental health of nursing students was affected during the pandemic, and resilience seems to counteract the negative effects. This is a cross-sectional study. The data (quantitative) were gathered at the beginning of the second term of the academic year 2020/2021. The study was carried out in the Spanish university context. Self-reported measures were gathered using three one-dimensional, valid, and reliable scales: the Psychological Distress Scale (K-10), the Emotional Burnout Scale (EBS), and the short version of the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC10). A total of 393 students of different Spanish universities participated in this study. A valid linear regression model was obtained, which allowed verifying that psychological distress is explained, with 37% variance, by emotional burnout and resilience. The total score in emotional burnout has more relevance than the total score in resilience, and the latter has a negative tendency. Facing the factors that generate emotional burnout in students in the academic scope and promoting resilience in them are fundamental aspects that contribute to their psychological well-being. The reflection should be extended to clinical practices. Universities are urged to think about last-year students, their experiences, perceptions, and feelings, to determine how their susceptibility to emotional burnout and psychological distress can be minimized in their future clinical practices. Strategies to promote their resilience should also be studied.","Merino-Godoy, Yot-DomÃƒÂ­nguez, Conde-JimÃƒÂ©nez, RamÃƒÂ­rez MartÃƒÂ­n, Lunar-Valle","https://doi.org/10.1111/inm.13046","20220808","emotional burnout; higher education; nursing; psychological distress; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-09","",35772,""
"Risk perception research informing recommendations for COVID-19 preventative health measures and public messaging","To provide a commentary on evidence-based recommendations for COVID-19 pandemic risk communication for more effective public health measures. We apply the principles of risk communication to address key issues in the COVID-19 pandemic. Risk perception and communication research usefully informs preventative health education and public messaging during disease outbreaks such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, especially for those with severe mental illness. Key recommendations for pandemic public health risk communication are: clear, timely and balanced information from a reputable source; accurate and non-sensationalised depiction of infection, morbidity and mortality rates; awareness of fear as a powerful motivator for adoption of protective measures against the causative virus; promotion of self-efficacy and sense of control in terms of mitigating the health threats associated with a pandemic; correction of mis- and disinformation regarding the pandemic and associated protective measures; and messaging may need to be modified for people with a mental illness to avoid exacerbations of depressive and anxiety symptoms.","Maguire, Looi","https://doi.org/10.1177/10398562221117060","20220808","COVID-19; pandemic influenza; risk communication; risk perception","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-09","",35773,""

"Keys to well-being in older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic: personality, coping and meaning","During the COVID-19 pandemic, older adults were portrayed as an at-risk group. While this may have been true in some respects, empirical studies on mental health, including well-being were conflicting. Some studies found that older adults demonstrated a notable emotional resilience against the impacts of the pandemic. In this study, we qualitatively examine how older adults understand well-being and how they approached pandemic's potential influence on their well-being. 17 older adults participated in the study, out of which 14 were interviewed and three provided written responses to a set of questions. Through Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis, three themes emerged:adaptation, control, and a sense of community. We use them to discuss three central questions within well-being theory and research: How far does well-being depend on personal traits and how far does it depend on the environment? How far do people adapt to changed circumstances, and how far is such adaption conducive to maintaining genuine well-being and not just a lowering of standards of comparison? How far does subjective well-being depend on individual and momentary experiences and how far does it depend on the larger temporal and social context of an individual?","Mau, Fabricius, Klausen","https://doi.org/10.1080/17482631.2022.2110669","20220808","COVID-19; older adults; theoretical issues in well-being research; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-09","",35775,""
"Impact of COVID-19 in mental health trusts","To explore how mental health trusts in England adapted and responded to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, with the aim of identifying lessons that can be learned during and beyond the pandemic. Following a scoping study, we undertook 52 semi-structured interviews with senior managers, clinicians, patient representatives and commissioning staff across four case study sites. These sites varied in size, location and grading awarded by a national regulatory body. We explored how services have been repurposed and reorganized in response to the pandemic and the participants' perceptions of the impact of these changes on quality of care and the wellbeing of staff. Mental health trusts have shown great flexibility and resilience in rapidly implementing new models of care and developing creative digital solutions at speed. New collaborative arrangements have been stimulated by a shared sense of urgency and enabled by additional funding and a more permissive policy environment. But there has also been a significant negative impact on the wellbeing of staff, particularly those staff from a minority ethnic background. Also, there were concerns that digital technology could effectively disenfranchise some vulnerable groups and exacerbate existing health inequalities. Many of the service changes and digital innovations undertaken during the pandemic appear promising. Nevertheless, those changes need to be urgently and rigorously appraised to assure their effectiveness and to assess their impact on social exclusion and health inequalities.","Mannion, Konteh, Jacobs","https://doi.org/10.1177/13558196221116298","20220808","COVID-19; digital technology; mental health services","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-09","",35776,""
"Supporting children's nurses to deliver trauma-informed care","World events, such as the conflict in Ukraine, the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, have highlighted the effects of trauma and adverse childhood experiences on children and young people. Adverse childhood experiences can lead to suboptimal health and risk-taking behaviours during adolescence and adulthood, while multiple adverse childhood experiences can manifest as complex trauma, toxic stress, anxiety or depression across a person's lifespan. This article discusses adverse childhood experiences and the concept of trauma-informed care, which involves recognising and understanding the negative events that have affected a person and how these relate to suboptimal health. The author suggests that developing resilience and using self-care strategies can support nurses to adopt a trauma-informed approach to care. This can assist them to recognise, understand and reflect on the effects of adverse childhood experiences in themselves as well as in their patients. The author also outlines a hybrid approach to debrief that can support staff to manage stressful situations and challenging workplace experiences.","Davies","https://doi.org/10.7748/ncyp.2022.e1422","20220808","child and adolescent mental health; child development; nursesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ well-being; patient safety; patients; professional; professional issues","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-09","",35777,""
"Coping, Symptoms, and Insomnia among People with Heart Failure during the Covid-19 Pandemic","Increases in stress, symptoms of anxiety and depression and sleep problems have been reported during the Covid-19 pandemic, and people with chronic medical conditions such as heart failure (HF) are especially vulnerable. The purpose of this study was to examine the extent to which sleep characteristics, sleep-related cognitions, anxiety, depression, perceived stress, and changes in these phenomena over time predict ways of coping with pandemic-related stress among participants in the HeartSleep study, a randomized controlled trial of the effects of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) in people with HF. Participants completed questionnaires to elicit sleep characteristics, daytime symptoms, mood and stress at baseline, six-months after the intervention and during the Covid-19 pandemic. We added measures of coping during the pandemic (June-August 2020). The sample included 112 participants (M ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°63 Ã‚Â± 12.9 years; 47% women; 13% Black; 68% NY Heart Class II or III). Participants (43%) reported pandemic-related stressors and most often used secondary control coping. Insomnia severity, anxiety, depression, perceived stress, and sleep-related cognitions predicted secondary control coping (positive thinking, cognitive restructuring, acceptance, distraction), involuntary engagement (physiological arousal, rumination) and involuntary disengagement (emotional numbing). Insomnia and mood disturbance are important determinants of coping and responses to stress. Improving sleep and symptoms among people with HF may improve coping during stressful events, and CBT-I may have protective effects.","O'Connell, Jeon, Conley, Linsky, Redeker","https://doi.org/10.1093/eurjcn/zvac072","20220808","Covid-19; cognitive behavioral therapy; coping; heart failure; insomnia; sleep; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-09","",35778,""
"Psychological distress among healthcare workers post COVID-19 pandemic: from the resilience of individuals to healthcare systems","Since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been increased interest in identifying ways of protecting the mental well-being of healthcare workers (HCWs). Much of this has been directed towards promoting and enhancing the resilience of those deemed as frontline workers. Based on a review of the extant literature, this paper seeks to problematise aspects of how 'frontline work' and 'resilience' are currently conceptualised. Firstly, frontline work is arbitrarily defined and often narrowly focused on acute, hospital-based settings, leading to the needs of HCWs in other sectors of the healthcare system being overlooked. Secondly, dominant narratives are often underpinned by a reductionist understanding of the concept of resilience, whereby solutions are built around addressing the perceived deficiencies of (frontline) HCWs rather than the structural antecedents of distress. The paper concludes by considering what interventions are appropriate to minimise the risk of burnout across all sectors of the healthcare system in a post-pandemic environment.","O'Donnell, Quigley, Hayden, Adamis, Gavin, McNicholas","https://doi.org/10.1017/ipm.2022.35","20220808","COVID-19; healthcare workers; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-09","",35779,""
"From idioms of distress, concern, and care to moral distress leading to moral injury in the time of Covid","In this invited commentary on the thematic issue of <i>Transcultural Psychiatry</i> on idioms of distress, concern, and care, I provide a brief overview of how my research agenda evolved over the years while conducting community and clinic-based research in South and Southeast Asia as well as North America. I then suggest areas where future research on idioms of distress, concern, care, and resilience will be needed among different demographics given social change and shifts in how we communicate face to face and in virtual reality, the impact of medicalization, pharmaceuticalization and bracket creep, changes in indigenous healing systems, and hybridization. I further call attention to the importance of conducting idioms guided research in occupational settings. Toward this end I highlight the moral distress health care workers in the U.S. have experienced during the Covid-19 pandemic and point out the importance of differentiating individual burnout from moral injury related to structural distress. I conclude by discussing the general utility of an idioms of distress perspective in the practice of cultural psychiatry and suggest that this perspective needs to be included in the training of all practitioners regardless of the system of medicine they practice. Doing so may enable the formation of mental health communities of practice in contexts where there are pluralistic health care arenas.","Nichter","https://doi.org/10.1177/13634615221115540","20220808","concern and care; future research; idioms of distress; moral distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-09","",35780,""

"Prevalence and Determinants of COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy Among the Ethiopian Population: A Systematic Review","Although vaccination is the most effective way to end the COVID-19 pandemic, there are growing concerns that vaccine hesitancy may undermine its effectiveness. In Ethiopia, vaccine hesitancy forms a major challenge to the uptake of COVID-19 vaccines. This systematic review examined the prevalence and determinants of the COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among the Ethiopian population. A systematic search of articles was conducted in PubMed, EBSCO, Google Scholar, and Semantic Scholar. Studies that evaluated the prevalence and determinants of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in Ethiopia were included. The identified determinants of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy were analyzed based on the frequency of occurrence in the included studies. The overall COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy level in the Ethiopian population ranged from 14.1% to 68.7%. The high COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy rate observed in this study was due to contextual factors, individual factors, and vaccine-specific factors. Young age, female sex, living in rural areas, lack of adequate information, and lower education are the most common contextual determinants of the COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Lack of awareness about the COVID-19 vaccine, low risk of COVID-19, poor adherence to COVID-19 prevention strategies, and negative attitude towards the COVID-19 vaccine are the most frequently reported personal factors. Common vaccine-specific determinants of COVID-19 vaccine hesitation are the side effects of the vaccine and doubts about its effectiveness of the vaccine. Our review showed that COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy remains highly prevalent and varied across regions of Ethiopia, with a wide variety of factors associated with it. Potential interventions on the benefits of vaccination and the adverse effects of vaccine rejection are crucial to enhance COVID-19 vaccine uptake among the Ethiopian population.","Yehualashet, Seboka, Tesfa, Mamo, Yawo, Hailegebreal","https://doi.org/10.2147/RMHP.S368057","20220808","COVID-19; Ethiopia; acceptance; hesitancy; systematic review; vaccine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-09","",35782,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on Health Seeking Behavior of Patients with Chronic Disease at Public Hospitals in Jimma Zone, South West Ethiopia","COVID-19 is a global pandemic with unprecedented medical, economic and social consequences affecting nations across the world. This epidemic arises while chronic diseases are continued to be a public health concern. Though evidence is generated on its impact on the health care system, little is known about the Impact of COVID -19 on the care-seeking behavior of chronic patients. To assess the Impact of COVID-19 on healthcare-seeking behavior of patients with chronic diseases attending follow-up at public hospitals in Jimma zone, South West Ethiopia. Facility-based cross-sectional study design was employed. The sample was calculated using the single population proportion formula. Hospitals were selected by using simple random sampling. Then, the final calculated sample size for the study was proportionally allocated to each selected hospital. Data were collected from 400 participants through face-to-face interviews and card reviews. Data were entered into Epi-Data version 3.1 and then exported to SPSS version 23 for analysis. Binary and multivariable logistic regression analyses with 95% CI for odds ratio (OR) were used to identify significant factors. Of the total respondents 156 (39.0%) of them had poor health-seeking behavior. Contact history with COVID -19 patient (AOR = 2.8; 95% CI = 1.1-7.0), perceived moderate depression (AOR = 2.3; 95% CI = 1.2-4.2), perceived extreme depression (AOR = 4.3; 95% CI = 1.8-10.5), shortage of medication (AOR = 2.4; 95% CI = 1.0-6.2) increases the odds of poor health-seeking behavior. In addition, the odds of poor health-seeking in patients with no formal education were higher compared to patients with higher educational status (AOR = 2.7; 95% CI = 1.0-9.0). COVID -19 outbreaks affected the health-seeking behavior of patients with chronic diseases. The impact was found to be more significant among patients who had a contact history with COVID -19 patients. Moreover, perceived depression, shortage of medication, and low educational status were significant predictors of poor health-seeking behavior. Therefore, working on the barriers to the health-seeking behavior of chronic patients may reduce the effect of COVID-19.","Awel, Ahmed, Tilahun, Tegenu","https://doi.org/10.2147/RMHP.S367730","20220808","COVID-19; Ethiopia; chronic disease; health-seeking behavior","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-09","",35783,""
"Virtual social interaction and loneliness among emerging adults amid the COVID-19 pandemic","Many social activities moved online during the global COVID-19 pandemic, yet research investigating whether virtual social interactions facilitate social connectedness has been inconclusive. In this study, participants completed online questionnaires assessing objective social isolation, loneliness, mental health, and virtual social interactions. There was clear evidence for worsening mental health among emerging adults during the COVID-19 pandemic characterized by large increases in depressive symptoms (mean increaseÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 8.35, 95% CI [6.97, 9.73], <i>t</i>(118)Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 118, <i>p</i> &lt; .001), and large decrements in happiness (mean decreaseÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â -0.71, 95% CI [-0.84, -0.57], <i>t</i>(118)Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 10.09, <i>p</i> &lt; .001) and social satisfaction (mean decreaseÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â -0.81, 95% CI [-1.00,-0.62], <i>t</i>(115)Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 8.28, <i>p</i> &lt; .001) post-pandemic onset. In line with expectations, those living in larger households amid the pandemic reported lower levels of loneliness and higher levels of happiness. A negative association was found between household size (an index of objective social isolation) and loneliness, <i>b</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â -3.01, <i>t</i>(79)Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 2.60, <i>p</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â .011, 95% CI [-5.32, -0.71], and a positive association was found between household size and happiness, <i>b</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 22.86, <i>t</i>(75)Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 3.30, <i>p</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â .001, 95% CI [9.06, 36.65].

"Experiences and needs of front-line nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review and qualitative meta-synthesis","Front-line nurses have played a critical role during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A number of qualitative studies reported front-line nurses' experiences and needs in caring for patients with COVID-19. However, the application of evidence from a single qualitative study to guide clinical practice has limitations. This study aimed to explore front-line nurses' experiences and needs during the COVID-19 pandemic through a qualitative meta-synthesis. Seven databases were searched from 1 December 2019 to 20 January 2022, including PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane COVID-19 study register, CINAHL, PsycINFO, MedRxiv, and bioRxiv. The quality of included studies was appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) qualitative research appraisal tool. Meta-synthesis was used to synthesize the data from included studies. A total of 70 studies were included, and five synthesized findings were developed: (1) Although nurses actively devoted themselves to fighting against COVID-19, considering their professional responsibility and historical previous experience with mankind, they were not invulnerable; (2) There were various difficulties and challenges in caring for patients with COVID-19, including fear related to providing patients with care, shortage of protective equipment and manpower, and negative attitude of family members; (3) Facing difficulties and challenges, nurses could only partly cope by using mixed means to overcome those, including media, learning, gaining skills, responding together, and organizational assistance; (4) To better respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, nurses' needs should be paid attention to. Counseling, training, information, resources, and investment are pivotal; (5) Despite the hardships, nurses became stronger and gained gratitude, positivity, mental peace, and confidence. This study reveals that the psychological experiences of front-line nurses varied, and they faced a variety of challenges. Although nurses had some coping strategies, they still needed multifaceted support to meet the challenges. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/, PROSPERO: CRD42021255468.","Ding, Deng, Zhang, Wang, Liu, Huang, Yang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.805631","20220808","coronavirus disease 2019; experiences; needs; nurses; qualitative meta-synthesis; systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-09","",35785,""
"""It's my frenemy"": A qualitative exploration of knowledge and perceptions of fentanyl use during the COVID-19 pandemic in people who use drugs at a syringe services program in Philadelphia, PA","Exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the proliferation of fentanyl and fentanyl analogs, overdose deaths have surged in the United States, making it important to understand how individuals who use drugs experience and perceive the risks of fentanyl use and how it has changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Twenty clients from a Philadelphia syringe services program completed a questionnaire and in-depth interview about their fentanyl experiences from January to March 2021. These interviews were transcribed and analyzed using thematic analysis methods. Sixty percent of participants were female and racial/ethnic minority. Participants indicated they believed fentanyl use accounted for most Philadelphia opioid-related overdoses and understood that fentanyl was different from other opioids. Fentanyl use was characterized as ""all-consuming"" by taking over lives and inescapable. While most perceived their risk of fentanyl overdose as high, there was low interest in and reported use of harm reduction strategies such as fentanyl test strips. The COVID-19 pandemic was noted to have negative effects on fentanyl availability, use and overdose risk, as well as mental health effects that increase drug use. The divide between perceived risk and uptake of protective strategies could be driven by diminished self-efficacy as it relates to acting on and engaging with resources available at the syringe services program and represents a potential intervention target for harm reduction intervention uptake. But the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated risks due to fentanyl use, making an effective, accessible, and well-timed intervention important to address the disconnect between perceived overdose risk and use of preventive behaviors.","Bass, Kelly, Pandit-Kerr, Pilla, Morris, Larsen, Wisdom, Torralva","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.882421","20220808","COVID-19; fentanyl; harm reduction; overdose; qualitative in-depth interviews","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-09","",35786,""
"The impact of social support and stress on academic burnout among medical students in online learning: The mediating role of resilience","As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, online learning and long-term isolation from social and clinical settings has exacerbated mental health problems and symptoms of academic burnout among medical students. However, few studies have discussed symptoms of academic burnout as a result of reduced social support, and increased stress among medical students during the process of online learning. To fill this gap, this study investigated the influencing factors and mechanism of academic burnout in medical students' online learning process. Both the positive inhibition effect of positive factors such as social support, and the negative aggravation effect of negative factors such as stress were explored, while the mediating and protecting role of resilience is also discussed. We collected survey data from a total of 817 medical students from a medical school in China who participated in online learning during the fall 2021 semester. An online questionnaire was sent to the students in January, 2022. Items adapted from the DASS Scale developed by Lovibond and Lovibond were used to measure medical students' stress levels. The perceived social support of medical students was assessed by the Gregory MSPSS. Resilience was evaluated by the 10-Item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC). Items from the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Student Survey (MBI-SS) were used to calculate students' academic burnout. Descriptive analysis, correlation analysis, hierarchical linear regression analysis and structural equation modeling were used to analyze the collected data. The results identified that in the context of online learning there was a positive correlation between medical students' stress and academic burnout, and their resilience played a partial mediating role. However, social support did not directly affect academic burnout, but inhibited the prevalence of academic burnout through resilience. In addition, stress was negatively related to resilience, while social support was positively related to resilience. Resilience was found to be negatively related to medical students' academic burnout in online learning. The results of this study can provide a reference for the future development of appropriate educational strategies and coping measures to ameliorate the academic burnout of medical students.","Liu, Cao","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.938132","20220808","COVID-19; academic burnout; medical students; online learning; resilience; social support; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-09","",35787,""
"Urban greenspace helps ameliorate people's negative sentiments during the COVID-19 pandemic: The case of Beijing","The COVID-19 pandemic has had negative effects on people's mental health worldwide, especially for those who live in large cities. Studies have reported that urban greenspace may help lessen these adverse effects, but more research that explicitly considers urban landscape pattern is needed to understand the underlying processes. Thus, this study was designed to examine whether the resident sentiments in Beijing, China changed before and during the pandemic, and to investigate what urban landscape attributes - particularly greenspace - might contribute to the sentiment changes. We conducted sentiment analysis based on 25,357 geo-tagged microblogs posted by residents in 51 neighborhoods. We then compared the resident sentiments in 2019 (before the COVID-19) with those in 2020 (during the COVID-19) using independent sample t-tests, and examined the relationship between resident sentiments and urban greenspace during the COVID-19 pandemic phases using stepwise regression. We found that residents' sentiments deteriorated significantly from 2019 to 2020 in general, and that urban sentiments during the pandemic peak times showed an urban-suburban trend that was determined either by building density or available greenspace. Although our analysis included several other environmental and socioeconomic factors, none of them showed up as a significant factor. Our study suggests the effects of urban greenspace and building density on residents' sentiments increased during the COVID-19 pandemic and that not all green spaces are equal. Increasing greenspace, especially within and near neighborhoods, seems critically important to helping urban residents to cope with public health emergencies such as global pandemics.","Guo, Tu, Huang, Fang, Kong, Wu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2022.109449","20220808","COVID-19; Phased impact; Residents' sentiments; Social media data; Urban greenspace","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-09","",35788,""

Unlike prior research, which has typically focused on a single aspect of psychosocial well-being, we conceptualized international students' well-being as a multidimensional construct including internalizing symptoms (i.e., depression, anxiety, loneliness) as well as markers of intercultural difficulties. We then investigated social media use as a function of international students' idiosyncratic well-being vulnerabilities. A latent profile analysis revealed four groups with distinctive psychosocial profiles: well-adjusted students, interculturally adjusted students with internalizing symptoms, students with low internalizing symptoms but high intercultural difficulties, and maladjusted students with high internalizing symptoms and high intercultural difficulties. Supporting the social compensation perspective, maladjusted international students reported the highest engagement with social media compared to the other groups. These findings shed light on the unique and heterogenous experiences of international students at the onset of the pandemic. They also add nuance to the social compensation hypothesis by delineating person-specific associations between psychosocial well-being and social media use.","Chen, Fan, Toma, Scherr","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2022.107409","20220808","COVID-19 pandemic; Intercultural difficulties; Internalizing symptoms; International students; Latent profile analysis; Psychosocial well-being; Social compensation; Social media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-09","",35791,""
"[Neuropsychological rehabilitation for post-COVID-19 syndrome: Results of a clinical program and six-month follow up]","Patients with post-COVID-19 syndrome may present cognitive and emotional symptomatology. This study aims to analyse the results of an outpatient neuropsychological intervention program for post-COVID-19 syndrome. In June 2020 Institut Guttmann started an outpatient post-COVID-19 neurorehabilitation program, including respiratory therapy, physiotherapy, and neuropsychological rehabilitation. Before and after the program, the cognitive-emotional state of all participants is assessed. Six months after treatment, a follow-up assessment is administered (which includes a collection of information on various aspects of daily life). The sample analysed consisted of 123 patients (mean age: 51 years, SD: 12.41). Seventy-four per cent (n=91) had cognitive impairment and underwent cognitive treatment (experimental group); the remaining 26% (n=32) constituted the control group. After the intervention, the experimental group improved in working memory, verbal memory (learning, recall and recognition), verbal fluency and anxious-depressive symptomatology. The control group showed changes in immediate memory, verbal memory (learning and recognition) and depressive symptomatology, although the effect size in the latter two was smaller than in the experimental group. Six months after treatment, 44.9% of the patients were unable to perform their pre-COVID-19 work activity, and 81.2% reported difficulties in their activities of daily living. Neuropsychological rehabilitation is an effective tool to treat the cognitive-emotional deficits present in post-COVID-19 syndrome. However, months after the end of treatment, not all patients recover their pre-COVID-19 functional level.","GarcÃƒÂ­a-Molina, GarcÃƒÂ­a-Carmona, EspiÃƒÂ±a-Bou, RodrÃƒÂ­guez-Rajo, SÃƒÂ¡nchez-CarriÃƒÂ³n, EnseÃƒÂ±at-Cantallops","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nrl.2022.06.008","20220808","Neuropsychological rehabilitation; cognition; emotion; longitudinal study; post-COVID-19 syndrome","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-09","",35792,""
"Psychopathological states among Congolese health workers during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic: links with emotion regulation and social support","<b>Background:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented stressor for frontline healthcare workers, notably increasing acute stress disorder and depression rates. Emotion regulation and social support could be major protective factors against such psychopathological states, but their role has not been explored outside Western contexts. <b>Objective:</b> To assess the association between emotion regulation, social support, acute stress disorder, and depression among healthcare workers directly confronted with the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. <b>Method:</b> A cross-sectional study assessed acute stress disorder, depression, adaptive (i.e. acceptance, positive refocusing,Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬Â¦) and maladaptive (i.e. self-blame, rumination, catastrophizing,Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬Â¦) emotion regulation strategies, social support (instrumental, emotional, and informational levels), as well as self-reported situations and feelings related to COVID-19, in a population of 252 frontline healthcare workers (121 women; 131 men; mean age: 39Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°11 years old) at the Referral General Hospital of Bukavu. We also explored the relations between these variables through bivariate and multivariate logistic regression. <b>Results:</b> Forty percent of participants presented symptoms of depression, and 16% presented acute stress disorder. In bivariate logistic regression, these psychiatric outcomes were associated with the availability of a COVID-19 protection kit [ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.24 (0.12-0.98)], hostility toward health workers [ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.21 (1.23-4.21)], putting into perspective [ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.91 (0.43-0.98)], self-blame [ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.44 (1.11-2.39)], catastrophizing [ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.85 (1.01-4.28)], blaming others [ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.77 (1.04-3.32)], emotional support [ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.83 (0.49-0.98)], instrumental support [ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.74 (0.28-0.94)], and informational support [ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.73 (0.43-0.98)]. In multivariate logistic regression, hostility [ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.21 (1.54-3.78)], self-blame [ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.57 (1.02-2.11)], rumination [ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.49 (1.11-3.13)] and emotional support [ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.94 (0.65-0.98)] remained significantly associated with psychiatric outcomes. <b>Conclusion:</b> Depression and acute stress disorder were highly prevalent among Congolese healthcare workers during the first wave of the COVID-19 health pandemic. Hostility, self-blame, rumination, and social support were associated with depression and/or acute stress disorder and should be targeted by interventions aiming to support health workers' wellbeing. Frontline health workers presented high prevalence of acute stress disorder (16%) and depression (40%) during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in the Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, as they were working in hostile environment without enough protection kits.Acute stress disorder and depression were negatively associated with adaptive emotion regulation and social support; and positively with maladaptive emotion regulation.Intervention aiming to support health workers in pandemics should target emotion regulation and social support. <b>Antecedentes:</b> La pandemia de COVID-19 es un factor estresante sin precedentes para los trabajadores de atenciÃƒÂ³n mÃƒÂ©dica de primera lÃƒÂ­nea, que aumenta notablemente las tasas de trastorno por estrÃƒÂ©s agudo y depresiÃƒÂ³n. La regulaciÃƒÂ³n de las emociones y el apoyo social podrÃƒÂ­an ser factores protectores importantes contra tales estados psicopatolÃƒÂ³gicos, pero su papel no ha sido explorado fuera de los contextos occidentales.<b>Objetivo:</b> Evaluar la asociaciÃƒÂ³n entre la regulaciÃƒÂ³n de las emociones, el apoyo social, el trastorno de estrÃƒÂ©s agudo y la depresiÃƒÂ³n entre los trabajadores de la salud que confrontaron directamente la primera ola de la pandemia de COVID-19 en el este de la RepÃƒÂºblica DemocrÃƒÂ¡tica del Congo.<b>MÃƒÂ©todo:</b> Un estudio transversal evaluÃƒÂ³ el trastorno de estrÃƒÂ©s agudo, la depresiÃƒÂ³n, estrategias de regulaciÃƒÂ³n emocional adaptativas (es decir, aceptaciÃƒÂ³n, refocalizaciÃƒÂ³n positiva,Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬Â¦) y desadaptativas (es decir, autoculpabilizaciÃƒÂ³n, rumiaciÃƒÂ³n, catastrofizaciÃƒÂ³n,Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬Â¦), apoyo social (niveles instrumental, emocional, e informacional), asÃƒÂ­ como situaciones y sentimientos autoinformados relacionados con el COVID-19, en una poblaciÃƒÂ³n de 252 trabajadores de salud de primera lÃƒÂ­nea (121 mujeres; 131 hombres; edad media: 39Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°11 aÃƒÂ±os) en el Hospital General de Referencia de Bukavu.

"Examining the association between social characteristics of urban green space visitors and the early outbreak of COVID-19","Even though exposure to urban green spaces (UGS) has physical and mental health benefits during COVID-19, whether visiting UGS will exacerbate viral transmission and what types of counties would be more impacted remain to be answered. In this research, we adopted mobile phone data to measure the county-level UGS visitation across the United States. We developed a Bayesian model to estimate the effective production number of the pandemic. To consider the spatial dependency, we applied the geographically weighted panel regression to estimate the association between UGS visitation and viral transmission. We found that visitations to UGS may be positively correlated with the viral spread in Florida, Idaho, New Mexico, Texas, New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.

Further, we found that when people visit UGS, there may be a positive association between median age and viral transmission in New Mexico, Colorado, and Missouri; a positive association between concentration of blacks and viral transmission in North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Florida; and a positive association between poverty rate and viral transmission in Iowa, Missouri, Colorado, New Mexico, and the Northeast United States.","Zhai, Yue, Deng","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2022.102768","20220808","COVID-19; Social characteristics; Urban green space; Viral transmission","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-09","",35794,""
"Sleep Disorders in Patients with Parkinson's Disease during COVID-19 Pandemic: A Case-Control Study","To assess the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on sleep disorders among Parkinson's disease (PD) patients using validated questionnaires. This prospective study involved 50 PD patients and 50 age, gender, and body mass index-matched controls. All participants underwent assessment of cognition using Montreal Cognitive Assessment scale, sleep quality using Parkinson's disease sleep scale-2 (PDSS-2; for PD patients) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI; for PD patients and healthy controls), excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) using Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS), insomnia symptoms and severity using insomnia severity index (ISI), restless legs syndrome (RLS) using International RLS Study Group criteria, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) using RBD Single-Question Screen (RBD1Q), and depression using Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scale. Eighty-eight percent of PD patients reported one or more sleep disorders, compared to 28% controls. While 72% of PD patients reported poor sleep quality (PDSS-2 Ã¢â€°Â¥15, PSQI &gt;5), 60% had insomnia, 58% reported RBD, 50% had EDS, and 36% reported RLS. Depressive symptoms were reported by 70% patients. PD patients with and without poor sleep quality were comparable with regards to demographic and clinical variables, except for depressive symptoms (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). Depressive symptoms showed a significant association with EDS (<i>P</i> = 0.008), RBD (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), and insomnia (<i>P</i> = 0.001). Prevalence of sleep disorders increased in PD patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Prevalence of EDS, RBD, and RLS in PD patients was higher compared to that reported in studies during the pre-COVID-19 times. Presence of depressive symptoms was a significant correlate of presence of sleep disorders in PD patients.","Desai, Gupta, Kumar, Tiwari, Kumar","https://doi.org/10.4103/aian.aian_255_22","20220808","Excessive Daytime Somnolence; Parkinson's disease; rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder; restless legs syndrome; sleep quality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-09","",35795,""
"Predicting Parental Mental Health During COVID-19: Economic Pressure, COVID-19 Stress, and Coping Strategies","As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, understanding connections between economic pressures and mental health experiences is critical in comprehending how stressful global events can affect families. Although economic pressures and stress can negatively impact mental health, approach coping strategies may provide reductions in negative mental health experiences for parents compared to avoidant coping strategies. Despite recent work showing that stress resulting from the pandemic can have negative implications for the mental health of parents with young children, there is little known about the mental health of parents with adolescents. This study utilized a longitudinal sample of 198 parents (194 biological parents; 103 Fathers, and 91 Mothers) of adolescents and examined the mediating impact of COVID-19 stress on the relationship between economic pressure and subsequent depressive and anxious symptoms. Additionally, approach and avoidant coping strategies were examined as potential moderators between COVID-19 stress and later mental health. Results indicated that parents who experienced economic pressure reported worsening mental health across the school semester, with COVID-19 stress mediating this pathway. Further, approach coping strategies moderated the association between COVID-19 stress and later anxiety symptoms such that higher levels of coping associated with greater rates of later anxiety symptoms, while lower levels of coping associated with less anxiety symptoms later. Avoidant coping strategies also moderated these associations, such that greater use associated with greater depressive and anxious symptomology later. These findings emphasize that parents are experiencing worsening mental health following the onset of the pandemic and that there is an urgent need for increased mental health services to assist families during this time.","Morgan, Higgins, Ingram, Rogers","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.909978","20220808","COVID-19; anxiety; coping; depression; parents","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-09","",35796,""
"Changes in non-motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease following COVID-19 pandemic restrictions: A systematic review","This review discussed the effects of the impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the psychological wellbeing of people with Parkinson's disease (PD) focusing specifically on depressive symptoms, anxiety levels, sleep, and quality of life (QoL). Together with motor symptoms, psychological symptoms are common and disabling conditions in the clinical course of PD becoming a relevant topic as a result of the lockdown measure due to alter their everyday life. We searched on PubMed online electronic databases for English articles published between January 2020 and 31 December 2021. Twenty-eight relevant studies were found and included in the review. Heterogeneous data emerged from the topics analyzed. Overall, data from depression studies showed significant depressive symptoms if the patient was analyzed longitudinally or vs. a control group consisting in healthy subjects, while these differences become minimal when the control group is a family member. Differently, in most of the studies reviewed there is no evidence of a statistically significant impact on anxiety disorders, nor on the quality of sleep. Conversely, PD patients showed a statistically significant negative impact of QoL compared with control groups or other neurological conditions. Although these findings must be interpreted carefully in the light of the studies' limitations, both in methodology and design, collectively our review showed that COVID-19 pandemic has had negative effects on the mental health of people with PD, due to disruption of healthcare services, loss of usual activities and supports and reduction in physical activity.","Mameli, Zirone, Capetti, Mellace, Ferrucci, Franco, Di Fonzo, Barbieri, Ruggiero","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.939520","20220808","COVID-19; Parkinson's disease; anxiety; depression; non-motor symptoms; pandemic restrictions; quality of life; sleep disturbances","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-09","",35797,""
"Time Outdoors in Nature to Improve Staff Well-Being: Examining Changes in Behaviors and Motivations Among University Staff in the Use of Natural Outdoor Environments Since the Emergence of the COVID-19 Pandemic","Work-related stress is of growing concern to employers because of its significant implications for employee dissatisfaction, reduced productivity, and lowered emotional and physical health. Job-related stress is particularly acute among staff members in higher education, negatively impacting the professional work and personal welfare of staff. During the COVID-19 pandemic, stress levels increased, due to work- and non-work-related factors. Work expectations and environments shifted, as did new non-work responsibilities, such as care of dependents. As a result, many people were forced to spend much more time at home. Given the anticipated levels of stress (higher) and the change in time spent at home (increased), we sought to explore if adults were spending more time outdoors, as compared to pre-pandemic times, and if so, for what purposes. We hypothesized that people would be spending more time outdoors in nature during the pandemic, and that they would be doing so to achieve some of the well-documented benefits including managing stress, and bolstering mental health and wellbeing. We further hypothesized that some staff would experience barriers to spending time outdoors in natural outdoor environments (NOEs), potentially limiting their ability to experience these beneficial effects. This study surveyed 507 staff from a large United States university to examine the degree to which staff were spending time in natural outdoor environments (NOEs) during the pandemic (two time-points, compared to pre-pandemic), and whether and how nature-based routines changed as a result of its emergence. The study also examined whether staff were motivated to spend time in nature to improve their mental health and/or wellbeing. The majority of respondents reported spending more time in NOEs since COVID-19 emerged, particularly early in the pandemic. Respondents reported doing so for restorative purposes, including stress relief, improved mental health, and improved physical health. Relative accessibility of NOEs, both in terms of proximity and number of barriers to access, significantly impacted both time outdoors and the number of NOEs used. Access to safe, high-quality NOEs was not experienced equally across staff respondents; barriers to access tended to be higher among staff living with dependents or others in their household, and for staff who identify as non-White. Spending time outdoors may have served as a protective factor for many university staff against some of the potentially detrimental effects of the pandemic, particularly reduced mental health and well-being. Universities can contribute to the ongoing well-being of their staff by supporting access to safe, high-quality NOEs on or adjacent to campus. This may also serve to reduce disparities in access to nature and experience of its benefits. Universities may also consider alternative work arrangements for staff to allow for more time for health and wellness self-care during the work day, including spending time outdoors in nature.","Loebach, Rakow, Meredith, Shepley","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.869122","20220808","COVID-19; natural outdoor environments; nature; restoration; stress; time outdoors; university staff; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-09","",35798,""
"<i>Ad</i> <i>hoc</i> Setup of an Online Mental Health Self-Help Program During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Description of the Development and Implementation Processes and Analysis of Its Users' and Usage Profiles","The COVID-19 pandemic hit Austria in March 2020. This led to a considerable reduction in outpatient psychiatric therapies. People with mental disorders as well as with newly emerging mental health issues found themselves with very limited treatment options. Within only a few days our hospital set up an online mental health self-help program which went online in its first version on the first day of the lockdown in Austria. The process of this development and implementation process alongside with the user's and usage data for the program are presented here. A small core team initiated the development of the program on a low-budget basis and using mostly freely available digital resources. The program had to be free of costs for its users and easy to navigate. Each self-help module contains a text description of the topic, a self-rating questionnaire and several psychoeducational 2-5Ã¢â‚¬â€°min videos. These videos explain, e.g., interactions of mental stress and the immune system or the vicious circle of anxiety. Additional videos provide easy to learn techniques like breathing and relaxation exercises. We illustrate the implementation of this program following the replicating effective program (REP) model. We provide a detailed description of the implementation process starting from a simple website to a smartphone-based application with registered user area and instantaneous reporting of self-rating questionnaire results to users. The described process could be used as a model for the setup of similar programs in a very short time. As an indicator of acceptance, we report 46,100 unique video views and 3,937 completed questionnaires in the first year of use. The most accessed videos were those on anxiety, relaxation and resilience. Analysis of the sociodemographic user data indicate that they were mostly young (&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°45Ã¢â‚¬â€°years; 59.7%), females (77.5%) and previously mentally healthy individuals (74.5%). An example of the collected psychometric questionnaire data over time is given. We show that it is possible to set up an online mental health self-help program <i>ad hoc</i> and without extensive prior planning, which enabled us to dynamically respond to a new situation. We are now planning on keeping the program active for a longer period of time to supplement and expand traditional treatment settings also outside the COVID-19 pandemic.","Galffy, Bichler, Mohr, Egeter, Neu, Oberhammer, HÃƒÂ¶gl, Deisenhammer, Sperner-Unterweger, HÃƒÂ¼fner","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.853371","20220808","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; e-health; resilience; self-help","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-09","",35799,""

"Prevalence of parents' non-intention to vaccinate their children and adolescents against COVID-19: A comparative analysis in Colombia and Peru","We aimed to estimate the prevalence and factors associated with parents' non-intention to vaccinate their children and adolescents against COVID-19 in Colombia and Peru. We performed a secondary analysis using a database generated by the University of Maryland and Facebook (Facebook, Inc). We Included adult (18 and over) Facebook users residing in LAC who responded to the survey between May 20, and November 5, 2021. We Included sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidities, mental health, economic and food insecurity, compliance with mitigation strategies against COVID-19, and practices related to vaccination against this disease. We estimated crude (cPR) and adjusted (aPR) prevalence ratios with their respective 95Ã‚Â %CI. We analyzed a sample of 44,678 adults from Colombia and 24,302 from Peru. The prevalence of parents' non-intention to vaccinate their children and adolescents against COVID-19 was 7.41Ã‚Â % (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 3,274) for Colombia and 6.64Ã‚Â % (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1,464) for Peru. In Colombia, age above 35Ã‚Â years old, compliance with physical distancing, use of masks, having economic insecurity, anxiety symptoms, having a chronic condition or more comorbidities, and being vaccinated were associated with a higher probability of vaccinating children and adolescents against COVID-19. In Peru, female gender, compliance with physical distancing, use of masks, having economic insecurity, anxiety symptoms, having a chronic condition or more comorbidities, having had COVID-19, and being vaccinated were associated with a higher probability of vaccinating children against COVID-19. Living in a town, a village, or a rural area was associated with a higher prevalence of non-intention to vaccinate children and adolescents against COVID-19. About 9 out of 10 parents in Colombia and Peru intend to vaccinate their children and adolescents against COVID-19.

"The influences on happiness and life satisfaction of young people during COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence for positive youth development","COVID-19 pandemic has brought about many uncertainties and adversities for young people, negatively influencing their mental health. The present study investigated the mediation role of intolerance to uncertainty (IU) in the relationship between social emotional learning (SEL) skills and happiness, and between SEL skills and life satisfaction (LS) of young people, within the framework of Positive Youth Development (PYD). The study included 589 university students (51% women) aged 18-24, and the participants completed a Demographic form, Social Emotional Learning Scale-Young Adult Form, Intolerance to Uncertainty Scale, Satisfaction with Life Scale, and Oxford Happiness Questionnaire. In the study, the mediating role of IU on the relationship between SEL skills and happiness (Model 1) and between SEL skills and LS (Model 2) were tested. The analysis first indicated positive direct relations of SEL skills with happiness and LS, as well as negative direct relations with IU. In addition, there were negative associations between IU and happiness, and between IU and LS. The results also demonstrated the mediation role of IU on the relationships between SEL skills and both happiness and LS. These findings confirmed the pivotal role that SEL skills play in happiness and LS by reducing the impact of IU, thus promoting PYD during the pandemic.","BÃƒÂ¼yÃƒÂ¼kÃƒÂ§olpan, Ozdemir","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-022-03548-3","20220808","COVID-19; Happiness; Intolerance to uncertainty; Positive youth development; Satisfaction with life; Social emotional learning skills","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-09","",35802,""
"A Longitudinal Process Model Evaluating the Effects of Cooperative Learning on Victimization, Stress, Mental Health, and Academic Engagement in Middle School","Mental health is a significant concern among young people, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Notably, mental health problems can significantly reduce student performance in school, including both engagement and achievement. Both mental health problems and reduced student performance often arise due to <i>peer victimization</i>, which can include teasing, racial- or gender-based discrimination, and/or physical assault. Stress has been proposed as one mechanism through which victimization influences mental health, and stress can also interfere with academic performance at school, including engagement and achievement. To date, however, no research has evaluated longitudinal associations between victimization and stress, and how these longitudinal patterns may impact adolescent behavior and mental health. In this study, we used data from a 2-year cluster randomized trial of cooperative learning to evaluate an etiological process model that includes (1) longitudinal reciprocal effects between victimization and stress, and (2) the effects of both victimization and stress on student mental health and academic engagement. We hypothesized that victimization and stress would have significant reciprocal effects, and that both would predict greater mental health problems and lower academic engagement. We further hypothesized that cooperative learning would have significant effects on all constructs. We found partial support for this model, whereby stress predicted greater victimization, but victimization did not predict increased stress. While both factors were linked to student outcomes, stress was a more powerful predictor. We also found significant salutary effects of cooperative learning on all constructs. The implications of these results for student behavioral and mental health are discussed.","Van Ryzin, Low, Roseth, Espelage","https://doi.org/10.1007/s42380-022-00140-y","20220808","Cooperative learning; Engagement; Mental health; Middle school; Stress; Victimization","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-09","",35803,""

This study explored some of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the educational, socialization, and mental and emotional health and wellbeing of Rohingya refugee youth from Myanmar resettled in the United States. Through in-depth qualitative interviews with 15 Rohingya refugees ages 12-17, we found that Rohingya youth's experiences with COVID-19 pandemic presented both challenges and opportunities. The challenges included unavailability of personal space to conduct school work, difficulties adjusting to online school due to computer literacy levels, and familial responsibilities that often conflicted with their schooling, as well as feelings of boredom and sadness that consequently impacted their emotional and mental health state. Youth also noted opportunities such as spending more time with their parents who were unable to work due to the pandemic as well as feeling helpful in acting as caregivers to their siblings and in working alongside their parents. Implications for policymakers and educators are also discussed.","Mahamud Magan, Patankar, Ahmed","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2022.106619","20220808","COVID-19 pandemic; Education; Mental Health; Refugee youth; Rohingya; Role of family","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-09","",35804,""

"Virtual Behavioral Health Treatment Satisfaction and Outcomes Across Time","The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have major and long-lasting impacts on health care delivery and mental health. As health care shifted to telehealth, legislation was adjusted to expand telehealth allowances, creating a unique opportunity to elucidate outcomes. The aim of this study was to assess long-term patient and clinician satisfaction and outcomes with virtual behavioral health. Data were obtained over 16 months from surveys to patients and clinicians receiving/providing virtual treatment. Outcomes data also were collected from medical records of adults receiving in-person and virtual behavioral health treatment. Data were summarized using descriptive statistics. Groups were compared using various chi-squared tests for categorical variables, Likert response trends over time, and conditional independence, with Wilcoxon rank-sum or Jonckheere trend test used to assess continuous variables. P-values of Ã¢â€°Â¤0.05 were considered statistically significant. Patients gave high ratings to virtual treatment and indicated a preference for virtual formats. Both patient and clinician preference for virtual visits increased significantly with time, and many clinicians perceived virtual services to be equally effective to in-person. Virtual programs had higher completion rates, attendance rates, and number of treatment visits, suggesting that virtual behavioral health had equivalent or better outcomes to in-person treatment and that attitudes toward telehealth changed over time. If trends found in this study continue, telehealth may emerge as a preferred option long term This is important considering the increase in mental health needs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the eventuality that in-person restrictions ease as the pandemic subsides.","Waite, Diab, Adefisoye","https://doi.org/10.17294/2330-0698.1918","20220808","COVID-19; behavioral health; hybrid virtual; no-shows; patient and clinician satisfaction; telehealth; telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-09","",35806,""

The cross-sectional survey sought to examine and comprehend the influence of COVID-19 on Indian dentistry practitioners. A 38-item questionnaire-based survey was communicated to Indian dental practitioners through a web-based form (Google form). The questionnaire was categorized into four sections: (i) Personal protective equipment (PPE), (ii) dental treatments, (iii) auxiliary management, and (iv) personal impact. The findings were examined and studied in order to comprehend the repercussions of COVID-19. The questionnaire was completed by 513 of the 1129 dentists to whom it was delivered. For the current questionnaire, a response rate that we received was 45.44%. When compared to the pre-pandemic era, the use of PPE has increased dramatically (95.7%). The use of PPE alleviated dental practitioners' and patients' doubts about viral transmission. The epidemic prompted the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) to issue specific recommendations for dental treatments, which were followed by 92.5% of dentists. The majority of dentists reported a considerable impact on both financial and mental health concerns. Teleconsulting and distant learning gained greater prominence. The COVID-19 epidemic affected the lives of dental professionals both within and outside of the dental setting, as well as the auxiliary. COVID-19 has left a trail of devastation in its aftermath.

An anonymous, online survey was conducted among working frontline nursing professionals between April 7 and 18, 2022. We collected information about the participants' age, sex, years of employment, shift work, and marital status. In addition, the participants were asked whether they had dealt with infected patients recently, and whether they had been quarantined, infected, or vaccinated. SAVE-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) were used to evaluate symptoms. We used the Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) to determine the validity of the two-factor model of the SAVE-9 scale. We also tested reliability and convergent validity using the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scales. A total of 136 responses was analyzed, and CFA for two-factors model of the SAVE-9 scale showed a good model fit among frontline nursing professionals (CFI = 1.000, TLI = 1.040, RMSEA = 0.000, RSMR = 0.060). Multi-group CFAs revealed that the SAVE-9 scale can measure work-related stress and viral anxiety in the same way across sex, having depression, or having generalized anxiety. The internal consistency was shown to be good, and the SAVE-9 scale was significantly correlated with the GAD-7 (r = 0.328, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and PHQ-9 score (r = 0.361, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).

An umbrella questionnaire comprised of demographics, COVID-19-related factors, Yale-Brown Obsessive and Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index-Revised (PSQI-R), Mobile Phone Addiction Index (MPAI), and Ottawa Self-injury Inventory (OSI) was extended to each subject <i>via</i> shared QR code. Of 349 patients with MDs included, 151 (43.27%) reported NSSI in the recent 1 month, among whom hand, lower arm/wrist, and scalp were the most hurt body parts, and cutting, hitting, and headbanging were the most adopted methods. ""Own idea"" was the most common origin of NSSI. In the logistic regression model, age bracket, family monthly income, occupation, level of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms, sleep duration, withdrawal reaction to the mobile phone, and habits of using a mobile phone were independently associated with NSSI. It was revealed by our study that NSSI was quite prevalent among patients with MDs, especially among those students, adolescents, comorbid with OCD symptoms, inadequate sleeping hours, and suffering from withdrawal reaction to mobile phones. Further research on NSSI in various psychiatric disorders and even in non-clinical settings such as the community population was in urgent need since NSSI in China was not rare.","Zheng, Xiao, Wang, Chen, Wang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.895892","20220808","characteristics; correlation factors; detective rate; non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI); retrospective research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-09","",35809,""

"Suicide numbers during the first 9-15 months of the COVID-19 pandemic compared with pre-existing trends: An interrupted time series analysis in 33 countries","Predicted increases in suicide were not generally observed in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the picture may be changing and patterns might vary across demographic groups. We aimed to provide a timely, granular picture of the pandemic's impact on suicides globally. We identified suicide data from official public-sector sources for countries/areas-within-countries, searching websites and academic literature and contacting data custodians and authors as necessary. We sent our first data request on 22nd June 2021 and stopped collecting data on 31st October 2021. We used interrupted time series (ITS) analyses to model the association between the pandemic's emergence and total suicides and suicides by sex-, age- and sex-by-age in each country/area-within-country. We compared the observed and expected numbers of suicides in the pandemic's first nine and first 10-15 months and used meta-regression to explore sources of variation. We sourced data from 33 countries (24 high-income, six upper-middle-income, three lower-middle-income; 25 with whole-country data, 12 with data for area(s)-within-the-country, four with both). There was no evidence of greater-than-expected numbers of suicides in the majority of countries/areas-within-countries in any analysis; more commonly, there was evidence of lower-than-expected numbers. Certain sex, age and sex-by-age groups stood out as potentially concerning, but these were not consistent across countries/areas-within-countries. In the meta-regression, different patterns were not explained by countries' COVID-19 mortality rate, stringency of public health response, economic support level, or presence of a national suicide prevention strategy. Nor were they explained by countries' income level, although the meta-regression only included data from high-income and upper-middle-income countries, and there were suggestions from the ITS analyses that lower-middle-income countries fared less well. Although there are some countries/areas-within-countries where overall suicide numbers and numbers for certain sex- and age-based groups are greater-than-expected, these countries/areas-within-countries are in the minority. Any upward movement in suicide numbers in any place or group is concerning, and we need to remain alert to and respond to changes as the pandemic and its mental health and economic consequences continue.

"Correlation Analysis of Positive Therapy Based on High Content Image Analysis Technology on Posttraumatic Nerve Growth in Patients with COVID-19 in the Context of Intelligent Medical Treatment","To investigate the correlation between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and the incidence of anxiety, depression, and mental disorders in patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia. Novel coronavirus pneumonia patients in Wuhan from 2020 to April were selected for treatment from hospitals and isolation wards from 1 to April. 70 rehabilitated patients were randomly divided into the control group (35 patients) and the observation group (35 patients) who were treated with conventional therapy. Positive therapy and full perfusion therapy were introduced on the basis of conventional therapy, and the related performances of different patients were observed and evaluated. The anxiety, depression, and incidence rate of related psychotic patients in the observation group after treatment were significantly reduced. Patients could maintain a good mood, increase their confidence in conquering diseases, and promote their early recovery. Active treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia has positive effects on posttraumatic growth of new crown pneumonia patients, relieving anxiety and negative emotions, improving emotional control, eliminating bad emotions, actively guiding patients, and promoting psychological rehabilitation of patients.","Zheng, Lin, Tu, Hu, Wei","https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/9165764","20220808","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-09","",35812,""
"Trends in mental health indicators among nurses participating in healthy nurse, healthy nation from 2017 to 2021","American healthcare workers face unprecedented stress and trauma in the workplace during COVID-19, putting nurses at increased risk for poor mental health. Examining trends of mental health from before and during COVID-19 can illuminate the toll of the pandemic on nurses well-being. Nurses enrolled in Healthy Nurse, Healthy Nation receive a prompt to take an annual survey (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 24,289). Mental health was assessed by active diagnoses of anxiety and depressive disorder, and feeling sad, down or depressed for two or more weeks in the past year. Logistic regression models were used to calculate predictive probabilities of health outcomes in year 4 (May 1, 2020 - April 30, 2021) compared to years 1-3 (each from May 1 to April 30), controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and nurse type. Models were also stratified by work setting and nurse type. In year 4, nurses had a 19.8% probability of anxiety disorder, significantly higher than year 3 (16.3%, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), year 2 (13.7%, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), and year 1 (14.0%, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). Similarly, nurses had a 16.7% probability of depression disorder in year 4, significantly higher than year 2 (12.9%, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) and year 1 (13.9%, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01). Year 4 nurses had a 34.4% probability of feeling sad, down or depressed for two weeks, significantly higher than previous years (year 1Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 26.8%, year 2Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 25.9%, year 3Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 29.7%, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). Trends in probabilities of mental health indicators were similar among each nurse type and work setting. Nurses in medical/surgical work settings and those with licensed practical nurse and licensed vocational nurse titles consistently had the highest probability of poor mental health. In 2020-2021, nurses faced challenges unlike any experienced in previous years. Unsurprisingly, nurses reported increased instances of poor mental health indicators. Positive disruptive strategies are needed to systemically change organizational culture and policy to prioritize and support nurses' well-being.","Cuccia, Peterson, Melnyk, Boston-Leary","https://doi.org/10.1111/wvn.12601","20220808","anxiety; depression; epidemiological; history; mental health; survey; trends","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-09","",35813,""
"New Parent Support Needs and Experiences with Pediatric Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Despite evidence for heightened psychiatric risk and unique parenting challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, no research exists on the specific needs of parents of infants and responsiveness of pediatric care to their needs. We aimed to describe the support needs of new parents and explore their experiences with pediatric care. In late 2020 we conducted semi-structured interviews with 30 mothers of babies born or due that year. Interviews addressed perinatal experiences during the pandemic, with an emphasis on experiences related to social support. In an iterative, inductive process, thematic analysis was used to analyze the data. This study identifies a set of support needs specific to the context of parenting an infant during the COVID-19 crisis: coping with the compound psychological impacts of the postpartum period and a pandemic; parenting in the absence of expected social support; risk assessment to keep infant and family safe. This study finds that policies implemented by health care providers to reduce risk of COVID-19 transmission came at a cost to new parents and parent-provider relationships. Participants reported mixed experiences with in-person and telehealth pediatric care, including inadequate and/or uncomfortable postpartum mental health screening and breastfeeding support, and identified specific features that constituted responsive care during the pandemic. Normative changes associated with the postpartum period combined with complex adaptations necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic presented substantial challenges for families with infants, even relatively privileged families. Providers can incorporate these findings to enhance support for families and promote maternal and child health.","Walsh, Reynders, Davis","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10995-022-03496-1","20220807","COVID-19 pandemic; Family-centered care; Pediatrics; Postpartum","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-09","",35814,""
"An 8-month longitudinal exploration of body image and disordered eating in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic","Research suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic is negatively impacting mental health, with rates of eating disorder referrals in particular rising steeply during the pandemic. This study aimed to examine 8-month changes in body image and disordered eating during the COVID-19 pandemic, and explore whether any changes were moderated by gender, age, or eating disorder history. This study used a longitudinal survey design in which 587 adults living in the UK (85Ã‚Â % women; mean ageÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 32.87Ã‚Â years) completed assessments every two months over five timepoints from May/June 2020 to January/February 2021. Measures included body esteem, disordered eating, and psychological distress. Mixed effect models showed small but significant improvements in body esteem and disordered eating symptoms from May/June 2020 to January/February 2021. These improvements were independent of changes in psychological distress, and did not vary by gender, age or eating disorder history. Whilst poor body image and disordered eating may have been elevated in the early period of the pandemic, this study suggests improvements, rather than worsening, of these outcomes over time. This may reflect adaptation to this changing context.","Sharpe, Newman, Robertson, Opitz, Peebles, Duffy","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eatbeh.2022.101660","20220807","Body image; COVID-19; Eating disorders; Lockdown; Longitudinal; Survey","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-09","",35815,""
"Impact of Working From Home on Addressing Practitioner Burnout and Work-Life Balance in Mental Health","While the demand for mental health services is growing, a practitioner shortage and high rates of burnout limit the capacity of the system to provide care.

"Love Together, Parent Together (L2P2): a protocol for a feasibility study of a conflict reappraisal writing intervention for interparental couples with young children","The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced or amplified stress and challenge within couples' relationships. Among those who are particularly vulnerable to heightened conflict and lower relationship satisfaction during this time are interparental couples with young children, whose relationships may have already been tenuous prior to the pandemic. Stress within the interparental relationship may have ripple effects on all family subsystems and child adjustment. The Love Together Parent Together (L2P2) program is a brief, low-intensity writing intervention adapted for parents of young children that was designed to reduce conflict-related distress and prevent declines in relationship satisfaction. Based on an original writing intervention by Finkel and colleagues, L2P2 has adapted the intervention duration and study population to be appropriate to the current global context. This study will examine the key feasibility metrics related to this adapted program with the goal of identifying problems and informing parameters of future pilot and/or main RCTs. The current study is a non-randomized feasibility study, using a single-arm, pre-test/post-test design to primarily assess the feasibility of an evaluative RCT, and to secondarily assess the potential effects on outcomes to be used in a future RCT. Couples will be recruited through three community-based agencies with the goal of obtaining a socio-demographically diverse sample. The first 20 couples to enroll will be included. Baseline and post-intervention surveys will be conducted, and a writing intervention will take place (three 7-min sessions over the course of 5 weeks). The primary outcomes will be feasibility metrics of recruitment rates, appropriateness of eligibility criteria, sample diversity, retention, uptake, adherence, and acceptability. In addition, we will develop an objective measure of couple ""we-ness"" based on an analysis of writing samples. The secondary outcomes will include couples' measures (i.e., relationship quality, perceived partner responsiveness, self-reported responsiveness, conflict-related distress), and additional family outcomes (i.e., parent-child relations, parental/child mental health). Criteria for success are outlined, and failure to meet the criteria will result in adaptations to the measurement schedule, intervention design, recruitment approach, and/or other elements of the program. This feasibility study will inform several components of the procedures used for a subsequent pilot RCT, in which we will examine the feasibility of the methodology used to evaluate the program (e.g., randomization, attrition to follow-up assessment/across groups, and sample size estimation, preliminary effectiveness), as well as the main RCT, which will investigate the effectiveness of the intervention on primary outcome measures and mediating pathways.

"Polysubstance use and correlations with psychosocial and health risk behaviours: A latent profile analysis among more than 95,000 Norwegian adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background and aims: Polysubstance use represents a health risk for adolescents; however, large scale studies on this issue during COVID-19 pandemic are scarce. We aim to (i) characterise substance use profiles among adolescents, and (ii) identify predictors of such substance use profiles. Design: A Norwegian nationwide survey was analysed using Latent Profile Analysis in 2021. Participants: Adolescents (N = 97,429; ages 13 to 18 years). Measurements: We assessed current cigarettes, e-cigarettes and snus use, lifetime alcohol consumption, and cannabis and other illicit drugs use over a 12-month period. Predictors included psychosocial variables, health risk behaviours, and COVID-19 related problems. Findings: We identified three adolescent profiles; those who use no substances (n = 88,890; 92%); those who use snus and alcohol (n = 6,546; 6%); and those who use multiple substances (i.e., polysubstance users; n = 1,993; 2%). Boys, older adolescents, adolescents with lower socio-economic status, and those reporting low levels of parental control and higher parental alcohol use were most likely to be polysubstance users. Other significant predictors were to have easy access to cannabis, mental health problems, a high prevalence of pain, a low consumption of fruit, low levels of physical activity, and using over the counter painkillers. Adolescents with social and mental health issues related to COVID-19 were also more at risk of being in the polysubstance user profile. Adolescents who use snus and alcohol showed similar patterns of correlates compared to non-users, but associations were weaker than for polysubstance users. Conclusions: Adolescents who use multiple substances have an unhealthier lifestyle, are at a higher risk of experiencing psychosocial impairments, and report more negative problems related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Preventative strategies aimed at reducing polysubstance use might help to promote psychosocial wellbeing in adolescents in various life domains.","RubÃ©n RodrÃ­guez-Cano et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E013B-4BC-63B","20220809","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Substance Abuse and Addiction; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; illicit drugs; polysubstance use; snus; alcohol drinking; e-cigarette; cannabis; latent profile analyses; cigarette; covid-19-related problems; adolescent","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-09","",35822,""
