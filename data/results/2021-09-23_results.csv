"Identifying At-Risk Communities and Key Vulnerability Indicators in the COVID-19 Pandemic","Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, certain communities have been disproportionately exposed to detrimental health outcomes and socioeconomic injuries. Quantifying community needs is crucial for identifying testing and service deserts, effectively allocating resources, and informing funding and decision making. We have constructed research-driven metrics measuring the public health and economic impacts of COVID-19 on vulnerable populations. In this work we further examine and validate these indices by training supervised models to predict proxy outcomes and analyzing the feature importances to identify gaps in our original metric design. The indices analyzed in this work are unique among COVID-19 risk assessments due to their robust integration of disparate data sources. Together, they enable more effective responses to COVID-19 driven health inequities.","Savannah Thais; Shaine Leibowitz; Alejandra Rios Gutierez; Alexandra Passarelli; Stephanie Santo; Nora Shipp","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.09.19.21263805","20210922","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-23","",18188,""
"Health-Related Quality of Life and psychological distress of adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic in Geneva","Purpose Our objective was to assess adolescent's Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and psychological distress, from their own and their parents' perspective, and to examine associated risk factors during the COVID-19 pandemic in Geneva, Switzerland. Methods A random sample of adolescents, aged 14-17 years, and their families was invited to a serosurvey in November and December 2020. Adolescents' HRQoL was evaluated using the validated adolescent-reported KIDSCREEN-10 and parent-reported KINDLR scales. Psychological distress was assessed with self-reported sadness and loneliness, and using the KINDLR emotional well-being scale. Risk factors for adolescents' low HRQoL and psychological distress were identified using generalized estimating equations and both adolescents' and their parents' perceptions were compared. Results Among 240 adolescents, 11% had a low HRQoL, 35% reported sadness and 23% reported loneliness. Based on parents' perception, 12% of the adolescents had a low HRQoL and 16% a low emotional well-being. Being a girl (aOR=3.29; 95%CI: 1.64-6.57), increased time on social media (aOR=2.05; 95%CI: 1.08-3.88), parents' average to poor mood (aOR=2.81; 95%CI: 1.21-6.56) and average to poor household financial situation (aOR=2.30; 95%CI: 1.00-5.29) were associated with an increased risk of sadness. Mismatches between adolescents' and their parents' perception of HRQoL were more likely for girls (aOR=2.88; 95%CI: 1.54-5.41) and in households with lower family well-being (aOR=0.91; 95%CI: 0.86-0.96). Conclusion A meaningful proportion of adolescents experienced low well-being during the second wave of COVID-19. Adolescents living in underprivileged or distressed families seemed particularly affected. Monitoring is necessary to evaluate the long-term effects of the pandemic on adolescents.","Roxane Dumont; Viviane Richard; Helene Baysson; Elsa Lorthe; Giovanni Piumatti; Stephanie Schrempft; Ania Wisniak; Remy Barbe; Klara Posfay Barbe; Idris Guessous; Silvia Stringhini","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.09.20.21263812","20210922","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-23","",18189,""
"Associations Among Nurses' Mental/Physical Health, Lifestyle Behaviors, Shift Length, and Workplace Wellness Support During COVID-19: Important Implications for Health Care Systems","Work cultures supportive of wellness and shorter shift length have been associated with better mental/physical health outcomes in nurses, but how the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic impacted such outcomes is not known. This study's aims were to (1) describe the mental/physical health, well-being, and healthy lifestyle behaviors of nurses during the pandemic; (2) explore the pandemic's impact on their health and healthy lifestyle behaviors; and (3) determine the associations of perceived workplace wellness support and shift length with nurses' health, well-being, and healthy lifestyle behaviors. A cross-sectional descriptive design was used with 264 nurses associated with Trusted Health. Nurses completed a survey containing valid and reliable scales measuring depression, anxiety, burnout and quality of life, perceived wellness culture, and healthy lifestyle behaviors. Results indicated that more than 50% of nurses had worsening mental/physical health relating to the pandemic. Compared with nurses whose workplaces provided little/no wellness support, nurses with workplaces that supported their wellness were 3 to 9 times as likely to have better mental/physical health, no/little stress, no burnout, and high quality of life. Nurses who worked longer shifts had poorer health outcomes. These findings indicate that workplace wellness support and shorter shifts positively impacted nurse mental/physical health and professional quality of life amidst the pandemic.","Melnyk, Hsieh, Tan, Teall, Weberg, Jun, Gawlik, Hoying","https://doi.org/10.1097/NAQ.0000000000000499","20210922","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-23","",18190,""
"Suicide reduction in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic: lessons informing national prevention strategies for suicide reduction","The objective of this research was to evaluate the impact of federal, public health and social support programs on national suicide rates in Canada. Cross-sectional study. Canadian National Database (i.e., Statistics Canada) and Statista. Population-level data, and economic and consumer market data. Suicide mortality data, population data and unemployment data were obtained from available statistical databases (e.g. Statistics Canada). We quantified suicide rate by dividing the total number of suicide deaths by the national population expressed as a rate per 100,000 population. Overall suicide mortality rate decreased in Canada from 10.82 deaths per 100,000 in the March 2019 - February 2020 period to 7.34 per 100,000 (i.e. absolute difference of 1300 deaths) in the March 2020 - February 2021 period. The overall Canadian unemployment rate changed from an average monthly rate of 5.7% in 2019 to 9.5% in 2020. Our results indicate that for the first post-pandemic interval evaluated (i.e., March 2020 - February 2021), suicide rates in Canada decreased against a background of extraordinary public health measures intended to mitigate community spread of COVID-19. An externality of public health measures was a significant rise in national unemployment rates in population measures of distress. Our results suggest that government interventions that broadly aim to reduce measures of insecurity (i.e., economic, housing, health), and timely psychiatric services, should be prioritised as part of a national suicide reduction strategy, not only during but after termination of the COVID-19 pandemic.","McIntyre, Lui, Rosenblat, Ho, Gill, Mansur, Teopiz, Liao, Lu, Subramaniapillai, Nasri, Lee","https://doi.org/10.1177/01410768211043186","20210922","COVID-19; bipolar disorder; depression; mental health; pandemic; public health; suicide; unemployment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-23","",18191,""
"Satisfaction of the Use of Telehealth and Access to Care for Veterans During the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Background:</b> While many health care providers have shifted toward telehealth services in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, little is known about the perception and acceptance of such services, particularly among vulnerable populations. Veterans, who are at increased risk of physical and mental health needs, may benefit from the use and availability of telehealth services. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> Cross sectional survey data related to telehealth use, satisfaction, and access were collected through an online survey. Participants from previous research studies and veterans receiving care at a national veteran behavioral health organization were invited to participate. <b>Results:</b> A total of 404 veterans participated. Before the pandemic, many veterans had never used telehealth for physical (72%) or mental (76%) health care. Since the start of the pandemic, 62% of participants reported they received some care through telehealth services. Most participants found telehealth valuable and helpful (82%), indicated the technology was well explained (77%), and felt that issues were resolved quickly and easily (67%). Access to care was limited among participants who utilize massage therapy (64%), dental care (53%), routine checkups (50%), acupuncture (50%), and physical therapy (48%). <b>Discussion:</b> These findings showed an increase in the use of telehealth services and overwhelming satisfaction among veterans. Despite this, some veterans indicated barriers to receiving physical and mental health care. <b>Conclusions:</b> This provides an opportunity to expand the use of telehealth services to meet the health care needs of veterans. Barriers to care should be addressed to minimize the impact on the well-being of veterans.","Kintzle, Rivas, Castro","https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2021.0262","20210922","access to care; satisfaction; telehealth; telemedicine; veteran","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-23","",18192,""
"Psychological distress during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ecuador: Cross-sectional study","The effects of the COVID 19 pandemic on the mental health of citizens from Asia, Europe, or North America begin to be known, but there are fewer publications on its effects in Latin American countries. In this study, its impact in Ecuador is described, with data collected during the first phase of the pandemic. The objective of this study was to analyse the level of psychological distress in the population of Ecuador during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Cross-sectional observational study. The questionnaires were collected through an online self-developed questionnaire, between April 2 and May 17, 2020, using the non-probabilistic sampling methodology: snowball method. The variables considered were sociodemographic variables, physical symptoms, health status, COVID-19 contact history, preventive measures, and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). The percentage with high psychological distress (PD) (GHQ-12 Ã¢â€°Â¥ 3) has been somewhat lower than that found in Europe, being women, young people, people with higher level of education, living without a partner, not living with children or children under 16 years of age, and with worse perception of health the groups with the highest PD. Differences have been observed with European studies regarding common symptoms, preventive measures to avoid contagion, percentage of infected relatives, or diagnostic tests performed. The use of the same research instrument, validated in Europe and adapted to Ecuador, has facilitated the comparison of the found results and differences, which can be explained by socio-economic or cultural variables, the health system, level of information, or by preventive measures put in place to prevent the pandemic.","GÃƒÂ³mez-Salgado, Adanaque-Bravo, Ortega-Moreno, Allande-CussÃƒÂ³, Arias-Ulloa, Ruiz-Frutos","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0257661","20210922","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-23","",18193,""
"The State of Mind of Healthcare Professionals in the Light of the COVID-19: Insights from Text Analysis of Twitter's Online Discourses","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected populations worldwide, with extreme health, economic, social, and political implications. Healthcare professionals (HCPs) are at the core of pandemic response and are among the most crucial factors in maintaining coping capacities. Yet, they are also vulnerable to mental health effects, managing a long-lasting emergency under lack of resources and complicated personal concerns. However, there is a lack of longitudinal studies that investigate the HCP population. To analyse the state of mind of HCPs as expressed in online discussions published on Twitter in light of COVID-19, from the pandemic onset until the end of 2020. The population for this study was selected from followers of a few hundred Twitter accounts of healthcare organizations and common HCP points of interest. We used active learning, a process that iteratively uses machine learning and manual data labeling, to select the large-scale population of Twitter accounts maintained by English-speaking HCPs focusing on individuals rather than official organizations. We analyzed the topics and emotions in their discourse during 2020. The topic distributions were obtained using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm. We defined a measure of topic cohesion and described the most cohesive topics. The emotions expressed in tweets during 2020 were compared to 2019. Finally, the emotion intensities were cross-correlated with the pandemic waves to explore possible associations between the pandemic development and emotional response. We analyzed timelines of 53,063 Twitter profiles, 90% of which are maintained by individual HCPs. Professional topics account for 44.5% of tweets by HCPs from Jan. 1st to Dec. 6th, 2020. Events such as the pandemic waves, U.S. elections, or the George Floyd case affect the HCPs' discourse. The levels of joy and sadness exceed their minimal and maximal values yesteryear, respectively, 80% of the time, P= .001. Most interestingly, fear precedes the pandemic waves (in terms of the differences in confirmed cases) by two weeks with a Spearman correlations coefficient of ÃÂ(47)= .34, P= .026. Analyses of longitudinal data over the 2020 year reveal that a large fraction of HCP discourse is related directly to professional content, including the increase in the volume of discussions following the pandemic waves. The changes in emotional patterns (decrease of joy, an increase of sadness, fear, and disgust) during the year 2020 may indicate the utmost importance in providing emotional support for HCPs to prevent fatigue, burnout, and mental health disorders postpandemic period. The increase of fear two weeks in advance of pandemic waves indicates that HCPs are in a position and with adequate qualification to anticipate the pandemic development, and could serve as a bottom-up pathway for expressing the morbidity and clinical situation to health agencies.","Elyashar, Plochotnikov, Cohen, Puzis, Cohen","https://doi.org/10.2196/30217","20210922","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-23","",18194,""
"Immunostimulant and Antidepressant Effect of Natural Compounds in the Management of Covid-19 Symptoms","In recent years, the use of natural compounds as adjuvant treatments and alternatives to traditional pharmacological therapies has become increasingly popular. These compounds have a wide range of biological effects, such as: antioxidant, anti-aging, hypocholesterolizing, hypoglycemic, antitumoral, antidepressant, anxiolytic activity, etc. Almost all of these compounds are easily available and are contained in different foods. At the end of 2019 the Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 appeared in China and quickly spread throughout the world, causing a pandemic. The most common symptoms of this infection are dry cough, fever, dyspnea, and in severe cases bilateral interstitial pneumonia, with consequences that can lead to death. The nations, in trying to prevent the spread of infection, have imposed social distancing and lockdown measures on their citizens. This had a strong psychological-social impact, leading to phobic, anxious and depressive states. Pharmacological therapy could be accompanied by treatment with several natural compounds, such as vitamins, baicalein, zinc and essential oils. These compounds possess marked immunostimulant activity, strengthening the immune response and mitigating interactions between the virus and the host cell. They also have an antidepressant effect, acting on certain neurotransmitters.","Alesci, Fumia, Lo Cascio, Miller, Cicero","https://doi.org/10.1080/07315724.2021.1965503","20210922","COVID-19; baicalein; depression; immune system; vitamins; zinc","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-23","",18195,""

"A National Study of Racial-Ethnic Differences in COVID-19 Concerns among Older Americans: Evidence from the Health and Retirement Study","Concerns about COVID-19 is an important emotional reaction to the pandemic and represents a key pandemic-related mental health outcome. We provide the first population-based evidence of racial-ethnic differences in COVID-19 concerns among older Americans during the COVID-19 outbreak. We analyzed data from the 2020 Health and Retirement Study COVID-19 project. The sample included 2,879 respondents (aged 50 and older) who were interviewed from June to September 2020 and had completed measures on COVID-19 concerns and other key covariates. Ordinary least squares regression models were estimated to assess racial-ethnic differences in COVID-19 concerns. Formal mediation analysis was conducted to test potential mediating roles of exposures to COVID-19 risks, preexisting health status, and socioeconomic resources in accounting for racial-ethnic differences in COVID-19 concerns. Non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic Americans showed significantly greater concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic than non-Hispanic White Americans. Racial-ethnic minority older adults also had higher proportions of knowing someone who had contracted or died from COVID-19 than White older adults. Unequal exposures to COVID-19 risks by race-ethnicity and, to a lesser degree, preexisting health inequalities accounted for only part of the racial-ethnic differences in COVID-19 concerns. Our findings call for more research and policy interventions to lessen the disproportionate burden of COVID-19 experienced by older adults of racial-ethnic minority groups.","Lin, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1093/geronb/gbab171","20210922","COVID-19; Health disparities; Minority aging; Race-ethnicity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-23","",18198,""
"Examination of Pre-Pandemic Measures on Youth Well-Being During Early Stages of the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected our lives in numerous ways. How youth have been impacted by the pandemic, and which pre-existing factors best relate to COVID-19 responses, is of high importance for effective identification and treatment of those most vulnerable. Youth with pre-pandemic mental health difficulties like ADHD could be at risk for worse well-being during and after the pandemic. The current study tested potential risk factors (i.e., pre-pandemic mental health, age, and parent education) and their relation to family experiences during early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were previously enrolled in an on-going, yearly longitudinal study examining the relationship between mental health and executive functions in youths. Families with 1-4 annual pre-pandemic lab visits filled out an online COVID-19 survey in May-July 2020 to assess how the pandemic impacted their well-being (n=135 youth). Youth pre-pandemic mental health difficulties, especially ADHD symptoms, related to worse well-being during the early pandemic. Trajectories of recent ADHD symptoms over time also predicted cognitive difficulties during the pandemic. We found that youth age was a strong predictor of pandemic response, with younger youths showing fewer negative responses. Parental education level buffered family economics during early COVID-19. Families showed synchrony in their pandemic response. Pre-pandemic ADHD severity and slope, youth age, and parent education (a proxy for socioeconomic status) were risk factors that influenced youth or family well-being early in the COVID-19 pandemic; this information can help identify those who may need more community and educational support.","Porter, Douglas, Larguinho, Aristizabal, Mitchell, Roe, Church","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsgos.2021.08.003","20210922","ADHD; COVID-19; adolescent; longitudinal; mental health; parent education","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-23","",18199,""
"Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19: Evidence of mood &amp; cognitive impairment","Acute health consequences associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection have been thoroughly characterized; however, long-term impacts are not yet understood. Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), also known as Long COVID syndrome, is the persistence of COVID-19 symptoms long after viral infection. In addition to physical symptoms, those with PASC experience changes in mental health, but few studies have empirically examined these effects. The current study investigated mood and cognitive functioning in individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 infection. We recruited 100 male and female adults (MÃ‚Â Ã¢â‚¬â€¹=Ã‚Â Ã¢â‚¬â€¹30 years old) with no history of mood or cognitive impairment prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (Jan. 2020). Half of the subjects were healthy controls (i.e., no prior COVID-19 infection) and half had received a past COVID-19 diagnosis (ascertained by PCR or antibody test) but were no longer infectious. Participants completed self-reported measures of stress, depression, and anhedonia, as well as the Attention Network Test (ANT), a behavioural measure of attentional alerting, orienting and executive functioning. Relative to controls, depression and anhedonia were significantly higher in the past-COVID group. Selective impairment in attention was observed in the past-COVID group, marked by deficits in executive functioning while alerting and orienting abilities remained intact. Effects were most pronounced among individuals diagnosed 1-4 months prior to assessment. There were no group differences in pandemic-related experiences with respect to social interaction, social distancing, or isolation. The past-COVID group scored significantly higher on perceived stress; however, this did not moderate any effects observed on mood or cognition. These findings implicate a protracted reaction to the virus, possibly via prolonged inflammation, contributing to sustained mood dysregulation and cognitive impairment. Future research should examine the neural and physiological underpinnings of PASC, particularly mechanisms that promote psychiatric sequelae 1-4 months following diagnosis.","Lamontagne, Winters, Pizzagalli, Olmstead","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2021.100347","20210922","Anhedonia; Attention network test (ANT); Cognitive control; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Inflammation; Long haul COVID; Post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC); SARS-CoV-2; depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-23","",18200,""
"Depression and anxiety in Malaysian population during third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic","The outbreak of coronavirus posits deleterious consequences on global healthcare system while affecting human life in every aspect. Despite several measures undertaken to limit the socio-economic effect of coronavirus, various challenges remain pervasive, and one such challenge is mental health, particularly depression and anxiety. Therefore, this study examines the prevalence and determinants of depression and anxiety in Malaysian population during third wave of COVID-19. A cross-sectional online survey was carried out via social media platforms and 1544 Malaysians were selected. The level of depression was assessed by Patient Health Questionnaires (PHQ-9) and scored accordingly for categorization. Zung's Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) was used as a self-assessment survey to quantify the level of anxiety of persons experiencing anxiety-related symptoms. Percentage distribution and logistic regression analysis were used in the data analysis. Results showed that one-fourth (25.1%) of the participants had severe depressive symptoms. Almost one-sixth (18.7%) had mild depressive symptoms and one-third (34.1%) had mild to moderate anxiety symptoms. Age, gender, and friends infected with virus were the three important predictors of depression and anxiety. The odds of having depression (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.44; CÃ‚Â·I.Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.32-1.62) and anxiety (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.36; CÃ‚Â·I.Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.27-1.47) were significantly higher among females than in males. A significant proportion of the study participants were facing mild to severe depression and anxiety symptoms which is very alarming as the pandemic is still now increasing across the country. Immediate interventions including community counselling programmes, TV and social media campaigns are urgently needed to reduce the psychological stress among the Malaysian population.","Marzo, Vinay, Bahari, Chauhan, Ming, Nelson Fernandez, Johnson, Thivakaran, Rahman, Goel","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cegh.2021.100868","20210922","Anxiety; Coronavirus; Depression; Patient health questionnaires; Zung's self-rating anxiety scale","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-23","",18201,""
"Diagnostic Pitfalls of Digital Microscopy Versus Light Microscopy in Gastrointestinal Pathology: A Systematic Review","Digital microscopy (DM) is one of the cutting-edge advances in pathology, which entails improved efficiency, diagnostic advantages, and potential application in virtual diagnosis, particularly in the current era of the coronavirusÃ‚Â disease (COVID-19) pandemic. However, the diagnostic challenges are the remaining concerns for its wider adoption by pathologists, and these concerns should be addressed in a specific subspecialty. We aim to identify the common diagnostic pitfalls of whole slide imaging (WSI), one modality of DM, in gastrointestinal (GI) pathology. From validating studies of primary diagnosis performance, we included 16 records with features on GI cases involved, at least two weeks wash-out periods, and more than 60 caseÃ‚Â study designs. A tailored quality appraisal assessment was utilized to evaluate the risks of bias for these diagnostic accuracy studies. Furthermore, due to the highly heterogeneous studies and unstandardized definition of discordance, we extract the discordant cases in GI pathology and calculate the discrepant rate, resulting from 0.5% to 64.28%. Targeting discrepancy cases between digital microscopy and light microscopy, we demonstrate five main diagnostic pitfalls regarding WSI as follows: additional time to review slides in WSI, hard to identify dysplasia nucleus, missed organisms like <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> (<i>H. pylori</i>), specific cell recognitions, and technical issues. After detailed reviews and analysis, we generate two essential suggestions for further GI cases signing out by DM. One is to use systematizedÃ‚Â 20x scans for diagnostic workouts and requesting 40x or even 60x scans for challengingÃ‚Â cases; another is that a high-volume slides training should be set before the real clinical application of WSI for primary diagnosis, particularly in GI pathology.","Shi, Georgiou, Akram, Proute, Serhiyenia, Kerolos, Pradeep, Kothur, Khan","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.17116","20210922","diagnosis; diagnostic pitfalls; digital microscopy; digital slide; gastrointestinal pathology; whole slide imaging","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-23","",18202,""
"Impact of COVID-19 restrictions on alcohol consumption behaviours","We aimed to evaluate how coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions had altered individual's drinking behaviours, including consumption, hangover experiences, and motivations to drink, and changing levels of depression and anxiety. We conducted an online cross-sectional self-report survey. Whole group analysis compared pre- versus post-COVID restrictions. A correlation coefficient matrix evaluated the associations between all outcome scores. Self-report data was compared with Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) scores from the 2014 Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey. Multiple linear modelling (MLM) was calculated to identify factors associated with increasing AUDIT scores and post-restriction AUDIT scores. In total, 346 individuals completed the survey, of which 336 reported drinking and were therefore analysed. After COVID-19 restrictions 23.2% of respondents reported an increased AUDIT score, and 60.1% a decreased score. AUDIT score change was positively correlated with change in depression (<i>P &lt;</i> 0.01, <i>r =</i> 0.15), anxiety (<i>P &lt;</i> 0.01, <i>r =</i> 0.15) and drinking to cope scores (<i>P &lt;</i> 0.0001, <i>r =</i> 0.35). MLM revealed that higher AUDIT scores were associated with age, mental illness, lack of a garden, self-employed or furloughed individuals, a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis and smoking status. COVID-19 restrictions decreased alcohol consumption for the majority of individuals in this study. However, a small proportion increased their consumption; this related to drinking to cope and increased depression and anxiety.","Palmer, Trender, Tyacke, Hampshire, Lingford-Hughes","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2021.986","20210922","Alcohol disorders; cognitive neuroscience; drugs of dependence disorders; epidemiology; psychosocial interventions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-23","",18203,""
"Prevalence and Associated Factors of Problematic Smartphone Use During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Bangladeshi Study","Problematic smartphone use (PSU) has been increasing hastily in recent decades, and it has become inseparable during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially among the students who are at risk of problematic smartphone use. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the prevalence and associated factors of PSU during the COVID-19 pandemic among the Bangladeshi students. A total of 601 Bangladeshi students were recruited through an online-based cross-sectional survey that was conducted between October 7 and November 2, 2020. The survey collected information related to socio-demographics, behavioral health, internet use behaviors, depression, anxiety, and PSU. Independent samples <i>t</i>-test and one-way ANOVA were performed to present the relationship between the studied variables and PSU. Multiple linear regression analysis was also used for investigating the explanatory power of the predictive models for PSU. Surprisingly, about 86.9% of the students scored to be problematic smartphone users (Ã¢â€°Â¥21 out of a total 36 based on the Smartphone Application-Based Addiction Scale). In addition, medical students, engaging in a relationship, performing less physical activity, longer duration of internet use, some sorts of internet use purpose (eg, messaging, watching videos, using social media), depression, and anxiety were significantly associated with higher scores of PSU. After adjusting all the studied variables, the final model explained a 31.3% variance predicting PSU. The present study is one of the first approaches to assess the prevalence of PSU among the Bangladeshi students during the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas the addiction level was superfluous (and this may be due to more online engagement related to the pandemic). Thus, the study recommended strategies or policies related to the students' risk-reducing and healthy use of smartphones.","Hosen, Al Mamun, Sikder, Abbasi, Zou, Guo, Mamun","https://doi.org/10.2147/RMHP.S325126","20210922","Bangladesh; Bangladeshi student; problematic smartphone use; smartphone; smartphone addiction in Bangladesh; smartphone overuse; technological addiction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-23","",18204,""
"Emotional and financial health during COVID-19: The role of housework, employment and childcare in Australia and the United States","During the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic, the world witnessed major economic, school, and daycare closures. We sampled respondents in Australia and the US during the height of the first restrictions to understand how the first quarantine structured their emotional strain and financial worry (825 Australians and 835 Americans aged between 18 and 65; May 2-3, 2020; source YouGov). We apply structural equation modeling to demonstrate that the <i>emotional well-being</i> impacts of COVID-19 are not only gendered but also vary between childless people and parents. Specifically, we show that compared to Australians, Americans were more impacted by changes in their financial circumstances. Further, while the financial worry and emotional strain impacts were similar between childless people and parents in Australia, significant differences existed between the two groups in the United States. In particular, we identify American mothers as the most disadvantaged group-feeling the most anxious and financially worried about both employment and domestic changes under COVID-19. Policy wise, we argue that COVID-19 is exacerbating gender inequality in emotional health. To slow down this trend, more adequate mental health supports are needed, particularly for mothers.","Ruppanner, Tan, Carson, Ratcliff","https://doi.org/10.1111/gwao.12727","20210922","COVIDÃ¢â‚¬Â19; emotional strain; financial worry; gender; work","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-23","",18205,""
"Parenting During COVID-19: A Study of Parents' Experiences Across Gender and Income Levels","This study describes parenting experiences at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and examines differences across parent gender and family income level. The COVID-19 pandemic had unprecedented impacts on families. Many parents faced employment changes, including job loss, reduced pay, and working remotely, while simultaneously experiencing increased childcare responsibilities due to school and childcare closures. Research is needed to document the ongoing impact of these changes on parents and families. An online convenience sample of parents (<i>N</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 1,009) reported on their parenting experiences during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic (April 2020) in an online survey. Parents reported high levels of depression, anxiety, and parental burnout. Further, many parents reported increased negative emotions, such as anger and worry, while simultaneously feeling closer to their children and offering more comfort and soothing. Differences across gender and income levels are presented. These results align with other emerging findings of increased impacts to mental health and well-being for parents and children and document the disproportionate effects on women and low-income families. Implications include needing additional support (e.g., financial, caregiving) for parents and families as we continue to face the impacts and consequences of COVID-19.","Kerr, Rasmussen, Fanning, Braaten","https://doi.org/10.1111/fare.12571","20210922","COVIDÃ¢â‚¬Â19; emotion; fathers; mental health; mothers; parenting","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-23","",18206,""
"Perceptions by early career tropical researchers on the impact of COVID-19 six months into the pandemic","The impacts of COVID-19 on early career tropical researchers are diverse and complex, including lack of funding opportunities, limitations to conducting fieldwork in remote places, reduced collaborations and networking, and difficulties when living and collecting data abroad. Here, we examine the current and future impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on this population through a survey of 213Ã‚Â students and early career tropical researchers from around the world. As of September 2020, 55% of participants had already experienced financial repercussions due to the pandemic. Future worries were diverse and included equal concern regarding advancement (collaborations and networking), job uncertainty, fieldwork, and funding, as well as mental health concerns. Successful strategies to support student and early career researchers with regards to the pandemic should include mentoring from those in more advanced career positions on how to reframe research that is no longer feasible to complete as originally intended. Additionally, those responsible for hiring decisions should not penalize applicants for gaps in productivity during this time.

"Anxiety and depression among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic umbrella review of the global evidence","To summarise the evidence relating to the prevalence of anxiety and depression among healthcare workers (HCWs) during the COVID-19 pandemic. An umbrella review of systematic reviews was undertaken using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methods. The Cochrane database of systematic reviews, JBI Evidence Synthesis, MEDLINE, Web of Science, PsycINFO, Embase and CINAHL were searched in March 2021 for reviews published in English. Systematic reviews reporting the prevalence of anxiety and depression among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Two researchers screened each abstract and independently reviewed full text articles. Study quality was assessed using the JBI critical appraisal tool for systematic reviews, and the degree of overlap in primary studies was calculated. Ten systematic reviews (100 unique studies), including 169Ã¢â‚¬â€°157 HCWs from 35 countries were included. The prevalence of anxiety among all HCWs ranged from 22.2% (95% CI 21.3% to 23.1%) to 33.0% (95% CI 31.9% to 34.1%). The prevalence of anxiety among physicians (n=5820) was reported to be between 17% and 19.8% and for nurses (n=14Ã¢â‚¬â€°938) between 22.8% and 27%. The prevalence of depression among all HCWs ranged from 17.9% (95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 17.1% to 18.8%) to 36% (95% CI 34.9% to 37.1%). The prevalence of depression among physicians (n=643) and nurses (n=8063) was reported to be 40.4% and 28%, respectively. There is wide variation evident in the presence of anxiety and depression among HCWs. In particular, the prevalence of depression among physicians was high. Strategies to reduce the incidence of anxiety and depression are urgently required.

"Mental health in the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic: protocol for a nationally representative multilevel survey in Serbia","The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have a prolonged impact on mental health (MH); however, the long-term MH effects of the COVID-19 pandemic remain unknown. The Serbian national survey-CoV2Soul.RS-was launched to document the MH status of the Serbian population following the COVID-19 pandemic and to contribute to an international evidence base about MH prevalence rates during different phases of the pandemic. This cross-sectional study was designed to collect a nationally representative sample (N=1200; age 18-65 years; estimated start/end-June/November 2021) using multistage probabilistic household sampling. Trained staff will conduct in-person diagnostic interviews. A battery of self-report instruments will be administered to assess the quality of life (QoL), general distress and associated protective and harmful psychological and societal factors. Analyses will be conducted to delineate the prevalence rates of MH disorders, how MH conditions and QoL vary with respect to sociodemographic variables, personality, health status and traumatic events during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to test how these relations depend on geographical region. Moreover, this study was designed to explore mechanisms linking personality and the perception of pandemic consequences and associated distress. Prevalence rates of MH disorders will be calculated using descriptive statistics. For additional analyses, we will use correlations, analysis of variance and regression analyses. The hierarchical structure of the data will be explored using multilevel random coefficient modelling. Structural equation modelling will be used to investigate the indirect effects of personality on distress through relevant variables. Ethical Committees of the Faculty of Medicine (1322-VII/31) and Faculty of Philosophy in Belgrade (02-33/273) and Faculty of Philosophy in Novi Sad (05-27, br.893/1) approved the protocol. Only respondents able to provide informed consent will participate in the study.

The objectives of the cohort study are to: (1) estimate and evaluate determinants of the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, disease and deaths; (2) assess the impact of the pandemic on psychosocial and economic outcomes and (3) assess the uptake of pandemic mitigation strategies. We began enrolling participants from 28 March 2020 using internet-based strategies. AdultsÃ¢â€°Â¥18 years residing anywhere in the USA or US territories were eligible. 6740 people are enrolled in the cohort, including participants from all 50 US states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Guam. Participants are contacted regularly to complete study assessments, including interviews and dried blood spot specimen collection for serologic testing. Participants are geographically and sociodemographically diverse and include essential workers (19%). 84.2% remain engaged in cohort follow-up activities after enrolment. Data have been used to assess SARS-CoV-2 cumulative incidence, seroincidence and related risk factors at different phases of the US pandemic; the role of household crowding and the presence of children in the household as potential risk factors for severe COVID-19 early in the US pandemic; to describe the prevalence of anxiety symptoms and its relationship to COVID-19 outcomes and other potential stressors; to identify preferences for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing when community transmission is on the rise via a discrete choice experiment and to assess vaccine hesitancy over time and its relationship to vaccine uptake.

Secondly, are there any positive side effects of these substances against SARS-CoV-2? Our aim was to analyze usage safety of psychotropics during COVID-19; therefore, herein, we have studied: (i) the risk of symptomatic complications of COVID-19 associated with the use of these drugs, notably central nervous system activity depression, QTc interval enlargement and infectious and thromboembolic complications; (ii) the risk of mistaking the iatrogenic impact of psychotropics with COVID-19 symptoms, causing diagnostic error. Moreover, we provided a summary of the different information available today for these risks, categorized by mental health disorder, for the following: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder, ADHD, sleep disorders and suicidal risk. The matter of psychoactive substance use during the pandemic is also analyzed in this paper, and guideline websites and publications for psychotropic treatments in the context of COVID-19 are referenced during the text, so that changes on those guidelines and eventual interaction between psychotropics and COVID-19 treatment medication can be reported and studied.

"<i>""When the first session may be the last!""</i>: A case report of the implementation of ""rapid tele-psychotherapy"" with single-session music therapy in the COVID-19 outbreak","Conventional psychotherapy with a lengthy and regular number of meetings is no longer relevant in the case of COVID-19, when persons with psychiatric problems, especially COVID-19 patients/clients, really require immediate psychological assistance. It is recognized as a ""rapid test"" in the field of body health to rapidly decide whether or not a person is affected by COVID-19. So, we should now be able to use the term ""rapid tele-psychotherapy"" with Single-Session Music Therapy (SSMT) in the field of mental health to characterize the mechanism of assistance provided to persons who seek therapeutic assistance virtually during this COVID-19 outbreak, so that they will easily and reliably be freed from troubling psychiatric issues. The author reports the case of a 33-year-old widow with asymptomatic COVID-19 who was admitted to her own home. The author describes the effectiveness of the implementation of rapid tele-psychotherapy with SSMT in reducing the scale of anxiety, panic, fear, depression, acute stress, insomnia, and delusions of death. This case can provide new inputs or ideas for counselors/psychologists/psychiatrists/therapists who work in hospitals/institutions to provide rapid tele-psychotherapy with SSMT as therapeutic assistance for individuals who need psychotherapy in this COVID-19 outbreak, especially for COVID-19 patients/clients. Besides that, this concept is not only suitable for rapidly screening individuals that may face psychological problems and helping them better seek therapeutic assistance, but can also be used as an adjuvant therapy for psychiatric patients.","Situmorang","https://doi.org/10.1017/S1478951521001425","20210922","COVID-19; Mental health services; Rapid tele-psychotherapy; Single-session music therapy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-23","",18213,""
"Feelings of fear, sadness, and loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic: Findings from two studies in the UK","During the COVID-19 pandemic, exposure to COVID-related stimuli, has been enormous. Exposure to threat-related stimuli, can have a significant impact on people's wellbeing particularly in relation to COVID-related anxiety. The present research comprises two empirical studies. In Study 1, a newly developed Emotional Stroop Task (EST) and an Image Rating Task (IRT) were used to assess, automatic and non-automatic affective responses to COVID-related words and images during the first wave of the pandemic in the UK general population. In Study 2, the same tasks were used to evaluate the affective responses of University students during the second wave of the pandemic. Additionally, loneliness and pro-social behaviours were explored in relation COVID-related anxiety in the same population. Overall, the results showed that automatic affective responses as measured by interference effects on the EST, remained unaffected during the pandemic. However, non-automatic affective responses to COVID-related images measured by the IRT, indicated that participants rated these images as more fearful sadder and higher in anger, compared to non-COVID negative images matched for arousal and negativity and this was more evident in people with high COVID-anxiety. Trait anxiety was related to higher levels of loneliness, more prosocial behaviour and higher intentions to help others, while COVID-related anxiety mediated these effects, suggesting that for high levels of trait anxiety, participants were more likely to have helped someone in need during the pandemic when their COVID-anxiety levels were low.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.08.031","20211201","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-23","",18214,""
