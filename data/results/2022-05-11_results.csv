"104 Million Children Affected by COVID-19-associated Orphanhood and Caregiver Death: An Imperative for Action","The new WHO estimates for COVID-19 excess deaths allow us to generate supdated and more accurate models of COVID-19 associated orphanhood and caregiver loss. Using methodology established in prior studies, we combine age-specific fertility and excess death estimates from January 2020 to May 2022. We find 10.4 million children have lost a parent or caregiver due to COVID-associated excess deaths, and 7.5 million children have experienced COVID-associated orphanhood. Without supportive intervention, caregiver loss can bring severe risks of poverty, school dropout, sexual exploitation, and mental health distress. It is essential that evidence-based care for these children is integrated into all national response plans as a caring action to protect children from immediate and long-term harms of COVID-19.","Susan Hillis; Joel-Pascal Ntwali N'konzi; William Msemburi; Lucie Cluver; Andres Villaveces; Seth Flaxman; H Juliette T Unwin","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.05.08.22274788","20220510","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-11","",31145,""
"Biopsychosocial response to the COVID-19 lockdown in people with major depressive disorder and multiple sclerosis","Background: Changes in lifestyle, finances and work status during COVID-19 lockdowns may have led to biopsychosocial changes in people with pre-existing vulnerabilities such as Major Depressive Disorders (MDD) and Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Methods: Data were collected as a part of the RADAR-CNS (Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse Central Nervous System) programme. We analyzed the following data from long-term participants in a decentralized multinational study: symptoms of depression, heart rate (HR) during the day and night; social activity; sedentary state, steps and physical activity of varying intensity. Linear mixed-effects regression analyses with repeated measures were fitted to assess the changes among three time periods (pre, during and post-lockdown) across the groups, adjusting for depression severity before the pandemic and gender. Results. Participants with MDD (N=255) and MS (N=214) were included in the analyses. Overall, depressive symptoms remained stable across the three periods in both groups. Lower mean HR and HR variation were observed between pre and during lockdown during the day for MDD and during the night for MS. HR variation during rest periods also decreased between pre-and post-lockdown in both clinical conditions. We observed a reduction of physical activity for MDD and MS upon the introduction of lockdowns. The group with MDD exhibited a net increase in social interaction via social network apps over the three periods. Conclusions: Behavioral response to the lockdown measured by social activity, physical activity and HR may reflect changes in stress in people with MDD and MS.","Sara Siddi; Iago Gine Vazquez; Raquel Bailon; Faith Matcham; Femke Lamers; Spyridon Kontaxis; Estela Laporta Puyal; Esther Garcia; Belen Arranz; Gloria Dallacosta; Anna Isabel Guerrero Perez; Anna Zabalza; Mathias Buron; Giancarlo Comi; Letizia Leocani; Peter Annas; Matthew Hotopf; Brenda Penninx; Melinda Magyari; Per Sorensen; Xavier Montalban; Grace Lavalle; Alina Ivan; Carolin Oetzmann; Katie White; Sonia Difrancesco; Patrick Locatelli; Jordi Aguilo; Vaibhav Narayan; Amos Folarin; Richard Dobson; Judith Anne Dineley; Daniel Leightley; Nicholas Cummins; Yarharth Ranjan; Zulqarnain Rashid; Aki Rintala; Giovanni De Girolamo; Antonio Preti; Sara Simblett; Til Wykes; Inez Myin-Germeys; Josep Maria Haro","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.05.10.22274890","20220510","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-11","",31146,""
"Mental-health before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in adults with neurodevelopmental disorders","The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted mental health globally. Individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), are at elevated risk of mental health difficulties. Therefore, we investigated the impact of the pandemic on anxiety, depression and mental wellbeing in adults with NDDs using longitudinal data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children study (n=3,058). Mental health data were collected pre-pandemic (age 21-25) and at three timepoints during the pandemic (ages 27-28) using the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire, Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment-7, and Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale. ADHD and ASD were defined using validated cut-points of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and Autism Spectrum Quotient, self-reported at age 25. We used multi-level mixed-effects models to investigate changes in mental health in those with ADHD and ASD compared to those without. Prevalences of depression, anxiety and poor mental wellbeing were higher at all timepoints (pre-pandemic and during pandemic) in those with ADHD and ASD compared to those without. Anxiety increased to a greater extent in those with ADHD ({beta}=0.8 [0.2,1.4], p=0.01) and ASD ({beta}=1.2 [-0.1,2.5], p=0.07), while depression symptoms decreased, particularly in females with ASD ({beta}=-3.1 [-4.6,-1.5], p=0.0001). On average, mental wellbeing decreased in all, but to a lesser extent in those with ADHD ({beta}=1.3 [0.2,2.5], p=0.03) and females with ASD ({beta}=3.0 [0.2,5.9], p=0.04). To conclude, anxiety disproportionately increased in adults with NDDs during the pandemic, however, the related lockdowns may have provided a protective environment for depressive symptoms in the same individuals.","Amy Shakeshaft; Rachel Blakey; Alex Siu Fung Kwong; Lucy Riglin; George Davey Smith; Evie Stergiakouli; Kate Tilling; Anita Thapar","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.05.09.22274714","20220510","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-11","",31147,""
"Have the COVID-19 Pandemic and Lockdown Affected Children's Mental Health in Long Term? A Repeated Cross-Sectional Study","Objective: The study aimed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms in children and adolescents. Design: Cross-sectional surveys were carried out on the mental health of children; one survey was conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic and one into the pandemic, 15 months after the implementation of lockdown, social distancing, and school closures. Demographic data and COVID-19 pandemic-related data were collected from specific parent-report and self-report questionnaires. Participants: Participants included children and adolescents between ages 6-16 years, attending a tertiary care hospital without any diagnosed major psychiatric disorder or chronic disorder. Analysis: Data was collected at two points (before the COVID-19 pandemic and during it) and compared. Levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms were compared and tested for statistically significant differences between these two points using appropriate statistical tests. Regression models were constructed to predict the factors affecting increased anxiety levels and depressive symptoms in the COVID-19 period. Results: 832 and 1255 children/adolescents were included in the study during the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 times, respectively. The median age of the participants was 10 years [Interquartile Range (IQR) = 4 years). The median (IQR) Spence Children's Anxiety Scale score was 24 (12) at the pre-COVID-19 point and 31 (13) during the COVID-19 pandemic (p<0.001, r=-0.27). 11% and 16% of children reported being depressed at these two-time points, respectively (p=0.004, {varphi}c=-0.063). Regression analysis showed that many factors, including the duration of smartphone use, female gender, and only child status, were associated with increased anxiety or depression levels. Conclusion: A large proportion of children had elevated anxiety and depressive symptoms during the pandemic relative to before the pandemic, suggesting a need for measures to engage children in healthy habits to protect children's mental health and continuous monitoring of children during such scenarios.","Manas Pustake; Sushant Mane; Mohammad Arfat Ganiyani; Sayan Mukherjee; Misba Sayed; Varada Mithbavkar; Zaid Memon; Abdus Samad Momin; Krishna Deshmukh; Ayush Chordia; Sabyasachi Parida; Ajit Bhagwat; Alan Johnson; Deepankar Varma; Sanket Warghade","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.05.10.22272976","20220510","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-11","",31148,""
"From inflammation to depression Mechanisms of action of natural products","Introduction: Depressive disorder is a complex illness and it is likely that alterations in several interacting systems underlie its pathogenesis [1, 2]. The inflammatory hypothesis emphasises the role of neuroimmunological dysfunctions. An IFN-a- induced raise of TNF-a and IL-6 can cause depressive symptoms, and even the microinflammation in the long COVID syndrome is often connected to depressive symptoms [3]. Therefore, it is necessary to re-evaluate the herbal treatment options for depression in terms of the mechanism of action. St. John's wort is very effective in depressive disorders and will therefore be evaluated for anti-inflammatory effects. Methods: A broad and systematic literature review was conducted [Medline, EMBASE] and the evidence was assessed. Results: St. John's wort extracts and a number of their constituents, especially flavonols and hyperforin, influence numerous inflammatory processes in vitro and in vivo, suggesting anti-inflammatory effects. This is also supported by recent data on the influence of phagocytic and migratory activity of microglial cells [5] or pituitary-derived AtT-20 cells in vitro [4]. Conclusions: The new data on potential mechanisms of action of St. John's wort extracts support its efficacy in depressive disorders, especially those with inflammatory etiology, and supports its use in these patients.","Mischer, N.; Kolb, C.; Kelber, O.; Nieber, K.","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00210-022-02205-7","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Archives of Pharmacology; 395(SUPPL 1):S10-S11, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-11","",31149,""
"Beyond clinical outcomes: using a disease-specific pilot survey to explore parent perceptions of wellbeing for children with short bowel syndrome","Background: Pediatric patients with short bowel syndrome (SBS) have complex medical needs that may impact their quality of life (QoL). Research has generally found children with SBS/intestinal failure (IF) to have impaired health-related QoL, but the mechanisms by which SBS shapes QoL for these patients remain unclear. Methods: A disease-specific mixed-methods pilot survey investigating wellbeing for children with SBS and their families was developed collaboratively by community stakeholders and clinicians and distributed via convenience sampling. The survey included fourteen diseasespecific items (e.g., PN, EN, toileting, eating, medical procedures), each scored on a 5-point Likert scale (1=no negative impact on child's wellbeing, 5=high negative impact on child's wellbeing);a not applicable option was additionally included for each item. Upon completion of the matrix, respondents were prompted to explain their response for each item scored with a 4 or 5 (indicating a high negative impact on child QoL). An option to describe any additional items perceived as negatively impacting their child's QoL was provided. Descriptive analyses of closed-and open-ended responses were conducted to investigate parent-perceived impact of disease-specific items on child wellbeing. Results: A total of 21 parents completed the survey. Items least frequently reported by parents as having a strong negative impact on their child's wellbeing were pain/discomfort or vomiting (23%) and utilization of PN (29%). Items related to absorption, including oral eating (33%), output-related issues (38%), and enteral feeds (41%), were more frequently reported by parents as strongly negatively impacting their child's wellbeing. Half of survey respondents (50%) perceived sleep or fatigue to have a strong negative impact. Items outside of the medical/physical domain were reported by 62% of parents as having a strong negative impact on their child's wellbeing: 39% of parents perceived their child's social life (independent of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic) to have suffered because of the condition;39% highlighted the impact of medical procedures on their child's mental health. Over half of respondents (53%) perceived two or fewer items to have a strong negative impact on their child's overall wellbeing. An additional 29% of respondents perceived 3-6 items, while 19% reported 7 or more items as having a strong negative impact on their child's wellbeing. Qualitative analyses of open-ended responses revealed no additional SBS-related items were perceived by parents as negatively shaping child wellbeing, suggesting the survey reached thematic saturation. Conclusion: These exploratory data provide insights into the parent-perceived factors shaping wellbeing for children with SBS. Better understanding how- and to what extent- these factors impact child QoL longitudinally is central to providing whole-person, patient-centered care. The conceptualization of overall wellbeing as a measurable outcome may provide members of the care team with important information to consider along with clinical factors and offer opportunities to discuss goals of care with children and their families. Future research should investigate the validity and reliability of a disease-specific child QoL measure.","Neumann, M.; Allen, J.; Kakani, S.; Ladner, A.; Rauen, M.; Weaver, M.; Mercer, D.","https://doi.org/10.1002/jpen.2345","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition; 46(SUPPL 1):S198, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-11","",31150,""
"Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Adult and Pediatric Home Enteral Nutrition Recipients","Background: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has had a devastating impact on the world leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Additionally, COVID-19 pandemic has impacted healthcare significantly as social distancing, school and business closures, and hospital systems at or above capacity have led to delayed care and more frequent use of telehealth. The current questionnaire was designed to evaluate the prevalence of COVID-19 among patients receiving home enteral nutrition (HEN) and the impact of the ongoing pandemic on them. Methods:We invited patients and caregivers of patients receiving HEN through several HEN providers and the Oley foundation to respond to a questionnaire about COVID-19 pandemic and their nutrition therapy between January 16th, 2020 and July 16th, 2021. In addition to basic demographic information, the questionnaire consisted of 6 main questions which logically branched with positive responses to question specific definitions. Authorized caregivers/parents/guardians were allowed to answer on behalf of patients they care for. Adults were defined as = 18 years of age. Results: A total of 884 completed all questions and are included in analysis. Of these, 566 (64%) were children (mean age 5.3 Â± 4.7 years;99.1% answered by caregivers;97.1% from North America), and 318 (36%) were adults (mean age 43.1 Â± 19.4 years;35.2% answered by caregivers, 97.7% from North America). In children, only 9 (1.6%) patients reported being diagnosed with COVID-19 and of whom 2 (22.2%) required hospitalization. On the other hand, in adults, 11 (3.4%) patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, of whom 4 (36.4%) were hospitalized. Despite very low infection rate, hospitalization rate appeared to be high. In our study, COVID-19 infections were significantly higher in adults compared to pediatric population (p-value=0.045). Fever was most prevalent presenting symptom (66.6% of children and 81.8% of adults diagnosed with COVID-19). Moreover, COVID-19 pandemic appeared to have had significant impact on patients receiving HEN. Delays in healthcare and receiving supplies were reported by (50.8%) and (27.8%) in pediatric group. Furthermore, in children, worsening in general health was reported by (8.6%) and worsening in metal health was reported by (10%) of patients. Similar considerable impact was reported by adults: delay in healthcare (51.4%), delays in receiving supplies (33.9%), worsening in general health (26.3%), and worsening in metal health (31.9%) (Figure 1). On details of delays in healthcare related to COVID-19 pandemic, most frequently reported problem in children group was cancellation of provider visits (40.2%) followed by delay in obtaining diagnostic tests (39.2%) whereas in adults most frequently reported delay was in obtaining diagnostic tests (51.4%) followed by obtaining labs or blood work (40.8%). In those who experienced delay in receiving supplies in adults and pediatric population, difficulty in obtaining feeding supplies was the most frequently reported delay (68.1% in children, and 80.5% in adults) (Table 1). Conclusion: Despite low rate of infection with SARS-CoV-2 among patients receiving HEN, hospitalization rate appears to be high. Additionally, COVID-19 pandemic has had significant impact on adults and children receiving HEN including causing delays in healthcare and delivery of HEN supplies as well as overall worsening in general and mental health.","Elfadil, O.

"EFFECTS OF MUSIC REGULATION ON PATIENTS WITH ANXIETY DISORDERS","Background: By the end of 2021, the COVID-19 outbreak has led to an increase of 90 million patients with anxiety disorders worldwide, which has had a significant adverse impact on human mental health. Music Therapy is a treatment method that utilizes the huge influence of music on emotions, changes people's emotions through music, and finally achieves the purpose of psychological healing. This study starts with Music Therapy and selects patients with anxiety disorders from a hospital in Hebei Province, China as subjects to explore the therapeutic effect of Music Therapy on patients with anxiety disorders. Subjects and Methods: The S-AI and TAI scores of the subjects were tested before treatment, after five weeks of treatment, and after ten weeks of treatment. And both the variable correlation analysis and t-test were carried out, using SPSS22.0 as the statistical tool. Results: The total STAI score of the experimental group was significantly higher than that of the control group after ten weeks of treatment (t = 164.102, P &lt; 0.001). After five weeks of treatment, the STAI score of the experimental group decreased significantly compared with that before treatment (t = 56.742, P &lt; 0.001). After ten weeks of treatment, the STAI score of the experimental group decreased significantly compared with that after five weeks of treatment (t = 71.155, P &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Music Therapy improves the patients' physical conditions such as sleep and energy, eating, movement and feeling. It is pain-free, low-cost, simple and easy to implement. Furthermore, it can also improve patients' interpersonal skills, work and study efficiency, as well as leisure and entertainment life satisfaction. It is worthy of promotion in the treatment of patients with generalized anxiety disorders.","Zhao, J.

"Thinking about the future after the pandemic: The mediating role of courage in the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and pessimism","Among the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic is fear. This emotion is linked to negative consequences: thinking about one's working future has become difficult. However, courage can support students in planning their careers. The present study was divided into two phases. In the first, we investigated, through qualitative research, how university students imagine their future. In the second phase, we hypothesized that courage could mediate in the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and pessimism. The participants were 209 university students aged between 19 and 24 (M = 20.99;SD = 1.39). The results confirmed the hypotheses and showed that students' concerns are more related to social relationships.

"An overview of the physical, psychological, and social responses of adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic in urban area","The COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on all sectors of life in all age groups, including teenagers. The physical and psychological responses on adolescents due to the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be explained yet. This study aims to explain the physical and psychological responses of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescents. This research method was descriptive with a survey approach. The survey was conducted on 219 teenagers in the West Surabaya area. Respondents filled out questionnaires about physical responses (weight, height and use of minus glasses), psychological responses (anxiety, stress and depression), and social responses (social interactions). DASS was used to measure the psychological response. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and Wilcoxon sign rank test to measure body weight before and during pandemic COVID-19. The physical responses that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic were an increase in the respondent's weight and the use of glasses due to the online school process. The social response that occurs is adolescent social interaction at a sufficient level. Psychological responses showed stress 57%, anxiety 68.9%, and depression 63.9%;only 7.8% teenagers have good social interaction. The responses of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescents can be seen physically, socially and psychologically. Efforts are needed to overcome and anticipate problems resulting from these changes.","Zahroh, C.; Nurjanah, S.; Kamariyah, N.; Ainiyah, N.; Machmudah, Khamida, Hasina, S.

"The Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Penetrating Neurotrauma at a Level 1 Trauma Center","INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic forced the implementation of social distancing guidelines to minimize spread of the coronavirus. However, it is not yet understood what effects these precautions had on the rates of penetrating neurotrauma. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed neurotrauma data from our institutional trauma registry from distinct periods defined as pre-COVID-19 (March 2019-September 2019) and COVID-19 (March 2020-September 2020). Demographics, injury characteristics, mechanisms of trauma, and past medical history (including psychiatric diagnosis) were collected. Data were analyzed for between-group differences and presented as odds ratios. RESULTS: We observed a significant rise in the number of neurotrauma cases in 2020 (558 vs. 630, OR 1.129 [1.0071, 1.2657]). There was a decrease in the proportion of male victims (71.3% vs. 68.6%, p = 0.03). There were significant differences noted in the mechanism of injury between groups. Patients in 2020 were less likely to present with falls (42.3% vs. 34.3%, OR 0.7119 [0.5627, 0.9005]) and more likely to present with GSW (4.48% vs. 7.78%, OR 1.7981 [1.0951, 2.9523]). Of the patients with penetrating cranial injuries, the most common motive was assault (56.7% vs. 60.0%), followed by self-inflicted (13.3% vs. 20.0%) and accidental (20.0% vs. 18.3%) with a significant difference between years (p = 0.0043). The presence of comorbid psychiatric illness or substance abuse did not confer an increased odds of presenting with penetrating injuries. No significant differences were noted in mean arrival or discharge GCS or injury severity as measured by ISS. However we did observe significant increases in patients presenting with bilaterally reactive pupils (48.3% vs 59.3%, p = 0.0025), patients discharged home (27.6% vs 37.3%, p = 0.0002), and survival at 6 months (41.4% vs. 54.2%, p = 0.0188). CONCLUSION: We observed a higher rate of penetrating neurotrauma while social distancing measures were in place. It is unclear if the psychosocial effects of quarantine and social distancing had a causative relationship with the increased rates of assault and self-inflicted penetrating injuries.","Yang, G.

"The effect of layoffs on the performance of survivors at healthcare organizations","For years, workers of an organization have strived to strengthen it and expand it with fresh concepts and strategies to accomplish new objectives. The layoff is, by definition, a spontaneous release from an institution, i.e. a compulsory resignation for certain purposes of employee categories, of permanent or temporary personnel (economic reasons, downsizing personal management). Outsourcing is a way of reducing costs and changing fixed costs to varying expenses for companies. It transfers work or researches to outside households, which lead to job losses. Finishing is a major business challenge, forced disconnected jobs and survivors. This sudden dismantling was triggered by the economic depression, which increased with corruption by governments. The COVID-19 spread around the world is further overcome day by day. When the layoff is mass, companies may notify the workers of the reasons for the reduction. Some hospitals issued departed personnel a warning for clarifying things and preparing the workers even though they could do serious harm. This form of warning illustrates a pandemic COVID-19 by delivering unemployment until layoffs explain the financial downturn for workers. Certain hospitals and organizations offer warning without consideration about the discharged workers on the same day. Moreover, this existed in tiny clinics, where there were not very significant layoffs. Substantial government institutions, including A.U.B.M.C., B.M.G. and other hospitals, prefer cuts as a remedy.

"BRAIN HEALTH, ONE HEALTH, COVID-19 AND OUR COLLECTIVE FUTURE","Objective: Brain health is fundamental to all health. Within the context of brain health and the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, it is vitally important for us as a medical community and as a species to reflect deeply upon our role in these increasingly frequent events and about what we can do to avoid them in the future. Results: The COVID-19 crisis has thus far affected over 350 million people in 226 countries and regions, resulting in over 5.6 million deaths and substantial acute and subacute brain morbidity in many forms with the potential for producing long-term neurological impairment in a high percentage of survivors. The crisis has also provided us with another fundamental determinant of brain health and overall health-the interconnectedness of all life-other humans, nonhumans and the earth. Conclusion: To mitigate the considerable increase in worldwide risk of lethal zoonotic diseases that impact negatively upon brain health, we need to discontinue live-wildlife markets and factory farming, two activities which are among the most threatening to human health and among the most debasing to our species. For the sake of humans, non-humans and the earth, there is a fundamental and urgent need for us to evolve toward eating forms of protein that are safer for humans, including abundant traditional plant-derived food sources as well as the more recently developed plant-based meat/dairy/egg alternatives and cultured meat (produced by culturing animal cells). And we need to advance our governance structures so that they are neither rewarding activities that are destructive to the planet nor heavily prioritizing economic governance over health and environmental governance. A One Health approach should be the new norm across the various sectors as we invent and implement equitable economic systems that have human, animal and environmental health at their cores.","Wiebers, D.; Feigin, V.; Winkler, A.

"The Greater Middle East Covid-19 Crisis Management: Challenges and Opportunities","The outbreak of the coronavirus (Covid-19) crisis in early 2020 took the whole world by surprise. The world witnessed its horrific spread in Italy, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Brazil in utter disbelief and helplessness. The Greater Middle East (GME) region too faced the pandemic-induced misfortune in no small measure. Governments and non-governmental organizations scrambled to articulate a response equivalent to the challenges. While the crisis clearly posed an unprecedented set of challenges in human history, it did provide some opportunities as well. If nothing else, the crisis brought home the importance of pandemicpreparedness, biosecurity, health security, food security, social cohesion, public compliance, and regional and international cooperation as succinctly as possible. While a few countries in the GME region did succeed in stepping up to the challenge in the early six months of the crisis well into the end of 2021, a few others fell considerably short in their response and are still struggling to provide even basic anti-virus measures. This article provides a general overview of the GME's response to the Covid-19 pandemic and highlights some of the major challenges faced by the states and society in the region and the opportunities thereof.

"RESEARCH ON GENERALIZED ANXIETY IN THE CONTEXT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC-TAKING IDEOLOGICAL AND POLITICAL EDUCATORS AS AN EXAMPLE","Background: Affected by the rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, teachers have experienced extremely general anxiety or depression. This article takes ideological and political educators as an example to study the generalized anxiety problem in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic from a demographic perspective. The influencing factors are analyzed and mitigation strategies are proposed accordingly. Subjects and methods: A total of 231 ideological and political educators from different colleges or middle schools in Anhui Province of China were selected and the survey was carried out through online questionnaires. Using SPSS 26.0 as the tool, the Chi-square test and cross-analysis were conducted to study the influencing factors of anxiety of ideological and political educators. Results: The age factor was significantly correlated with anxiety at the 0.001 level (chi(2) = 33.067, P &lt; 0.001). The gender factor was significantly correlated with anxiety at the 0.01 level (chi(2) = 11.591, P &lt; 0.01). The highest educational level was associated with anxiety at the 0.01 level. There was a significant correlation at the 0.001 level (chi(2) = 22.653, P &lt; 0.001). There was a significant correlation between physical health and anxiety at the 0.001 level (chi(2) = 22.653, P &lt; 0.001). The degree of attention to the pandemic also significantly affected the level of individual anxiety (chi(2) = 46.430, P &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: This study conducted a survey analysis of 231 ideological and political educators in different universities or middle schools in Anhui Province of China. The results show that factors such as age, gender, highest education, health, and attention to the pandemic will all affect the anxiety level of individuals. Therefore, educators should combine their own conditions and determine whether professional psychological counseling is needed according to the severity of anxiety.","Men, Y.","https://www.google.com/search?q=RESEARCH+ON+GENERALIZED+ANXIETY+IN+THE+CONTEXT+OF+THE+COVID-19+PANDEMIC-TAKING+IDEOLOGICAL+AND+POLITICAL+EDUCATORS+AS+AN+EXAMPLE","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychiatria Danubina; 34:S956-S961, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-11","",31164,""

Many (35%) were worried as if something terrible was going to happen, but 'not too severely,' while 33 percent felt frightened 'a bit' as if something terrible was about to happen, but it did not bother them. Many people (38 percent) had anxious thoughts from time to time, while others (24 percent) had them all the time. Only 41% said they sat at ease and felt calm ""generally,"" while others said they didn't sit at ease and felt relaxed ""very frequently"" (33 percent). More than half of the students (55%) reported not being afraid or having a 'butterfly' feeling in their stomach, whereas many others (24%) had that scared emotion 'sometimes.' Only 15% of the participants reported being restless and on the move. In terms of experiencing a sudden sense of panic attacks, just a small percentage (9%) reported having had this 'often' or 'very frequently' (20 percent). When asked if they still enjoyed the things they used to appreciate, just 36% said they didn't enjoy them as much anymore. Only half of the students (50%) said they could laugh and see the funny side of things ""as much as they always could."" A fresh look at the participants' emotions indicated that just 47 percent of them felt joyful'sometimes,' while others felt cheery 'not often/not at all' (24 percent, 14 percent respectively).

"A New Prescription for the Opioid Epidemic: 360-Degree Accountability for Pharmaceutical Companies and Their Executives","We can no longer ignore this-a national crisis resulting in almost one million American deaths, costing hundreds of millions of dollars, ravaging the health care system, and devastating state and local communities. This narrative describes the COVID-19 pandemic and something else: the epidemic of opioid addiction and abuse. In the last twenty years, the opioid epidemic claimed the lives of more than 700,000 people at the cost of more than 500 billion dollars to the economy. The COVID-19 pandemic has made the opioid epidemic worse, causing a staggering increase in opioid-related overdose deaths. Even now, on average, 140 people die every day from an opioid overdose, making it a leading cause of injury-related death in the United States. And 70% of those deaths involve a prescription opioid. There is a growing sense that those responsible for the opioid epidemic, specifically drug companies and their executives, have escaped responsibility for their dangerous and deceptive practices in manufacturing and marketing opioids. Although they have confronted civil lawsuits, the pharmaceutical industry has faced virtually no criminal scrutiny;only a couple of companies and executives have ever been criminally charged for the devastation that opioids have caused. This raises questions: Given the increasing number of opioid overdose deaths nationally, why are charges and convictions of drug companies and their executives so rare? And why have existing legal mechanisms not worked to punish the improper manufacturing and marketing practices and curb the epidemic? Their misconduct continues because no single federal law exists to prosecute pharmaceutical companies and their executives for causing the epidemic. And existing laws are ineffective;they fail to criminalize the type of conduct that caused the epidemic, contain elements prohibitively difficult to prove, or impose minimal penalties that fail to deter bad actors. Thus, the drug industry has persisted in dubious practices unfettered by civil litigation, government enforcement actions, and fines. This Article seeks to examine these issues and others. It is the first in legal scholarship to offer a concrete and omnibus solution grounded in federal law to address the pharmaceutical industry's misconduct. The novel 360-degree solution proposed here the""Controlled Substance Manufacturing and Marketing Accountability Act""-will deter and punish those pharmaceutical companies and their executives who provided misleading information to government regulators and used deceptive practices in marketing opioids to the public. It also recognizes that when properly prescribed, these drugs provide essential relief for pain and suffering. Thus, this Proposal seeks to address prior misconduct and point the way forward to avoid the next drug epidemic.","Delfino, R.

Materials and Methods: This is a systematic review of studies related to the effects of COVID-19 pandemic and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) on eachother, and its impact on provision of related healthcare services for NCDs, carried out in 2021 by defining search keywords and database including PubMed / MEDLINE <U+060C>ISI / Web of Sciences (WOS) and Scopus. Results: 625 articles were found in the first search, that 98 duplicate onees were removed. Following a review of the article titles, 216 studies were removed as well. The s of the articles were then reviewed, and 139 items were removed too. Finally, the study included 81 articles that met the previously mentioned criteria. The studies' findings were divided into seven groups: increased disease severity, decreased referrals to medical centers, decreased care delivery, increased anxiety and depression, decreased diagnosis of diseases, reduced elective surgeries, and strategies used to provide services to patients. Conclusion: A review of country policies and experiences and the loss of thousands of human resources in the field of health during the Covid-19 pandemic crisis showed that country governance systems should prioritize capacity building and updating action plans to deal with similar crises. In the meantime, a resilient national program for the prevention and effective fight against NCDs, as the most important cause of death of citizens that is also preventable, and its uninterrupted implementation during crises of the health system is of fundamental importance.","Bakhtiari, A.; Takian, A.; Behzadifar, M.; Hosseinpour, F.; Mostafavi, H.","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+COVID-19+Pandemic+and+Noncommunicable+Disease+Service+Delivery:+an+Overview+of+Global+Experiences","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Scientific Journal of Kurdistan University of Medical Sciences; 26(5):98-118, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-11","",31171,""
"An Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on The Motivation and Psychological Well Being of Dermatology Residents","Objective: To analyze the motivation and psychological well-being to perform duties during the COVID-19 pandemic among the dermatology residents. Study Design: Cross-sectional survey. Place and Duration of Study: Dermatology Department, Combined Military Hospital, Rawalpindi, from Mar to Sep 2020. Methodology: A total of 155 dermatology residents were included in the study. Health care provider motivation scale (HCPMS) was used through online Google Doc due to lockdown. Secondary data was also generated from Google scholar, newspapers, journals, reports and the literature review. Results: We analyzed the impact of COVID-19 on motivation and psychological well-being. The result showed that the COVID-19 pandemic has an adverse effect on motivation due to anxiety (31%), stress (23%) and depression (27%) among dermatology residents. There was statistically significant relationship between decreased motivation and increased stress levels and depression among dermatology residents performing COVID-19 duties (p&lt;0.001).

"Counselling needs in professional and non-professional students","Physical health as well as mental health, both plays a very key role in one's wellbeing. Due to this ongoing pandemic situation, both physical and mental health is at stake, and one need to be very careful. It is very much evident that students from school or colleges need counselling related to various issues. But it is also observed that, students are still hesitant to contact the counsellors for help and, there is a gap in counselling services. This paper studied the need for counselling among college students. This research study accessed 216 students from professional & non-professional students. Data was collected through online questionnaire. The study focused on the need of counselling in students for Personal, Academic, Career & Psychological issues. Result of this study showed that students from professional and non-professional courses experience equal need for academic-career & psychological needs whereas students from non-professional courses shows significantly higher need for personal counselling.","Amruta, Bhuskute, Chib, S.; Ragini, Patil, Surbhi, Maita","https://www.google.com/search?q=Counselling+needs+in+professional+and+non-professional+students","","Database: GIM; Publication type: article; Publication details: Natural Volatiles & Essential Oils; 8(5):1415-1421, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-11","",31173,""
"PHYSICIANS AND THE GIG ECONOMY","Because a two-week quarantine is recommended for those who have been infected with COVID-19, telemedicine tools give physicians the opportunity to check on patients to ensure they are recovering without additional health concerns or complications. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, 75 percent of medical school students in the class of 2018 graduated with an average loan debt of $196,520, which included debt from medical school, undergraduate studies, and other higher education expenses.4 With a $197,000 student loan balance, a young doctor on average would owe $2,212 a month on the standard, 10-year federal repayment plan, (assuming a 6.25 percent average interest rate). While the benefits for patients were outside the scope of our report, other studies have shown that patients benefit from more flexible access to physicians via telemedicine, especially for routine medical questions and checkups, mental health care, and post-natal care. With the increased use of telemedicine tools, patients get ""on-demand"" access to care, which means that parents with a question about their infant can conveniently connect with their physician, as can a full-time professional who must fit mental health care around a busy work schedule.","Alperin, Peter M.

"Neglected tropical diseases: impact of COVID-19 and WHO's response - 2021 update","This article is a 2021 update on the WHO report on the impact of COVID-19 on neglected tropical diseases (NTD) and the response appropriated by the WHO. In January 2021, and after almost 2 years of wide-ranging consultations, WHO launched the new NTD roadmap for 2021-2030 that provides a framework and actions to drive progress towards a world free of NTDs, contributing during this decade to the attainment of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals through: fundamental shifts that put countries, communities and people at the centre of the agenda;supportive cross-sectoral actions, such as health, education, nutrition, water, sanitation, and hygiene and;sustaining and accelerating progress towards the 2030 goals. Furthermore, the roadmap provides opportunities to evaluate, assess, and adjust programmatic actions, as and when needed, over the next decade by setting clear targets and milestones. Another distinct feature of this roadmap is to drive greater ownership by national and local governments, including communities. The overarching 2030 global targets are to: (1) reduce by 90% the number of people requiring interventions against NTDs;(2) have at least 100 countries having eliminated at least one NTD;(3) eradicate 2 diseases (dracunculiasis and yaws) and;(4) reduce by 75% the DALYs related to NTDs. The roadmap will enable future measuring of progress towards eradication, elimination and control of the 20 NTDs by tracking disease-specific targets. Additionally, the roadmap includes 10 cross-cutting targets relevant to progress in the areas of integration, multisectoral coordination, universal health coverage, and country ownership. Examples include a reduction by more than 75% in the number of deaths from vector-borne NTDs such as dengue and leishmaniasis;100% access to basic water supply, sanitation, and hygiene in areas endemic for NTDs;75% integrated treatment coverage index for preventive chemotherapy;90% countries including NTDs in their package of essential services, and 90% countries collecting and reporting NTD data disaggregated by gender.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Neglected+tropical+diseases:+impact+of+COVID-19+and+WHO's+response+-+2021+update","","Database: CAB Abstracts; Publication type: article; Publication details: Weekly Epidemiological Record; 96(38):461-462, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-11","",31176,""
"Isolation of Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp from free-ranging wild animals","Increasing interactions between humans, domestic animals and wildlife may result in inter-species transmission of infectious agents. To evaluate the presence of pathogenic E. coli and Salmonella spp. and to test the antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates, rectal swabs from 36 different free-ranging wild mammals were taken from two distinct natural sites in Brazil: Cantareira State Park (CSP, state of SÃ£o Paulo) and Santa Isabel do Rio Negro Region (SIRNR, state of Amazonas). The swabs were randomly collected and processed for bacterial isolation, identification, characterization and antimicrobial resistance. Eighteen E. coli strains from CSP and 20 from SIRNR were recovered from 14 and 22 individuals, respectively. Strains from animals captured in CSP, the site with the greatest anthropization, exhibited a higher range and percentage of virulence genes, including an eae+/bfpA+ strain. Antimicrobial resistance was verified in strains originating from both sites; however, in strains from SIRNR, aminopenicillins were almost the exclusive antimicrobial class to which strains exhibited resistance, whereas in CSP there were strains resistant to cephalosporins, sulfonamide, aminoglycoside, tetracycline and fluoroquinolone, in addition to strains exhibiting multidrug resistance. Two strains of Salmonella enterica that are known to be associated with reptiles, serotypes Belem and 60:r:e,n,z15, were recovered only from Amazonian animals and showed susceptibility to all classes of antimicrobials that were tested. Although the potential impact of these pathogens on wildlife remains unknown, bacteria isolated from free-ranging wild animals may provide relevant information about environmental health and should therefore be more deeply studied.(AU)","Iovine, Renata de Oliveira; Dejuste, Catia; Miranda, FlÃ¡via; Filoni, Claudia; Bueno, Marina GalvÃ£o; Carvalho, Vania Maria de","http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1517-83822015000401257","","Database: VETINDEX; VETINDEX; Publication type: article; Publication details: Braz.

"The CLASS Study (Circadian Light in Adolescence, Sleep and School): protocol for a prospective, longitudinal cohort to assess sleep, light, circadian timing and academic performance in adolescence","During adolescence, sleep and circadian timing shift later, contributing to restricted sleep duration and irregular sleep-wake patterns. The association of these developmental changes in sleep and circadian timing with cognitive functioning, and consequently academic outcomes, has not been examined prospectively. The role of ambient light exposure in these developmental changes is also not well understood. Here, we describe the protocol for the Circadian Light in Adolescence, Sleep and School (CLASS) Study that will use a longitudinal design to examine the associations of sleep-wake timing, circadian timing and light exposure with academic performance and sleepiness during a critical stage of development. We also describe protocol adaptations to enable remote data collection when required during the COVID-19 pandemic. Approximately 220 healthy adolescents aged 12-13 years (school Year 7) will be recruited from the general community in Melbourne, Australia. Participants will be monitored at five 6 monthly time points over 2 years. Sleep and light exposure will be assessed for 2 weeks during the school term, every 6 months, along with self-report questionnaires of daytime sleepiness. Circadian phase will be measured via dim light melatonin onset once each year. Academic performance will be measured via national standardised testing (National Assessment Program-Literacy and Numeracy) and the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test-Australian and New Zealand Standardised Third Edition in school Years 7 and 9. Secondary outcomes, including symptoms of depression, anxiety and sleep disorders, will be measured via questionnaires. The CLASS Study will enable a comprehensive longitudinal assessment of changes in sleep-wake timing, circadian phase, light exposure and academic performance across a key developmental stage in adolescence. Findings may inform policies and intervention strategies for secondary school-aged adolescents. Ethical approval was obtained by the Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee and the Victorian Department of Education. Dissemination plans include scientific publications, scientific conferences, via stakeholders including schools and media.

"LGBTQ Identity-Related Victimization During COVID-19 Is Associated with Moderate to Severe Psychological Distress Among Young Adults","<b><i>Purpose:</i></b> Existing evidence indicates significant threats against the mental health of sexual and gender minority (SGM) young adults as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including elevated rates of substance use, anxiety, depression, and traumatic stress. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the mechanistic identity-related factors that may influence the mental health needs of SGM young adults in the time of COVID-19. This study aims to examine the impact of increases in lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer or questioning (LGBTQ) identity-related victimization since the start of COVID-19 on psychological distress among SGM college students. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> A nonprobability, cross-sectional online survey was conducted between May and August 2020 to explore the psychological impacts of COVID-19 on U.S. SGM college students (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°565). Previously validated scales were used to measure LGBTQ identity-related victimization and psychological distress. Chi-square tests of independence, independent samples <i>T</i>-tests, and adjusted logistic regression were used to examine the study aim. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Adjusted logistic regression findings revealed that reporting past year+more frequent LGBTQ identity-related victimization since the start of COVID-19 (compared to no report) was associated with over four times greater odds of experiencing moderate to severe psychological distress. <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> Findings highlight the importance of research, practice, and policy stakeholders toward addressing the unique identity-related mental health needs and victimization experiences of SGM college students. Mental health, social service, and higher education practitioners have an important opportunity and responsibility toward identifying and intervening on SGM college students and young adults facing identity-related victimization amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Salerno, Boekeloo","https://doi.org/10.1089/lgbt.2021.0280","20220510","LGBTQ; college students; mental health; minority stress; victimization; young adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-11","",31180,""

"The role of maladaptive emotion regulation in the bidirectional relation between sleep and depression in college students during the COVID-19 pandemic","<b>Background:</b> Emotion regulation deficits are an outcome and risk factor for both insomnia and depression, suggesting that maladaptive emotion regulation might in part explain the bi-directional links between sleep and depression. The current study tests this hypothesis during the COVID-19 pandemic in emerging adult undergraduate students, a high-risk population for both depression and sleep disturbance.<b>Methods:</b> A sample of 154 undergraduate students completed a series of online questionnaires bi-weekly on sleep, depression, and emotion regulation strategies across eight weeks during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic (April 2nd to June 27th, 2020).<b>Results:</b> Sleep disturbance and depression prospectively predicted one another across eight weeks, and both directions were mediated by maladaptive emotion regulation. However, sleep and depression failed to predict change in one another controlling for baseline measures, directly or via emotion regulation.<b>Conclusions:</b> The results suggest that maladaptive emotion regulation is a potential mechanism through which sleep disturbance and depression help maintain high levels of one another in college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, emotion regulation deficits are potentially an important target for interventions to interrupt the sleep disturbance-depression cycle.","Niu, Snyder","https://doi.org/10.1080/10615806.2022.2073441","20220510","COVID-19; depression; emerging adults; maladaptive emotion regulation; sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-11","",31183,""
"Social Media and Online Digital Technology Use Among Muslim Young People and Parents: Qualitative Focus Group Study","Digital technology and social media use are common among young people in Australia and worldwide. Research suggests that young people have both positive and negative experiences online, but we know little about the experiences of Muslim communities. This study aims to explore the positive and negative experiences of digital technology and social media use among young people and parents from Muslim backgrounds in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. This study involved a partnership between researchers and a not-for-profit organization that work with culturally and linguistically diverse communities. We adopted a participatory and qualitative approach and designed the research in consultation with young people from Muslim backgrounds. Data were collected through in-person and online focus groups with 33 young people aged 16-22 years and 15 parents aged 40-57 years. Data were thematically analyzed. We generated 3 themes: (1) maintaining local and global connections, (2) a paradoxical space: identity, belonging and discrimination, and (3) the digital divide between young Muslims and parents. Results highlighted that social media was an important extension of social and cultural connections, particularly during COVID-19, when people were unable to connect through school or places of worship. Young participants perceived social media as a space where they could establish their identity and feel a sense of belonging. However, participants were also at risk of being exposed to discrimination and unrealistic standards of beauty and success. Although parents and young people shared some similar concerns, there was a large digital divide in online experiences. Both groups implemented strategies to reduce social media use, with young people believing that having short technology-free breaks during prayer and quality family time was beneficial for their mental well-being. Programs that address technology-related harms must acknowledge the benefits of social media for young Muslims across identity, belonging, representation, and social connection. Further research is required to understand how parents and young people can create environments that foster technology-free breaks to support mental well-being.","Douglass, Borthwick, Lim, Erbas, Eren, Higgs","https://doi.org/10.2196/36858","20220510","COVID-19; Muslim; adolescent; digital health; digital technology; diverse population; mental health; parent; parenting; pediatrics; psychological effect; qualitative research; social connection; social media; user experience; young adult; youth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-11","",31184,""
"COVID-19-related posttraumatic stress disorder in adults with lived experience of psychiatric disorder","Prevalence estimates of COVID-19-relatedÃ‚Â posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have ranged from 1% to over 60% in the general population. Individuals with lived experience of a psychiatric disorder may be particularly vulnerable to COVID-19-relatedÃ‚Â PTSD but this has received inadequate attention. Participants were 1571 adults with lived experience of psychiatric disorder who took part in a longitudinal study of mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. PTSD was assessed by the International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ) anchored to the participant's most troubling COVID-19-relatedÃ‚Â experiencevent. Factors hypothesised to be associated with traumatic stress symptoms were investigated by linear regression. 40.10% of participants perceived some aspect of the pandemic as traumatic. 5.28% reported an ICD-11 PTSD qualifying COVID-19 related traumatic exposure and 0.83% met criteria for probable ICD-11 COVID-19-related PTSD. Traumatic stress symptoms were associated with younger age, lower income, lower social support, and financial worries, and lived experience of PTSD/complex PTSD. Depression and anxiety measured in June 2020 predicted traumatic stress symptoms at follow-up approximately 20 weeks later in November 2020. We did not find evidence of widespread COVID-19-related PTSD among individuals with lived experience of a psychiatric disorder. There is a need for future research to derive valid prevalence estimates of COVID-19-relatedÃ‚Â PTSD.","Lewis, Lewis, Roberts, Evison, Edwards, John, Lloyd, Pearce, Poole, Richards, Robinson, Jones, Bisson","https://doi.org/10.1002/da.23262","20220510","COVID-19; ICD-11; PTSD; collective trauma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-11","",31185,""
"Conversation time and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic: A web-based cross-sectional survey of Japanese employees","During the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, social isolation and impaired social interaction could be the factors that cause mental health problems. This study investigated the association between conversation time in daily life and mental health among Japanese employees. In August 2021, a web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted with 1000Ã‚Â Japanese employees. Weekly conversation time was assessed in four domains (family members, friends, someone in the workplace, and others), and mental health was assessed using the Japanese version of the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K6Ã‚Â scale). Weekly total conversation time was calculated, and participants were assigned to one of the four conversation time categories based on quantile values to investigate the associations with poor mental health (K6Ã‚Â Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã‚Â 13). The logistic regression analyses revealed that participants with short conversation times (&lt;3.5Ã‚Â h per week) had poorer mental health compared to those with long conversation times (&gt;Ã‚Â 21.0Ã‚Â h per week), even after adjusting for confounders (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2.48 [95% CI 1.31-4.71]). For the exploratory analyses of conversation time for each domain, the associations of short conversation time in the workplace with poor mental health was most robust (ORÃ‚Â =2.02 [95% CI 1.13-3.63]).

"Social Rhythm Disruption is Associated with Greater Depressive Symptoms in People with Mood Disorders: Findings from a Multinational Online Survey During COVID-19","Societal restrictions imposed to prevent transmission of COVID-19 may challenge circadian-driven lifestyle behaviours, particularly amongst those vulnerable to mood disorders. The overarching aim of the present study was to investigate the hypothesis that, in the routine-disrupted environment of the COVID-19, amongst a sample of people living with mood disorders, greater social rhythm disruption would be associated with more severe mood symptoms. We conducted a two-wave, multinational survey of 997 participants <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>39.75</mml:mn><mml:mo>Ã‚Â±</mml:mo><mml:mn>13.39</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mspace/><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>81.6</mml:mn><mml:mtext>%</mml:mtext><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mspace/></mml:math> who self-reported a mood disorder diagnosis (i.e., major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder). Respondents completed questionnaires assessing demographics, social rhythmicity (The Brief Social Rhythm Scale), depression symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), sleep quality and diurnal preference (The Sleep, Circadian Rhythms and Mood questionnaire) and stressful life events during the COVID-19 pandemic (The Social Readjustment Rating Scale). The majority of participants indicated COVID-19-related social disruption had affected the regularity of their daily routines to at least some extent (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°788, 79.1%). As hypothesised, lower social rhythmicity was associated with greater depressive symptoms when tested cross-sectionally (standardised <i>ÃŽÂ²</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-.25, <i>t</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-7.94, <i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.000) and when tested using a 2-level hierarchical linear model across two time points (<i>b</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.14, <i>t</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-3.46, <i>df</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°264, <i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). These results are consistent with the social zeitgeber hypothesis proposing that mood disorders are sensitive to life events that disrupt social rhythms.","Kahawage, Bullock, Meyer, Gottlieb, Crowe, Swartz, Yatham, Inder, Porter, Nierenberg, Meesters, Gordijn, Haarman, Murray","https://doi.org/10.1177/07067437221097905","20220510","COVID-19; bipolar disorder; circadian rhythm; depression; mood disorders; social rhythms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-11","",31187,""
"""Burden that cannot be borne"": qualitative study of body dissatisfaction among women during the pandemic","Long-duration restrictions during the pandemic caused different effects on women's mental health in terms of eating behavior and negative body perception. This study was performed with the aim of determining opinions about body perceptions women during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was a qualitative study using the content analysis method. A total of 10 women, determined with the targeted sampling method (similar group), were interviewed who were young adults and adults. Research data were collected between July - August 2021 with an information form and semi-structured interview form. The content analysis method was used to analyze data to create themes. The women in the study were aged from 20-39Ã¢â‚¬â€°years and eight of the 10 women were married, and all had undergraduate degrees. The research revealed 3 main themes and 7 subthemes. The themes were determined as dissatisfaction (vicious circle, loss of the self-respect), burden that cannot be borne (complications, pressure from others) and restrictions (cage, self-care neglect, Necessity of support). During the pandemic, it was identified that the body dissatisfaction of women increased, in addition to emotional and physical burdens, they had difficulty coping with this situation and required psychological support to struggle with burdens they could not bear.","Ãƒâ€“zdil, KÃƒÂ¼ÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ¼k Ãƒâ€“ztÃƒÂ¼rk","https://doi.org/10.1080/03630242.2022.2072049","20220510","Body dissatisfaction; Qualitative study; pandemic; woman","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-11","",31188,""
"A comparison between healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers' anxiety, depression and PTSD during the initial COVID -19 lockdown","Several studies have found that Healthcare workers are vulnerable to mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, few studies have made comparisons of healthcare workers (HCWs) and non-HCWs. The current study aimed to compare mental health problems among HCWs with non-HCWs during the initial lockdown of COVID 19. A population-based cross-sectional survey. The survey was conducted by means of an open web link between April and May 2020. Data were collected by self-report. The PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) was used to assess posttraumatic stress. A total of 4527 citizens answered the questionnaire and 32.1% were HCWs. The majority were female, under 60 years of age, and lived in urban areas. Among the HCWs, the majority were registered nurses working in hospitals. The prevalence were 12.8% vs 19.1% for anxiety, 8.5% vs 14.5% for depression and 13.6% vs 20.9% for PTSD among HCWs and non-HCWs respectively. The highest prevalence's for anxiety and PTSD among HCWs were found for those under 40 years of age and having low education level (&lt;12 years). Mental health problems was significantly lower among HCWs compared to non-HCWs. However, the COVID-19 poses a challenge for HCWs, especially young HCWs and those with low level of education. Providing support, appropriate education, training, and authoritative information to the different members of the HCWs could be effective ways to minimize the psychological effect.","Schou-Bredal, Bonsaksen, Ekeberg, Skogstad, Grimholtg, Heir","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhip.2022.100267","20220510","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Healthcare workers; Mental health; PTSD; Pandemic; Survey","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-11","",31189,""

"Longitudinal study of changes observed in quality of life, psychological state cognition and pulmonary and functional capacity after COVID-19 infection: A six- to seven-month prospective cohort","To investigate the health-related quality of life (HRQoL), symptoms, psychological and cognitive state and pulmonary and physical function of nonhospitalised COVID-19 patients at long-term, and to identify factors to predict a poor HRQoL in this follow-up. Studies have focused on persistent symptoms of hospitalised COVID-19 patients in the medium term. Thus, long-term studies of nonhospitalised patients are urgently required. A longitudinal cohort study. In 102 nonhospitalised COVID-19 patients, we collected symptoms at 3Ã‚Â months (baseline) and at 6-7Ã‚Â months (follow-up) from diagnosis (dyspnoea, fatigue/muscle weakness and chest/joint pain), HRQoL, psychological state, cognitive function, pulmonary and physical function. This study adhered to the STROBE statement. HRQoL was impaired in almost 60% of the sample and remained impaired 6-7Ã‚Â months. At 3Ã‚Â months, more than 60% had impaired physical function (fatigue/muscle weakness and reduced leg and inspiratory muscle strength). About 40%-56% of the sample showed an altered psychological state (post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety/depression), cognitive function impairment and dyspnoea. At 6-7-months, only a slight improvement in dyspnoea and physical and cognitive function was observed, with a very high proportion of the sample (29%-55%) remained impaired. Impaired HRQoL at 6-7Ã‚Â months was predicted with 82.4% accuracy (86.7% sensitivity and 83.3% specificity) by the presence at 3Ã‚Â months of muscle fatigue/muscle weakness (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 5.7 (1.8-18.1)), PTSD (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 6.0 (1.7-20.7)) and impaired HRQoL (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 11.7 (3.7-36.8)). A high proportion of nonhospitalised patients with COVID-19 experience an impaired HRQoL, cognitive and psychological function at long-term. HRQoL, PTSD and dyspnoea at 3Ã‚Â months can identify the majority of patients with COVID-19 who will have impaired quality of life at long-term. Treatments aimed at improving psychological state and reducing the fatigue/muscle weakness of post-COVID-19 patients could be necessary to prevent the patients' HRQoL from being impaired at 6-7Ã‚Â months after their reported recovery.","Del Corral, Menor-RodrÃƒÂ­guez, FernÃƒÂ¡ndez-Vega, DÃƒÂ­az-Ramos, Aguilar-Zafra, LÃƒÂ³pez-de-Uralde-Villanueva","https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.16352","20220510","COVID-19; health-related quality of life; long-term; physical function; psychological status; pulmonary function","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-11","",31191,""
"Pediatric Intensive Care Unit Admissions After Adolescent Suicide Attempts During the Pandemic","The worldwide SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic challenges adolescents' mental health. The aim of this study was to compare the number of pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admissions after suicide attempts during the first German lockdown and one year later during a second, prolonged lockdown with pre-pandemic years. A retrospective multicenter study was conducted among 27 German PICUs. Cases &lt;18 years admitted to the PICU due to accidents or injuries between March 16th and May 31st of 2017-2021 were identified based on ICD-10 codes (German modification) and patient data entered into a database. This study is a subset analysis on suicide attempts in adolescents aged 12-17.9 years. The Federal Statistics Office was queried for data on fatal suicides, which were available only for 2020 in adolescents aged 10-17.9 years. Total admissions and suicide attempts declined during the first lockdown in 2020 (standardized morbidity ratio (SMR) 0.74 (95% CI 0.58-0.92) and 0.69 (0.43-1.04), respectively) and increased in 2021 (2.14 (SMR 1.86-2.45) and 2.84 (2.29-3.49), respectively). Fatal suicide rates remained stable between 2017-2019 and 2020 (1.57 v. 1.48/100,000 adolescent years) with monthly numbers showing no clear trend during the course of 2020. This study shows a strong increase in serious suicide attempts among adolescents during the course of the pandemic in Germany. More research is needed to understand the relation between pandemic prevention measures and suicidal ideation to help implement mental health support for adolescents.","Bruns, Willemsen, Stang, Kowall, Holtkamp, Kamp, Dudda, Hey, Hoffmann, Blankenburg, Eifinger, Fuchs, Haase, Baier, AndrÃƒÂ©e, Heldmann, Maldera, Potratz, Kurz, Mand, Doerfel, Rothoeft, Schultz, Ohlert, SilkenbÃƒÂ¤umer, Boesing, Indraswari, Niemann, Jahn, Merker, Braun, Brevis Nunez, Engler, Heimann, Brasche, Wolf, Freymann, Dercks, Hoppenz, Felderhoff-MÃƒÂ¼ser, Dohna-Schwake","https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2021-055973","20220510","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-11","",31192,""
"Mitigating COVID-19 Risk and Vaccine Hesitancy Among Underserved African American and Latinx Individuals with Mental Illness Through Mental Health Therapist-Facilitated Discussions","Underserved ethnic minorities with psychiatric disorders are at an increased risk of COVID-19. This study aims to examine the effectiveness of one-to-one counseling on COVID-19 vaccination and vaccination readiness among underserved African American and Latinx individuals with mental illnesses and adult caregivers of children with mental illness. Through an academic-community partnered collaboration, a multidisciplinary and culturally sensitive training on COVID-19 was co-developed and delivered to 68 therapists from January to March 2021. Mental health clients and their caregivers were recruited to participate in pre- and post-intervention surveys to evaluate the impact of the intervention on their perceptions of COVID-19 public health guidelines, testing, and vaccination. Mental health therapists delivered four lessons of the COVID-19 educational intervention with 254 clients from March to June 2021, when vaccine availability was widely available. Of those clients, we collected 180 baseline and 115 follow-up surveys. The main outcome was the uptake in COVID-19 vaccine. There was a positive shift in participant vaccine acceptance and receptivity. Pre-intervention survey shows that only 56% of adult clients and 48% of caregivers had indicated a likelihood of getting the vaccine for themselves at baseline. Post-intervention documented that more than 57% of each group had been vaccinated, with another 11-15% of the unvaccinated individuals reporting that they were somewhat or very likely to get the vaccine. This study demonstrated that multidisciplinary academic-community and theoretical-based educational intervention delivered by mental health therapists is an effective strategy in increasing COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and reducing the negative impact and disruption that COVID-19 caused in the daily life of mental health patients and caregivers.","Venegas-Murillo, Bazargan, Grace, Cobb, Vargas, Givens, Li-Sarain, Delgado, Villatoro, Goodall, Tesimale, Ramirez, Brown, Uyanne, Assari","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40615-022-01321-7","20220509","COVID; Intervention; Mental health; Psychiatry; Vaccine hesitancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-11","",31193,""

"The time divide: Reducing the barrier of a lack of spare time increased physical activity levels during the UK Government-enforced COVID-19 lockdown","Background & Objective: Many individuals do not meet the World Health Organisation (2010) recommendations of 150 minutes of physical activity a week, often citing a lack of time as a key reason. The UK government-mandated lockdown for the global SARS-CoV-2 virus (COVID-19) pandemic provided an opportunity to investigate whether a potential increase in available time would lead to increased activity levels, and whether an increase in activity would correlate with improvements in mental health. Methods: An online survey investigated physical activity levels (time and intensity) at three separate intervals within one calendar year: firstly, for a typical week before the government-mandated lockdown; secondly, a week during lockdown (including measures of mental wellbeing); and finally in August 2020 - which re-assessed physical activity levels and mental wellbeing after the easing of some lockdown restrictions. Results: Whilst participants reported spending more time engaging in physical activity during lockdown compared to before (with those who perceived themselves to have more spare time reporting a greater increase than those who did not), there was no difference in the intensity of this activity. Additionally, there was a significant positive correlation between physical activity levels and mental wellbeing during the initial period of lockdown. Conclusions: Overall, the study demonstrated that, as hypothesised by the COM-B model, reducing one of the most commonly reported barriers (time) did increase physical activity levels. Importantly, it also showed that those who engaged in more physical activity also reported better mental health, which is particularly striking given the likely overall detrimental effect of being in lockdown.","Samuel Warne et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E00CD-51C-104","20220511","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sport Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; spare time; lockdown; covid-19; physical activity; behaviour change; mental wellbeing","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-11","",31195,""
"Dismissed and newly planned babies during the COVID-19 pandemic A study of the motivations behind changes in fertility plans and behaviors in Italy","While early evidence of the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on births has suggested a depressive effect on fertility intentions and behaviours, not all individuals have equally suffered the indirect consequences of the pandemic, and especially those related with the increased uncertainty brought by the economic recession. This study accounts for the heterogeneous consequences of the pandemic on fertility plans and behaviours, by focusing on the motivations for suspended pre-Covid fertility plans and on those for new fertility plans and conceptions that arose during the pandemic. The reasons for the latter are almost unexplored. To do that, we rely on unique data collected with a repeated cross-sectional survey conducted in April/May 2021 and October/November 2021 (2000 respondents each) on a quota sample of young Italians (aged 18 to 34). After exploring the main motivations for changing pre-COVID fertility plans or for intending to conceive a previously unplanned child during the pandemic, we estimate a set of multinomial and logit models to examine some correlates of fertility plans and behaviours. Finally, by interpreting these results in light of the reported motivations, we provide a more qualitative analysis that allows for a deeper interpretation of the reasons behind the patterns of associations. Potentially complex and non-unidirectional mechanisms, only partially related with reducing financial and occupational vulnerability, emerge as relevant for supporting fertility during the pandemic.","FRANCESCA LUPPI et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0217-9DC-5B0","20220511","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics; pandemic; sars-cov2; coronavirus; italy; fertility behaviors; fertility intentions; births; covid-19","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-11","",31196,""
