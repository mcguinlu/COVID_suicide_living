"Investigating mental and physical disorders associated with COVID-19 in online health forums","Objectives: Online health forums provide rich and untapped real-time data on population health. Through novel data extraction and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, we characterise the evolution of mental and physical health concerns relating to the COVID-19 pandemic among online health forum users. Setting and design: We obtained data from 739,434 posts by 53,134 unique users of three leading online health forums: HealthBoards, Inspire and HealthUnlocked, from the period 1st January 2020 to 31st May 2020. Using NLP, we analysed the content of posts related to COVID-19. Primary outcome measures: (i) Proportion of forum posts containing COVID-19 keywords (ii) Proportion of forum users making their very first post about COVID-19 (iii) Number of COVID-19 related posts containing content related to physical and mental health comorbidities Results: Posts discussing COVID-19 and related comorbid disorders spiked in early- to mid-March around the time of global implementation of lockdowns prompting a large number of users to post on online health forums for the first time. The pandemic and corresponding public response has had a significant impact on posters' queries regarding mental health. Conclusions: We demonstrate it is feasible to characterise the content of online health forum user posts regarding COVID-19 and measure changes over time. Social media data sources such as online health forums can be harnessed to strengthen population-level mental health surveillance.","Rashmi Patel; Fabrizio Smeraldi; Maryam Abdollahyan; Jessica Irving; Conrad Bessant","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.14.20248155","20201216","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-16","",8248,""
"Mental and social health of children and adolescents with pre-existing mental or somatic problems during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown","Background: The COVID-19 lockdown increases psychological problems in children and adolescents from the general population. Here we investigate the mental and social health during the COVID-19 lockdown in children and adolescents with pre-existing mental or somatic problems. Method: We included participants (8-18 years) from a psychiatric (N = 249) and pediatric (N = 90) sample, and compared them to a general population sample (N = 844). Measures were assessed during the first lockdown (April-May 2020) in the Netherlands. Main outcome measures were Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) domains: Global Health, Peer Relationships, Anxiety, Depressive Symptoms, Anger, and Sleep-Related Impairment. Additionally, socio-demographic variables, COVID-19-related questions, changes in atmosphere at home from a parent and child perspective, and children's experiences of lockdown regulations were assessed. Results: On all measures except Global Health, the pediatric sample reported least problems. The psychiatric sample reported significantly more problems than the general population sample on all measures except for Anxiety and Peer Relationships. Having a COVID-19 affected friend/relative and a COVID-19 related change in work situation negatively moderated outcome, but not in the samples with pre-existing problems. All parents reported significant decreases in atmosphere at home, as did children from the general population. Conclusion: We observed significant differences in mental and social health between three child and adolescent samples during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown and identified COVID-19-related factors influencing mental and social health. Our findings contribute to current and future policies during pandemic related lockdowns regarding the mental and social health of children and adolescents.","Josjan Zijlmans; Lorynn Teela; Hanneke van Ewijk; Helen Klip; Malindi van der Mheen; Hyun Ruisch; Michiel Luijten; Maud van Muilekom; Kim Oostrom; Jan Buitelaar; Pieter Hoekstra; Ramon Lindauer; Arne Popma; Wouter Staal; Robert Vermeiren; Hedy van Oers; Lotte Haverman; Tinca Polderman","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.15.20248237","20201216","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-16","",8249,""
"It makes you realise your own mortality: A qualitative study on mental health of older adults in the UK during COVID-19","Background: Older adults have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19, with high fatalities and health complications reported. Adults over the age of 70 in the UK were advised to self-isolate for 3 months early during the pandemic and it is unclear which factors influenced their experiences during this time. Objective: The aim of this qualitative study was to explore factors that threatened and protected the wellbeing of older adults living in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We undertook semi-structured interviews with 20 adults aged over 70. Purposive sampling methods were used to increase diversity within the group. Transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Participants were aged 72-93, 9 women and 11 men, 80% were White British, 40% lived alone. We identified 2 superordinate themes, including (1) Threats to wellbeing: mortality concerns, grief and loss of normal life, restricted health service access, COVID-19 concerns, and restricted access to activities that protect wellbeing. (2) Factors protective of wellbeing: slower pace of life, maintaining routine, socialising, and use of past coping skills. Many participants drew on their resilience and life experience to self-manage fear and uncertainty associated with the pandemic, using their time during lockdown to reflect or organise end-of-life affairs. Conclusions: This study provides evidence that while older adults experienced challenges, many were resilient against COVID-19 restrictions despite early concerns of mental health consequences. Our findings highlight the importance of maintaining access to essentials to promote feelings of normality and social support to help reduce uncertainty in times of pandemics.","Alison Ruth McKinlay; Daisy Fancourt; Alexandra Burton","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.15.20248238","20201216","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-16","",8250,""
"Risk of Stress/Depression and Functional Impairment in Denmark Immediately Following a COVID-19 Shutdown","Background This study aimed to investigate the impact of the first COVID-19 lockdown (March-April 2020) on risk for stress/depression and functional impairment in a representative sample of adult individuals in Denmark, and whether the impact of lockdown was heterogeneous across living situation. Methods: Using a representative, randomly drawn sample from the complete Danish adult population interviewed in March 2 to April 13, 2020 (n=2,836) and again in July 2020 (n=1,526, 54% retention rate), we study how the imposed lockdown announced March 11 following the onset of the first Danish wave of COVID-19 infections affected mental wellbeing. We use the World Health Organization Five Well-being Index (WHO-5) and the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS) to capture wellbeing and functioning. Using covariate adjusted ordinary least squares linear probability models and exploiting variation in the timing of responses occurring just before and just after the introduction of lockdown, we compare respondents before lockdown to respondents that answered during lockdown, as well to answers in re-interviews in July. Results: We find reduced depressive symptoms among adults immediately after the shutdown, concentrated in adults with children living at home. Measures of functional impairment also decline immediately after the March shutdown among adults with children living at home. Impairment intensified for the entire sample between March and July, but depressive symptoms remained at lower rate in July. Conclusions: Findings in Denmark indicate that living with children at home may have, in the short term, buffered the potential mental health sequelae of the COVID-19 shutdown.","Lars H.

"Misdirecting persuasive efforts during the covid-19 pandemic: The targets people choose may not be the most likely to change","Persuading people to engage in specific health behaviors is critical to prevent the spread of and mitigate the harm caused by COVID-19  Most of the research and practice around this issue focuses on developing effective message content  Importantly, though, persuasion is often critically dependent on choosing appropriate targetsâ€”that is, on selecting the best audience for oneâ€™s message  Three experiments conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic explore this target selection process and demonstrate misalignment between who persuaders target and who will display the greatest attitude and behavior change  Although people prefer to send messages encouraging COVID-19 prevention behaviors to targets with slightly negative attitudes toward the behaviors in question, their messages can often have more impact when sent to targets whose attitudes are slightly favorable  Recent insights in categorical perception and message positioning effects in persuasion help explain this misalignment  Â© 2020 the Association for Consumer Research  All rights reserved","Bechler, C.

"BMI, Weight Discrimination, and the Trajectory of Distress and Well-Being Across the Coronavirus Pandemic","OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the trajectory of psychological distress and well-being across the coronavirus pandemic by BMI category and weight discrimination. METHODS: Participants (N = 1,590) were assessed three times: early February 2020 before the coronavirus crisis in the United States and again in mid-March and late April 2020. Participants reported their weight, height, and weight discrimination in February. Depressed affect, loneliness, purpose in life, life satisfaction, and perceived support were assessed in all surveys; anxiety and stress were assessed in the March/April surveys. RESULTS: Prior to the pandemic, reporting weight discrimination or being in the underweight or obesity 2 to 3 categories was associated with more distress and lower well-being. Weight discrimination, not BMI, was associated with a twofold increased risk of incident depression from before to during the pandemic. Weight discrimination was associated with declines in purpose in life and life satisfaction across the pandemic. BMI categories were unrelated to changes in distress/well-being across the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Prior to the pandemic, BMI and weight discrimination were vulnerabilities for greater distress and lower well-being. Weight discrimination, but not BMI, increased risk for incident depression and declines in well-being during the coronavirus pandemic.","Sutin, Angelina R; Stephan, Yannick; Luchetti, Martina; Aschwanden, Damaris; Strickhouser, Jason E; Lee, Ji Hyun; Sesker, Amanda A; Terracciano, Antonio","https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/oby.23048","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Obesity (Silver Spring);2020 Sep 24.; Publication details: Obesity (Silver Spring);2020 Sep 24.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-16","",8285,""
"Psychological Distress during COVID-19 Lockdown among Dental Students and Practitioners in India: A Cross-Sectional Survey","Ã¢â‚¬Æ’In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the Indian Government imposed a countrywide lockdown of 21 days from March 25 to April 14, 2020, which was further extended to 60 days. The sudden draconian measures changed the delivery of dental education and practice throughout the country. The study aimed to screen for depression during the COVID-19 lockdown and the factors associated with it among dental students and practitioners in highly COVID-19 infected states of India. Ã¢â‚¬Æ’The current study is an online cross-sectional survey performed in Delhi NCR, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu during May 2020. The participants were recruited by convenience sampling. The main outcome measure was the screening of depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), which was categorized as mild, moderate, and severe depression. The data analysis was performed with IBM SPSS Version 23.0. A multivariable logistic regression model was fitted to identify the independent predictors of depression. Ã¢â‚¬Æ’In total, 335 dental students and practitioners participated in the survey. Among this, a significant number of the dental students (54%) and practitioners (44%) scored moderate to severe depression in terms of depression severity according to the PHQ-9 scores. Those who were screened depressed were likely to be males and younger than 30 years old. The results of correlation analysis indicated that worry about the professional growth, concerns regarding setbacks in clinical and research experiences, previous history of mental health issues, and fear of contracting COVID-19 from patients were positively related to higher depression scores in students. Moreover, for practitioners, fear of contracting COVID-19 from the patients scored higher levels of depression. The practitioners who reported less concern about their practice/job post COVID-19 lockdown and those who were able to meet their financial expenses during the lockdown were the least likely to be depressed. Ã¢â‚¬Æ’The results of this study indicate a high level of depression among a significant number of dental students and practitioners. It is important to monitor and address the mental health needs of dental students and practitioners during and after the lockdown.","Chakraborty, Subbiah, Damade","https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1719211","20201215","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-16","",8286,""

"Factors affecting mental health of health care workers during coronavirus disease outbreaks (SARS, MERS &amp; COVID-19): A rapid systematic review","The novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) outbreak currently puts health care workers at high risk of both physical and mental health problems. This study aimed to identify the risk and protective factors for mental health outcomes in health care workers during coronavirus epidemics. A rapid systematic review was performed in three databases (March 24, 2020) and a current COVID-19 resource (May 28, 2020). Following study selection, study characteristics and effect measures were tabulated, and data were synthesized by using vote counting. Meta-analysis was not possible because of high variation in risk factors, outcomes and effect measures. Risk of bias of each study was assessed and the certainty of evidence was appraised according to the GRADE methodology. Out of 2605 references, 33 observational studies were selected and the identified risk and protective factors were categorized in ten thematic categories. Most of these studies (n = 23) were performed during the SARS outbreak, seven during the current COVID-19 pandemic and three during the MERS outbreak. The level of disease exposure and health fear were significantly associated with worse mental health outcomes. There was evidence that clear communication and support from the organization, social support and personal sense of control are protective factors. The evidence was of very low certainty, because of risk of bias and imprecision. Safeguarding mental health of health care workers during infectious disease outbreaks should not be treated as a separate mental health intervention strategy, but could benefit from a protective approach. This study suggests that embedding mental health support in a safe and efficient working environment which promotes collegial social support and personal sense of control could help to maximize resilience of health care workers. Low quality cross-sectional studies currently provide the best possible evidence, and further research is warranted to confirm causality.","De Brier, Stroobants, Vandekerckhove, De Buck","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0244052","20201215","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-16","",8288,""
"Social Capital-Accrual, Escape-from-Self, and Time-Displacement Effects of Internet Use during the COVID-19 Stay-at-home Period: A Prospective Study","COVID-19 has spread like wildfire across the globe, prompting many governments to impose unprecedented stay-at-home orders to limit its transmission. During an extended stay-at-home period, individuals may engage in more online leisure activities. Internet use is a double-edged sword that may have both desirable and undesirable effects on psychological well-being, and this study sought to disentangle adaptive from maladaptive Internet use amidst this unusual health crisis. The objectives of this study were to assess the prevalence of probable depression during the COVID-19 stay-at-home period, and to test three hypothesized risk-reduction or risk-elevation mechanisms, namely social capital-accrual, escape-from-self, and time-displacement effects. This study took place from March to May 2020 at the early stage of the pandemic. The study adopted a prospective design, with an online survey administered to 573 U.K. and 474 U.S. adult residents at two assessment points two months apart. The prevalence of moderate-to-severe depression was 36% (bootstrap BCa 95% CI: 33%-39%) at Time 1 and 27% (bootstrap BCa 95% CI: 25%-30%) at Time 2. The results supported the social capital-accrual hypothesis by showing that approach coping style was inversely associated with Time 2 depression through its positive associations with both social networking and perceived family support. The results also supported the escape-from-self hypothesis by revealing that avoidant coping style was positively associated with Time 2 depression through its positive associations with both gaming and cyberbullying victimization, but the serial mediation model was no longer significant after Time 1 depression and some demographic risk factors had been controlled for. Finally, the results supported the time-displacement hypothesis by showing that gaming was positively associated with Time 2 depression through its inverse associations with social networking and perceived family support. During the extended stay-at-home period in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of probable depression during the two-month study period was high among the U.K. and U.S. residents. Individuals with distinct coping styles may engage in different types of online leisure activities and perceive varying levels of social support, which are associated with risks of probable depression.","Cheng, Lau, Luk","https://doi.org/10.2196/22740","20201215","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-16","",8289,""
"Study of the Novel AI-Powered Emotional Intelligence and Mindfulness App (Ajivar) for the College population during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Emotional Intelligence (EI) and mindfulness can impact the level of anxiety and depression that an individual experiences. These symptoms have been exacerbated in college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. AjivarTM is an application that utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to deliver personalized mindfulness and EI training. The main objective of this research study was to determine the effectiveness of delivering an EI curriculum and mindfulness techniques using an AI conversation platform, AjivarTM to improve symptoms of anxiety and depression during this pandemic. 95 subjects ages 18-29 years were recruited from a second semester freshmen of students. All participants completed the online TestWell inventory at the start and at the end of the 14 week semester. The comparison group (n=45) was given routine mental wellness instruction. The intervention group (n=50) were required to complete AjivarTM activities in addition to routine mental wellness instruction during the semester, which coincided with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. This group also completed assessments to evaluate for anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, GAD-7) and depression (Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9). Study participants were 19.8Ã¯â€šÂ±1.9 years old, 28% males (27/95), and 60% Caucasian. No significant demographic differences existed between the comparison and intervention groups. Subjects in the intervention group interacted with AjivarTM for a mean of 1424Ã¯â€šÂ±1168 minutes. There was a significant decrease in anxiety as measured by GAD-7 (11.47Ã¯â€šÂ±1.85 at the start of the study compared to 6.27Ã¯â€šÂ±1.44, P&lt;0.01, at the end). There was a significant reduction in the symptoms of depression measured by PHQ-9 (10.69Ã¯â€šÂ±2.04 vs. 6.69Ã¯â€šÂ±2.41, P&lt;0.01). Both the intervention and the comparison groups independently had significant improvements in pre-post TestWell inventory. The subgroups in the inventory for social awareness and spirituality showed significant improvement in the intervention group. In a group of participants (n=11) where GAD-7 was available during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, it showed an increase in anxiety (11.01Ã¯â€šÂ±2.16 at the start to 13.03Ã¯â€šÂ±1.34, P=0.23) in mid-March (onset of pandemic) to a significant decrease at the end of the study period (6.3Ã¯â€šÂ±1.44, P&lt;0.01).

Women, non-physician healthcare professionals, young and single people and those who worked in COVID-19 service and stayed at least one week away from their families during the pandemic were found to have poor mental well-being. Psychological well-being was significantly and negatively correlated with depression and anxiety.

"The COVID-19 Pandemic and Psychosocial Outcomes across Age through the Stress and Coping Framework","The emergence of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the measures implemented to curb its spread may have deleterious effects on mental health. Older adults may be at increased risk for adverse psychosocial outcomes since opportunities to remain socially connected have diminished. Research is needed to better understand the impact of pandemic-related stress on mental health. The purpose of this study is three-fold: 1) to examine the influences of COVID-19 pandemic-related stress on depression, anxiety, and loneliness, 2) to assess the mediating role of coping style and social support, and 3) to investigate whether these relationships vary across age. Participants (N = 1,318) aged 18-92 years completed an online survey assessing pandemic-related stress, mental health, social support, coping, and their experiences with social distancing, during the initial implementation of social distancing measures in the United States. Social support and coping style were found to relate to psychosocial outcomes. Avoidant coping was the strongest mediator of the relationship between pandemic-related stress and psychosocial outcomes, particularly depression. Avoidant coping more strongly mediated the relationship between stress and depression in younger adults compared to older adults. Results were consistent with the stress and coping framework and recent work highlighting older adults' resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings highlight the associations between positive coping behaviors and psychosocial well-being and indicate that older adults may use unique adaptive mechanisms to preserve well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Minahan, Falzarano, Yazdani, Siedlecki","https://doi.org/10.1093/geront/gnaa205","20201215","Coping; Mental health; Social distancing; Social support; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-16","",8292,""
"How does social distancing during COVID-19 affect negative moods and memory?","In the absence of an effective vaccine or treatment, the current best defence against COVID-19 is <i>social distancing</i> - staying at home as much as possible, keeping distance from others, and avoiding large gatherings. Although social distancing improves physical health in terms of helping to reduce viral transmission, its psychological consequences are less clear, particularly its effects on memory. In this research, we investigated the effect of social distancing duration on negative moods and memory. The relation between social distancing duration and both negative mood and memory errors followed the same U-shaped function: negative moods and memory errors initially decreased as social distancing duration increased, and then at approximately 30 days, they began to increase. Subsequent analyses indicated that memory errors were mediated by lonely mood in particular. Thus, short-term social distancing might benefit psychological well-being and memory performance, but extended social distancing has a negative impact on mood and memory.","Zhang, Gao, Gross, Shrum, Hayne","https://doi.org/10.1080/09658211.2020.1857774","20201215","COVID-19; false memory; negative mood; social distancing; social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-16","",8293,""
"Burnout, depersonalization, and anxiety contribute to post-traumatic stress in frontline health workers at COVID-19 patient care, a follow-up study","We designed a follow-up study of frontline health workers at COVID-19 patient care, within the same working conditions, to assess the influence of their general characteristics and pre-existing anxiety/depression/dissociative symptoms and resilience on the development of symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), while monitoring their quality of sleep, depersonalization/derealization symptoms, acute stress, state anxiety, and burnout. In a Hospital reconfigured to address the surge of patients with COVID-19, 204 frontline health workers accepted to participate. They completed validated questionnaires to assess mental health: before, during, and after the peak of inpatient admissions. After each evaluation, a psychiatrist reviewed the questionnaires, using the accepted criteria for each instrument. Correlations were assessed using multivariable and multivariate analyses, with a significance level of .05. Compared to men, women reporting pre-existing anxiety were more prone to acute stress; and younger age was related to both pre-existent common psychological symptoms and less resilience. Overall the evaluations, sleep quality was bad on the majority of participants, with an increase during the epidemic crisis, while persistent burnout had influence on state anxiety, acute stress, and symptoms of depersonalization/derealization. PTSD symptoms were related to pre-existent anxiety/depression and dissociative symptoms, as well as to acute stress and acute anxiety, and negatively related to resilience. Pre-existent anxiety/depression, dissociative symptoms, and coexisting acute anxiety and acute stress contribute to PTSD symptoms. During an infectious outbreak, psychological screening could provide valuable information to prevent or mitigate against adverse psychological reactions by frontline healthcare workers caring for patients.","Miguel-Puga, Cooper-Bribiesca, Avelar-Garnica, Sanchez-Hurtado, Colin-MartÃƒÂ­nez, Espinosa-Poblano, Anda-Garay, GonzÃƒÂ¡lez-DÃƒÂ­az, Segura-Santos, Vital-Arriaga, JÃƒÂ¡uregui-Renaud","https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.2007","20201215","anxiety; burnout; depersonalization; post-traumatic stress disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-16","",8294,""

"Gene editing and RNAi approaches for COVID-19 diagnostics and therapeutics","The novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) is a highly infectious acute respiratory disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Related Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) (Prec Clin Med 2020;3:9-13, Lancet 2020;395:497-506, N. Engl J Med 2020a;382:1199-207, Nature 2020;579:270-3). SARS-CoV-2 surveillance is essential to controlling widespread transmission. However, there are several challenges associated with the diagnostic of the COVID-19 during the current outbreak (Liu and Li (2019), Nature 2020;579:265-9, N. Engl J Med 2020;382:727-33). Firstly, the high number of cases overwhelms diagnostic test capacity and proposes the need for a rapid solution for sample processing (Science 2018;360:444-8). Secondly, SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to other important coronavirus species and subspecies, so detection assays can give false-positive results if they are not efficiently specific to SARS-CoV-2. Thirdly, patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection sometimes have a different respiratory viral infection or co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses (MedRxiv 2020a;1-18). Confirmation of the COVID-19 is performed mainly by virus isolation followed by RT-PCR and sequencing (N. Engl J Med 2020;382:727-33, MedRxiv 2020a, Turkish J Biol 2020;44:192-202). The emergence and outbreak of the novel coronavirus highlighted the urgent need for new therapeutic technologies that are fast, precise, stable, easy to manufacture, and target-specific for surveillance and treatment. Molecular biology tools that include gene-editing approaches such as CRISPR-Cas12/13-based SHERLOCK, DETECTR, CARVER and PAC-MAN, antisense oligonucleotides, antisense peptide nucleic acids, ribozymes, aptamers, and RNAi silencing approaches produced with cutting-edge scientific advances compared to conventional diagnostic or treatment methods could be vital in COVID-19 and other future outbreaks. Thus, in this review, we will discuss potent the molecular biology approaches that can revolutionize diagnostic of viral infections and therapies to fight COVID-19 in a highly specific, stable, and efficient way.","Berber, Aydin, Kocabas, Guney-Esken, Yilancioglu, Karadag-Alpaslan, Caliseki, Yuce, Demir, Tastan","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41434-020-00209-7","20201215","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-16","",8296,""

"Impact of COVID-19 on health-related quality of life in patients with cardiovascular disease: a multi-ethnic Asian study","Little is known about the impact of the global coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD), the biggest global killer and major risk factor for severe COVID-19 infections. We aim to explore the indirect consequences of COVID-19 on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients with CVD. Eighty-one adult outpatients with CVD were assessed using the EQ-5D, a generic health status instrument with five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression), before and during the pandemic. Changes in the EQ-5D dimensional responses were compared categorically as well as using the dimension-specific sum-score (range 1-3, with a higher score indicating worse health). The responses and sum-score were compared using the exact test of symmetry and the paired t-test, respectively. These patients [mean age (SD) 59.8 (10.5); 92.6% males; 56% New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class I] had coronary artery disease (69%), heart failure (28%), or arrhythmias (15%). None experienced change in NYHA class between assessments. About 30% and 38% of patients reported problems with at least one of the EQ-5D dimensions pre-pandemic and during the pandemic, respectively. The highest increase in health problems was reported for anxiety/depression (12.5% pre-pandemic vs 23.5% during pandemic; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.035) with mean domain-specific score from 1.12 (SD 0.33) to 1.25 (SD 0.46) (standardized effect sizeÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.373, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.012). There was no meaningful change in other dimensions as well as overall HRQoL. The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with a significant worsening of the mental health of patients with CVD.","Lim, Woo, Lim, Ng, Chan, Gandhi","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12955-020-01640-5","20201215","COVID-19; Cardiovascular; EQ-5D; Health-related quality of life; Psychological health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-16","",8299,""
"Mental Health Risks after Repeated Exposure to Multiple Stressful Events during Ongoing Social Unrest and Pandemic in Hong Kong: The Role of Rumination: Risques pour la santÃƒÂ© mentale aprÃƒÂ¨s une exposition rÃƒÂ©pÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ©e Ãƒ de multiples ÃƒÂ©vÃƒÂ©nements stressants d'agitation sociale durable et de pandÃƒÂ©mie Ãƒ Hong Kong: le rÃƒÂ´le de la rumination","The co-occurrence of different classes of population-level stressors, such as social unrest and public health crises, is common in contemporary societies. Yet, few studies explored their combined mental health impact. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of repeated exposure to social unrest-related traumatic events (TEs), coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic-related events (PEs), and stressful life events (SLEs) on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depressive symptoms, and the potential mediating role of event-based rumination (rumination of TEs-related anger, injustice, guilt, and insecurity) between TEs and PTSD symptoms. Community members in Hong Kong who had utilized a screening tool for PTSD and depressive symptoms were invited to complete a survey on exposure to stressful events and event-based rumination. A total of 10,110 individuals completed the survey. Hierarchical regression analysis showed that rumination, TEs, and SLEs were among the significant predictors for PTSD symptoms (all <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), accounting for 32% of the variance. For depression, rumination, SLEs, and PEs were among the significant predictors (all <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), explaining 24.9% of the variance. Two-way analysis of variance of different recent and prior TEs showed significant dose-effect relationships. The effect of recent TEs on PTSD symptoms was potentiated by prior TEs (<i>P</i> = 0.005). COVID-19 PEs and prior TEs additively contributed to PTSD symptoms, with no significant interaction (<i>P</i> = 0.94). Meanwhile, recent TEs were also potentiated by SLEs (<i>P</i> = 0.002). The effects of TEs on PTSD symptoms were mediated by rumination (ÃŽÂ² = 0.38, standard error = 0.01, 95% confidence interval: 0.36 to 0.41), with 40.4% of the total effect explained. All 4 rumination subtypes were significant mediators. Prior and ongoing TEs, PEs, and SLEs cumulatively exacerbated PTSD and depressive symptoms. The role of event-based rumination and their interventions should be prioritized for future research.","Wong, Hui, Wong, Suen, Chan, Lee, Chang, Chen","https://doi.org/10.1177/0706743720979920","20201215","cumulative trauma; depression; pandemic; post-traumatic stress disorder; rumination; social unrest; stressful life events","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-16","",8300,""
