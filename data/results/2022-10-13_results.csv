"Post-acute symptoms four months after SARS-CoV-2 infection during the Omicron period: a nationwide Danish questionnaire study","Abstract Objectives To evaluate the effects of the Omicron variant on the post-acute symptoms, four months after infection with SARS-CoV-2. Design A nationwide questionnaire study. Setting Denmark. Participants 44,004 individuals aged 15 years or older with either a SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive test result from the period of Delta dominance (July to November 2021), or a positive or negative RT-PCR test result from the period of Omicron dominance (December 2021 to January 2022). Methods A questionnaire based cohort study with outcomes on post-acute physical, fatigue, cognitive, mental health symptoms, and new-onset general health problems, four months after testing. Risk differences (RDs) were estimated by comparing cases and controls during the Omicron period, cases during the Delta and Omicron periods, and vaccinated cases with two and three doses during the Omicron period, adjusted for age, sex, BMI, self-reported chronic diseases, Charlson comorbidity index, healthcare occupation and vaccination status. Results Four months after testing for SARS-CoV-2 during the Omicron period, cases experienced higher risk of 18 out of 26 post-acute symptoms and five out of five new-onset general health problems, compared to controls. Cases during the Omicron period experienced lower risks of 8 of the 18 symptoms and of all five new-onset general health problems, compared to Delta cases. The most prominent RDs estimated when comparing Omicron cases to controls were: memory issues (RD=5.4%, 95% CI 4.8 to 6.1), post-exertional malaise (RD=5.3%, 95% CI 3.1 to 7.7), fatigue/exhaustion (RD=5.2%, 95% CI 3.7 to 6.9), substantial fatigue (RD=5.0%, 95% CI 2.7 to 7.5), and dyspnea (RD=4.8%, 95% CI 3.8 to 5.9). Compared to cases from the Delta period, Omicron cases reported reduced risks of post-acute altered/reduced sense of smell (dysosmia) (RD=-15.1%, 95% CI -17.0 to -12.9) and -taste (dysgeusia) (RD=-11.6%, 95% CI -13.6 to -9.7). Cases vaccinated with three doses prior to Omicron infection reported reduced risk of 13 of the 26 post-acute symptoms and of three of the five new-onset general health problems, compared to those vaccinated with two doses. Conclusions A considerable amount of cases infected during the Omicron period experienced post-acute symptoms and new-onset health problems, four months after testing, although milder compared to Delta cases. During the Omicron period, a booster vaccination dose was associated with fewer post-acute symptoms and new-onset health problems, four months after infection, compared to two doses of COVID-19 vaccine.","Lampros Spiliopoulos; Anna Irene Vedel SÃ¸rensen; Peter Michael Bager; Nete Munk Nielsen; JÃ¸rgen VinslÃ¸v Hansen; Anders Koch; Inger Kristine Meder; Poul Videbech; Steen Ethelberg; Anders Peter Hviid","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.10.12.22280990","20221012","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-13","",38992,""
"The impact of lockdown measures on the mental health of the general population: Results from a national multicentric study","The COVID-19 pandemic and the related containment measures, such as lockdown, are affecting mental health of the general population worldwide. This is an unprecedented event, which is influencing the health care, political, economic, and social welfare systems. Among Western countries, Italy has been one of the first severely hit by the pandemic in terms of number of cases and mortality rates. On March 8, 2020, the Italian Prime Minister issued restrictive measures in order to limit the spread of the disease. During this period known as â€œPhase oneâ€ of the national health emergency, all not necessary activities have been closed, more than 29,000 people have died and almost 100,000 people have been home-isolated, with strict lockdown measures. The COvid Mental hEalth Trial (COMET) network, including ten university Italian sites and the National Institute of Health, has promoted a national online survey in order to evaluate the impact of lockdown measures on the mental health of the Italian general population. The COMET survey reports data from a large sample of more than 20.000 people from Italian general population, showing that lockdown has had a detrimental impact on mental health, in terms of worsening of anxiety, depressive and stress symptoms. Findings from this study can be useful to inform national and international associations, policy makers and stakeholders on the importance to provide adequate support to the mental health of the general population.

"From mentee to mentor: Becoming an early career professor in psychiatry","In the last years several social, economic and scientific changes have occurred, which have had a significant impact on psychiatric clinical practice, research and training. Some traditional syndromes seem to be disappeared, while new forms of mental health problems are coming to psychiatric consultation. The psychosocial distress caused by the current ongoing crisis due to the COVID-19 or the maladaptive use of the new technologies among the younger generation, are some good examples of psychosocial factors causing new mental health disturbances. Psychiatrists and mental health professionals are not yet well-equipped for managing these, which represent major unmet needs in modern clinical practice. Furthermore, in this evolving social context, the societal role of psychiatrists is completely changed, moving from being â€œalienistâ€ working in asylums to â€œmental health care providersâ€ working in the communities. The role of psychiatrists is to improve global mental health and to promote well-being in the general population according to a life-span perspective. Nowadays, early career psychiatrists report several unmet needs that we are not able to manage. In this symposium, I will describe my personal experience of moving from my role of mentee to mentor.

"Psychiatric disorders during acute hospital treatment of COVID-19 - a case series","Introduction Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been associated with the development mental and behavioural symptoms and psychiatric disorders. This association is stronger in severe cases of the disease and in those needing inpatient treatment, particularly in intensive care units (ICU). Objectives To determine the incidence of psychiatric disorders in a Portuguese hospital-based sample of patients with COVID-19. To describe relevant demographic and clinical data. Methods We reviewed all COVID-19 inpatients assessed by liaison psychiatry at our hospital between April and September 2020. Patients admitted due to a psychiatric disorder were excluded from the analysis. We reviewed medical records and retrieved relevant clinical data. ICD-10 was used to classify diagnoses. Results We identified 36 cases with a mean age of 62.64 years-old (SD 19.23). The most common disorder was delirium, which occurred in 41.7% of our sample (15 patients), followed by adjustment disorder (22.2%, n=8), and depressive episode (16.7%, n=8). Most patients had no personal (61.1%, n=22) nor family (75%, n=27) history of a psychiatric disorder. Mean length of admission was 36.89 days (SD 28.91). Seventeen cases (47.22%) had at least one risk factor for severe COVID-19 disease and 14 (38.89%) were admitted at some point to the ICU. Conclusions In our sample, delirium was the main cause for mental or behavioural symptoms in COVID-19 patients. However, we observed a wide array of presentations in our center. A larger sample would allow to better characterize this often-overlooked symptoms and identify risk factors to psychiatric syndromes. Disclosure No significant relationships.","Fernandes, L.

"Psychiatric emergency admissions and inpatient length of stay before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany","Objective: The impact of the COVID-19 year on the number of daily psychiatric emergency admissions and length of stay was compared with previous years. Methods: In a retrospective study, the four quarters of 2020 of several psychiatric hospitals in Germany were statistically compared with the respective quarters of 2018 and 2019. Results: A total of 73,412 cases was analyzed. In the 2nd quarter of 2020, the number of daily admissions was significantly lower as compared to the control period (59.1 vs. 70.7;incidence rate ratio [95% confidence interval] 0.81 [0.69;0.96];p = 0.012). Length of stay was numerically but not significantly different as compared to the control periods. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic had a strong impact on inpatient psychiatric care. In the future, multimodal care structures must ensure the care of severely mentally ill people in crisis situations.

"Families' housing experiences within contexts of stress","Experiences of homelessness and housing instability have implications for child and family well-being across the life course. In this three-paper dissertation, I explore a variety of housing experiences for families within additionally stressful contexts. First, I review the existing literature regarding infants' and toddlers' experiences of homelessness, a consequential developmental time period, and a critical gap in homelessness scholarship. Second, using qualitative analyses, I investigate families' descriptions of their experiences of housing instability and homelessness in addition to experiencing the incarceration of a parent, addressing family-identified challenges and supports. Lastly, I address relations between parents' well-being and children's stress within families living doubled-up during the COVID-19 pandemic, comparing across doubled-up status for parent mental health symptoms, emotions, behaviors, and employment, and child stress and adaptive behaviors. Following the three papers, I discuss implications for future research, policy, and practice within the field of family homelessness and housing instability.

"Suicidality measured by PHQ-9 in kosovo during the COVID-19 outbreak","Introduction As a consequence of the impact of COVID-19 there are suggestions and projections that suicide rates will rise, although this is not inevitable. It is intriguing what impact it will have on Kosovo as a country with the lowest suicide rate in Europe. Objectives The objective of this study was to understand the level of suicidal thinking as a result of the COVID-19 situation and possible associations with sociodemographic variables. Methods Itâ€™s a comparative study. We examined data of two cross-sectional online surveys conducted during the one-month periods 20.03.20 until 23.04.20 and 27.04.2020 until 05.06.2020. The participants were online respondents, N = 194 (first period) and N = 155 (second period);who completed the Albanian version of PHQ-9. We used the statement number 9 of questionnaire indicative of suicide. Results Mean score of suicidal thinking resulted 0.58 (SD = .98) in the first period and 0.84 (SD = 1.16) in the second period. 10.1% of participants in March/April and 18.2% in May/June period scored that almost every day thoughts that would be better off dead, or of hurting yourself in some way. Significantly higher suicidal thinking resulted for females and for respondents who had previously had depression in both periods. Compared to two previous studies (2018 and 2019) in different settings only the results of the second period show an increase in suicidal thinking. Conclusions Further studies are needed to better scientifically elaborate these findings. It is important enhanced surveillance of COVID-19-related risk factors contributing to suicidal behaviors and timely preventive efforts.

"CON perspective","Body Psychiatry is facing major challenges during times of a pandemic as illustrated by the current COVID-19 pandemic. The challenges involve its actual and perceived role within the medical system, in particular how psychiatric hospitals can maintain their core mission of attending to the mentally ill while at the same time providing relief to general medicine. Although psychiatric disorders are the top leading causes of global burden of disease, we can witness mental health care being de-emphasized in the wake of the massive onslaught of the pandemic: psychiatric wards are being downsized, clinics closed, psychiatric support systems discontinued etc. in order to make room for emergency care. While nobody can deny the need to act decisively and swiftly and ramp up intensive care readiness, we believe that there is no need to do this at the expense of psychiatric care. Using the pandemic COVID-19 contingency plan developed at the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of the University Hospital of LMU Munich as a case in point, we demonstrate how a psychiatric hospital can share in the acute care of a health care system facing an acute and highly infectious pandemic like COVID-19 and at the same time provide for the mentally ill, with or without a COVID-19 infection, and develop mid and long-term plans for coping with the aftermath of the pandemic.

"Psychological profile of the bariatric surgery candidates in a spanish hospital in 2020: a descriptive study","Introduction Previous research has found that candidates for bariatric surgery usually present anxiety, depression, personality disorders and/or a tendency to binge eating. The situation related with the pandemic and the lockdowns during the 2020 are possible aggravating factors for these characteristics. Objectives To study the more important psychological characteristics presented by candidates for bariatric surgery. Methods 40 people between 29 and 65 years old (M=46.4, SD=9.1;37.5% male, 62.5% female) were evaluated between July and December of 2020. The assessment consisted in an interview carried out by a clinical psychologist, and a pool of questionnaires to evaluate depression and anxiety symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory, BDI;and the Goldberg Anxiety and Depression Scale, GADS) the existence of a binge eating pattern (the Binge Eating Scale;BES) and personality traits (the Salamanca Screening Test). Results The 25% of the sample had previous mental health antecedents. Eight people disclosed to feel stress in relation with the COVID-19, and 18 presented an emotional regulation strategy using food during the lockdown. 62.5% scored above the cut-off point on the BDI (mild=27.5%, moderate=20%, severe=15%) and a 40% and a 47.5% did it for the anxiety and the depression (respectively) GADS subscales. 20% presented a binge eating pattern according with the BES.

"Evaluation of anxiety symptoms and depression in the general albanian population during quarantine","Introduction During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Albanian authorities declared mandatory stay-at-home measures, closing businesses, schools and public places. Objectives To investigate the impact of these immediate changes on the mental wellbeing of the population. Methods Respondents (N=1678) from 18 to 60 years old were selected through a convenient sampling method. Questionnaires were administered online reporting time spent daily in the COVID-19 topic and genealities;the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7. Results Findings suggest a significant negative correlation between age and anxiety scoring (r(n=1678)=-.121, p=.001) and age and depression scoring (r(n=1678)=-.232, p=.001), shown also on the ANOVA test for age and anxiety (F=6.019, p=.05) and age and depression (F=20.326, p=.05). Differences on the level of education resulted in a lower score of anxiety and depression respectively (F=3.524, p=.05), (F=7.739, p=.05) on respondents with higher education. Those who were jobless from the pandemic scored higher on anxiety and depression respectively (F=9.760, p=.05) (M=6.21, ds=4.686) and (F=16.051, p=.05) (M=8.18, ds=5.791). Significant differences were found related to different amounts of time spent on the COVID-19 topic, respectively for anxiety and depression (F=25.736, p=.001), (F=5.936, p=.003), with people who spend less than 1 hour scoring higher on depression (M=7.57, ds= 5.849) and those who spend more than 3 hours scoring higher on anxiety (M=6.76, ds=5.60).

"Essays on the economics of welfare policy and well-being","The objective of this thesis is the evaluation of government policy. The first two chapters are focused on policies that affect separated families;Child Maintenance, an important source of income for separated parents, and the Lone Parent Obligation reform.Chapter 2 examines the effect of receiving child maintenance on youth behavioural and social outcomes, using new methods to assess the extent to which results are driven by selection on unobservable characteristics. The findings provide compelling estimates that, among boys, child maintenance receipt is associated with significantly fewer conduct problems and better pro-social skills. Chapter 3 evaluates the Lone Parent Obligation reform which imposed work search requirements for lone mothers with a youngest child aged 5 or 6. The findings suggest that the reform was successful in increasing maternal employment, an effect size of 8 percentage points. This was accompanied by an increase in the proportion of lone mothers who were searching for work by 9 percentage points. The results are similar across two datasets and are robust to several sensitivity checks, which add credibility to the estimates.Finally, Chapter 4 focuses on the COVID-19 pandemic and mental health in the UK. It aims to isolate the effect of being in a government imposed lockdown from the threat of the virus. The results reveal that lockdown plays a large role in explaining mental health declines, with national case and death rates also found to be important. These effects are heterogeneous across the population, with younger adults, women, and lone mothers particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of lockdown.

"Emotional response to illness in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in russia","Introduction The situation of Covid-19 disease, associated with a high threat to life and uncertainty, had not only somatic, but also psychological consequences for most patients. Emotional reactions of patients to hospitalization and ways to cope with what is happening have become the subject of study in different countries. Objectives To assess the severity of signs of depression and anxiety and to study the methods used to regulate the emotional state in patients with COVID-19 at the time of hospitalization. Methods The study volunteered 127 hospitalized patients with Covid-19 (67 men (52.8%) and 60 women (47.2%), aged 19 to 77 years, who completed the following methods: Sociological questionnaire, Beck Depression Questionnaire, GAD-7, F-SOZU-22, CERQ, Dembo-Rubinstein self-assessment scales. The study was conducted from 04/25/2020 to 05/31/2020. Results A quarter of patients showed pronounced signs of depression and anxiety (25.4% and 24.13%, respectively), with women having higher rates of depression (M = 8.76 and M = 6.32, p&lt;0.01). Anova showed no significant differences in the response to the disease situation in patients of different age groups. Factor analysis made it possible to identify 3 patterns of emotional coping with the disease: Â«positive decision orientedÂ», Â«fixed on negative experiencesÂ», Â«accusersÂ» (The resulting factor solution explains 69% of the dispersion).

Methods 949 participants from Russia (ages 18-66) voluntarily completed online questionnaires: BAI;BDI;SCL-90-R;Personal Views Survey III during the early COVID-19 restrictions (24 March - 15 May). Subsamples from four time periods were compared using ANOVA. The first dataset was collected before the official restrictionsâ€™ introduction (n=88). The second subsample was gathered during the â€œdays offâ€ week (n=262). The third period started with the â€œdays offâ€ extension and ended with the strict self-isolation announcement (n=296). The fourth dataset was gathered during self-isolation (n=303). General linear models (GLM) were used to determine the effect of variables on anxiety, depression, and general symptomatic index (GSI). Results Hardiness, anxiety, depression, and GSI differed significantly between the time-periods (F=4.899, p&lt;0.01;F=3.173, p&lt;0.05;F=8.096, p&lt;0.01;F=3.244, p&lt;0.022 ;F=4.899, p&lt;0.01 respectively). GLMs showed gender, chronic diseases, self-assessed fears, and hardiness contribution to anxiety, depression, and GSI. Hardiness had the biggest effect on all models. Anxiety was additionally influenced by the time factor, which also interacted with hardiness (see Figure 1). With lower hardiness, higher anxiety arose over time. Conclusions Hardiness notably contributes to personal adaptation during the COVID-19 outbreak-related restrictions.","Dovbysh, D.; Epishin, V.; Salikhova, A.; Bogacheva, N.; Bogdanova, M.; Kiseleva, M.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Impact+of+personality+hardiness+on+anxiety+dynamics+during+the+COVID-19+outbreak+in+russia","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European psychiatry : the journal of the Association of European Psychiatrists; 64(Suppl 1):S284-S284, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-13","",39005,""
"Exercise addiction, body dysmorphic disorder, and use of enhancement drugs during the COVID-19 pandemic confinement period: A transcultural study","Introduction The Coronavirus pandemic has originated unprecedented sanitary control measures that have conditioned peopleâ€™s lifestyles and habits. Little is known about the impact of such measures, especially the most restrictive, on recent and growing phenomena such as exercise addiction, use of enhancement drugs, and Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD). Objectives The objective was to investigate the above-mentioned phenomena during COVID-19 pandemic and how they relate. Methods The sample consisted of 3161 participants (65% women), from Portugal (11%), Italy (41%), Spain (16%), the UK (12%), Lithuania (12%), Japan (6%), and Hungary (4%). Mean age was 35.05 (SD = 12.10). Participants responded online to the Exercise Addiction Inventory (EAI), the Appearance Anxiety Inventory (AAI), and questions about use of enhancement drugs. Results 4.3% of the participants scored above the cut-off point of the EAI, with higher values registered in the UK and Spain. Exercise addiction was higher among men. Appearance anxiety and body satisfaction problems were found in participants of all participating countries, with 15.2% scoring over the cut-off point for BDD. Higher numbers of those at risk of BDD were found in Italy, Japan, and Portugal. About 29% reported the use of fitness supplements to make them look better, with 6.4% starting a new use during the lockdown. Change in supplements use and exercise are predicted by EAI scores. Change in mental health is predicted by AAI scores. Conclusions This study helps to shed light on how COVID-19 lookdown induced behavioral changes and how they affect physical and mental health-related aspects in different countries.","Dores, A.

"Binge eating disorder and coronavirus outbreak among health care workers in tunisia","Introduction COVID19 outbreak had affected physical and mental health of individuals. Different adverse health behaviors had worsened and eating disorders had evolved. Health care workers were not spared. Objectives To screen binge eating disorder among health care workers of regional hospital of Gabes (south of Tunisia) and its associated factors. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional, descriptive and analytical study, from April 19, 2020, to May 5, 2020 on 289 in Gabes regional Hospital. All healthcare workers were included (n=620). Workers who were on sick leave during the study were excluded. During this period, the total confirmed cases of COVID-19 exceeded 900 cases in Tunisia and around 20 cases in Gabes. We used a self-administered anonymous questionnaire containing sociodemographic and clinical data. DSM-5 diagnostic criteria were used to assess Binge-Eating Disorder. Results Of the 289 responding participants, 85 were physicians (29%), 166 nurses (57.4%), 8 ambulance drivers (2.8%) and 30 health-related administrators (10.3%). A total of 100 participants (34.6%) were frontline health care workers directly engaged in diagnosing, treating or caring for patients with coronavirus disease.

"Remote psychoeducation for eating disorders: An exploratory study during lockdown","Introduction With increasing prevalence, eating disorders (EDs) constitute a public health problem. Access to treatment is limited and often delayed for the majority of patients. Such obstacles might be mitigated via the development of virtual treatments. Objectives Conducted during COVID-19 lockdown, this pilot study aimed to explore the feasibility and preliminary clinical outcomes associated with treatment of EDs by means of a remote psychoeducational (PE) programme. Methods Eleven patients who fulfilled DSM-5 criteria for anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or binge eating disorder completed assessments, including ED symptoms, anxiety and depression, as well as motivation to change measures at the beginning and end of the time-limited (4 weeks) specialized treatment. It consisted in receiving 4 PE documents by email (1 per week), which was completed by a 15-20 minutes phone call with each participant (1 per week). Results Data showed significant improvements of several self-reported eating disorder symptoms, including body dissatisfaction and intensity of bulimic episodes. Conclusions Our findings suggest that a time-limited remote PE intervention produces clinically meaningful changes in ED symptoms. Thus, it might be worth developing such interventions in a clinical context, especially when performed prior to higher level of care.

"Preparation for counseling children with adverse childhood experiences in CACREP clinical mental health counseling programs: A qualitative study","The life-long health consequences of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have been well documented throughout the literature since the original study was published nearly twenty-five years ago. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic exacerbated psychological, social, economic, and political issues common to ACEs. Research outcomes provide evidence that therapeutic interventions can buffer the harmful effects of ACEs;however, a shortage of child-specialized mental health providers exists globally. Lack of training is cited as one of the many barriers to accessing mental health care for children. Inquiries in counselor preparation have determined that emerging counselors' report that their graduate training for counseling children and children with trauma was inadequate. While researchers have explored counselor preparation for children and counselor preparation for treating trauma, this research fills a gap in the literature for counselor preparation for treating children with ACEs. This qualitative conventional content analysis explored counselor preparation in accredited clinical mental health counseling programs for counseling children with ACEs from the lens of social justice theory. Seven participants self-identified as experienced child counselors and counselor educators. Participants elected to share instructional content specific to multicultural attitudes, skills, knowledge, and actions for counseling children with ACEs during virtual, audio-recorded semi-structured interviews. Data analysis revealed the pedagogical content most often reported by participants. Findings were compared to the Multicultural Social Justice Counseling Competencies and offer implications for counseling professionals, counselor educators, and social justice and advocacy to begin breaking down systemic barriers to accessing multiculturally sensitive mental health care for children and their families.

"Depression and anxiety in hospitalized children with epilepsy during COVID-19 pandemic: Preliminary findings of a cross-sectional study","Introduction Anxious-depressive disorders are common among children with epilepsy. A recent Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (Scott et al., 2020) reported that the overall pooled prevalence of anxiety disorders is 18.9% while of depressive disorders is 13.5%. COVID-19 pandemic has centralized the attention of governors and careers on the health emergency. As a result, the trajectory of the psychological care needs of this at risk population may have been neglected. Objectives The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence rate of depressive and anxiety symptoms among children with epilepsy during COVID-19 pandemic. Children were hospitalized in- and out-patients under a neurological and psychological follow up program in an Italian Children Hospital. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study among 38 hospitalized children and adolescents with epilepsy (21F;17M, mean age: 14,5;range: 11-18) during COVID-19 pandemic. We performed face-to face interviews and assessed depressive and anxiety symptoms with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorders (GAD-7) questionnaire during scheduled follow up checks. Results Preliminary results showed a rate of mild-to-severe anxious depressive symptoms by 49.9% and 60.5% respectively. In detail: 21.1% mild, 15.7% moderate and 13.1% of severe anxiety, meanwhile 23.7% mild, 26.3% moderate and 10.5% of severe depression. The prevalence of comorbid depressive and anxiety symptoms was 39.5% among the entire sample. Conclusions Depressive and anxiety rates among hospitalized children with epilepsy during COVID-19 outbreak are very high. Pediatric services should deserve special attention to those patientsâ€™ mental health. Regular screening protocols and empowerment interventions in Hospital should be promoted.

We performed face-to face interviews and assessed depressive and anxiety symptoms with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorders (GAD-7) questionnaire during scheduled follow up visits. Results The anxiety score of parents of HCCI was 4.43 Â± 3.17, of which 39.1% of parents were anxious (=5 points), while the depression score was 4.04 Â± 2.67, of which 30.4% of parents show depressive symptoms (=5 points). The prevalence of comorbid depressive and anxiety symptoms was 26.1% among the entire sample. Conclusions Preliminary data of our pilot study showed a high prevalence of anxious depressive symptoms and comorbidity among parents of HCCI. Timely provision of psychologic interventions are needed during and after COVID-19 pandemic in order to empower parenting and promote children recovery and quality of life.

"Suicidal ideation during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in a child and adolescent psychiatry emergency care sample","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic forced many countries to apply restrictive measures. During the first wave Portugal went through a lockdown, and all the child and adolescents had to stay home and could only contact with the oneâ€™s they lived with for several months. Objectives This study aimed to evaluate the impact of those restrictions on suicidal ideation in the pediatric population evaluated in a child and adolescent psychiatry emergency care of a tertiary referral hospital. Methods We conducted an exploratory retrospective study. All the data from discharge notes were collected between March 15thÂ and June 15thÂ of 2020 (n=59), and in the homologous period of the previous year (n=178). The referral after evaluation (primary care, child and adolescent psychiatry consultation, inpatient unit) was considered a measure of severity. Results The demographic variables (sex, age) were homogeneous between the two groups (p = 0,05). 17,4% (n=31) of the sample from 2019, and 16,9% (n=10) of the sample of 2020 had suicidal ideation, which was not statistically different between groups (p=1,000). The referral, after evaluation between groups were also not statistically different (p=0,186). Conclusions Even though the proportion of patients with suicidal ideation was homogenous during the two periods, the total number of patients evaluated in the emergency room were lower during the first wave of Covid-19 pandemic. We assume that the population had fear of seeking help in hospital facilities, but we also believe that the pause on school burdens and the reconnection between some families could have function as protective factors.

"The coronavirus pandemic in Israel: A comparison between holocaust survivors and other older adults","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic places older adults at increased risk for hospitalization and mortality. It also involves social isolation and negative effects of limited mental, social and physical activity. Holocaust survivors could be especially vulnerable to such effects due to their early life traumas. Previous research suggests that in times of life crises, Holocaust survivors may be both most vulnerable (i.e., wear-and-tear hypothesis);yet they may also demonstrate resilience. Objectives Thus, the current study examines the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health and well-being of Holocaust survivors in Israel, compared to adults who did not experience the Holocaust. Methods We collected data from 305 older adults aged 75 and above in Israel during the COVID-19 pandemic. Of these, 114 were Holocaust survivors and 191 did not experience the Holocaust. Participants were asked about their worries of COVID-19 infections, will to live, loneliness and depression and how these changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results Holocaust survivors were worried to a greater extent from COVID-19 infection and from close others becoming infected, compared to older adults who did not experience the Holocaust. Moreover, survivors reported greater loneliness and depression overall and also reported that these measures became worse during the pandemic. On the other hand, despite these differences, the two groups were similar in their will to live. Conclusions Holocaust survivors seem to be more vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic, strengthening the vulnerability hypothesis. Policy makers and practitioners should pay special attention to this particularly vulnerable population during these difficult times.

"Psychosocial consequences of the COVID-19 social isolation in the italian general population: Preliminary results","Introduction Although some philosophers recognize in the loneliness an evolutionary existential process, a 2019 declaration of World Health Organization underlines the major health problem in the worldwide is the perception of state of loneliness. The feeling of loneliness linked to the social isolation (SI) or a lack of social opportunity activate a stressful condition associated to an increase of social dependence. This â€˜learned social helplessnessâ€™ can be dangerous so that it is associated with an increased prevalence of suicides (Cacioppo and Cacioppo, 2018;Bzdok and Dunbar, 2020). Considering the impact of loneliness on the mental health we can assume that the COVID-19 forced SI affects the state of health and psychosocial well-being. Objectives To evaluate the psychosocial impact of the SI in Italy. Methods An ad hoc survey have been sent from May to June 2020. Results These results refer to the Italian survey of a multicenter investigation with partnership of Spain and Portugal universities. The investigation is in progress being a longitudinal study. Of the total 292 subjects investigated (age xM: 34;sD14.13), 118 (40,41%) had been in SI. Subjects forced into SI report more interference in the life satisfaction (p=0.003) though no more anxiety, depression and hostility we found in the SI group. Conclusions During the phase 2 of Italian COVID-19 diffusion, we found an impact on the life satisfaction more than psychopathology. We can assume that the impact of mental health it may occur as the reduction in life satisfaction associated with forced SI continues.","Ciaramella, A.; Rossi, M.; Jarego, M.; Ferreira-Valente, A.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Psychosocial+consequences+of+the+COVID-19+social+isolation+in+the+italian+general+population:+Preliminary+results","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European psychiatry : the journal of the Association of European Psychiatrists; 64(Suppl 1):S311-S311, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-13","",39022,""

In Hubei, China, of which Wuhan is the capital, residents experienced unprecedented stringent lockdowns in the early months of 2020 when COVID-19 was first reported. The comorbidity between PTSD and MDD has been previously studied using network models, but often limited to cross-sectional data and analysis. Objectives: This study aims to examine the cross-sectional and longitudinal network structures of MDD and PTSD symptoms using both undirected and directed methods. Methods: Using three types of network analysis â€“ cross-sectional undirected network, longitudinal undirected network, and directed acyclic graph (DAG) â€“ we examined the interrelationships between MDD and PTSD symptoms in a sample of Hubei residents assessed in April, June, August, and October 2020. We identified the most central symptoms, the most influential bridge symptoms, and causal links among symptoms. Results: In both cross-sessional and longitudinal networks, the most central depressive symptoms included sadness and depressed mood, whereas the most central PTSD symptoms changed from irritability and hypervigilance at the first wave to difficulty concentrating and avoidance of potential reminders at later waves. Bridge symptoms showed similarities and differences between cross-sessional and longitudinal networks with irritability/anger as the most influential bridge longitudinally. The DAG found feeling blue and intrusive thoughts the gateways to the emergence of other symptoms. Conclusions: Combining cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis, this study elucidated central and bridge symptoms and potential causal pathways among PTSD and depression symptoms. Clinical implications and limitations are discussed. HIGHLIGHTS This study examined the cross-sectional and longitudinal network structures of depression and post-traumatic disorder symptoms using undirected and directed methods. The most central depressive symptoms included sadness and depressed mood, whereas the most central post-traumatic disorder symptoms changed from irritability and hypervigilance to difficulty concentrating and avoidance of reminders over time.

"Covid 19-consideration on separation and mourning ritual","Introduction During COVID 19 epidemic it has been interesting to observe the gradual transformation of the daily routine into death, sorrow and pain. The moment of transition from life to death was really changed by distressing for survivors who had to face with unexpected ways to live their mourning. Objectives The paper would like to analyze the mounring ritual during COVID 19 epidemic. Methods During COVID 19 tragedy victims and survivors have been first associated by the infection and then dramatically separated by its effects. It has been necessary to re-relaborate new procedures of separation from deceased, as far for laws prohibitions it was no longer possible to use the traditional ones. Results So a leaving â€œritualâ€ re-emerged very similar to the â€œcrying ritualâ€ of the Southern Italy folkloric culture. The traditional wailers have been substitued by the windows flash mobs trying to replace the forced absence of â€œpietasâ€, with a moment of positive sharing of physical distance between life and death, using sounds, songs, tools that always, in farming culture help to exorcise and take away death. Conclusions The relevant starting powerlessness to face the fast disease diffusion, its intrinsic seriousness, inspired surprising capabilities of immediate reaction and active mobilization in response to the attack suffered by Koerper and Leib (in Heidegger sense) which actualized in the research of a new â€œseparationâ€ dimension.

"Covid 19, lockdown and brief psychotic disorders","Introduction Acute and transient psychotic disorders are a rare condition entity as the sudden appearance of affective, confusional symptoms and paranoia triggered by some psychological trauma. The current pandemic caused by COVID-19 is an important psychological stressor that could favor the appearance of acute psychotic disorders. Several studies have been recently published proposing that the multifactorial stress associated with lockdown could function as a catalyst for acute psychotic disorders. Objectives To present a case of a brief psychotic disorder during the national lockdown in Spain and to review the literature about the relationship between the current pandemic and psychosis. Methods We will present a case report and a literature review. Results We report a case of a 27-year-old woman, with no previous psychiatric history. Three weeks after the start of Spain lockdown sudden symptoms appeared with psychomotor restlessness, confused speech, emotional lability, thought blocking and persecutory and referential delusions. Physical exam, blood analysis and cerebral CT scan with no alterations. Treatment was performed with aripiprazole 10 mg and lorazepam 1 mg daily with clinical improvement in one weeks. She was diagnosed of Acute transient psychotic disorder. Conclusions Stressful life events that can trigger psychosis in vulnerable individuals and the current pandemic and lockdown context could favor the appearance of acute psychotic disorders.

"EVALUATION OF COVID-19 FEAR AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC","Objective The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has an impact on physical health, but also has effects on mental health. With the COVID-19 pandemic, the level of fear increases and fear triggers many psychological diseases such as depression. We aimed to determine the COVID-19 fear situation in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) patients and to examine its relationship with the quality of life. Methodology In this prospective study, 64 patients who underwent HSCT during the pandemic (between 11 March 2020 and 31 December 2020) were included. The COVID-19 fear situation was evaluated with the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S). Quality of life was evaluated with the European Organization for Quality of Life Research and Treatment Core Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) (version 3). Results The median FCV-19S score was 16.5 (12.0-22.0). The FCV-19S score was significantly higher in urban residents than rural residents (19.0 (15.0-23.5) vs 14.0 (9.0-22.0) (p=0.44). The general health score was 59.64 Â± 20.04. The strongest positive correlation between fear level and quality of life was found in emotional function (r=0.474, p &lt;0.01). In addition, a weak, significant, positive correlation was observed between role function, nausea-vomiting, pain, anorexia, and fear level. Conclusion FCV-19S is a short, safe and valid tool that can be used to determine the COVID-19 fear level in vulnerable patient groups such as HSCT patients and to direct them to the necessary psycho-oncological support.","Ã‡elik, Serhat, GÃ¼ven, Zeynep Tugba, &Iacute;pekten, Funda, Keklik, Muzaffer, &Uuml;nal, Ali, Kaynar, LeylagÃ¼l","https://www.google.com/search?q=EVALUATION+OF+COVID-19+FEAR+AND+QUALITY+OF+LIFE+IN+PATIENTS+WITH+HEMATOPOIETIC+STEM+CELL+TRANSPLANTATION+DURING+THE+COVID-19+PANDEMIC","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Hematology, transfusion and cell therapy; 44:S16-S16, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-13","",39027,""
"Taking care of mental wellbeing: updates from the nutraceutical market","According to a European market survey conducted by Innova Market Insights, the main area of customers' concern is related to stress management: 47% of consumers identified it with low mood, while 41% linked it with sleep interruptions. According to a different American Psychological Association poll, 78% of American adults say that the pandemic is a substantial source of stress in their lives, and 67% of those adults claim to have noticed an increase in stress during the Covid-19 outbreak. In this situation, dietary supplements might provide a sophisticated way to assist clients in enhancing their mood, sleep, and cognitive function throughout a trying time. This increased interest may also be attributed to the numerous studies conducted in recent years that link the immune system, gut, and brain, leading to the creation of several substances that have been shown to regulate stress and its associated negative effects. Prior to now, the market has focused on a wider aspect of mental wellbeing related to modern living, stress management, mental fatigue, concentration and memory performances, sleep quality, and depression. In the past, the mental health category has offered solutions to improve mental performance and relaxation. Bacteria can so easily join the market for mental health products, especially in light of recent developments in pharmaceutical formulation research that have made it possible to combine probiotics with botanicals to achieve the best of both worlds.

"Psychopathological consequences and dysfunctional behaviours during the COVID-19 epidemic in italy: A longitudinal study before and after the lockdown","Introduction In the first months of 2020 the COVID-19 epidemic spread in Italy, and the Italian government implemented a general lockdown. These events are at high risk for psychiatric symptoms in the general population, including anxiety/depression and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). Objectives To characterize the psychopathological correlates of the spread of COVID-19 and lockdown in a sample of subjects from the Italian population, with a before-after follow-up. Methods Six weeks after the lockdown, 671 subjects aged 18-60 years completed the Brief Symptom Inventory and Impact of Event Scale-Revised, for the evaluation of psychopathology and PTSS respectively. Environmental factors and subjectively-perceived deteriorations related to COVID-19 were also investigated. Pre-COVID-19 data on psychopathology, collected in December 2019/January 2020, were available for 130 subjects and were used for longitudinal analyses. Results With respect to males, female subjects more frequently reported deteriorations of relations (21.5% vs 10.9%), household arguments (26.0% vs 12.6%), sleep quality (47.6% vs 26.6%), episodes of overeating (22.5% vs 12.5%), worries for oneself (19% vs 8.9%) and for loved ones (55.7% vs 36.5%). These changes were associated with increased psychopathology, PTSS, and numerous environmental conditions, including significant economic damage from COVID-19/lockdown. Longitudinal analyses showed an increase in phobic anxiety in the whole sample, and in depression for female subjects only, following the spread of COVID-19. Pre-existing psychopathology was a significant predictor of PTSS. Conclusions COVID-19 epidemic and lockdown have a high impact on psychopathology and PTSS. Female subjects and those with pre-existing psychopathology were found to be more vulnerable and may need additional support.

"Ethical issues under the pressure of COVID-19 pandemic","The pandemic has highlighted with particular evidence the vulnerability of people with mental disorders and a series of specific ethical concerns regarding their condition. First of all, the risk of receiving poor medical care due to the double stigma of being affected by a mental disorder and Covid infection, in addition to the many other additional barriers, including poverty, marginal housing, and food insecurity. Moreover, in some countries, in a situation where demands for intensive care exceeded the treatment facilities available, the tragical ethical dilemma regarding the choice of people to be saved was resolved with the option in favor of healthier and/or younger people who have more chances of recovery, thus excluding, among others, aged people with severe mental disorders such as dementias. In other countries, ethical concerns emerged related to the enhanced risk of involuntary hospital admission of individuals with severe mental illness mainly due the high likelihood of these patients violating physical-distancing and other safety rules. Social distancing measures have determined, among others, relevant obstacles for direct access to psychiatric care services, with the consequent adoption of the so called â€œtelepsychiatryâ€ of â€œtele mental healthâ€ by mental health services, a measure which unfortunately has cut off a large amount of patients who have not been able to benefit from these innovative methods of care both because of barriers posed by their own serious mental conditions, and by the impossibility of having the necessary technology.

"WHOLE-BODY CRYOSTIMULATION: A REHABILITATION BOOSTER","A growing body of work suggests that whole-body cryostimulation (WBC) could play a role as a promising adjuvant therapy in various conditions of rehabilitation interest. In fact, WBC is currently being used to relieve symptoms in rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, ankylosing spondylitis, depression and anxiety, multiple sclerosis, sleep disturbances, muscle soreness after strenuous physical exercise, post-Covid syndrome and obesity. WBC is not only a symptomatic physical therapy but rather represents an â€œadaptation therapyâ€ because of the repeated shock-like cryogenic cold stimulus over the entire body surface that induces reactions in the autonomic, endocrine, circulatory, neuromuscular and immunological systems, resulting in an adaptation that contributes to the restoration of the homeostatic state. Therefore, based on the existing evidence, WBC can be described as follows: a â€œtraining methodâ€ for the autonomic nervous system;a novel anti-inflammatory and antioxidant treatment;a treatment with beneficial effects on body composition and adipose tissue. In our opinion, the powerful effects of thermal stress on the physiological responses of the human body present unique features that could potentially be exploited to boost rehabilitation outcomes in various conditions. Therefore, we believe it is important to highlight the potential use of WBC for medical use and emphasize its relevance in the field of rehabilitation with the aim of stimulating scientific studies on the efficacy of WBC as an adjuvant treatment in various conditions of rehabilitation interest.

"Effectiveness of Telehealth for Womenâ€™s Preventive Services","ObjectivesTo evaluate the effectiveness, use, and implementation of telehealth for womenâ€™s preventive services for reproductive healthcare and interpersonal violence (IPV), and to evaluate patient preferences and engagement for telehealth, particularly in the context of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.Data sourcesOvid MEDLINEÂ®, CINAHLÂ®, EmbaseÂ®, and Cochrane CENTRAL databases (July 1, 2016, to March 4, 2022);manual review of reference lists;suggestions from stakeholders;and responses to a Federal Register Notice.Review methodsEligible s and full-text articles of telehealth interventions were independently dual reviewed for inclusion using predefined criteria. Dual review was used for data ion, study-level risk of bias assessment, and strength of evidence (SOE) rating using established methods. Meta-analysis was not conducted due to heterogeneity of studies and limited available data.ResultsSearches identified 5,704 unique records. Eight randomized controlled trials, one nonrandomized trial, and seven observational studies, involving 10,731 participants, met inclusion criteria. Of these, nine evaluated IPV services and seven evaluated contraceptive care, the only reproductive health service studied. Risk of bias was low in one study, moderate in nine trials and five observational studies, and high in one study. Telehealth interventions were intended to replace usual care in 14 studies and supplement care in 2 studies. Delivery modes included telephone (5 studies), online modules (5 studies), and mobile applications (1 study), and was unclear or undefined in five studies. There were no differences between telehealth interventions to supplement contraceptive care and comparators for rates of contraceptive use, sexually transmitted infection, and pregnancy (low SOE);evidence was insufficient for abortion rates. There were no differences between telehealth IPV services versus comparators for outcomes measuring repeat IPV, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, fear of partner, coercive control, self-efficacy, and safety behaviors (low SOE). The COVID-19 pandemic increased telehealth utilization. Barriers to telehealth interventions included limited internet access and digital literacy among English-speaking IPV survivors, and technical challenges and confidentiality concerns for contraceptive care. Telehealth use was facilitated by strategies to ensure safety of individuals who receive IPV services. Evidence was insufficient to evaluate access, health equity, or harms outcomes.ConclusionsLimited evidence suggests that telehealth interventions for contraceptive care and IPV services result in equivalent clinical and patient-reported outcomes as in-person care. Uncertainty remains regarding the most effective approaches for delivering these services, and how to best mobilize telehealth, particularly for women facing barriers to healthcare.","Cantor, Amy, Nelson, Heidi D.; Pappas, Miranda, Atchison, Chandler, Hatch, Brigit, Huguet, Nathalie, Flynn, Brittny, McDonagh, Marian","https://www.google.com/search?q=Effectiveness+of+Telehealth+for+Womenâ€™s+Preventive+Services","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (US), Rockville (MD);2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-13","",39032,""
"THE MENTAL HEALTH STATUS OF INPATIENTS WITH NEWLY DIAGNOSED HEMATOLOGICAL CANCER DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC","Objective There is limited data in the literature on the mental health of newly diagnosed hematological cancer (HC) patients in COVID-19 pandemic. This study evaluates the mental health statuses of HC inpatients diagnosed during the COVID-19 pandemic in comparison to the statuses of patients diagnosed with HC before the pandemic. Methodology A cross-sectional survey collected the mental health measurements of 77 inpatients with HC between March and May 2021. The levels of depression, generalized anxiety, distress, sleep disorder, health anxiety, trait anxiety, coronaphobia, and resilience in HC patients newly diagnosed during the pandemic (NDHC) (n=38) and HC patients diagnosed before the pandemic (BPHC) (n=39) were compared. The relationships between predictive factors and cancer patientsâ€™ mental health statuses were evaluated. Results Depression (63.2% vs. 35.9%, p=0.017) and sleep disorder (67.8% vs. 38.5, p=0.016) were significantly higher, while generalized anxiety (57.9% vs. 38.5%, p=0.088) and distress (52.6% vs. 33.3%, p=0.087) were higher in NDHC.Health anxiety was more common in BPHC (53.8% vs. 31.6%, p=0.048).Among NDHC, women had more anxiety symptoms than men (76.5% vs. 42.9%, p=0.037).Diagnosing newly increased the risk of severity of depression and sleep disorders, bu decreased the risk of health anxiety. Conclusion Our data indicate that patients with HC are vulnerable to mental health problems in the COVID-19 pandemic. This vulnerability is higher in newly diagnosed HC patients than in patients diagnosed before the pandemic. These findings may help develop interventions that reduce the vulnerability to adverse psychological effects by identifying risk factors for HC patients under pandemic conditions.","Can, Ferda, Korkmaz, Alperen, Guney, Tekin, Akinci, Sema","https://www.google.com/search?q=THE+MENTAL+HEALTH+STATUS+OF+INPATIENTS+WITH+NEWLY+DIAGNOSED+HEMATOLOGICAL+CANCER+DURING+THE+COVID-19+PANDEMIC","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Hematology, transfusion and cell therapy; 44:S18-S18, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-13","",39033,""
"â€œI am the coronavirusâ€: A case report and review","Introduction As disorders of thought, delusions are modified by patientsâ€™ background, and so their content varies widely according to location and throughout the ages. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown its global impact on society and mental health of the population, thus becoming a new delusional topic. Objectives We report a case where the COVID-19 pandemic has been integrated into a patientâ€™s delusion in an attempt to raise professional awareness for this new psychotic presentation. Methods Review of clinical notes and literature review. Results A 38-year-old female patient with no prior psychiatric history presented with psychotic symptoms characterized by self-referential ideas, feelings of guilt and delusions of ruin, with a sudden onset of less than 24 hours prior to observation. The patient claimed that she was the coronavirus and, as such, she was a common topic of conversation in both television and social media, and the reported deaths caused by COVID-19 were her own doing. As a result of this, the patient was asking doctors to kill her in order to save everyone else affected by the virus. After evaluation, a diagnosis of Acute and Transient Psychotic Disorder was considered. The patient was initially treated with paliperidone, but due to hyperprolactinemia and menstrual changes this was switched to aripiprazole. Symptoms remitted fully after 21 days of treatment, and six months later no recurrences have been described. Conclusions This case illustrates the potential of the coronavirus pandemic outbreak as a new delusional topic. Possible side effects of treatment are also discussed.","Camilo, J.; Silva, R.; Vaz, I.; Roque, M.","https://www.google.com/search?q=â€œI+am+the+coronavirusâ€:+A+case+report+and+review","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European psychiatry : the journal of the Association of European Psychiatrists; 64(Suppl 1):S294-S294, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-13","",39034,""
"New onset of mental disorders, lifestyle changes, and quality of relationships during COVID-19 in italian population","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has been causing relevant public health and psychosocial consequences. Objectives To assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health, lifestyle and personal relationships in the Italian general population. Methods An online survey spread between May and June 2020 to collect socio-demographic, clinical, lifestyle, relationship, and mental health self-reported information. Mental disorder screening was performed by the Patient Health Questionnaire and PTSD Checklist for DSM-5. Results Participants were 2003, 1504 of which (75%) completed the entire questionnaire (1157 females, 77%). Among the completers who have not had any mental disorder before (n=524, 35%), 263 (51.7%) met cut-off scores for psychiatric diagnoses on the self-report psychiatric screeners during the pandemic (i.e., Major Depressive Disorder, 11.3%, with death thoughts in approximately half of the cases;Panic Disorder, 1.1%;Generalized Anxiety Disorder, 13%.3, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, 13.2%, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, 7.3%;Alcohol Abuse, 5.5%). In line with this, 39% of completers complained of insomnia, while 12% and 10% started using anxiolytics and antidepressants, respectively. Approximately 7-8 % of completers started/increased alcohol and/or nicotine consumption, 33% quitted/decreased physical activity, and 40% declared decreased sexual satisfaction. Approximately 21% and 38% declared worsening in relationship with partner and difficulty in child-caring, respectively. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic appears to be a risk factor for new onset of mental disorders and worsening in lifestyle and familial relationships in the Italian population. These results should be confirmed by clinical interviews, and may represent a starting point for further monitoring of the medium and long-term consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Precarious Employment during the COVID-19 Pandemic, Disability-Related Discrimination, and Mental Health","Drawing on separate strands of research documenting the psychological consequences of (a) precarious employment and other challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and (b) ableism, this study incorporates both into an examination of disability-based differences in the joint significance of discrimination and work precarity during the pandemic for mental health. Analyses utilizing data from a regional survey of people with and without disabilities in the Intermountain West (N = 2,012) provide evidence that precarious employment, greater discrimination, and disability independently predict depressive symptoms. Further, in the context of greater discrimination, more precarious employment is found to have greater significance for people with disabilities compared to those who are not currently disabled. These findings challenge us to think about how we engage in research concerning ableism and macro-level stressors, and underscore the role of power structures and positionality in shaping the psychological impact of employment challenges experienced during the pandemic.","Brown, Robyn Lewis, Ciciurkaite, Gabriele","https://www.google.com/search?q=Precarious+Employment+during+the+COVID-19+Pandemic,+Disability-Related+Discrimination,+and+Mental+Health","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Work and occupations;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-13","",39036,""
"Antidepressant use and risk of intubation or death in hospitalized patients with COVID-19: A retrospective cohort study of clinical effectiveness","Initial controlled trials of the serotonergic antidepressant fluvoxamine showed promise for treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in outpatients, although more recent outpatient data have been less encouraging. Turning to studies of hospitalized patients, a retrospective cohort study by Hoertel and associates in 2021 found a markedly reduced risk of intubation or death among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who were receiving serotonergic antidepressants at the time of admission vs. those not receiving antidepressants. In an attempt to replicate these latter findings, we performed a similarly designed study of 500 individuals hospitalized with COVID-19 in a large academic hospital system who were taking a serotonergic antidepressant at the time of admission compared with two groups (N = 573 and N = 593) not receiving an antidepressant. In analyses controlling for demographic and clinical variables, we found no significant difference in effect between the antidepressant group and either of the two comparison groups [hazard ratios (95% CI) for intubation or death 1.1 (0.83â€“1.5) and 1.1 (0.86â€“1.5);and for death alone 1.3 (0.93â€“1.8) and 1.1 (0.85â€“1.7)]. Examining the results of our study, along with those of Hoertel et al. and three additional retrospective cohort studies in inpatients published in the interim, the data permit only very limited conclusions, with the findings on the effect of serotonergic antidepressants ranging from a strongly protective effect to no effect. Although there are numerous threats to validity that might account for this wide range of findings, we could not identify any principal factor or set of factors that could clearly explain the differences.","Brennan, Brian P.; Schnabel, Jiana, Pope, Harrison G.; Hudson, James I.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Antidepressant+use+and+risk+of+intubation+or+death+in+hospitalized+patients+with+COVID-19:+A+retrospective+cohort+study+of+clinical+effectiveness","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Frontiers in psychiatry; 13, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-13","",39037,""
"Psychotic relapse from COVID-19 pandemic: Clinical features","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic affected today more than 76,000,000 worldwide, and more than half of humanity has been placed in quarantine. This pandemic affects mental health problems and influences the onset of symptoms. Objectives The aim of this review is to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychotic disorders and its interaction with the various risk factors. Methods We undertook a review of the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on psychosis. We carried out a systematic review of electronic databases using the keywords â€œCOVID-19â€, â€œpandemicsâ€, â€œpsychotic disordersâ€, and â€œdelusionsâ€. Relevant literature was limited to articles conducted around the world and published between January and December 2020. Results We identified ten papers addressing incident cases of psychosis relapse linked to coronavirus pandemic. In multiple cases, psychotic symptoms were characterized by delusional thoughts about being infected by the coronavirus. The limited access to regular medications and psychosocial interventions was the main factor to psychotic relapse. This review included one cross-sectional clinical study comparing the impact of this pandemic on patients suffering from severe mental illness compared with healthy controls and they found that patients with mental disorders reacted to the pandemic and the lockdown restrictions with higher anxiety levels than the general public. Our study also revealed that elderly people suffering from psychosis and other chronic illness were the most vulnerable to relapse. Conclusions Psychotic disorders can relapse during stressful events like COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, specific attention to these vulnerable subjects is crucial to prevent relapses in times of worldwide pandemic. Disclosure No significant relationships.","Brahmi, L.; Ammar, H.

"COVID-19 pandemic and first episode of psychosis: Clinical characteristics","Introduction The rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic among the world poses challenges to the management of both physical and mental health. This unexpected situation could predict an exacerbation of anxiety, depressions, obsessions, and even multiple cases of psychosis. Objectives The aim of this literature review is to identify and analyze studies conducted in 2020 that investigate the incidence of psychotic disorders, related to COVID-19 pandemic and describe its symptoms. Methods A systematic search in the PubMed electronic database was performed using keywords â€œCOVID-19â€, â€œpandemicsâ€, â€œpsychotic symptomsâ€, and â€œ first episode of psychosisâ€ Relevant literature was limited to articles describing studies conducted and published in 2020. Results 9 papers met the inclusion criteria. The selected studies reported 20 cases of psychosis in patients with no psychiatric history, directly triggered by stress derived from the COVID-19 pandemic and by social distancing and quarantine. All cases were characterized by sudden behavioral changes out of character, increased concern about coronavirus risk infection, anxiety, psychomotor agitation, and insomnia. In multiple cases, psychotic symptoms were characterized by thoughts of reference, persecution, and structured delusional. 5 patients were convinced that COVID-19 Pandemic was part of a conspiracy and that someone was trying to infect them by diffusing the COVID-19 or other pollutants. Half of the patients had the delusional conviction that they got infected and they were contagious. Conclusions COVID-19 pandemic appears to be the trigger for precipitating psychosis which has a high risk of suicidal behavior.

"Professionalsâ€™ experience of the rapid implementation of a remote consultation model of healthcare: A survey of clinicians in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction Despite the availability of remote consolation and the evidence for its effectiveness, its adoption has been relatively limited (Hashiguchi, 2020). In light of COVID social distancing measures, there was an immediate requirement to adopt this technology into routine practice. Objectives The objective of this evaluation was to examine cliniciansâ€™ experiences of the urgent adoption of digital technology in a NHS provider of mental health and community physical health services. Methods From a staff survey (n=234) of experiences of working during a period when there were significant levels of Covid-related restrictions, data was extracted and subject to thematic analysis by a research team made up of clinicians, academics, and quality improvement specialists. Results Five key themes relevant to the urgent adoption of digital technology were identified (figure 1): (1) Availability of staff for patient contact was generally felt to be improved;(2) Quality of contact was reported to be variable (e.g. some respondents reporting better rapport with patients, whereas others found remote contact interfered with rapport building);(3) Safeguarding concerns were reported to be more difficult to identify through remote consultation;(4) Contingency plans were recommended to allow for vulnerable patients for whom remote consultation was a problem;(5) Multi-agency working was reported to be strengthened.

"Anxiety among healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic: Predictive role of social support","Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic may cause elevated levels of anxiety in healthcare professionals (HCP). Identifying factors that could help maintain mental health especially social support could be helpful in facing this stressful situation. Objectives The aim of this study was to asses the relationship between the trait-anxiety and perceived social support among Tunisian HCP in the current pandemic wave of COVID-19. Methods A cross- sectional descriptive and analytic study conducted among Tunisian HCP during November and December 2020. The data were collected by an online questionnaire. The trait-anxiety was assessed using the â€œGeneral Anxiety questionnaire of Spielbergerâ€ (STAI-Y-B). We used the â€œSocial Support Questionnaireâ€ to measure availability and satisfaction regarding perceived social support. Results Participants were 135 HCP, and aged from 24 to 61 years old (average age 31.98 years). The sex ratio was 1.1 (71 males and 64 females). Of HCP involved in the study, 61.5% were single, 36.3% were married and 2.2% were divorced. The average scores of availability and satisfaction regarding perceived social were 7.79 (SD=3.56) and 28.41 (SD=6.75), respectively. Seventy-two of the HCP had a trait-anxious. Analysis showed that social support satisfaction scores were significantly lower in trait-anxious HCP (p&lt;0.001). However, there was no significant difference in the score of availability according to trait-anxiety (p=0.49). Conclusions Our study highlighted the existence of a deficit on perceived social support satisfaction among trait-anxious Tunisian HCP.

"Neutropenia in patients under treatment with clozapine and COVID-19 infection","Introduction Clozapine is among the most effective antipsychotics used for treatment resistant schizophrenia. Adverse reactions to clozapine include neutropenia. Case series report that clozapine-treated patients with COVID-19 have no documented neutropenia. Objectives We sought to investigate the potential adverse effect of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in patients taking clozapine. Methods We retrospectively inspected data of 13 consecutive patients on clozapine, admitted to Highgate Mental Health Centre -Camden & Islington NHS Foundation Trust between March and June 2020. Selection was based on their COVID-19 symptoms presentation and/or COVID-19 positive test. We used a linear regression model with COVID status as independent variable and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) as dependent variable to inform about a correlation between COVID-19 status and neutrophil count. STATA was used for statistics. Results We collected data on thirteen patients of which nine were male. The median age was of 41.97 years;six subjects were Black, three were Asian and four were White Caucasian. Ten subjects tested positive to COVID-19 and 3 were suspected cases -these latter were excluded from stastical analysis. During COVID-19 infection, neutrophils count (ANC) dropped significantly to 4.215 from a baseline value of 5.337. The beta values of 0.83 shows that ANC declined significantly during COVID-19 infection (p =&lt;.0001, R2Â = 95%). In three of thirteen patients, ANC drop was significant and changed the patientsâ€™ monitoring status from green to amber and required frequent blood tests.

"Depression, social networks, and social support during the perinatal and postpartum period among military-affiliated women","The purpose of this dissertation was to provide a foundation for future research aimed at understanding associations between social network analysis measures and perinatal depression symptoms among military spouses. This work summarizes how social network analysis measures have been associated with depression in adults (systematic literature review), what is known regarding perinatal depression in the military-affiliated population (scoping literature review), and provides a description of women's experience of the perinatal period and social support during the COVID-19 pandemic (phenomenological qualitative study).There is a gap in the literature regarding how structural, compositional, and functional SNA characteristics associate with depressive symptoms among adults. However, it does appear that having similar others and various types of social support consistently associates with decreased symptomology. Future studies examining SNA properties and associations with depression in adults should adequately describe the population of interest and statistical analysis methodology. More specific information on which qualities of homophily relate to decreased depression will be helpful to design treatment interventions.I found 10 articles that warranted inclusion in the scoping review addressing perinatal depression among military-affiliated women-there is a scarcity of research being conducted in this field. Major findings include a lack of information from analytical and qualitative study designs. Documenting conflicts of interest and study limitations such as the self-report nature of PND screening tools, were not adequately addressed in the included studies. Future studies should define periods of separation to accurately reflect the influence of deployments and temporary duties as well as aim to capture risk and protective factors for military spouses versus active-duty military women.Lastly, I carried out a phenomenological qualitative study to better understand women's perinatal and social support experiences during the pandemic. My findings indicate that women experienced a wide range of emotions, changes to their perinatal care and social support, other factors that compounded being pregnant or having a baby during a pandemic, and a dissatisfaction with postpartum care. Implications for more effective communication and information on how to receive support during a period of isolation are warranted among this population.

"A comparative study reveals a similar validity of telepsychiatry and face-to-face psychiatric assessment in emergency room setting","Introduction Telepsychiatry (TP) can provide an alternative to traditional face-to-face (FTF) assessments. However, TP in the emergency room setting is much less prevalent, probably due to lack of solid evidence about its effectiveness and acceptability. Objectives To directly compare traditional FTF and TP modalities in the emergency room setting. Methods Psychiatric patients (n=38) presented to the emergency room went through traditional in-person and videoconference TP interviews in varying order. Both FTF and TP interviewers that examined the patients as well as a third psychiatrist, acting as an observer for both modalities, determined the diagnosis, disposition recommendation and indication for involuntary admission. Results Rater decisions had a high matching on disposition and indication for involuntary admission (Cohenâ€™s Kappa (CK) of 0.84/0.81, 0.95/0.87 and 0.89/0.94 for FTF-TP, Observer-FTF and Observer-TP, respectively). Although identical diagnosis matching between the raters was relatively low, the partial diagnosis matching was high (CK of 0.52/0.81, 0.52/0.85 and 0.56/0.85 for FTF-TP, Observer-FTF and Observer-TP, respectively). Telepsychiatry assessments had comparable acceptability in items such as psychiatristsâ€™ certainty and interviewersâ€™ and patientsâ€™ satisfaction. Conclusions TP and FTF psychiatric assessments in the emergency room settings have similar validity and acceptability. Implementation of TP in emergency room settings might improve the mental health servicesâ€™ quality and access especially for remote populations. TP is especially important during the COVID-19 pandemic to enable treatment for epidemiologically isolated patients and to protect the medical personnel.","Bistre, M.; Eitan, R.; Linkovsky, O.; Barash, I.; Juven-Wetzler, A.; Katz, G.; Kohn, Y.; Argo, D.; Teplitz, R.; Fastovsky, N.; Said, M.

"Investigating the perceived effectiveness of eye movement desensitisation reprocessing (EMDR) treatment in adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse and the impact on neuropsychological, emotional and behavioural functioning and quality of life: A case series analysis","Childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is an ongoing issue (WHO, 2017) with 1 in 20 children annually reported as being abused in the UK (NSPCC, 2019;Radford et al, 2011). Many child survivors are of adolescent or young adult age before they request help from relevant services (HAVOCA, 2021;NSPCC, 2018;Noel, Dogaru, and Ellis, 2015;Flatley, 2017). The aim of this study was to investigate the perceived experiences of six young adult female survivors of CSA of their EMDR treatment as well as an assessment of the changes in the individual trauma stress response. This case series analysis explored (a) neuropsychological, emotional (namely low selfesteem, anxiety and depression), behavioural functioning and quality of life issues using descriptive statistics via outcome measures conducted before, during and after treatment and (b) client perspectives through qualitative interviewing at one-month follow-up to ensure adequate time was allowed to monitor changes using Thematic Analysis [TA]. The study setting was within the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) program framework, established to ensure service users accessing NHS treatment are presented with choice in their treatment.The triangulation of data in this study allowed for a deeper analysis of the experiences of adult CSA survivors undergoing EMDR treatment beyond an examination of differences in pre and post outcome measures. The descriptive statistics suggested overall positive changes in participant functioning in all measured domains (three positive, two moderate outcome cases and one sceptical no-improvement case;based on independent research rater feedback) however variable differences in neuropsychological processing from pre- to post-treatment. The descriptive statistics were limited in their generalisability because of certain limitations in data collection as inhibited by COVID-19 restrictions and because of the small sample size. Three key themes were identified in the qualitative analysis which contributed to the literature on treatment of adult CSA survivors by identifying which factors the clients identified as helpful and unhelpful to their treatment. These themes were identified as being an 'Unhelpful' process (service time restrictions, fear of the lack of confidentiality, fear of emotional reprocessing), 'Helpful' aspects of therapy (client choice in treatment, therapist interpersonal and professional skills, psychological resourcing, idiosyncratic approaches) and 'Mixed Responses' due to COVID-19 (face-to-face vs remote working). Overall, this study contributed to the literature about EMDR treatment for adult CSA survivors by shedding insight into the perceived experiences of clients and providing further evidence for the efficacy of this treatment.Importantly, further research could investigate a potentially larger sample, emphasis on neuropsychological functioning, and within differing settings, to understand deficits within the current study. A qualitative study of the perceptions and experiences of childhood sexual abuse survivors who opt for CBT over EMDR might lead to recommendations for changes in protocol that would make EMDR more acceptable. There is scope to further investigate EMDR as a reliable and valid treatment option within NHS IAPT settings, alongside essential service development in therapist training programmes to support the growing need for treatment of multiple-trauma and/or Complex-PTSD (ICD-11, International Classification of Diseases-11, 2018).

"Telework during COVID-19 outbreak: Impact on mental health among Italian workers","Introduction Since February 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 has spread to several countries worldwide, including Italy, leading to an uptake of telework. Objectives We aim to evaluate the psychopathological impact of teleworking during the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, identifying mental health determinants among home-based workers. Methods 804 participants completed an online survey, including the psychometric scales â€œDepression, Anxiety and Stress Scale â€“ 21 itemsâ€ (DASS-21) and the â€œInsomnia Severity Indexâ€ (ISI). Teleworkers were also asked to provide information about their current work routine, home environment and clinical history. Results At the DASS-21, 30% of the participants presented pathological levels of depression, 20.8% of anxiety and 30.7% of stress. At the ISI, 5% appeared to suffer from insomnia. Respondents with psychological and physical frailties, greater social isolation or inadequate working spaces manifested higher levels of psychiatric symptoms. Moreover, we also find a correlation of these symptoms with occupations in education. Telework was broadly appreciated and 87% of respondents expressed a willingness to maintain access to this arrangement. Conclusions Our results document that about a third of our sample manifested psychopathological symptoms while teleworking during the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy. However, telework itself does not seem to be directly associated with increased psychiatric symptoms, which were instead exacerbated by COVID-19-related stressful circumstances, as well as by constitutional and social determinants of health. Going forward, authorities should promote adequate measures in order to guarantee a healthy approach to teleworking.

"Prevalence of maternal burn out and depression in tunisia during the coronavirus pandemic","Introduction Lockdown due to coronavirus pandemic has been a stressful experience especially to mothers. Juggling work from home and childcare has led to maternal burn out and depression. Objectives The aim of the present study was to assess maternal burn-out rate during lockdown and its eventual relationship with depression and associated factors Methods 156 Tunisian mothers responded to online questionnaire posted on social network after 1 month of lockdown. The questionnaire evaluated burnout and depression as measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and depression and anxiety symptoms (HADS) respectively. Results The participants were aged between 24 and 64 years and 61.5% had more than one child. Mean score on the BMS10 was 4.11 out of 7 maximum score with 71.8% of participants fulfilling criteria for maternal burn-out. Among them, 30.1% had high level of burn out and 9.6% extreme burn out. The main factors associated with maternal burn out were age of children, financial difficulties and lack of leisure activities. Motherâ€™s age, perceived husband support, medical or psychiatric history havenâ€™t been associated with maternal burn out. HADS questionnaire indicated that 38.5% of mothers had moderate to severe anxiety disorder and 35,9% had moderate to severe depressive disorder. A postive correlation was found between burnout and anxiety (r=0.634, p&lt;0.001) and burn out and depression (r=0.515, p&lt;0.001). Conclusions The prevalence of maternal burn out during lockdown was significantly high resulting in higher rate of depression than ususal. However, severe forms of burnout may share several characteristics with depression raising the question of overlap of these two entities.","Bergaoui, E.; Lansari, R.; Karmous, A.; Larnaout, A.; Melki, W.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Prevalence+of+maternal+burn+out+and+depression+in+tunisia+during+the+coronavirus+pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European psychiatry : the journal of the Association of European Psychiatrists; 64(Suppl 1):S261-S261, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-13","",39047,""
"Depression, anxiety, and perceived stress during a pandemic: An understanding of the psychological impact of COVID-19 on a university community","COVID-19 is a viral infectious disease that first occurred in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and by March 2020, it was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Mental health - especially as it relates to physical distancing, loneliness, and stress - is a major public health concern as the COVID-19 pandemic continues. The social, economic, and environmental effects have been associated with emotional distress, anxiety, loneliness, boredom, depression, irritability, frustration, insomnia, blaming, anger, panic attacks, delirium, general fear, fear of dying or falling sick, helplessness, confusion, and stigma. Despite the increased attention on mental health and the psychological impact of COVID-19 on the general population, and even student populations, studies have been primarily conducted outside the United States (U.S.) and focused on the immediate aftermath or earliest stages of the pandemic. Few studies have focused on university communities and even fewer included faculty and staff in the study population. Furthermore, many evaluated the immediate aftermath or earliest stages of the pandemic rather than possible effects months or a full year later. Given this, the purpose of this three-manuscript dissertation was to understand ""what impact has COVID-19 had on the psychological wellbeing of faculty, staff, and students at a public American research university?"" and includes three primary aims: 1) to explore how sociodemographic factors are related to the psychological impact of COVID-19 on a collegiate community;2) to evaluate the association between physical distancing and psychological impact, with past community trauma and social support as effect modifiers;and 3) to evaluate the association between perceived stress and depression and anxiety symptoms with resilient coping and social support as mediators of this relationship. Two frameworks guided this study - the Social and Cultural Determinants of Mental Disorders Framework by Lund, et al. and the Stress Buffering Model by Cohen & Willis.This quantitative study employed primary data collection. A cross-sectional study of a university population used a web-based, online questionnaire to collect information on the psychological impact of COVID-19 as evidenced by anxiety symptoms (using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item Scale), depression symptoms (using the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item Scale), and perceived stress (using the Perceived Stress Scale). The questionnaire also used the DeJong Geirveld Loneliness Scale to assess loneliness, the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support to assess perceived social support, and the Brief Resilient Coping Scale (BRCS) to measure resilient coping. An email was sent via an anonymous link to every member of the university - all faculty, students, and staff - who were working or enrolled at the university prior to the start of the Spring 2020 semester (i.e. January 8, 2020). Data were collected over ten weeks between December 2020 and February 2021. Summary statistics of the sociodemographic characteristics of participants and outcomes were calculated. Both ordinal and binary logistic regression was used to obtain odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals to provide unadjusted measures of the associations between each of the exposures and outcomes, depending on the study. Multivariate ordinal and logistic regression models, controlling for confounders, were created by including all the potential predictors in each model and then using a backwards elimination procedure to retain only predictor variables with p &lt;0.20. In chapter three, stratified analyses were used to evaluate whether past community trauma or perceived social support modified the physical distancing and psychological wellbeing association.

"The psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and confinement period on a tunisian sample","Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019, is now a global pandemic that has spread rapidly causing many deaths. Most countries have opted for compulsory confinement which had repercussions on mental health and well-being. Objectives The purpose of this study is to assess mental health consequences during the confinement period. Methods This is a cross-sectional descriptive study of 360 Tunisians in April and May 2020. We used an anonymous E-questionnaire that included a socio-demographic fact sheet, The HAD questionnaire, and a Q-EDD questionnaire to explore eating disorders. Results The subjects of our sample were mostly males with a mean age of 31. The body mass index was 25.5 (range 16.10 -46.24), 15% suffered from obesity. Half of the subjects were single and 6.7% spent the confinement time alone. 11.1% were smokers while 4.4% were alcohol users. The HAD-A and the HAD-D scores had an average of 9.1 and 8.48 respectively.A pathological threshold of anxiety and depression was found in 20% and 30% of the sample respectively.15% had an eating disorder: 76% had binge eating, 20% had bulimia and 17% had anorexia. In our study, we found an association between eating disorder and obesity, single marital status (p=0.007), living alone (p=0.001), history of depression (p=0.046), anxiety (p=0.049) and depression (p=0.038). Conclusions Reduced social interactions, decreased physical activity and increased stress are potentially harmful causes for our brain. Confining the population for several weeks has a negative impact on our physical and mental health. A crisis unit has been formed in Tunisia to help subjects overcome these psychological difficulties.","Bejar, M.; Mohamed, B. Ben, Faouel, N.; Ali, R.

"Attachment, avoidance, and disenfranchised grief in college students during the COVID-19 pandemic","Covid-19 changed the world. For college students attending four-year institutions in America, their changes and losses looked like moving off-campus, losing social circles, graduations, professional opportunities, and much more. Mental health concerns among college students increased significantly during the pandemic and as did the amount of loss this population experienced. If grief is not properly validated by another, it can become disenfranchised and leads to even more mental health concerns. Attachment styles and grief have been linked, but mostly as it relates to bereavement. This study explored the attachment styles of college students and the levels of disenfranchised grief and grief avoidance they experienced. Upon data collection, a surprising majority of participants reported fearful attachment causing the analysis to shift from a MANOVA to correlations. There was no difference found in reports of disenfranchised grief when it came to year in college, gender, or ethnicity. Those who reported not experiencing a Covid-related death had high reports of disenfranchised grief and tendencies to avoid their grief.

"Distress and burnout among psychiatrists during the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. The WHO on March 11, 2020, has declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic. Several studies found an association between the COVID-19 pandemic and psychiatric symptoms, such as distress, anxiety, fear of infection, depression and insomnia in the general population. Therefore, psychiatrists have been professionally overloaded, trying to manage the psychosocial impact of the pandemic and suffering its effects in person. Objectives To evaluate the disease perceptions, distress and burnout among psychiatrists from the Department of Mental Health and Addictions of Pavia in three different times, which correspond to the three main phases of the pandemic management in Italy: T0 is the first peak of the infections and the lock-down, from March to June;T1 is the reduction of the infections and the reopening, from June to October;T2 is the second wave of infections with a new progressive closure, the current one. Methods We used three questionnaires: the BIPQ (Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire), the PSS-10 (Perceived Stress Scale-10), the PED (Profile of emotional distress). We also used a survey (6 items) in T0, T1 and T2 to evaluate exposure, perception, quality of life and burnout. Results table 1,2,3. BIPQ: no one was exposed.

"COVID-19 in forensic psychiatry settings: The unique vulnerability of patients in secure services","Introduction Secure forensic mental health services treat patient with high rates of treatment resistant psychoses, typically schizophrenia. These groups have high rates of obesity and medical co-morbidities. Population based studies have identified high risk groups in the event of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including those with long term medical conditions. Objectives The aim of this study was to compare the vulnerability to serious adverse outcome in the event of COVID-19 infection in a forensic psychiatric patient population. Methods All patients of a complete National Forensic Mental Health Service (n=141) were rated for risk of adverse outcome in the event of SARS-CoV-2 infection, using two structured tools, the COVID-AGE tool and the COVID-Risk tool. Results Eighty-two patients (58.2%) met criteria for obesity, 32 had type II diabetes and 28 were hypertensive. Mean chronological age was 45.5 years (SD 11.4, median 44.1), while mean COVID-AGE was 59.1 years (SD 19.4, median 58.0), mean difference 13.6 years (SD 15.6) paired t=10.9, df=140, p=0.000. Three patients (2.1%) were chronologically over 70 years compared to 40 (28.4%) with a COVID-AGE over 70 (X2=6.99, df=1, p=0.008, Fishers exact test p=0.027). Conclusions These risk assessments may identify the extent of increased risk among a uniquely medically vulnerable patient group. Patients in secure forensic psychiatric services represent a high-risk group for adverse outcomes in the event of SARS-COV-2 infection. Population based cocooning and self-isolating guidance based on chronological age may not be sufficient.

"Brazilian version of the postpartum depression screening scale-24","Introduction The PDSS-24 is a Portuguese short version of the Postpartum Depression Screening Scale (Beck and Gable, 2002). Items were selected on the basis of exploratory factor analysis (those with loadings &gt;.60). The PDSS-24 proved to be superior to the 35-items PDSS in reliability, validity and screening ability (Pereira et al. 2013). Objectives To analyze the psychometric properties (construct validity using Confirmatory Factor Analysis, discriminant validity and reliability) of the Brazilian preliminary version of PDSS-24 Methods After confirming the items semantic equivalence and slightly adapt two adjectives from European to Brazilian Portuguese, 350 pregnant women (Mean age: 30.01Â±5.452;Mean gestation weeks=25.17Â±6.55), with uncomplicated pregnancies, completed the PDSS-24 and the Brazilian recently validated versions of Profile of Mood States-25 (PoMS;Barros et al. 2021). SPSS and AMOS software were used. Results After some errors were correlated the multidimensional second-order model of PDSS-24 presented an aceptable fit (<U+03C7>2=3.448;RMSEA=.099;CFI=.817, TLI=.886, GFI=.886). The PDSS Cronbachâ€™s alpha for the total was a=.90. Cronbach alpha was .90 for the total and &gt;.75 for the dimensions. Appling the Portuguese validated cut-off score for Major Depression/DSM-5 (&gt;42) to this sample 224 (64.0%) participants presented clinical relevant depressive symptoms. Conclusions The Brazilian PDSS-24 has acceptable validity and reliability. The percentage of women with high depressive symptomatology is three times higher than the figures reported in Portuguese Studies. This can be partly explained by the fact that data collection was done during the COVID19 pandemic.

"Levels of depressive and anxious symptoms of pregnant women before vs during the COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction The effects on the populationâ€™s mental health due to the rapid global spread of COVID-19 are even greater for specific groups such as pregnant women. Objectives To compare levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms of pregnant women before vs. during the COVID-19 pandemic and to analyze the role of COVID-19 fear in perinatal psychological disorder. Methods 200 Brazilian women evaluated during the pandemic in May-June 2020 (Sample-1) with the Brazilian Covid-19 Fear Scale for the Perinatal Period (Barros et al. 2020) and Screening for Perinatal Depression and the Perinatal Anxiety Crawl Scale, both with a&gt; .90. Sample-1 was compared with a sample of 300 Portuguese women;these responded to the same questionnaires, before the pandemic, in 2017 and 2018 (Sample-2). Results Sample-1 had significantly higher mean scores of depression (52.73 Â± 20.26 vs. 35.87 Â± 16.98, t = 10.77, p &lt;.001) and anxiety (36.58 Â± 18.23 vs. 18.50 Â± 13.71, t = 11.94, p &lt;.001) and correlated significantly (p &lt;.05) and moderate (r.30) with the fear of COVID-19. Hierarchical regression analyzes showed that, even after controlling for the effect of risk factors for PPP (Pereira et al. 2020), fear of COVID-19 is a significant predictor of depressive symptomatology levels (increments of 2-5%) and anxious (10-15%) during the pandemic. Conclusions The Sample-1 being from a different country may be a confusing factor, however, the magnitude of differences in PPP levels and the relevant role of fear in COVID-19, alert us to be aware of perinatal mental health.","Barros, M.; Aguiar, M.; Macedo, A.; Azevedo, J.; Pereira, A.

"COVID-19 pandemic and eating disorders: What impact on specific and general psychopathology?","Introduction The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the resulting containment measures, such as â€œlockdownâ€ and â€œsocial distancingâ€, have had important consequences on peopleâ€™s mental and physical health. Objectives We aimed to study the effect of social isolation and subsequent re- exposure and eventual changes in general and ED-specific psychopathology in people with Eating Disorders (EDs). Methods Three-hundred twelve Italian people with EDs (179 Anorexia Nervosa, 83 Bulimia Nervosa, 48 Binge Eating Disorder and 22 Other Specific Feeding Eating Disorder) were asked to fill-in an online survey to explore several dimensions such as: anxiety, depression, panic, insomnia, suicide ideation, stress, post-traumatic stress and obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Differences in ED specific and general symptoms among the 3 investigated time periods (before, during and after the end of lockdown) were assessed with a one-way ANOVA with repeated measures. Subsequently, ED diagnosis was introduced as covariate in the analysis in order to investigate the possible contribution on psychopathological changes. Results ED core symptoms increased during the lockdown but most of them returned to pre-COVID19 levels at re-opening. The severity of general psychopathology also increased during the lockdown and persisted high in the following phase, except for depression and suicide ideation. None of this symptoms was affected by ED diagnosis, participantsâ€™age and illness duration.

The ELLIPSE (E-Lifelong Learning In Prevention of Suicide in Europe) (www.e-llipse.com) is the first international project in the area of education in suicide prevention in the higher education co-founded by the European Union Erasmus+ programme. We will reflect on some opportunities and challenges due to COVID-19 pandemics. Identified opportunities: 1) learning a new way of communicating, 2) reaching more participants (in case of Sweden we were able to get participants from more regions, 3) more frequent meetings heightening the quality of the project, 4) travelling less (online is the more eco-friendly solution). But there were also some challenges: 1) not be able to proceed according to the preliminary plan generated much more administrative work, 2) online meetings was a challenge for those partners who had problems adjusting to the online form of communication, 3) more negative attitudes to the canal of communication resulted in avoiding it, leading to less frequent interactions what resulted in diminished motivation to the project, and being unable to proceed with project tasks, 4) resignation of some patients from participation because of difficulties in accepting the online form of communication. We will discuss these issues in a more detailed way during the interactive workshop.

"A Mixed Methods Study of Functioning and Rehabilitation Needs Following COVID-19","COVID-19 can lead to a long-term loss of functioning, which may affect activities and participation in daily living in various ways. The extent and characteristics of post-COVID-19 persistent symptoms are currently being studied extensively worldwide. The purpose of this exploratory study is to explore functioning and rehabilitation needs among persons with self-reported disability following COVID-19. This mixed methods study is based on data from patient-reported outcome measures (PRO), tests of body functions, visual drawings and focus groups among persons with self-reported disability after having suffered from COVID-19. PRO covered quality of life, activity and participation. Tests of body functions targeted strength and endurance. Focus groups and visual drawings elaborated on how post COVID-19 persistent symptoms affected functioning, activities and daily living. Data was collected in August and September 2020. The study sample consisted of 11 women, nine men, aged 35â€“79 years. Self-reported PRO data showed low quality of life and disability among the participants primarily related to fatigue, energy and drive, breathing and concentration. Tests of body functions showed low strength in lower extremities but otherwise no striking limitations on a group level. Analysis of the focus groups generated the following four themes: (1) Persistent symptoms, particularly in regards to concentration, memory, lack of energy, fatigue and headaches. (2) Balancing activities in daily living with fluctuating symptoms. (3) Uncertainty and Powerlessness, which included a need for directional guidance in order to regain functioning and unmet needs regarding further clinical assessment of persistent symptoms, referral to rehabilitation and returning to work. (4) Hope associated with the experiences of recovery - and for the future. This study highlights that persons with persistent symptoms after COVID-19 may experience a range of limitations in their daily living. This points toward a need for individual assessment and guidance to tailor relevant rehabilitation.","Backmann, Tina, Maribo, Thomas, Zwisler, Ann-Dorthe, Davidsen, Jesper RÃ¸mhild, Rottmann, Nina","https://www.google.com/search?q=A+Mixed+Methods+Study+of+Functioning+and+Rehabilitation+Needs+Following+COVID-19","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Frontiers in rehabilitation sciences; 2, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-13","",39057,""

"Psychiatric clinical profiles and pharmacological interactions in COVID-19 inpatients referred to a consultation liaison psychiatry unit","Introduction The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) can affect mental health in different ways. There is little research about psychiatric complications in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Objectives The aim of the study was to describe the psychiatric clinical profile and pharmacological interactions in COVID-19 inpatients referred to a Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry (CLP) unit. Methods This is a cross-sectional retrospective study, carried out at a tertiary hospital in Spain, in inpatients admitted because of COVID-19 and referred to our CLP Unit from March 17,2020 to April 28,2020. Clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records. The patients were divided in three groups depending on psychiatric diagnosis: delirium, severe mental illness (SMI) and non-severe mental illness (NSMI). Results Of 71 patients included (median [ICR] age 64 [54-73] years;70.4% male), 35.2% had a delirium, 18.3% had a SMI, and 46.5% had a NSMI. Compared to patients with delirium and NSMI, patients with SMI were younger, more likely to be institutionalized and were administered less anti-COVID19 drugs. Mortality was higher among patients with delirium (21.7%) than those with SMI (0%) or NSMI (9.45%). The rate of side effects due to interactions between anti-COVID19 and psychiatric drugs was low, mainly drowsiness (4.3%) and borderline QTc prolongation (1.5%). Conclusions Patients affected by SMI were more often undertreated for COVID-19. However, the rate of interactions was very low, and avoidable with a proper evaluation and drug-dose adjustment. Half of the patients with SMI were institutionalized, suggesting that living conditions in residential facilities could make them more vulnerable to infection.

"Stress, health and lifestyle behaviours during COVID-19 home confinement in portuguese adults","Introduction The confinement associated with COVID-19 pandemic was an experience with significant physical and mental health implications, including higher stress levels, decreased sleep quality, pain symptoms and changes in lifestyle behaviours. Objectives The main goal of this study was to analyze the relationship between stress and health variables (sleep, health symptoms, health perception, and lifestyle behaviours) in a Portuguese university during COVID-19 home confinement. Methods A cross-sectional online survey design was conducted. A sample of 263 Portuguese workers (64.3% females), with mean age of 48.3 years (sd=8.9), filled in the PSS10, answering questions concerning health symptoms (perceived health, pain symptoms and fatigue), lifestyle behaviours (sleep and eating habits, use of alcohol and tobacco) during COVID-19 home confinement. A descriptive statistical analysis, a Pearson correlation analyses and the t Student test, for independent samples, were performed. Results The results showed significant correlations between stress and perceived health (r=-.404;p&lt;.0001), arms pain (r=.212;p=.002), legs pain (r=.201;p=.003), back pain (r=.219;p=.001), headache (r=.289;p&lt;.0001) and fatigue (r=.295;p&lt;.0001). Concerning lifestyle behaviours, the results showed significant correlations between stress and sleep (r=-.552;p&lt;.0001) and stress is significantly higher (p&lt;.0001) in individuals who have changed their eating habits. Conclusions During the COVID-19 home confinement, higher stress levels are associated with a worse perception of health, more pain symptoms (legs, arms, back, headache), worse sleep quality and more fatigue. Moreover, the individuals with higher levels of stress have changed their eating habits. Lastly, health promotion interventions are needed in order to minimize the impact of home confinement in health.","Amaral, A. P.; Figueiredo, J.; Ferreira, A.; Seco, S.; Loureiro, A.; Costa, L.

"Quarantine-related depression and anxiety during coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak","Introduction Psychological well-being has an important impact on individuals. In the face of the health threat of COVID-19, psychological changes as fear stress anxiety and depression is reported. Objectives Explore the prevalence of depression and anxiety among people under quarantine during the COVID-19 outbreak in Saudi Arabia. Methods A cross-sectional study of a convenience sample of 65 participants who were quarantined at multiple hotels under the supervision of the Saudi Ministry of Health. The patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9) and generalized anxiety disorder questionnaire (GAD-7) were used to assess depression and anxiety. Results The majority of the participants were male (66.2%), aged 18â€“29 (47.7%) from the Eastern region (66.15%), who were still waiting for the result of the COVID-19 test (64.6%). Approximately half of the sample had depressive and anxiety symptoms (49.2% and 44.6%, respectively). The depression mean score was significantly higher only among the 18â€“29 age group. However, the depression and anxiety mean scores were higher among females than males and among participants with positive COVID-19 test results compared to those who had pending or negative results. The anxiety mean score was higher during the first week of quarantine, but the depression mean score was higher during later weeks. Conclusions Depression and anxiety were prevalent among people in quarantine during the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in Saudi Arabia. It is crucial to study the most effective interventions to reduce the psychological consequences, especially for vulnerable groups. Longitudinal research studies need to be conducted to follow up regarding participantsâ€™ mental health symptoms and evidence-based interventions.

"Parental subjective wellbeing during the COVID-19 lockdown: Evidence from the epicenter of a pandemic crisis","Introduction The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) health emergency has led national states to adopt severe actions forcing many people to cope with new and unexpected challenges. Those constraints risked to jeopardized the mental health and subjective wellbeing (SWB) of individuals. Objectives The present cross-sectional quantitative study explored whether and to what extent psychological and social aspects were determinants of parental SWB as outcome variable during the COVID-19 lockdown. Methods The sample was composed of 304 Italian parents (93% female, mean age 41.5, 91% from Lombardy). Data were gathered through Computer Assisted Web Interview (CAWI) four weeks after the beginning of the national lockdown. World Health Organization (WHO) wellbeing scale along with other self-reported measures of social support, feelings of abandonment, feeling of being equipped and adequacy of living spaces were administered. Data were analyzed by hierarchical regression models (Ethics Committee of Milano-Bicocca University approval N.0034537/20) Results According to the WHO cutoff score, 37.7% of parents reported low well-being levels. The regression model (F=11.2, p&lt;.001) suggested that the feeling of abandonment and the feeling of being equipped were the most important contributors to SWB. Other statistically significant (but with lower effect sizes) variables were the support received by the partner and the adequacy of living spaces. Conclusions The findings bear out the pivotal importance of subjective states (such as feelings of abandonment or perceptions of being poorly equipped) in relation to the levels of parental SWB during the COVID-19 lockdown. Implications for planning psychological interventions aimed at strengthening personal resources to face the emergency are discussed.

"9th Annual Symposium on Global Cancer Research;Global Cancer Research and Control: Looking Back and Charting a Path Forward, 10-11 March 2021","These proceedings contains 114 articles that discuss building toward resilient health systems as the main topic of the first ASGCR plenary. Speakers stressed the significance of collaborations, adaptation, and innovation while highlighting crucial gaps that have appeared in the face of serious threats and emergencies like COVID-19, climate change, and political shifts. In order to close the gap between research and practice in cancer prevention and control in LMICs, this workshop covered evidence-based and cutting-edge solutions. The sometimes transient nature of many programs and initiatives was discussed, along with the difficulties of sustainability in the face of conflicting priorities and dangers to reliable health systems. Nevertheless, even as it discussed past failings, the event also recognised significant gains and started a conversation about resilient building patterns. The second plenary addressed equality in international cancer research, acknowledging the inequalities in the field's translational capacity. Research in LMICs has frequently led to important advances in cancer science, such as the early Burkitt lymphoma treatment trials in Uganda and the human papillomavirus immunisation trials in Costa Rica. The LMIC groups who contributed to these triumphs have frequently not received the rewards of this progress fairly. Inequities in cancer between high-income countries (HIC) and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) also lead to research that fails to take into account the entire scientific worth of studies carried out in LMICs as well as the worldwide burden of disease. Established power imbalances that are frequently related to funding sources can hinder the development of HIC's career and local knowledge. To ensure the translation of research findings, suggestions included multisectoral stakeholder engagement across entire health systems, such as finance and education, as well as proper humility and listening on the part of HIC researchers and funders. Additionally, the chance for two-way information exchange and learning, respecting local knowledge, and developing trust to ensure successful relationships were noted. In turn, successful collaborations and active community involvement were considered as the way to effectively translate and disseminate research findings.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=9th+Annual+Symposium+on+Global+Cancer+Research;Global+Cancer+Research+and+Control:+Looking+Back+and+Charting+a+Path+Forward,+10-11+March+2021","","Database: CAB Abstracts; Publication type: article; Publication details: Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention; 30(7 Suppl):4-114, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-13","",39079,""
"The Role of Epigenetic Regulator SIRT1 in Balancing the Homeostasis and Preventing the Formation of Specific ""Soil"" of Metabolic Disorders and Related Cancers","SIRT1 was discovered in 1979 but growing interest in this protein occurred only 20 years later when its overexpression was reported to prolong the lifespan of yeast. Since then, several studies have shown the benefits of its increased expression in preventing or delaying of many diseases. SIRT1, as a histone deacetylase, is an epigenetic regulator but it has wide range of non-histone targets which are involved in metabolism, energy sensing pathways, circadian machinery and in inflammatory regulation. Disturbances in these interconnected processes cause different diseases, however it seems they have common roots in unbalanced inflammatory processes and lower level or inactivation of SIRT1. SIRT1 inactivation was implicated in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) severity as well and its low level counted as a predictor of uncontrolled COVID-19. Several other diseases such as metabolic disease, obesity, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular disease or depression are related to chronic inflammation and similarly show decreased SIRT1 level. It has recently been known that SIRT1 is inducible by calorie restriction/proper diet, physical activity and appropriate emotional state. Indeed, a healthier metabolic state belongs to higher level of SIRT1 expression. These suggest that appropriate lifestyle as non-pharmacological treatment may be a beneficial tool in the prevention of inflammation or metabolic disturbance-related diseases as well as could be a part of the complementary therapy in medical practice to reach better therapeutic response and quality of life. We aimed in this review to link the beneficial effect of SIRT1 with those diseases, where its level decreased. Moreover, we aimed to collect evidences of interventions or treatments, which increase SIRT1 expression and thus, open the possibility to use them as preventive or complementary therapies in medical practice.","Nemeth, Kiss, Takacs","https://doi.org/10.31083/j.fbl2709253","20221012","SIRT1; cancer prevention; health; lifestyle; metabolism; methylation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-13","",39080,""
"Can we mitigate the psychological impacts of social isolation using behavioural activation? Long-term results of the UK BASIL urgent public health COVID-19 pilot randomised controlled trial and living systematic review","Behavioural and cognitive interventions remain credible approaches in addressing loneliness and depression. There was a need to rapidly generate and assimilate trial-based data during COVID-19. We undertook a parallel pilot RCT of behavioural activation (a brief behavioural intervention) for depression and loneliness (Behavioural Activation in Social Isolation, the BASIL-C19 trial ISRCTN94091479). We also assimilate these data in a living systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42021298788) of cognitive and/or behavioural interventions. Participants (Ã¢â€°Â¥65 years) with long-term conditions were computer randomised to behavioural activation (n=47) versus care as usual (n=49). Primary outcome was PHQ-9. Secondary outcomes included loneliness (De Jong Scale). Data from the BASIL-C19 trial were included in a metanalysis of depression and loneliness. The 12 months adjusted mean difference for PHQ-9 was -0.70 (95% CI -2.61 to 1.20) and for loneliness was -0.39 (95% CI -1.43 to 0.65).The BASIL-C19 living systematic review (12 trials) found short-term reductions in depression (standardised mean difference (SMD)=-0.31, 95% CI -0.51 to -0.11) and loneliness (SMD=-0.48, 95% CI -0.70 to -0.27). There were few long-term trials, but there was evidence of some benefit (loneliness SMD=-0.20, 95% CI -0.40 to -0.01; depression SMD=-0.20, 95% CI -0.47 to 0.07). We delivered a pilot trial of a behavioural intervention targeting loneliness and depression; achieving long-term follow-up. Living meta-analysis provides strong evidence of short-term benefit for loneliness and depression for cognitive and/or behavioural approaches. A fully powered BASIL trial is underway.

To characterize the state of governmental public health workforce among state health agency (SHA) staff across the United States and provide longitudinal comparisons to 2 prior fieldings of the survey. State health agency leaders were invited to have their workforce to participate in PH WINS 2021. As in prior fieldings, participating agencies provided staff lists used to send e-mail invitations to employees to participate in this electronic survey. State health agency staff. PH WINS 2021 maintains the 4 primary domains from 2014 and 2017 (ie, workplace engagement, training needs assessment, emerging public health concepts, and demographics) and includes new questions related to the mental and emotional well-being; the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on staff retention; and the workforce's awareness of and confidence in emerging public health concepts. The percentage of SHA staff who self-identify as Black, Indigenous, and people of color increased from 30% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 29%-32%) to 35% (95% CI: 35%-37%) between 2014 and 2021. Staff younger than 31 years accounted for 11% (95% CI: 10%-12%) of the SHA workforce in 2021 compared with 8% in 2014 (95% CI: 8%-9%). From 2014 to 2021, staff who self-identify as a woman increased from 72% (95% CI: 71%-74%) to 76% (95% CI: 75%-77%).

"Working in the digital economy: A systematic review of the impact of work from home arrangements on personal and organizational performance and productivity","Work-from-home has become an increasingly adopted practice globally. Given the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, such arrangements have risen substantially in a short timeframe. Work-from-home has been associated with several physical and mental health outcomes. This relationship has been supported by previous research; however, these health and safety issues often receive little resources and attention from business perspectives compared to organizational and worker performance and productivity. Therefore, aligning work-from-home practices with business goals may help catalyze awareness from decision makers and serve to effectively implement work-from-home policies. We conducted a review to synthesize current knowledge on the impact of work-from-home arrangements on personal and organizational performance and productivity. Four large databases including Scopus, PubMed, PsychInfo, and Business Source Complete were systematically searched. Through a two-step screening process, we selected and extracted data from 37 relevant articles. Key search terms surrounded two core concepts: work-from-home and productivity/performance. Of the articles published prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, 79% (n = 19) demonstrated that work-from-home increased productivity and performance whereas 21% (n = 5) showed mixed or no effects. Of the articles published during the pandemic, 23% (n = 3) showed positive effects, 38% (n = 5) revealed mixed results, and 38% (n = 5) showed negative effects. Findings suggest that non-mandatory work-from-home arrangements can have positive impacts on productivity and performance. When work-from-home becomes mandatory and full-time, or external factors (i.e., COVID-19 pandemic) are at play, the overall impacts are less positive and can be detrimental to productivity and performance. Results will help foster an understanding of the impact of work-from-home on productivity and performance and inform the development of organizational strategies to create an effective, resilient, and inclusive work-from-home workplace by helping to effectively implement work-from-home policies that are aligned with business goals.","Hackney, Yung, Somasundram, Nowrouzi-Kia, Oakman, Yazdani","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0274728","20221012","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-13","",39083,""
"Mental Health Mobile Apps in the French App Store: Assessment Study of Functionality and Quality","Approximately 800 million people, representing 11% of the world's population, are affected by mental health problems. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated problems and triggered a decline in well-being, with drastic increase in the incidence of conditions such as anxiety, depression, and stress. Approximately 20,000 mental health apps are listed in mobile app stores. However, no significant evaluation of mental health apps in French, spoken by approximately 300 million people, has been identified in the literature yet. This study aims to review the mental health mobile apps currently available on the French Apple App Store and Google Play Store and to evaluate their quality using Mobile App Rating Scale-French (MARS-F). Screening of mental health apps was conducted from June 10, 2022, to June 17, 2022, on the French Apple App Store and Google Play Store. A shortlist of 12 apps was identified using the criteria of selection and assessed using MARS-F by 9 mental health professionals. Intraclass correlation was used to evaluate interrater agreement. Mean (SD) scores and their distributions for each section and item were calculated. The highest scores for MARS-F quality were obtained by Soutien psy avec Mon Sherpa (mean 3.85, SD 0.48), Evoluno (mean 3.54, SD 0.72), and Teale (mean 3.53, SD 0.87). Mean engagement scores (section A) ranged from 2.33 (SD 0.69) for Reflexe reussite to 3.80 (SD 0.61) for Soutien psy avec Mon Sherpa. Mean aesthetics scores (section C) ranged from 2.52 (SD 0.62) for Mental Booster to 3.89 (SD 0.69) for Soutien psy avec Mon Sherpa. Mean information scores (section D) ranged from 2.00 (SD 0.75) for Mental Booster to 3.46 (SD 0.77) for Soutien psy avec Mon Sherpa. Mean Mobile App Rating Scale subjective quality (section E) score varied from 1.22 (SD 0.26) for VOS - journal de l'humeur to 2.69 (SD 0.84) for Soutien psy avec Mon Sherpa. Mean app specificity (section F) score varied from 1.56 (SD 0.97) for Mental Booster to 3.31 (SD 1.22) for Evoluno. For all the mental health apps studied, except Soutien psy avec Mon Sherpa (11/12, 92%), the subjective quality score was always lower than the app specificity score, which was always lower than the MARS-F quality score, and that was lower than the rating score from the iPhone Operating System or Android app stores. Mental health professionals assessed that, despite the lack of scientific evidence, the mental health mobile apps available on the French Apple App Store and Google Play Store were of good quality. However, they are reluctant to use them in their professional practice. Additional investigations are needed to assess their compliance with recommendations and their long-term impact on users.","Carrouel, du Sartz de Vigneulles, Bourgeois, Kabuth, Baltenneck, Nusbaum, Burge, Roy, Buchheit, Carrion-Martinaud, Massoubre, Fraticelli, Dussart","https://doi.org/10.2196/41282","20221012","French; behavior change; lifestyle; mHealth; mental; mobile apps; mobile health; prevention; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-13","",39084,""
"Stressors and symptoms associated with a history of adverse childhood experiences among older adolescents and young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic in Manitoba, Canada","The COVID-19 pandemic has had major economic, social and psychological consequences for adolescents and young adults. It is unclear whether those with a history of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) were particularly vulnerable. We examined whether a history of ACEs was associated with financial difficulties, lack of emotional support, feeling stressed/anxious, feeling down/depressed, increased alcohol and/or cannabis use and increased conflict with parents, siblings and/or intimate partners among 16- to 21-year-olds during the pandemic. Data were collected in November and December 2020 from respondents aged 16 to 21 years (n = 664) participating in the longitudinal and intergenerational Well-being and Experiences Study (Wave 3) conducted in Manitoba, Canada. Age-stratified associations between ACEs and pandemic-related stressors/symptoms were examined with binary and multinomial logistic regression. A history of ACEs was associated with pandemic-related financial difficulties (adjusted relative risk ratio [aRRR] range: 2.44-7.55); lack of emotional support (aRRR range: 2.13-26.77); higher levels of feeling stressed/anxious and down/depressed (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] range: 1.78-5.05); increased alcohol and cannabis use (aOR range: 1.99-8.02); and increased relationship conflict (aOR range: 1.98-22.59). Fewer associations emerged for older adolescents and these were not to the same degree as for young adults. Adolescents and young adults with a history of ACEs reported increased odds of pandemic-related stressors and symptoms, and may need more resources and greater support compared to peers without an ACE history. Differences in results for adolescents and young adults suggest that interventions should be tailored to the needs of each age group.

The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated financial, social and psychological difficulties for young people. Older adolescents and young adults with a history of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) were more vulnerable to pandemic-related stressors and symptoms compared to their peers without an ACEs history. Young adults with a history of ACEs may need additional resources that provide financial assistance, address mental health concerns, foster emotional support, reduce substance use and facilitate positive relationships. Older adolescents with a history of ACEs may benefit from interventions that improve feelings of depression and foster emotional support and healthy relationships with parents. Psychological first aid that provides practical and emotional support may be a suitable approach for supporting recovery from the pandemic.

"Use of and Retention on Video, Telephone, and In-Person Buprenorphine Treatment for Opioid Use Disorder During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic prompted policy changes to allow increased telehealth delivery of buprenorphine, a potentially lifesaving medication for opioid use disorder (OUD). It is unclear how characteristics of patients who access different treatment modalities (in-person vs telehealth, video vs telephone) vary, and whether modality is associated with retention-a key indicator of care quality. To compare patient characteristics across receipt of different treatment modalities and to assess whether modality was associated with retention during the year following COVID-19-related policy changes. This cross-sectional study was conducted in the national Veterans Health Administration. Participants included patients who received buprenorphine for OUD during March 23, 2020, to March 22, 2021. Analyses examining retention were stratified by buprenorphine initiation time (year following COVID-19-related changes; prior to COVID-19-related changes). Patient characteristics; treatment modality (at least 1 video visit, at least 1 telephone visit but no video, only in-person). Treatment modality; 90-day retention. Among 17Ã¢â‚¬Â¯182 patients, 7094 (41.3%) were aged 30 to 44 years and 6251 (36.4%) were aged 45 to 64 years; 15Ã¢â‚¬Â¯835 (92.2%) were male, 14Ã¢â‚¬Â¯085 (82.0%) were White, and 16Ã¢â‚¬Â¯292 (94.8%) were non-Hispanic; 6547 (38.1%) had at least 1 video visit, 8524 (49.6%) had at least 1 telephone visit but no video visit, and 2111 (12.3%) had only in-person visits. Patients who were younger, male, Black, unknown race, Hispanic, non-service connected, or had specific mental health/substance use comorbidities were less likely to receive any telehealth. Among patients who received telehealth, those who were older, male, Black, non-service connected, or experiencing homelessness and/or housing instability were less likely to have video visits. Retention was significantly higher for patients with telehealth compared with only in-person visits regardless of initiation time (for initiated in year following COVID-19-related changes: adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.31; 95% CI, 1.12-1.53; for initiated prior to COVID-19-related changes: aOR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.08-1.39). Among patients with telehealth, higher retention was observed in those with video visits compared with only telephone for patients who initiated in the year following COVID-19 (aOR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.26-1.71). In this cross-sectional study, many patients accessed buprenorphine via telephone and some were less likely to have any video visits. These findings suggest that discontinuing or reducing telephone access may disrupt treatment for many patients, particularly groups with access disparities such as Black patients and those experiencing homelessness. Telehealth was associated with increased retention for both new and continuing patients.","Frost, Zhang, Kim, Lin","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.36298","20221012","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-13","",39086,""
"Association of Major Disease Outbreaks With Adolescent and Youth Mental Health in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: A Systematic Scoping Review","Adolescents and young people have been historically understudied populations, and previous studies indicate that during epidemics, these populations, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), are at high risk of developing mental disturbances. To identify the existing evidence regarding the association of mental health with outbreaks of the influenza A (H1N1), Zika, Ebola, and SARS-CoV-2 virus in exposed youth and adolescents in LMICs. Across 6 databases (Embase, Cochrane Library, PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science), the mental health outcomes of adolescents and youth (aged 10-24 years) associated with 4 major pandemic outbreaks from January 2009 to January 2021 in LMICs were reviewed. A group of 3 authors at each stage carried out the screening, selection, and quality assessment using Joanna Briggs Institute checklists. The social determinants of adolescent well-being framework was used as a guide to organizing the review. A total of 57 studies fulfilled the search criteria, 55 related to the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic and 2 covered the H1N1 influenza epidemics. There were no studies associated with Zika or Ebola outbreaks that met screening criteria. The studies reported high rates of anxiety and depressive symptoms among adolescents, including posttraumatic stress disorder, general stress, and health-related anxiety. Potential risk factors associated with poor mental health outcomes included female sex; home residence in areas with strict lockdown limitations on social and physical movement; reduced physical activity; poor parental, family, or social support; previous exposure to COVID-19 infection; or being part of an already vulnerable group (eg, previous psychiatric conditions, childhood trauma, or HIV infection). Results of this systematic scoping review suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic and H1N1 epidemic were associated with adverse mental health among adolescents and youth from LMICs. Vulnerable youth and adolescents may be at higher risk of developing mental health-related complications, requiring more responsive interventions and further research. Geographically localized disease outbreaks such as Ebola, Zika, and H1N1 influenza are highly understudied and warrant future investigation.","Kumar, Akbarialiabad, Kouhanjani, Kiburi, Shidhaye, Taghrir, Shidhaye","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2022.3109","20221012","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-13","",39087,""
"Evaluation of long-term psychopathology and sleep quality in children and adolescents who presented to a university pandemic clinic with possible COVID-19 symptoms","The first articles about the impact of COVID-19 infection focused on the physical health and existing well-being of children and adolescents. However, little is known about the long-term effects of the disease itself, especially being infected with the virus and even the possibility of the infection on their mental health. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the long-term psychological effects of the disease. The study was designed as cross-sectional quantitative research. For this, the medical records of all 8-18-year-old children who presented to a university pandemic clinic in 2020 with possible COVID-19 symptoms were scanned. One hundred 62 children, with the first presentation date of 6 months ago and earlier, were divided into three groups. Group 1 consisted of children with chronic diseases who were hospitalized at the time of admission and continued to be hospitalized in the follow-up after they were PCR( +; polymerase chain reaction +). Group 2 comprised children without chronic diseases and continued outpatient follow-up after they were PCR(+). Finally, Group 3 was constituted by children with chronic diseases who were hospitalized at the time of admission but were discharged after their test was negative. A control group was also included. It was found that presenting to a pandemic clinic with possible COVID-19 symptoms, being PCR-positive for COVID-19, and being hospitalized with a verified disease posed a significant risk to children for the development of mental disorders, including anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and sleep disorders. Thus, prompt identification of at-risk populations, early intervention, and effective management of diagnosed disorders is necessary.

"Trauma in the American asylum process: Experiences of immigrant families under the migrant protection protocols","Latinx asylum-seeking families report posttraumatic distress that is 161-204% higher than in nonimmigrants, with adverse consequences for health and well-being. Recent U.S. policies have further embedded trauma in the asylum-seeking process by forcing families to remain in Mexico, enduring dire living conditions in tent encampments near the border while awaiting processing. These families are now entering the United States in large numbers. This article sheds light on their recent experiences and mental health needs, using a mixed methods-grounded theory design, presenting quantitative and qualitative data to describe the experiences of six asylum-seeking families who waited for 1-2 years in the refugee camp in Mexico. Quantitative data was obtained from the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 and the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire while qualitative interviews provided insight into reasons for migration and trauma at different stages of the migration process. All participants experienced multiple traumas and endorsed trauma related symptoms. Important themes of psychological distress and trauma emerged, including unending suffering, hunger, and worry for the safety of their children while living in the refugee camp. Asylum-seeking families experienced substantial distress and trauma secondary to their stay in Mexico and COVID-19. Families arriving to the United States have experienced significant trauma, separation, and loss before and during their journey. Interactions with an unprepared and overwhelmed immigration system further compromises their psychological well-being. It is imperative that first-person narratives inform policy that addresses their complex needs and protects their human rights.

"Predictors of persistent depressive and anxiety symptoms among older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada","The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the risk of psychological distress for older adults during a period of reduced access to mental health support. We identified predictors of persistent depressive and anxiety symptoms among older adults throughout the initial 9Ã¢â‚¬â€°months of the pandemic. This was a longitudinal study using web-based surveys sent to a convenience sample of Canadians aged Ã¢â€°Â¥55Ã¢â‚¬â€°years. A baseline survey was sent in May 2020, with eight surveys sent monthly between June 2020 and January 2021. Data were separated into three study periods, corresponding to coronavirus case rates. Respondents who met predetermined thresholds for elevated depressive or anxiety symptoms using standardized mental health scales during all three periods were defined as having persistent symptoms. Multivariable Poisson regression was used to compare the risk of persistent symptoms across respondent characteristics selected a priori. There were 835 respondents who answered questions about depressive symptoms and 865 who answered questions about anxiety symptoms across all three study periods. Among those with complete follow-up data, 19.2% (nÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°159/827) reported persistent depressive symptoms and 16.4% (nÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°140/856) reported persistent anxiety symptoms. Respondents with persistent depressive symptoms were more likely to be women (adjusted relative risk [aRR] 1.71; 95% CI 1.19-2.46), and report multimorbidity (aRR 1.45; 95% CI 1.07-1.97), pre-existing depression (aRR 2.00; 95% CI 1.45-2.77) and pre-existing anxiety (aRR 1.50; 95% CI 1.10-2.06). The same respondent characteristics were correlates of persistently elevated anxiety symptoms. Older women, older adults with pre-existing depression and anxiety, and those with multimorbidity were more likely to report persistent mental health symptoms during the first 9Ã¢â‚¬â€°months of the COVID-19 pandemic. These individuals were known to have elevated risk prior to the pandemic, and expanded interventions targeted to these groups are necessary to adequately address their mental health needs.","Siddhpuria, Webber, Mahar, Hallet, Rochon, Reppas-Rindlisbacher","https://doi.org/10.1111/jgs.18087","20221012","COVID-19; longitudinal; mental health; older adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-13","",39091,""
"In silico analysis of the antidepressant fluoxetine and related drugs at SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro)","SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro or 3CLpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro) are common viral targets for repurposed drugs to combat COVID-19 disease. Recently, several anti-depressants (such as fluoxetine, venlafaxine and citalopram) belonging to the Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) and the Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRI) classes have been shown to in vitro inhibit viral replication. Investigate a possible action of fluoxetine and derivatives on SARS-CoV-2 protease sites. molecular docking was performed using AutoDock Vina. Both proteases structures and different drugs conformations were used to explore the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 inhibition on a Mpro or PLpro related pathway. Drug structures were obtained by optimization with the Avogadro software and MOPAC using PM6 method. Results were analysed on Discovery Studio Visualizer. The results indicated that Mpro interacted in a thermodynamically favorable way with fluoxetine, venlafaxine, citalopram, atomoxetine, nisoxetine and norfluoxetine in the region of the active site, whether PLpro conformers did not come close to active site. In an in silico perspective, it is likely that the SSRIs and other anti-depressants could interact with Mpro and cause the enzyme to malfunction. Unfortunately, the same drugs did not present similar results on PLpro crystal, therefore no inhibition is expected on an in vitro trial. Anyway, in vitro test are necessary for the better understanding the links between SARS-CoV-2 proteases and anti-depressants.","Tronco Pauletto, Omage, Delgado, Nogara, Teixeira Rocha","https://doi.org/10.2174/1570163819666221010115118","20221012","Mpro; PLpro; SARS-CoV-2; antidepressants; docking; drug repurposing; proteases","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-13","",39092,""

"HIV, HSV, SARS-CoV-2 and Ebola Share Long-Term Neuropsychiatric Sequelae","Long COVID, in which disease-related symptoms persist for months after recovery, has led to a revival of the discussion of whether neuropsychiatric long-term symptoms after viral infections indeed result from virulent activity or are purely psychological phenomena. In this review, we demonstrate that, despite showing differences in structure and targeting, many viruses have highly similar neuropsychiatric effects on the host. Herein, we compare severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), Ebola virus disease (EVD), and herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1). We provide evidence that the mutual symptoms of acute and long-term anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress among these viral infections are likely to result from primary viral activity, thus suggesting that these viruses share neuroinvasive strategies in common. Moreover, it appears that secondary induced environmental stress can lead to the emergence of psychopathologies and increased susceptibility to viral (re)infection in infected individuals. We hypothesize that a positive feedback loop of virus-environment-reinforced systemic responses exists. It is surmised that this cycle of primary virulent activity and secondary stress-induced reactivation, may be detrimental to infected individuals by maintaining and reinforcing the host's immunocompromised state of chronic inflammation, immunological strain, and maladaptive central-nervous-system activity. We propose that this state can lead to perturbed cognitive processing and promote aversive learning, which may manifest as acute, long-term neuropsychiatric illness.","BÃƒÂ¼ttiker, Stefano, Weissenberger, Ptacek, Anders, Raboch, Kream","https://doi.org/10.2147/NDT.S382308","20221012","HIV-1; SARS virus; interoception; neuropsychiatry; virus latency","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-13","",39095,""
"A web-based survey of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and its adverse effects in Chinese postoperative patients with breast cancer: a cross-sectional study","Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 has been the most important strategy for preventing infection and controlling pandemics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Cancer patients have a significantly higher risk of infection with COVID-19 because of their impaired immunity. Breast cancer is the most common female malignant tumor in the world. However, studies on COVID-19 vaccination in breast cancer patients are scarce, so that more information is needed to guide vaccination in these. We conducted a web-based questionnaire survey on SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in breast cancer patient. Questionnaires completed by non-postoperative patients will be considered invalid. The main variables in the questionnaire including vaccination status, willingness to get the vaccines, candidate factors, and measures of adverse events in vaccinated individuals were used for analysis. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate the associations. Among 947 valid online questionnaires, 341 (36.0%) accepted SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, while 606 (64.0%) did not. There were significant differences in age, current treatment, time since surgery, and symptoms of anxiety and depression between the two groups. Compared to vaccinated patients, we identified current treatment [odds ratio (OR) =0.51 for endocrine therapy; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.29-0.89], time since surgery (OR =22.49 for 1-2 years; 95% CI: 12.31-41.10; OR =8.49 for 2-5 years; 95% CI: 4.98-14.46; OR =1.79 for &gt;5 years; 95% CI: 1.11-2.89), and symptoms of depression (OR =2.48; 95% CI: 1.19-5.15) as significant factors for being unvaccinated. The overall incidence of adverse reactions was 43.1%, and the most common local and systemic adverse reactions were pain (28.4%) and fatigue (8.8%). However, about 76.6% of the unvaccinated participants were willing to be vaccinated. Compared to the general population, postoperative patients with breast cancer had a lower rate of vaccination for SARS-CoV-2. Receiving treatment, a shorter time since surgery, and symptoms of depression were associated with being unvaccinated. However, about 76.6% of the unvaccinated participants were willing to be vaccinated. Although our study showed that there were adverse effects of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, such as pain, fatigue, they are common adverse effects of routine vaccination. We believe that vaccination against COVID-19 is safe in postoperative patients with breast cancer.","Wang, Shen, Zhang, Wang, Zhang, Li, Hu, Xia, Liao","https://doi.org/10.21037/gs-22-454","20221012","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); adverse reaction; breast cancer; unvaccination; vaccine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-13","",39096,""
"Pandemic-related socioeconomic disruptions and adverse health outcomes: a cross-sectional study of female caregivers","The COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to mitigate transmission resulted in sudden and widespread socioeconomic disruptions including school and child care closures, unemployment and underemployment, and housing precarity. Understanding the extent to which these disruptions may have contributed to adverse health outcomes is critical for establishing policy priorities that can mitigate further harm. We explored the associations between pandemic-related child care, employment, and housing disruptions with depressive symptoms, self-rated health, and food security status among a sample of economically disadvantaged and racially diverse female caregivers of young childrenÃ‚Â (n=464). Data were derived from the Assessing California Communities' Experiences with Safety Net Supports (ACCESS) study, which conducted survey-based interviews with California caregivers with low-income from August 2020 - May 2021. We implemented a series of multivariable Poisson regressions with robust standard errors to assess the potency of each exposure, independently and within the context of one another. Most caregivers experienced disruptions to child care (70%) and employment (63%); few experienced major housing disruptions (8%). Women that experienced child care and housing disruptions had greater depressive symptoms, lower self-rated health, and greater food insecurity, although the relationships for housing and depressive symptoms were modified by the timing of participants' interviews. Employment disruptions were not associated with any of the examined adverse health outcomes. In the wake of socioeconomic stressors brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, attending to structural deficits in the child care system and increasing housing supports may be critical for protecting the health of caregivers.","Brown, Fernald, Hamad, Hoskote, Jackson, Gosliner","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-14287-2","20221011","COVID-19; Child care; Employment; Food insecurity; Housing; Mental health; Parental health; Socioeconomic factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-13","",39097,""
"A multidimensional approach to the resilience in older adults despite COVID-19","Researchers have mainly focused on aging risk factors and COVID-19 consequences. However, older adults have proved their ability to overcome adversities along their life. Resilience is a protective variable that dampens the impact of stress. Based on MacLeod's et al. (2016) approach, we aimed to analyze the relationship between older adults' resilience and COVID-19 related-stressors as well as their physical, mental, and social characteristics. Eight hundred eighty-nine people aged 60 and over participated in this study. Older participants, women, having better perceived health and not losing a loved one because of the virus were associated with more resilience. Moreover, higher levels of gratitude, personal growth, life purpose and lower levels of depression were associated with greater scores in resilience. This study offers a change of perspective in which aging is perceived from a positive viewpoint by focusing on easily accessible resources that may help older adults to cope with adverse situations.","Perez-Rojo, LÃƒÂ³pez, Noriega, Velasco, Carretero, LÃƒÂ³pez-Frutos, Galarraga","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12877-022-03472-y","20221011","Crisis; Descriptive survey study; Protective factors; Strengths","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-13","",39098,""
"Prevalence of self-reported symptoms of temporomandibular disorders and associated factors in the period of distance learning","Assess the prevalence of self-reported TMD symptoms and anxiety and check the quality of sleep and life during the distance learning period in university students at the University of Brasilia (UnB). The participants were students from the Health Sciences College and Medicine College at UnB. Self-administered questionnaires were used to evaluate symptoms of TMD, quality of life, and sleep quality. One-way analysis of variance, followed by Bonferroni test, and Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by Dunn's test, were performed (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). For qualitative data analysis, the chi-square test was applied (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). Total 156 students were included; prevalence of TMD, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and poor sleep quality was 73.1%, 84%, 12.8%, and 62.8%, respectively. A greater prevalence of painful TMD was observed in students with severe anxiety (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.007). Students with symptoms of painful TMD, severe anxiety, and sleep disorders had statistically worse quality of life. The implementation of distance learning in health courses to replace classroom teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted TMD prevalence, anxiety, quality of life, and sleep quality. Psychological factors are directly associated with TMD symptoms and quality of life, TMD conditions are related to quality of life as well. COVID-19 pandemic and the distance learning in health courses are new situations that can lead to a great impact on mental health and in consequence to TMD conditions and quality of life.","Santos, Ramos, de Sousa, de Medeiros","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00784-022-04743-z","20221011","Anxiety; Anxiety disorders; COVID-19; Myalgia; Temporomandibular disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-13","",39099,""
"Anxiety and depressive symptoms of German university students 20Ã¢â‚¬Â¯months after the COVID-19 outbreak - A cross-sectional study","Given the long duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, monitoring mental health remains important. This study aimed to determine (1) the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among university students 20Ã¢â‚¬Â¯months after the first COVID-19 restrictions and (2) which factors were associated with these outcomes. The cross-sectional COVID-19 German Student Well-being Study (C19 GSWS) collected data of 7025 students at five German universities. Associations between anxiety and depressive symptoms with sociodemographic and other factors were analysed using multivariable logistic regression models. The mean age of the participants was 23.9Ã¢â‚¬Â¯years (SDÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯4.9), 67Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% were female and 31Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% male. The prevalence for depressive symptoms was 29Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% (PHQ-2) and 12Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% (CES-D 8) and 32Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% for anxiety. A complicated relationship status, the lack of a trusted person, and financial difficulties were associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms. University students who were worried about (re-) infection with COVID-19 had a 1.37-times higher chance for reporting anxiety (GAD-2: OR, 95Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% CI: 1.09-1.71). Those with pre-existing cardiovascular health conditions had an up to 3.21-times higher chance for reporting depressive symptoms (OR, CESD-D 8, 95Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% CI: 1.44-7.14). The study design is cross-sectional and uses self-reported outcomes. Concepts for prevention and counselling to tackle mental health problems in students are needed and programmes should take specific stressors related to the pandemic into account.","Heumann, Helmer, Busse, Negash, Horn, Pischke, Niephaus, Stock","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.09.158","20221011","Anxiety; Depression; Mental health; Students' well-being; University students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-13","",39100,""
"Speaking Well and Feeling Good: Older Adults Exhibit Increased Emotional Linguistic Precision During Resting State Cognition","Despite the prevalence and potential importance of resting state cognition for daily functioning and psychological wellbeing, no study has yet probed whether older age is associated with augmented precision in the use of emotional words during unconstrained contexts. Age-related increases in this construct â€“ here termed â€œaffective lexical granularityâ€ â€“ could be a novel manifestation of the positivity effect, with implications for wellbeing. Therefore, across two studies, we instructed a total of 77 young adults and 74 cognitively normal older adults to speak their thoughts freely during a Think-Aloud Paradigm and computed the emotional properties of words spoken as well as participantsâ€™ retrospective self-report affective experiences. Study 1, conducted before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, revealed that older adults exhibited higher positive, but not negative, lexical granularity compared to younger adults, paralleled by increases in psychological wellbeing and an increase in self-reported positive thoughts. Despite being conducted virtually during the COVID-19 pandemic, Study 2 replicated many of Study 1â€™s main findings, generalizing these results across independent samples and study contexts. Collectively, these results suggest that normal cognitive aging, in our mostly white non-Hispanic sample, may be associated with an increase in the use of unique positive words during natural periods of restful thought, and may therefore reveal a novel expression of the â€œpositivity effectâ€ witnessed in this population. These data may also have broad implications for clinical populations whose natural thought content may differ, such as individuals with depression or other mental health conditions.","Teodora Stoica et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E01D4-301-9A0","20221012","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Aging; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; cognitive aging; language; age differences; emotion differentiation; autobiographical thought; granularity; mind-wandering; emotion; resting-state cognition; text-analysis","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-13","",39101,""
