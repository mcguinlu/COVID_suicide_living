"Cutting Edge: SARS-CoV-2 Infection Induces Robust Germinal Center Activity in the Human Tonsil","Understanding the generation of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in lymphoid tissues draining the site of infection has implications for immunity to SARS-CoV-2. We performed tonsil biopsies under local anesthesia in 19 subjects who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection 24-225 d previously. The biopsies yielded &gt;3 million cells for flow cytometric analysis in 17 subjects. Total and SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific germinal center B cells, and T follicular helper cells, were readily detectable in human tonsils early after SARS-CoV-2 infection, as assessed by flow cytometry. Responses were higher in samples within 2 mo of infection but still detectable in some subjects out to 7 mo following infection. We conclude the tonsils are a secondary lymphoid organ that develop germinal center responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and could play a role in the long-term development of immunity.","Tan, Wragg, Kelly, Esterbauer, Dixon, Lau, Flanagan, van de Sandt, Kedzierska, McMahon, Wheatley, Juno, Kent","https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.2101199","20220429","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-30","",30759,""
"HIV Care Continuum Services for People Who Inject Drugs in Kazakhstan During COVID-19: A Qualitative Study of Service Provider Perspectives","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and resulting lockdowns have disrupted health care service delivery globally. This includes disruptions in harm reduction and HIV service delivery for people who inject drugs (PWID), a population at high risk for not only COVID-19 but also poor HIV and drug-treatment access. However, little is known about these issues in Kazakhstan. We examined harm reduction provider experiences with delivering services and regulatory changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted in-depth interviews with 24 nurses, social workers, and doctors serving both HIV-positive and HIV-negative PWID at 13 needle and syringe programs (NSPs) and 4 AIDS Centers (HIV treatments centers) in Kazakhstan from May to August 2020. Participants were asked how the COVID-19 pandemic had impacted their PWID clients' risks, their organizational environment, and the services offered to PWID over the prior 3-6 months. Thematic content analysis was used to elicit findings. The COVID-19 pandemic considerably impacted NSP and AIDS Center operations. Participants perceived high risks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection for themselves and their clients, as well as pandemic-related increases in substance use and HIV risks for clients. Organizations instituted several policy and regulatory changes to adapt to the pandemic, most notably tasking NSPs with delivering HIV medications; these changes necessitated new roles and responsibilities for many providers. Despite this stressful changing environment and increased service demands, participants still shared examples of persistence and resilience as they worked to meet client needs during these challenging times. NSPs in Kazakhstan are well-positioned to reach key populations with crucial information and flexible services during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, they need recognition as essential organizations and additional equipment and staff support to protect staff and clients, maintain pandemic-related regulatory changes, and address additional challenges such as overdose prevention among clients.","McCrimmon, Sundelson, Darisheva, Gilbert, Hunt, Terlikbayeva, Primbetova, El-Bassel","https://doi.org/10.9745/GHSP-D-21-00619","20220429","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-30","",30760,""
"Psychiatric disorders newly diagnosed among veterans subsequent to hospitalization for COVID-19","The goal of our study was to evaluate the development of new mental health diagnoses up to 6-months following COVID-19 hospitalization for in a large, national sample. Data were extracted for all Veterans hospitalized at Veterans Health Administration hospitals for COVID-19 from March through August of 2020 utilizing national administrative data. After identifying the cohort, follow-up data were linked through six months post-hospitalization. Data were analyzed using logistic regression. Eight percent of patients developed a new mental health diagnosis following hospitalization. The most common new mental health diagnoses involved depressive, anxiety, and adjustment disorders. Younger and rural patients were more likely to develop new mental health diagnoses. Women and those with more comorbidities were less likely to develop new diagnoses. A subpopulation of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 developed new mental health diagnoses. Unique demographics predictors indicate the potential need for additional outreach and screening to groups at elevated risk of post-hospitalization, mental health sequelae.","Chen, Hickok, O'Neill, Niederhausen, Laliberte, Govier, Edwards, Gordon, Slatore, Weaver, Young, Hynes","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2022.114570","20220429","Covid-19; Intensive care; Mental health; Military veterans","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-30","",30761,""
"Long COVID in Children and Adolescents","<b><i>Objective:</i></b> To review the empirical evidence regarding neuropsychiatric illness (long coronavirus disease [COVID]) in children and adolescents post-severe acute respiratory coronavirus disease 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. <b><i>Data Sources:</i></b> A search of PubMed, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar was conducted from the date of inception until February 2022 using the keywords <i>corona</i>*, <i>COVID-19</i>, <i>SARS-CoV-2</i>, <i>mental health</i>, <i>depression</i>, <i>anxiety</i>, <i>neurological</i>, <i>psychiatric</i>, <i>long COVID</i>, and <i>post-COVID outcomes</i>.

Data regarding long COVID in children and adolescents post-SARS-CoV-2 infection were extracted to understand epidemiologic trends, preventive measures, and treatment options. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Studies during the initial phase of the pandemic reported a mixed range of symptoms from case reports or case series. However, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) was widely reported. During the subsequent phases, the emergence of new variants led to a surge of SARS-CoV-2 infections in pediatric populations. There were highly variable, mixed symptom clusters within 60 days post-infection, which resolved in many patients within 6 months. There were prolonged illnesses and impairments in some children and adolescents with long COVID, and many had similar symptoms even though they tested negative for COVID-19. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Long COVID symptoms are both physical and mental in nature among children and adolescents. The impairments have the potential to affect long-term functioning and increase the overall burden on health care delivery. Despite current studies having methodological issues, there is a consensus to provide multidisciplinary and holistic care to those in need.","Gupta, Gupta, Esang","https://doi.org/10.4088/PCC.21r03218","20220429","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-30","",30762,""
"Observational study of mental health presentations across healthcare setting during the first 9 months of the COVID-19 pandemic in England","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented impact on the day to day lives of people, with several features potentially adversely affecting mental health. There is growing evidence of the size of the impact of COVID-19 on mental health, but much of this is from ongoing population surveys using validated mental health scores. This study investigated the impact of the pandemic and control measures on mental health conditions presenting to a spectrum of national healthcare services monitored using real-time syndromic surveillance in England. We conducted a retrospective observational descriptive study of mental health presentations (those calling the national medical helpline, NHS 111, consulting general practitioners in- and out-of-hours, calling ambulance services and attending emergency departments) between 1 January 2019 to 30 September 2020. Estimates for the impact of lockdown measures were provided using an interrupted time series analysis. Mental health presentations showed a marked decrease during the early stages of the pandemic. Post-lockdown, attendances for mental health conditions reached higher than pre-pandemic levels across most systems; a rise of 10% compared to expected for NHS 111 and 21% for GP out-of-hours whilst the number of consultations to in-hours GPs was 13% lower compared to the same time last year. Increases were observed in calls to NHS 111 for sleep problems. These analyses showed marked changes in the healthcare attendances and prescribing for common mental health conditions, across a spectrum of healthcare provision, with some of these changes persisting. The reasons for such changes are likely to be complex and multifactorial. The impact of the pandemic on mental health may not be fully understood for some time, and therefore these syndromic indicators should continue to be monitored.","Smith, Harcourt, Hoang, Lemanska, Elliot, Morbey, Hughes, Lake, Edeghere, Oliver, Sherlock, AmlÃƒÂ´t, de Lusignan","https://doi.org/10.2196/32347","20220429","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-30","",30763,""
"COVID-19 News and Its Association with the Mental Health of Sexual and Gender Minority Adults: A Cross-Sectional Study","Sexual and gender minority (SGM; people whose sexual orientation is not heterosexual and/or whose gender identity varies from what is traditionally associated with the sex assigned to them at birth) people experience high rates of trauma and significant disparities in anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Exposure to traumatic stressors, such as news related to COVID-19, may be associated with symptoms of anxiety and PTSD. to evaluate the relationship of COVID-19 news exposure with anxiety and PTSD symptoms in a sample of SGM adults in the United States (US). Data were collected between March 23 and August 2, 2020 from The PRIDE Study, a national, longitudinal, cohort study of SGM people. Regression analyses were used to analyze the relationship between self-reported news exposure and (1) symptoms of anxiety using the General Anxiety Disorder (GAD) 7-item Scale and (2) symptoms of COVID-related PTSD using the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R). Our sample included a total of 3,079 SGM participants. Each unit increase in COVID-19-related news exposure was associated with greater anxiety symptoms (OR=1.77,95% CI [1.63, 1.93], P&lt;.001) and 1.93 greater odds of PTSD (95% CI [1.74, 2.14], P&lt;.001). Our study found that COVID-19 news exposure was positively associated with greater symptoms of anxiety and PTSD among SGM people. This supports previous literature in other populations where greater news exposure was associated with poorer mental health. Further research is needed to determine the direction of this relationship and to evaluate for differences among SGM subgroups with multiple marginalized identities.","Clark, Lunn, Sherman, Bosley, Lubensky, Obedin-Maliver, Dastur, Flentje","https://doi.org/10.2196/34710","20220429","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-30","",30764,""
"Yoga provision for individuals living with Multiple Sclerosis: Is the future online?","Yoga has multiple benefits for individuals living with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), including reduced pain, depression, fatigue, strength, and improved quality of life. During the COVID-19 pandemic, home-based delivery of yoga increased. However, no studies to date have explored online home-based yoga for individuals living with MS, more specifically the motivations, experiences, or the sustainability of home-based yoga practice for individuals living with MS. This study aimed to explore the facilitators and barriers of online yoga provision for individuals living with MS. One focus group and three semi-structured interviews were carried out online via Zoom with one yoga instructor and seven yoga participants living with MS. Thematic Analysis was used to analyse this data. Two themes were generated from the interviews, the environment and future provision, each with their own sub-themes. The themes reflect various facilitators and barriers of home-based yoga provision which differed depending upon the individuals home environment, social connections, physical ability, and confidence practising yoga. Furthermore, preferences of home provision fluctuated over time depending upon symptoms of MS. Home-based yoga practice is a viable and enjoyable option for individuals living with MS. It is recommended that yoga studios offering home-based yoga provision consider individual differences in preference, as well as fluctuations in symptoms that may create inequitable access to services and may prevent participation for some.","Wilson-Menzfeld, Naisby, Baker, Morris, Robinson, Barry","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0266786","20220429","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-30","",30765,""
"Healthcare worker trauma and related mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 outbreak in New York City","Healthcare workers (HCWs) faced a range of stressors during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, contributing to psychological stress. We use a psychological trauma framework to characterize the mental health burden for clinical and non-clinical healthcare worker occupations during the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective was to measure and characterize risk factors for trauma and anxiety-related mental health problems among HCWs at a public hospital in the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City (NYC). This study reports findings from a cross-sectional survey of NYC HCWs shortly after the initial 2020 infection surge. Over 800 hospital employees completed the survey that assessed professional quality of life indicators (compassion satisfaction [CS], burnout [BO], secondary traumatic stress [STS]), Coronavirus Anxiety (CS), Obsession with Coronavirus (OC), and PTSD symptoms. The survey also assessed pandemic-related work and life circumstances such as ""do you have a family member or friend who tested positive for COVID"". Relatively small percentages of HCWs endorsed probable Coronavirus Anxiety (6%), PTSD (13%), and Coronavirus Obsession (21%). We observed higher proportions of Burnout (29%), Moderate or High Secondary Traumatic Stress (45%), and High Compassion Satisfaction (52%). Adjusted regression models showed important implications for prior behavioral/emotional health concerns among HCWs, providing care for a patient that died from COVID-19, and other characteristics. This study supports prior studies documenting the mental health consequences for the healthcare workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study builds on that base by including non-clinical staff in the sample and assessing pandemic life-stressors such as caring for sick family members.","Yu, Barnett, Menon, Rabiee, De Castro, Kasubhai, Watkins","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0267315","20220429","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-30","",30766,""
"COVID-19 Surveillance in the Biobank at the Colorado Center for Personalized Medicine: Observational Study","Characterizing the experience and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic among various populations remains challenging due to the limitations inherent in common data sources such as the electronic health record (EHR) or cross-sectional surveys. To describe testing behaviors, symptoms, impact, vaccination status and case ascertainment during the COVID-19 pandemic using integrated data sources. In summer 2020 and 2021, we surveyed participants enrolled in the Biobank at the Colorado Center for Personalized Medicine (CCPM, N = 180,599) about their experience with COVID-19. Prevalence of testing, symptoms, and the impacts of COVID-19 on employment, family life, and physical and mental health were calculated overall and by demographic categories. Survey respondents who reported receiving a positive COVID-19 test result were considered a ""confirmed case"" of COVID-19. Using the Electronic Health Record (EHR), we compared COVID-19 case ascertainment and characteristics in the EHR versus the survey. Positive cases were identified in the EHR using ICD-10 diagnosis codes, healthcare encounter types, and encounter primary diagnoses. Of the 25,063 survey respondents (13.9%), 42.5% had been tested for COVID-19 and of those, 12.8% tested positive. Nearly half of those tested had symptoms and/or had been exposed to someone who was infected. Young adults (18-29 years) and Hispanics were more likely to have positive tests compared to older adults and persons of other racial/ethnic groups. Mental health (54.6%) and family life (48.8%) were most negatively affected by the pandemic and more so among younger groups and women; negative impacts on employment were more commonly reported among Black respondents. Of the 10,249 individuals who responded to vaccination questions from version 2 of the survey (summer 2021), 95.3% had received the vaccine (n = 9,770). After integration with EHR data up to the time of the survey completion, 4.0% of survey respondents (n=1,006) had discordant COVID-19 case status between the EHR and the survey. Using all longitudinal EHR and survey data, we identified 11,472 COVID-positive cases among Biobank participants (6.4%). In comparison to COVID-19 cases identified through the survey, EHR-identified cases were younger and more likely to be Hispanic. We found that the COVID-19 pandemic has had far-reaching and varying effects among our Biobank participants. Integrated data assets such as the Biobank at the CCPM are key resources for population health monitoring in response to public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Johnson, Marker, Mayer, Shortt, Kao, Barnes, Lowery, Gignoux","https://doi.org/10.2196/37327","20220429","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-30","",30767,""
"Effect of COVID-19 Lockdowns on Physical Activity, Eating Behavior, Body Weight and Psychological Outcomes in a Post-Bariatric Cohort","Little is known about the consequences of COVID-19 lockdowns on physical activity (PA), eating behavior, and mental health in post-bariatric surgery (BS) patients. We aimed to analyze the relations between changes in PA during COVID-19 lockdowns and changes in body weight and a comprehensive set of lifestyle and psychological outcomes in patients who have undergone BS. In April-May 2020 (lockdown#1), we performed an online survey in a cohort of 937 adults who underwent BS and were followed-up at our university medical center for at least one year. We assessed changes in PA, eating behavior, body weight, fatigue, and depression (PHQ-9). In November-December 2020 (lockdown#2), we recorded body weight in 280 patients who had reported decreased PA during lockdown #1. During lockdown #1 (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°420 patients included, 44% response rate), decreased PA was reported by 67% patients. Compared to those who reported increased or unchanged PA, patients with decreased PA were more likely to report aÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°5% weight gain (OR (95% CI): 3.15 (1.46-7.65), increased fatigue (2.08 (1.36-3.23)), a worsening of eating behavior (2.29 (1.47-3.58)), and moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms (4.74 (2.14-11.76)). During lockdown #2 (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°225 patients, 80% response rate), significant weight gain since before lockdown #1 was reported (+Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.8 (95% CI: 1.7-3.8) kg, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), with 36% patients reporting aÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°5% weight gain.

"Mental impact of Covid-19 among Spanish healthcare workers A large longitudinal survey","Longitudinal data on the mental health impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic in healthcare workers is limited. We estimated prevalence, incidence and persistence of probable mental disorders in a cohort of Spanish healthcare workers (Covid-19 waves 1 and 2) -and identified associated risk factors. 8996 healthcare workers evaluated on 5 May-7 September 2020 (baseline) were invited to a second web-based survey (October-December 2020). Major depressive disorder (PHQ-8 Ã¢â€°Â¥ 10), generalised anxiety disorder (GAD-7 Ã¢â€°Â¥ 10), panic attacks, post-traumatic stress disorder (PCL-5 Ã¢â€°Â¥ 7), and alcohol use disorder (CAGE-AID Ã¢â€°Â¥ 2) were assessed. Distal (pre-pandemic) and proximal (pandemic) risk factors were included. We estimated the incidence of probable mental disorders (among those without disorders at baseline) and persistence (among those with disorders at baseline). Logistic regression of individual-level [odds ratios (OR)] and population-level (population attributable risk proportions) associations were estimated, adjusting by all distal risk factors, health care centre and time of baseline interview. 4809 healthcare workers participated at four months follow-up (cooperation rate = 65.7%; mean = 120 days s.d. = 22 days from baseline assessment). Follow-up prevalence of any disorder was 41.5%, (v. 45.4% at baseline, p &lt; 0.001); incidence, 19.7% (s.e. = 1.6) and persistence, 67.7% (s.e. = 2.3). Proximal factors showing significant bivariate-adjusted associations with incidence included: work-related factors [prioritising Covid-19 patients (OR = 1.62)], stress factors [personal health-related stress (OR = 1.61)], interpersonal stress (OR = 1.53) and financial factors [significant income loss (OR = 1.37)]. Risk factors associated with persistence were largely similar. Our study indicates that the prevalence of probable mental disorders among Spanish healthcare workers during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic was similarly high to that after the first wave. This was in good part due to the persistence of mental disorders detected at the baseline, but with a relevant incidence of about 1 in 5 of HCWs without mental disorders during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. Health-related factors, work-related factors and interpersonal stress are important risks of persistence of mental disorders and of incidence of mental disorders. Adequately addressing these factors might have prevented a considerable amount of mental health impact of the pandemic among this vulnerable population. Addressing health-related stress, work-related factors and interpersonal stress might reduce the prevalence of these disorders substantially.

"Mental Health, Quality of Life and Coping Strategies in Vulnerable Children During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The coronavirus pandemic has led to a situation without precedent in modern history. The aim of this study is to analyse the consequences after one year of the pandemic on a group of children and adolescents assessed at the beginning of the pandemic in 2020 and to determine the most effective ways of psychologically coping with this pandemic. Two different, but equivalent, groups with a total of 604 (study I, 2020) and 743 (study II, 2021) children and adolescents in residential care, foster families, kinship families or family strengthening programs in Spain were evaluated using the SDQ (mental health measure), KIDSCREEN-10 index (quality of life measure) and Kidcope (coping behaviour measure). An independent sample t-test and a decision tree analysis were used. The mental health of children and adolescents decreased by 9.7%, and Self-Perceived quality of life did not change after one year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nonactive coping strategies predicted worse mental health and worse quality of life. Problem solving served as a protective factor. One year after, the COVID-19 pandemic has an effect on the psychological wellbeing of children and adolescents, and the consequences can be reduced if proper coping strategies are used.","Vallejo-Slocker, Sanz, GarcÃƒÂ­a-Vera, Fresneda, Vallejo","https://doi.org/10.7334/psicothema2021.467","20220429","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-30","",30770,""
"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Perinatal Depression and Anxiety: A Large Cross-sectional Study in Spain","The current COVID-19 pandemic is a unique stressor with potentially negative consequences for pregnant and postpartum women. We investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on perinatal depression and anxiety in Spain. This cross-sectional study was conducted from June to December 2020. A total of 3,356 adult pregnant and postpartum women (with infants up to 6 months of age) from all Spanish regions were surveyed. The assessment included measures of Coronavirus Perinatal Experiences (COPE-IS questionnaire) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screener (GAD-7=10) and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS=10). The prevalence of perinatal anxiety and depression (above established cut-offs) was 33.3% and 47.2%, respectively; 29.2% of women screened positive for both conditions. Higher rates of perinatal depression and anxiety were associated with increased concern about threats of COVID-19, especially employment and the financial impact, along with increased overall levels of distress. Exposure to COVID-19 and its symptoms did not appear to be a relevant risk factor. More COVID-19-related predictors and a higher rate of depression were found in postpartum women. The current study highlights the substantial increase in symptoms of perinatal depression and anxiety, especially in postpartum women.

"Pandemic parenting: A pilot study of in-person versus internet-DOCS K-5 for caregivers of school-age children with disruptive behaviors","Behavioral parent training (BPT) programs are needed to address disruptive behavior disorders among school-aged children. Given the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic and associated mental health consequences, adapting BPTs to telehealth modalities is necessary to ensure continued services to children and families. This pilot study evaluated the use of a telehealth vs in-person modality to deliver the Developing Our Children's Skills K-5 (DOCS K-5) BPT. Participants were caregivers of children enrolled in elementary school exhibiting disruptive behaviors who participated in either in-person DOCS K-5 (<i>n</i> = 21) or internet-DOCS K-5 (i-DOCS K-5; <i>n</i> = 34). Pre- and post-intervention outcome measures were collected for child disruptive behavior, parenting stress, and caregiver symptoms of depression while consumer satisfaction was assessed at post-test only. Multiple linear and Poisson regression models were performed to assess the effect of session modality on the outcomes. Child disruptive behavior, parenting stress and depression, and consumer satisfaction scores were not significantly different across groups, even after adjusting for baseline characteristics. The results of this study provide preliminary evidence that the i-DOCS K-5 modality is as effective as the in-person program. Study findings may be beneficial to practitioners treating school-age children and utilizing telehealth interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic and onward.","Agazzi, Hayford, Thomas, Dickinson, Ortiz, Salinas-Miranda","https://doi.org/10.1177/13591045221096313","20220429","COVID-19; HOT DOCS; early intervention; parent training; telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-30","",30772,""
"[Abuse and neglect alerts in vulnerable adults: the evolution during the COVID-19 outbreak in France]","The COVID-19 outbreak is likely to affect both the occurrence and the reporting of abuse or neglect in vulnerable adults in a variety of ways. This study aims to explore such effects based on the alerts reported to the national system dedicated to these situations by the Ministry of Solidarity and Health in France. The main characteristics of the situations of abuse or neglect (age and gender of the victims, main type of abuse or neglect, persons considered as responsible, place of occurrence) reported to the national system from March to December 2020, since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, have been compared to those observed during the same months from 2017 to 2019. In 2019-20, abuses or neglects in nursing homes decreased (-111 or -8%), during 3-months, while those reported in domestic situations increased slightly (+50 or +1%), despite a short decline at the beginning of the epidemic. The situations reported during the epidemic as compared to those of the three previous years affected more often women, and less often involved persons other than families or professionals. Violations of rights, and psychological abuses have been more frequent, financial abuses and neglects have been less frequent since the beginning of the outbreak.","","https://doi.org/10.3917/spub.216.0997","20220429","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-30","",30773,""
"[COVID-19: Professional practices in closed institutional settings]","While governments have focused efforts on implementing health measures such as physical distancing and confinement to protect communities from the spread of COVID-19, some researchers focused on the significant impact of these measures on mental health and well-being. Persons with mental disorders who are both institutionalized and justice-involved in psychiatric and forensic hospitals find themselves more vulnerable to these measures and more limited in their movements and activities. The purpose of this paper is to examine the changes in practice in response to the pandemic and their potential impact on individuals in institutional settings. A rapid review including 69Ã‚Â publications identified nine major themes in the literature, which will serve as a framework to analyze the experience of one forensic psychiatry institution in Canada. These themes are: 1)Ã‚Â population-specific vulnerability factors; 2)Ã‚Â staff management and training; 3)Ã‚Â early discharge, parole, and community integration; 4)Ã‚Â management of contagion in closed spaces; 5)Ã‚Â sanitary measures and personal protective equipment; 6)Ã‚Â care and service continuity; 7)Ã‚Â use of technology to maintain social ties and services; 8)Ã‚Â legal mechanisms and individual rights; and 9)Ã‚Â post-pandemic realities. Although this is the first pandemic of such international magnitude, experts point to an increase in epidemics over the past decade and continued growth in the coming decades. It is thus essential to learn from this health crisis in order to be prepared and minimize their potential impact on vulnerable populations in the future. The reflections presented here could be contrasted with the lived-experiences of people in institutions in order to nuance the data and propose new strategies.","","https://doi.org/10.3917/spub.216.0979","20220429","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-30","",30774,""
"[The impact of COVID-19 on the health of children, a group ""protected"" fromÃ‚Â infection]","This article underlines that a viral epidemic and strategies to deal with it 1)Ã‚Â have a major impact on groups that are a priori spared by the disease itself, in this case children, and 2)Ã‚Â can generate health problems beyond the disease and lead to major social, economic and educational difficulties and an increase of social inequalities in health. The observations presented are based on the scientific literature available in the first half of 2020 and on discussions with actors in the field, experts and heads of institutions, conducted byÃ‚Â a working group of the Haut Conseil de la SantÃƒÂ© Publique reflecting on a global and concerted policy for children's health. The health crisis and its management have had an impact on children's development and their quality of life. They have been more exposed to sedentary lifestyles, screens, accidents, and violence at home. The closure of schools and leisure facilities has led to difficulties in school, socialization, psychological well-being and mental health. Curative or preventive care has been postponed. These effects occurred with significant social and territorial inequalities. Any health crisis management requires an assessment of the overall impact of the epidemic and the proposed measures on health, economic, social, and educational indicators. This crisis shows the need for a coordinated children's policy, which is not currently the case in France.","","https://doi.org/10.3917/spub.216.0905","20220429","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-30","",30775,""
"[Psychosocial vulnerabilities of Quebec's rural populations during a pandemic]","Psychosocial impacts of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, including those on mental health, are now recognized. However, the experience of the COVID-19 pandemic differs from one individual, group or context to another and solutions to cope with it must be adapted and contextualized. This study aims to identify factors of psychosocial vulnerability in rural populations in Quebec (Canada). The approach is adapted from previous work on the prevention and reduction of the psychosocial impacts of climate change in non-metropolitan areas. A descriptive qualitative design based on several data sources was used. The data come from a press review, a review of the scientific literature, semi-structured interviews with key actors in the community and municipal domains. Data triangulation and validation by community organization teams (public health department) identified forty-one (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 41) factors (e.g., social cohesion, digital literacy) likely to increase or decrease the psychosocial vulnerability of rural populations in the context of a pandemic. These factors are grouped under six categories of determinants: 1) population's knowledge and attitudes towards the pandemic, 2) previous experience of difficult events, 3) community dynamism, social cohesion and solidarity, 4) citizens, municipalities and government authorities' involvement, 5) health and social services and those from their intersectoral partners, and 6) land use planning. These results are useful for local and regional public health teams in developing local portraits of psychosocial vulnerabilities to support plans to strengthen community resilience and reduce social and health inequalities accentuated by the pandemic.","","https://doi.org/10.3917/spub.216.0897","20220429","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-30","",30776,""
"[Nurses' bedside emotions for COVID-19 Consensual qualitative research]","The COVID-19 pandemic has created unprecedented working conditions, with repercussions on the daily lives of nurses. The events experienced positively or negatively in their clinical practice have aroused a variety of emotions for them. The objective of this research is to describe and categorize the events that provoked emotions in nurses who volunteered to accompany COVID-19 victims in a Belgian academic hospital during the first wave of theÃ‚Â pandemic by identifying what these emotions were. The researchers used Hill's Consensual Qualitative Research method. Nineteen semi-structured individual interviews were conducted. After the full transcription of the recordings, the data were analyzed by the research team. The results show that the emotions felt by the participants were caused by thirty-seven types of events (categories) grouped into nine families (domains). COVID-19 is viewed negatively by the participants who express fear of this serious and contagious disease. When they talk about the experiences of patients and their families, their discourse alternates between joy at having been able to provide help and care and sadness at not having been able to be effective in all circumstances. Participants share a positive experience and express joy in recalling the COVID-19 outbreak as an exceptional event that they coped with through their personal and professional experience and resources, their relationships with colleagues on the interprofessional team, and the responses of the nursing department and hospital.","","https://doi.org/10.3917/spub.216.0863","20220429","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-30","",30777,""

"Occupational Burnout and Stress of Nurses in Taiwan Regarding COVID-19: An Intervention with Gong Medication","This study aimed to explore the effectiveness of gong meditation on nurses' perceived stress and occupational burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nurses play an important role in hospitals, and they currently encounter additional stress due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In this experimental study, participants were provided intervention with seven sections of gong meditation, and each session lasted for approximately 50-60 min. Data were collected from July 2020 to February 2021. Eighty nurses were randomly assigned to the experimental or control group, and 79 completed all the processes of our protocol. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used in data analysis. Compared with the control group, the experimental group experienced significant improvements in stress and occupational burnout. Gong meditation can effectively alleviate stress and occupational burnout among nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Gong meditation can be provided by hospital managers to all nurses to reduce their stress, occupational burnout, and subsequent mental health problems. Additionally, we suggest that gong meditation can be used as an effective intervention for individuals in other occupational fields, as it is accessible and inexpensive intervention.","Hsieh, Huang, Ma, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1111/jonm.13653","20220429","COVID-19 pandemic; Gong meditation; Occupational burnout; Perceived stress; Smartwatch","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-30","",30779,""
"The Impact of Canadian Medical Delays and Preventive Measures on Breast Cancer Experience: A Silent Battle Masked by the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic led to the prioritization of breast cancer services towards patients who are currently in treatment or diagnosed with advanced stages of breast cancer, and the self-assessment of both tumor growth and treatment side effects. Alongside the stress associated with cancer itself, delays and complications due to COVID-19 may impact patients' mental health. To describe the experiences of Canadians living with breast cancer who received a diagnosis and/or treatment during the pandemic, and to identify their recommendations for improving patients well-being during future pandemics. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eighteen women living with breast cancer who also completed the Distress Thermometer questionnaire. The transcripts were analyzed using a descriptive thematic content methodology. Women who started their breast cancer screening or treatment before the pandemic reported fewer delays and less psychological distress than those who started during the pandemic. Participants reported feeling dehumanized while receiving their medical care, being unable to be accompanied during medical visits, and fearing treatment interruption during the pandemic. Patient recommendations for improving care and psychological support included the presence of family caregivers at consultations to receive the diagnosis and for the first treatment session. Study findings provide new insights on how healthcare restrictions during the pandemic impacted on patient experiences and their well-being during screening and treatment for breast cancer. The need for cancer nursing practices and care delivery strategies that promote the delivery of compassionate, patient-centred care and the provision of psychological support during future pandemics are identified.","Fortin, Rivest-Beauregard, Defer, Leblanc, Thamar Louis, Roy, Lapierre, Brunet, Montreuil, Marin","https://doi.org/10.1177/08445621221097520","20220429","Psychological distress; mental health; oncology; pandemic; qualitative research; recommendations","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-30","",30780,""
"The impact of COVID-19 restrictions on perceived health and wellbeing of adult Australian sport and physical activity participants","Individuals' access to sport and physical activity has been hampered due to COVID-19 lockdown restrictions. In Australia participation in community sport was cancelled during lockdowns. There is limited research on the impact of sport participation restrictions on the health and wellbeing of adults.AimThe aim of this study was to investigate the perceived health and wellbeing of a sample of predominantly active Australian adults, both during COVID-19 and in comparison with one year earlier (pre COVID-19).MethodsA survey was conducted during the first COVID-19 restrictions and lockdowns in Australia in May-June 2020. It was distributed by national and state sporting organisations and through researchers' social media accounts. This particular paper focuses on adults aged 18-59Ã‚Â years. The survey collected information on participant demographics, the sport and physical activity patterns pre- COVID-19, and health and wellbeing outcomes during COVID-19 lockdown and compared to one year earlier. The health measures were cross-tabulated against the demographic and sport and physical activity variables, and group profiles compared with chi-square tests. Scales were derived from three wellbeing questions, and group differences were analysed by t-tests and F-tests.ResultsThe survey sample included 1279 men and 868 women aged 18-59Ã‚Â years. Most (67%) resided in metropolitan cities. The great majority (83%) were sport participants. During COVID-19 lockdown men were significantly more likely than women to report worse or much worse general (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.014), physical (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.015) and mental health (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.038) and lower life satisfaction (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.016). The inactive adults were significantly more likely to report poorer general health (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and physical health (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) compared to active adults. The younger age cohort (18-29Ã‚Â years) were significantly more likely to report poorer general wellbeing (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), and lower life satisfaction (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) compared to the older age groups.ConclusionIt seems that the absence of playing competitive sport and training with friends, teams and within clubs has severely impacted males and younger adults in particular. Sports clubs provide an important setting for individuals' health and wellbeing which is why clubs require the capacity to deliver sport and individuals may need to regain the motivation to return.","Eime, Harvey, Charity, Elliott, Drummond, Pankowiak, Westerbeek","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-13195-9","20220428","Adults; Community sport; Health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-30","",30781,""
"PTSD is not the emblematic disorder of the COVID-19 pandemic; adjustment disorder is","Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been hailed by some as the emblematic mental disorder of the COVID-19 pandemic, assuming that PTSD's life-threat criterion was met de facto. More plausible outcomes like adjustment disorder (AD) have been overlooked. An online cross-sectional survey was launched in the initial stage of the pandemic using a convenience sample of 5Ã‚Â 913 adults to compare the prevalence of COVID-related probable PTSD versus probable AD. The abridged Impact of Event Scale - Revised (IES-6) assessed the severity of trauma- and stressor-related symptoms over the previous week. Demographic and pandemic-related data (e.g., receiving a formal diagnosis of COVID-19, job loss, loss of loved one, confinement, material hardship) were collected. A Classification and Regression Tree analysis was conducted to uncover the pandemic experiences leading to clinical 'caseness'. Caseness was defined by a scoreÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°9 on the IES-6 symptom measure and further characterized as PTSD or AD depending on whether the Peritraumatic Distress Inventory's life-threat item was endorsed or not. The participants were predominantly Caucasian (72.8%), women (79.2%), with a university degree (85%), and a mean age of 42.22 (SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°15.24) years; 3Ã‚Â 647 participants (61.7%; 95%CI [60.4, 63.0]) met the threshold for caseness. However, when perceived life-threat was accounted for, only 6.7% (95%CI [6.1, 7.4]) were classified as PTSD cases, and 55% (95%CI [53.7, 56.2]) as AD cases. Among the AD cases, three distinct profiles emerged marked by the following: (i) a worst personal pandemic experience eliciting intense fear, helplessness or horror (in the absence, however, of any life-threat), (ii) a pandemic experience eliciting sadness/grief, and (iii) worrying intensely about the safety of significant others. Studies considering the life-threat criterion as met de facto during the pandemic are confusing PTSD for AD on most counts. This misconception is obscuring the various AD-related idioms of distress that have emerged during the pandemic and the actual treatment needs.","Brunet, Rivest-Beauregard, Lonergan, Cipolletta, Rasmussen, Meng, Jaafari, Romero, Superka, Brown, Sapkota","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-022-03903-5","20220428","Adjustment disorder; COVID-19; Coronavirus; Post-traumatic stress; Resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-30","",30782,""
"Suicidal ideation and its related factors among older adults: a population-based study in Southwestern Iran","Suicidal ideation is a major risk factor for suicide and can negatively affect self-care and health behaviors among the older adults. There are limited data on the prevalence and risk factors of suicidal ideation among the older population during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of the present study was to examine the prevalence and risk factors of suicidal ideations among Iranian older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 803 older community adults in Shiraz (Southwestern Iran) were surveyed to determine potential factors influencing suicidal ideation, including demographic factors, physical health status, access to healthcare, current depression status, fear of COVID-19, perceived social support, and social engagement. Data were collected utilizing face-to-face interviews between November and December 2020. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent variables associated with suicidal ideations. Among the 803 participants, 69 reported suicidal ideations (8.6%). Individuals with suicidal ideations were more likely to have greater fear of COVID-19. However, based on the results of multivariate logistic regression analysis, current depression (OR: 2.07, CI 95%: 1.18-3.65), not being married (OR: 1.82, CI 95%: 1.06-3.13), inability to pay for medical bills (OR: 2.16, CI 95%: 1.23-3.79), low perceived social support (OR: 2.03, CI95%: 1.11-3.71), and having limited social network (OR:1.77, CI 95%: 1.02-3.10) appeared to be more powerful influencing factors. Suicidal ideation appears to be relatively common among Iranian older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. A lack of longitudinal data makes it difficult to establish an association between suicidal ideations and the COVID-19 pandemic. Systematic monitoring of suicidal ideation is recommended among high-risk groups, particularly the older population.","Shiraly, Mahdaviazad, Zohrabi, Griffiths","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12877-022-03049-9","20220428","COVID-19; Depression; Older adults; Pandemic; Social support; Suicidal ideation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-30","",30783,""

The Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) COVID-19 Questionnaire developed by the National Institutes of Health ECHO COVID-19 Task Force was administered to participants (n=85) from the iCARE study between June 2020 and October 2020. Children 12 years old (via parent report) and adolescents and young adults Ã¢â€°Â¥13 years old (via self-report) participated. The questionnaire assessed the impact of the pandemic on health-care appointments, lifestyle, internet use, social connections and mental health. Participants were 17.0Ã‚Â±3.1 (range, 12 to 27) years of age and predominantly female (61.3%). During the pandemic, 69.4% were able to attend their health-care appointments by telephone or virtual platforms, 31.7% ate more, 45.1% slept more and 29.3% spent less time on physical activities. There was an increase in internet use for both educational (42.0%) and noneducational purposes (54.9%). Participants felt less socially connected (64.6%). Participants also felt sometimes (59.2%), often (19.7%) and very often (6.7%) satisfied with their lives.

"SARS-CoV-2 Nsp14 mediates the effects of viral infection on the host cell transcriptome","Viral infection involves complex set of events orchestrated by multiple viral proteins. To identify functions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins, we performed transcriptomic analyses of cells expressing individual viral proteins. Expression of Nsp14, a protein involved in viral RNA replication, provoked a dramatic remodeling of the transcriptome that strongly resembled that observed following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, Nsp14 expression altered the splicing of more than 1000 genes and resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of circRNAs, which are linked to innate immunity. These effects were independent of the Nsp14 exonuclease activity and required the N7-guanine-methyltransferase domain of the protein. Activation of the NFkB pathway and increased expression of <i>CXCL8</i> occurred early upon Nsp14 expression. We identified IMPDH2, which catalyzes the rate-limiting step of guanine nucleotides biosynthesis, as a key mediator of these effects. Nsp14 expression caused an increase in GTP cellular levels, and the effect of Nsp14 was strongly decreased in the presence of IMPDH2 inhibitors. Together, our data demonstrate an unknown role for Nsp14 with implications for therapy. Viruses are parasites, relying on the cells they infect to make more of themselves. In doing so they change how an infected cell turns its genes on and off, forcing it to build new virus particles and turning off the immune surveillance that would allow the body to intervene. This is how SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID, survives with a genome that carries instructions to make just 29 proteins. One of these proteins, known as Nsp14, is involved in both virus reproduction and immune escape. Previous work has shown that it interacts with IMPDH2, the cellular enzyme that controls the production of the building blocks of the genetic code. The impact of this interaction is not clear. To find out more, Zaffagni et al. introduced 26 of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins into human cells one at a time. Nsp14 had the most dramatic effect, dialing around 4,000 genes up or down and changing how the cell interprets over 1,000 genes. Despite being just one protein, it mimicked the genetic changes seen during real SARS-CoV-2 infection. Blocking IMPDH2 partially reversed the effects, which suggests that the interaction of Nsp14 with the enzyme might be responsible for the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the genes of the cell. Understanding how viral proteins affect cells can explain what happens during infection. This could lead to the discovery of new treatments designed to counteract the effects of the virus. Further work could investigate whether interfering with Nsp14 helps cells to overcome infection.","Zaffagni, Harris, Patop, Pamudurti, Nguyen, Kadener","https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.71945","20220429","CXCL8; IMPDH2; Nsp14; SARS-CoV-2; chromosomes; circRNA; gene expression; human; infectious disease; microbiology; transcription","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-30","",30786,""
