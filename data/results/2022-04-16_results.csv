"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Psychosocial Health of Persons With Spinal Cord Injury: Investigation of Experiences and Needed Resources","BackgroundEmerging evidence suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has been accompanied by increased rates of depression and social isolation. However, we do not yet understand how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the psychosocial health of people with spinal cord injury (PwSCI), a population that is already at risk of experiencing mental health conditions.ObjectivesThe aims of the study were to (1) examine the impact of the pandemic on the psychosocial health of PwSCI and (2) investigate the experiences of PwSCI and resources they reported needing during the peak of the pandemic.MethodsA cross-sectional survey with closed- and open-ended questions was administered to 51 PwSCI. Participants were included if they had an SCI, were 18 years or older, lived in St. Louis, Missouri, and surrounding areas, and understood English.ResultsCanonical correlation showed a significant association between financial security, food insecurity, and personal assistance service use and adverse psychosocial health outcomes (p &lt; .001). Participants reported interest in resources related to COVID-19 precautions for wheelchair users as well as home exercise programming and financial assistance with utilities. Finally, qualitative analysis revealed four major themes: (1) mental health during the pandemic, (2) financial concerns and reduced access to personal assistance services, (3) feelings of social isolation prior to the pandemic, and (4) local and national authoritiesâ€™ handling of the pandemic.ConclusionPwSCI are impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and reported a variety of resource needs. These findings may inform service providers, support systems, and organizations to better support PwSCI during times of crisis.","Morgan, Kerri, Heeb, Rachel, Walker, Kim, Tucker, Sue, Hollingsworth, Holly","https://doi.org/10.46292/sci21-00060","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Topics in Spinal Cord Injury Rehabilitation; 28(2):185-195, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-16","",30143,""
"Financial literacy as a mediator of personal financial health during COVID-19: A structural equation modelling approach: [version 2;peer review: 2 approved]","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become a global humanitarian challenge. This scourge has impacted people from all walks of life as well as every economic sector and activity, from travel to automotives, hotels to banking, and supply chain to retail. The pandemic has affected not only physical and mental health but also financial health. Studies have examined the pandemicâ€™s economic impact, but very few have examined its impact on personal finances. Efforts to contain the pandemicâ€™s spread, such as lockdowns, have resulted in suspended business operations throughout the world that have intensified joblessness. To prepare and protect people from such unforeseen situations, financial education and planning are necessary. We attempt to expand the evidence on this issue by applying a structural equation modelling approach to identify the mediating role of financial literacy programs in preparing and protecting household wealth against sudden worldwide setbacks. The research design is descriptive and exploratory using snowball sampling technique. The data was collected through an internet survey. In total, 400 survey responses were obtained. After testing the measurement model for key validity dimensions, the hypothesised causal relationships are examined in several path models. The results indicated that coronavirus awareness exerts a direct or indirect influence on the financial health of individuals through financial literacy. We conclude that financial literacy has a full mediating effect on the personal finance of individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings not only contributed to the need and understanding of financial literacy but also have managerial implications. Financial literacy programs provide investment advice and suggestions which are actionable and also work to help individuals to come out stronger in terms of knowledge and skill set when the COVID-19 crisis passes.","Anand, Swati, Mishra, Kushendra, Verma, Vishal, Taruna, Taruna","https://doi.org/10.35241/emeraldopenres.13735.2","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Emerald Open Research;2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-16","",30144,""
"Knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward COVID-19 among the general population: A cross-sectional Study in Kankan Guinea (preprint)","Implementing decisive and effective infection prevention and control measures requires a good understanding of the state of knowledge among the general population, in order to identify existing gaps and respond adequately. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to assess the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) related to COVID-19 among the public in Kankan Guinea, with a view to understanding socio-demographic factors that are associated with poor KAP. In total, 1230 Guineans participated in this study.The majority of respondents (60%) had good knowledge about COVID-19. However, only 44% of respondents below 29 years old had a good level of knowledge about COVID-19. Male participants had a higher level of knowledge about COVID-19 compared to female participants (P = 0.003). The majority of participants (82%) had negative attitudes towards COVID-19 and 61% of respondents reported good practices related to COVID-19 measures. In this study, being female was a risk factor for poor knowledge about COVID-19 (P &lt; 0,001) and being single was a risk factor for negative attitudes towards COVID-19 (P = 0,009).

"The development and validation of the pandemic medication-assisted treatment questionnaire for the assessment of the impact of pandemic crises on medication management and administration for patients with opioid use disorders (preprint)","COVID-19 pandemic and the globally applied restriction measures mainly affect vulnerable population groups, such as patients with opioid use disorders. Towards inhibiting SARS-COV-2 spread, the medication-assisted treatment (MAT) programs follow strategies targeting reduction of in-person psychosocial interventions, and increase of take-home doses. However, there is no available instrument to examine the impact of such modifications on diverse health aspects of patients under MAT. The aim of this study was to develop and validate the PANdemic Medication-Assisted Treatment Questionnaire (PANMAT/Q) to address the pandemic effect on the management and administration of MAT. In total, 463 patients under <U+039C><U+0391><U+03A4> participated. Our findings indicate that PANMAT/Q has been successfully validated exerting reliability and validity. It can be completed within approximately 5 minutes, and its implementation in research settings is advocated.

"Effect of internet-based UP-A intervention on stress, anxiety, depression, and psychological flexibility during the COVID-19 pandemic: A clinical trial (preprint)","Objective:  The Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders in Adolescents (UP-A) has been shown to be effective for reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression in adolescents with emotional disorders. The present study aims to assess the effectiveness of internet-based UP-A in reducing stress, anxiety, and depression, and psychological flexibility of adolescents with subclinical features of emotional disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: : This is a longitudinal randomized clinical trial conducted on 40 adolescents aged 12-17 years with subclinical features of emotional disorder. They were assigned randomly into two groups of intervention (n=20) and control (n=20). They first completed the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale- 21 item (DASS-21) and the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (AAQ-2) online. Then, the intervention group received 12 sessions of UP-A through video call on WhatsApp, two days per week each for 45 minutes. The control group received no treatment. Immediately and 3 months after the intervention, the questionnaires were completed again. Collected data were analyzed using longitudinal marginal modeling. Results: : The stress, anxiety, and depression levels of adolescents decreased and their psychological flexibility increased immediately and 3 months after the intervention. The marginal modeling showed the interaction effect of time and group (p&lt;0.05), indicating that the difference between groups was significant at all three time points.

"Tele-yoga in the management of Ankylosing Spondylitis amidst COVID pandemic: A Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial (preprint)","Patients with Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) often report mental and physical problems and have a poor quality of life (QoL). This study intended to investigate the efficacy of a 3-months tele-yogic intervention on the disease activity, inflammatory markers, and mental health measures in patients with AS. Hundred and twenty AS patients were assigned to either the yoga intervention or control arm. The yoga intervention arm (YG) (n = 57) received a 60-minutes structured yoga module for 3-months on online in addition to standard medical care. The control (CG) participants (n = 52) followed only standard care for the same period. BASDAI, BASFI, ASQOL, psychological and inflammatory biomarkers were assessed at baseline and three months. YG showed significant improvement in BASDAI (p = 0.001), anxiety (p = 0.0004), and depression (p = 0.001) at 3-months compared to the baseline. The CG showed no change. After 3-months, the intervention resulted in a significant improvement in BASDI (-0.79;95% CI (-1.3, to -0.29);p = 0.0021),BASFI (-0.86;95% CI (-1.59, to -0.14);p = 0.0193), anxiety (-0.42;95% CI (-0.84 to -0.01);p = 0.0468), and AS-QoL (-3.37;95% CI (-5.21, to 1.53);p = 0.0004) compared to the CG.

"â€œCOVID Knocked me Straight Into the Dirtâ€: Perspectives from People Experiencing Homelessness on the Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic (preprint)","Background:  People experiencing homelessness (PEH) are uniquely susceptible and disproportionately affected by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding context-specific challenges, responses, and perspectives of PEH is essential to improving pandemic response and mitigating the long-term consequences of the pandemic on this vulnerable population. Methods As part of an ongoing community-based participatory research study in partnership with a homeless service organization in Indiana, semi-structured interviews were conducted with a total of 34 individuals experiencing homelessness between January and July 2021. Guided by the NIMHD Health Disparities Research Framework, which builds on the socio-ecological model, data was thematically coded using Nvivo12 qualitative coding software and themes were organized by levels of influence (individual, interpersonal, community, societal) and domains of influence (biological, behavioral, physical/built environment, sociocultural environment, health care system). Results PEH narratives revealed numerous and compounding factors affecting COVID-19 risks and health outcomes among PEH across all levels and domains of influence. At the individual level, PEH experience unique challenges that heightened their susceptibility to COVID-19, including pre-existing physical and mental health conditions, substance use and behavioral health risks, socioeconomic precarity, and low health literacy and COVID-related knowledge. At the interpersonal level, poor communication between PEH and homelessness service providers led to limited understanding of and poor compliance with COVID safety measures. At the community level, closures and service disruptions restricted PEH access to usual spaces and resources to meet basic needs. At a policy level, PEH were disregarded in ways that made pandemic relief resources largely inaccessible to them. Conclusions Our findings reveal important and mitigable issues with ongoing pandemic response efforts in homeless populations through direct, first-hand accounts of PEH experiences during COVID-19. These insights offer opportunities for multilevel interventions to improve outreach, communication, and impact mitigation strategies for PEH. This study highlights the importance of centering the voices of vulnerable communities to inform future pandemic response for homeless and other underserved and marginalized populations.","Rodriguez, Natalia, Martinez, Rebecca, Ziolkowski, Rebecca, Tolliver, Cealia, Young, Hope, Ruiz, Yumary","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1442084/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Research Square;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-16","",30150,""
"Impact of psychological stress during COVID 19 pandemic on quality of life of health care workers in mental health hospital in Egypt (preprint)","Background:  COVID-19 outbreak resulted in negative mental health consequences such as depression, anxiety, and stress, particularly among health-care workers. Objective: To evaluate health care worker mental well-being and explore the reasons standing beyond their concerns and fears. Methods:  From January to June 2021, we recruited 107 health care workers from psychiatric hospitals. The translated Arabic version COVID stress scale was used to assess their level of stress. The WHO Quality of Life - BREF score was used to assess their level of affection for their quality of life. Results:  The majority of our sample (45.8%) was between the ages of 20 and 30. Females made up 37.8% of the group. The majority of them were infected during the first wave. The COVID Stress Scale (CSS) revealed that 21.5% of participants had no signs or symptoms of depression, while 55.1% had mild symptoms. Only 23.4% of our sample had moderate to severe symptoms.

"Maternal Mental Health and Breastfeeding amidst the Covid-19 Pandemic: outcomes in a Catalan cohort (preprint)","Background:  Covid-19 pandemic became an unexpected stressor for the entire population and, particularly, for pregnant women and lactating mothers. The alarming infectious risk together with the lockdown period could affect the emotional state of mothers-to-be, as well as breastfeeding rates, mother-baby bonding, or neonatal weight gain. The aim of this study is to describe the impact of this world health emergency in mother-baby pairs right after the first wave of Sars-Cov-2 pandemic (from March to May 2020). Study design: a prospective observational study was carried out in mother-child dyads from those women who gave birth between June and August 2020 in a tertiary hospital. 91 mother-baby pairs were initially enrolled and 56 of them completed the follow-up. The study design had two separate steps: i) Step one: A clinical interview plus three psychometric tests (EPDS: Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, PBQ: Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire and STAI-S: State-Trait Anxiety Inventory);ii) Step two: mother-child dyads were followed using a round of three brief telephone interviews (conducted at the newbornâ€™s 7, 14 and 28 days of age) to accurately depict the newbornâ€™s outcome in the neonatal period. Results: : In terms of maternal mental health, 25% of the sample screens positively in the EPDS, requiring further evaluation to rule out depressive symptoms. STAI-state and PBQ detect no abnormalities in either anxiety levels or mother-child bonding in our sample, as 100% of the mothers score below the cut-off points in each test (34 and 26 respectively). When comparing feeding practices (breast/bottle feeding) in 2020 to those practices during pre-pandemic years (2017-2019), a significant increase in breastfeeding was found in pandemic times.

"Nursesâ€™ satisfaction and experiences of redeployment during COVID-19- A cross-sectional survey (preprint)","Background:  Literature suggested that redeployment to an unfamiliar environment is a risk to nursesâ€™ mental health. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many health professionals, particularly nurses, were required to be redeployed to different units to meet the changing demands of health service. This study aimed to evaluate nursesâ€™ satisfaction and experiences of redeployment during COVID-19 and identify factors influencing redeployment satisfaction. Methods: : A cross-sectional survey was developed to explore level of satisfaction and understand redeployment experiences. A total of 600 nurses from a tertiary teaching hospital in Australia were invited to complete an online survey from July to August 2020 with an estimated 25% of these experiencing redeployment as result of COVID-19 pandemic. Logistic regression was used to identify what impacts redeployment satisfaction. Redeployment experiences were analysed using iterative thematic approach. Results: : A total of 98 surveys were analysed, with an estimated response rate of 65%. Forty-four percent of redeployed nurses were dissatisfied with redeployment and 53% reported a negative redeployment experience. Nurses who had a negative redeployment experience were five times more likely to be dissatisfied with redeployment (OR: 5.17, 95% CI: 2.12-12.5). These results were reflected in the qualitative findings where nurses reported that a positive redeployment experience such as â€œfeeling welcomeâ€ and being given â€œfair patient allocationâ€ eased their anxiety of being redeployed and created a positive perception on redeployment. Conclusion:  Redeployment of healthcare workers during a pandemic is inevitable. This study highlighted that a large proportion of redeployed nurses feel dissatisfied with redeployment. Creating a positive redeployment experience is an important consideration to improve nursesâ€™ satisfaction. In order to reduce the negative impact of dissatisfaction, more research needs to investigate how the negative redeployment experienced by nurses impacts on quality care and patient safety.","Chu, Ginger, Connelly, Kristy, Mexon, Alexandra, Britton, Ben, Tait, Julie, Pitt, Victoria, Inder, Kerry","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1429392/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Research Square;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-16","",30153,""
"Counting the Social, Psychological and Economic Costs of COVID-19 for Cancer Patients (preprint)","Purpose:  Cancer patients were particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic given their reliance on the health care system, and their weakened immune systems. This systematic review examines the social, psychological and economic impacts of COVID-19 on cancer patients.MethodsThe systematic search, conducted in March 2021, captures the experience of COVID-19 Wave I, when the most severe restrictions were in place globally, from a patient perspective.ResultsThe search yielded 56 studies reporting on the economic, social, and psychological impacts of COVID-19. The economic burden associated with cancer for patients, during the pandemic included direct and indirect costs with both objective (i.e. financial burden) and subjective elements (financial distress). The pandemic exasperated existing psychological strain and associated adverse outcomes. Including: worry and fear (of COVID-19 and cancer prognosis);distress, anxiety, and depression;social isolation and loneliness. National and institutional public health guidelines to reduce COVID-19 transmission resulted in suspended cancer screening programmes, delayed diagnoses, postponed or deferred treatments and altered treatment. These altered patients' decision making and health seeking behaviours.ConclusionCOVID-19 compounded the economic, social, and psychological impacts of cancer on patients owing to health system adjustments and reduction in economic activity. Identification of the impact of COVID-19 on cancer patients from a psychological, social, and economic perspective following the pandemic can inform the design of timely and appropriate interventions and supports, to deal with the backlog in cancer care and enhance recovery.","Kirby, Ann, Drummond, Frances, Lawlor, Amy, Murphy, Aileen","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1427151/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Research Square;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-16","",30154,""
"A Cross-Sectional Study Investigating The Tools and Resources Australian Medical Students Used to Support Their Mental Health During COVID-19 (preprint)","Background:  The mental health of medical students is notoriously poor, and with the additional challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, there has never been greater concern for the wellbeing of the current cohort. This cross-sectional study investigates the impact of coping strategies used by Australian medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic on their mental health improvement, including exercise, using social media, and connecting with family and friends. Methods:  An anonymous questionnaire was shared with medical students from all years via Facebook and General Practice Students Networksâ€™ communications during the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of a variety of lockdown coping strategies utilised by participants was assessed using SPSS. Results:  There were 321 participants in this study, 69.6% of whom were females, 54.9% in their pre-clinical years, and 70.5% between the ages of 18-24. The results showed that nearly 80% of participants credited their mental health improvement to peri-lockdown strategies. The logistic regression analysis demonstrated that reading (non-medical books) and spending more time with family were the most notable peri-lockdown strategies associated with mental health improvement. Interestingly, some coping strategies made some participants more â€œdemotivatedâ€ and were in fact more â€œaddictiveâ€ which â€œtook away from study timeâ€, especially video games, TV series and movies. Conclusion:  In quantitatively and qualitatively illustrating the impact of peri-lockdown coping strategies, we hope that medical faculties and mental health support networks within medicine may more appropriately tailor support and resources for students, not only in this time of hardship, but also for the many challenges ahead of all medical students. More specifically, medical faculty leads could explore the possible implementation of small reminders in the course curriculum, i.e. at the end of lecture and study material, to remind students to take breaks from studying, through reading and/or spending more time with family.","Jiang, Stephen, Lu, Anton, Yeoh, Alexandra, Tan, Andrea, Vimalanathan, Viveeka, Xu, Annie, Albarqouni, Loai","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1422529/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Research Square;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-16","",30155,""
"Emotional impact on children during home confinement in Spain (preprint)","Introduction:  The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about important changes. On March 14, 2020, a strict home confinement was decreed in Spain. Children did not attend school and were not allowed to leave their homes. The aim of this study was to determine the emotional state of these children, as well as associated factors. Material and methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted using an online questionnaire sent by cell phone. This survey includes sociodemographic items and questions concerning the emotional impact of the lockdown. With the questions on emotions, two categories of emotional state were established with the variables fear, irritability, sadness and somatization: those who were less or more emotionally affected. A multivariate logistic model was used to estimate the associations between the variables. Results: A total of 3890 responses were obtained. The mean age of the children was 6.47 years (range 0 to 17). A score indicating poor emotional state was reported by 40.12%. The multivariate logistic model for poor emotional state was directly associated with having less appetite, sleep disturbances, and with parentsâ€™ beliefs that their child will have difficulties returning to normal life after lockdown. A better emotional state was associated with being an only child, access to outdoor spaces at home, having pets, and parents informing their children about the pandemic using creative explanations. Conclusions: During strict home confinement, a considerable emotional impact was observed in children as described by their parents. Specific elements were associated with a better or poorer emotional state.","SÃ¡nchez-Ferrer, Francisco, Cervantes-GarcÃ­a, Evelyn, GavilÃ¡n-MartÃ­n, CÃ©sar, Quesada, JosÃ© Antonio, Cortes-Castell, Ernesto, Nso-Roca, Ana Pilar","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1341840/v2","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Research Square;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-16","",30156,""
"A convolutional neural network-based COVID-19 detection method using chest CT images","Background: High-throughput population screening for the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is critical to controlling disease transmission. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a cutting-edge technology in the field of computer vision and may prove more effective than humans in medical diagnosis based on computed tomography (CT) images. Chest CT images can show pulmonary abnormalities in patients with COVID-19. Methods: In this study, CT image preprocessing are firstly performed using fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm to extracted the region of the pulmonary parenchyma. Through multiscale transformation, the preprocessed image is subjected to multi scale transformation and RGB (red, green, blue) space construction. After then, the performances of GoogLeNet and ResNet, as the most advanced CNN architectures, were compared in COVID-19 detection. In addition, transfer learning (TL) was employed to solve overfitting problems caused by limited CT samples. Finally, the performance of the models were evaluated and compared using the accuracy, recall rate, and F1 score. Results: Our results showed that the ResNet-50 method based on TL (ResNet-50-TL) obtained the highest diagnostic accuracy, with a rate of 82.7% and a recall rate of 79.1% for COVID-19. These results showed that applying deep learning technology to COVID-19 screening based on chest CT images is a very promising approach. This study inspired us to work towards developing an automatic diagnostic system that can quickly and accurately screen large numbers of people with COVID-19. Conclusions: We tested a deep learning algorithm to accurately detect COVID-19 and differentiate between healthy control samples, COVID-19 samples, and common pneumonia samples. We found that TL can significantly increase accuracy when the sample size is limited.","Cao, Y.; Zhang, C.; Peng, C.; Zhang, G. F.; Sun, Y.; Jiang, X. X.; Wang, Z.; Zhang, D.; Wang, L. F.; Liu, J.

"Enhancing Resilience Regarding Depression, Anxiety and COVID-19 with a Narrative Method of Ordering Memory Effective in Researchers Experiencing Burnout (preprint)","Depression and anxiety are prevalent, persistent and difficult to treat industrialized world mental health problems. These disorders negatively modify an individual's life perspective through brain function imbalances, notably in the amygdala and hippocampus, and are primarily treated with pharmaceuticals and psychotherapy. Nevertheless, these mental health issues have only increased in the number of individuals affected and the intensity of their suffering-especially as a result of COVID-19 restrictions and fears. An approach to alleviating depression and anxiety in relation to researchers self-identifying as experiencing burnout is promising. Enhancing resilience, the approach considers depression and anxiety as consequences of the particular method people adopt in ordering their memories, and focuses on narrative development. The method encourages accepting of different perspectives as unique and necessary in creating safe protection from research burnout. Moving from an identification of personal character to prompting plot development of memory, the method promotes resilience by encouraging thoughtful reconsideration of the negative assessments by participants of their circumstances that can lead to depression and anxiety. The method of ordering and group members' feedback are inspected, including during the period of COVID-19 restrictions, and conclusions are offered regarding further research to encourage burnout resilience to diminish depression and anxiety.","Nash, Carol","https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202203.0313.v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Preprints.org;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-16","",30158,""
"DesafÃ­os educativos en ambientes virtuales: escuelas rurales y urbanas","Se presentan los resultados de una investigaciÃ³n que indagÃ³ en las percepciones y experiencias de estudiantes universitarios en contextos urbanos y rurales, a fin de conocer cÃ³mo viven su educaciÃ³n en una modalidad virtual bajo un contexto de pandemia, considerando tres categorias: condiciones pedagÃ³gicas, materiales y emocionales. Fue un estudio cualitativo a partir del mÃ©todo fenomenolÃ³gico, se aplicaron entrevistas a profundidad y anÃ¡lisis documental. Particip aron doce universitarios de zonas rurales y quince de urbanas en el Estado de Chihuahua. Los resultados indican que en ambos contextos se percibiÃ³ una educaciÃ³n deficiente, con prÃ¡cticas docentes tradicionales y aburridas, con aprendizajes por debajo de lo esperado y retroalimentaciÃ³n y comunicaciÃ³n poco efectiva;se presentÃ³ baja motivaciÃ³n y sentimientos recurrentes de miedo, tristeza y desesperanza;la mayor preocupaciÃ³n en contextos urbanos fue el riesgo de contagio y el aislamiento social, en rurales los problemas de conectividad y la pobreza econÃ³mica. Sobre los recursos materiales, los estudiantes en contextos rurales tuvieron mayores carencias, menos de la mitad contaban con computadora e internet. Por otro lado, se encontrÃ³ un desarrollo de habilidades tecnolÃ³gicas y de autogestiÃ³n del aprendizaje como la administraciÃ³n del tiempo y los recursos, la organizaciÃ³n de actividades y la autoconstrucciÃ³n del conocimiento. Se concluye que la educaciÃ³n virtual se desarrolla bajo un paradigma tradicional, lo que hace necesario fortalecer no sÃ³lo el acceso a tecnologÃ­as, tambiÃ©n promover la motivacion, participaciÃ³n e interacciones entre estudiantes y transformar las prÃ¡cticas pasivas por experiencias organizadas, flexibles y con impacto social, actitudinal y cognitivo.Alternate :The results of an investigation that investigated the perceptions and experiences of university students in urban and rural contexts are presented, in order to know how they live their education in a virtual mode under a pandemic context, considering three categories: pedagogical, material and emotional It was a qualitative study based on the phenomenological method, in-depth interviews and documentary analysis were applied. Twelve university students from rural areas and 15 from urban areas in the State of Chihuahua participated. The results indicate that in both contexts a deficient education was perceived, with traditional and boring teaching practices, with lower than expected learning and ineffective feedback and communication;low motivation and recurrent feelings of fear, sadness and hopelessness were presented. The greatest concern in urban contexts was the risk of contagion and social isolation, in rural the problems of connectivity and economic poverty. Regarding material resources, students in rural contexts had greater deficiencies, less than half had a computer and internet. On the other hand, it was found a development of technological skills and self-management of learning such as time and resource management, the organization of activities and the self-construction ofknowledge. It is concluded that virtual education is developed under a traditional paradigm, which makes it necessary to strengthen not only access to technologies, but also to promote motivation, participation and interactions among students and transform passive practices through organized, flexible experiences with social impact, attitudinal and cognitive.","Grijalva, Perla Melendez, HernÃ¡ndez, Celia Carrera, Luna, Josefina Madrigal","https://doi.org/10.20511/pyr2021.v9n3.1333","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Propositos y Representaciones; 9(3):1-19, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-16","",30159,""
"Nonprofit Governance in an Age of Disruption and Transition: The Impact of COVID-19","The drastic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the arts and cultural sector cannot be underestimated. Over 90% of arts venues have ceased or transformed their operations, with many productions being delayed, postponed, rescheduled, or canceled because of travel restrictions and lockdowns. Facing hiring freezes, layoffs, and furloughs, cultural organizations have been forced to make difficult choices based on their unique situations and resources. As Farago (2021) noted: â€œThe effects of this cultural depression will be excruciating, and not only for the symphony not written, the dance not choreographed, the sculpture not cast, the musical not staged. Beyond value in its own right, culture is also an industry sector accounting for more than 4.5 percent of this countryâ€™s gross domestic product, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.â€ The three cases in this issue highlight the governance challenges faced by arts organizations in California, Pennsylvania, and Illinois.

"Impact of Coronavirus Infection Threats and Response Measures to Combat It on Disabled People as a Socially Vulnerable Category: A Thematic Literature Review","In December 2019, the world faced the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused a widespread social upheaval. The negative consequences of the infection and restrictions associated with it have particularly acutely affected socially vulnerable groups of the population, including the disabled. This article attempts a thematic analysis of scientific publications on the impact of the coronavirus infection and response measures to combat it on persons with disabilities. The empirical basis was the domestic and foreign literature in Russian and English from the scientific databases Scopus, ScienceDirect, Google Academy, E-library, as well as published in journals included in the list of peer-reviewed publications of the Higher Attestation Commission of the Russian Federation. The analysis of English- and Russian-language literature suggests the relevance of research on the threats and social consequences of COVID-19. However, the emphasis on the disparity and specificity of the threats and consequences of the pandemic, and the response to it for socially vulnerable groups of the population is rather characteristic of English-language literature. English-language databases contain a larger body of scientific literature on the problems of persons with disabilities in this period. Based on the analysis of the databases, the main threats to persons with disabilities during the pandemic were identified (threats related to the availability and quality of medical services;the inability to comply with preventive measures;deterioration of mental health;socioeconomic risks;threats associated with difficulties in reducing or unavailability of services and social support;increased risks of infection in segregated living conditions;the low level of accessibility of the environment and information;the increase in violence and the transformation of ""norms"" in relation to persons with disabilities). Scientific research is an important resource for reducing threats during the COVID-19 period and developing fundamentally new mechanisms for protecting the rights of persons with disabilities. Insufficient attention of domestic researchers to the situation of disabled people, lack of consideration of gender, age, and nosological characteristics of various categories of disabled people during the pandemic negatively affect the development of targeted support for the population. The thematic spectrum of research on the problems of persons with disabilities during the pandemic allows us to outline research directions in the Russian reality and use the knowledge gained in the development of practical recommendations for improving social policy in relation to persons with disabilities.","Detochenko, L.

"Yoga to improve maternal mental health and immune function during the COVID-19 crisis (Yoga-M2 trial): study protocol for a pilot randomized controlled trial (preprint)","Background:  Mental health of women is adversely affected during pregnancy. A huge proportion of pregnant women suffer from stress and depression which negatively impacts birthweight and neuro-cognitive development of the fetus. The current crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic further adds to the stressful situation. Yoga practiced during pregnancy has beneficial effects on improving stress and depression and preliminary evidence suggests that yoga-based interventions can improve immunity. This study aims to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a Yoga -based intervention for maternal M ental health and i M munity (Yoga-M 2 ) in a rural community in India.Â  Â Â  Methods: : The study design will be a single-blind individual randomized parallel group-controlled pilot trial with 1:1 allocation ratio. Adult pregnant women, with gestational age between 12â€“24 weeks will be randomly allocated to either the Yoga-M 2 group or the Enhanced Usual Care (EUC) group. Participants in the Yoga-M 2 arm will attend weekly group yoga sessions for 12 weeks and will be encouraged to practice yoga at home. In the EUC arm, participants will receive a single session of health education. Eligibility of the participants, recruitment, retention-in-care, and study completion rates will be estimated and feasibility of delivering Yoga-M 2 and acceptability of this intervention by the participants will be assessed. Change in the scores of the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), EuroQoL 5 Dimensions Score (EQ-5D-5L), Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Severity Scale (WURSS-21), and serum C-Reactive Protein at three-months post-randomization will be used to assess preliminary efficacy. Â  Discussion:  The key outputs of this trial will be a structured intervention manual and evidence about the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the intervention,Â establishing the foundation to undertake an explanatory randomized controlled trial to assess efficacy and cost-effectiveness of Yoga-M 2 intervention.Â  Trial registration: CTRI/2022/01/039701 .

"The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on health care workersâ€™ anxiety levels: a meta-analysis","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has been declared a public health emergency of international concern, causing excessive anxiety among health care workers. Additionally, publication bias and low-quality publications have become widespread, which can result in the dissemination of unreliable information. A meta-analysis was performed for this study with the following two aims: (1) to examine the prevalence of anxiety among health care workers and determine whether it has increased owing to the COVID-19 pandemic and (2) to investigate whether there has been an increase in publication bias. Methods All relevant studies published between 2015 and 2020 were searched in electronic databases (namely Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, PsycInfo, PsyArXiv, and medRxiv). The heterogeneity of the studies was assessed using the I2 statistic. The effect size (prevalence rate of anxiety) and 95% CI for each study were also calculated. We used moderator analysis to test for the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on health care workersâ€™ anxiety levels and to detect publication bias in COVID-19 studies. We assessed publication bias using funnel plots and Eggerâ€™s regression. Results A total of 122 studies with 118,025 participants met the inclusion criteria. Eighty-eight articles (75,066 participants) were related to COVID-19, 13 articles (9,222 participants) were unrelated to COVID-19 (i.e., articles related to other outbreaks, which were excluded), and 21 preprints (33,737 participants) were related to COVID-19. The pooled meta-analysis prevalence was 33.6% (95% CI [30.5-36.8];95% PI [6.5-76.3]). Moderator analysis revealed no significant differences between articles related to COVID-19 and those unrelated to COVID-19 (p = 0.824). Moreover, no significant differences were found between articles and preprints related to COVID-19 (p = 0.843). Significant heterogeneity was observed in each subgroup. An Eggerâ€™s test revealed publication bias in both articles and preprints related to COVID-19 (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions Determining whether the anxiety state of health care workers is altered by the COVID-19 pandemic is currently difficult. However, there is evidence that their anxiety levels may always be high, which suggests that more attention should be paid to their mental health. Furthermore, we found a substantial publication bias;however, the quality of the studies was relatively stable and reliable.","Zhang, Lunbo, Yan, Ming, Takashima, Kaito, Guo, Wenru, Yamada, Yuki","https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.13225","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: PeerJ;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-16","",30163,""
"Depression, Anxiety, and Stress among General Public of India during Post-COVID-19 Second Wave: A Web-Based Cross-Sectional Survey","Background: Evidence suggests that one-third of respondents had a significant psychological impact in the lockdown period of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This indicates a need for longitudinal assessment of the psychological needs of the public to plan holistic interventions. Aim: To investigate depression, anxiety, and stress (DAS) levels among the general public post-COVID-19 second wave. Materials and Methods: A web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among the general public who were aged above 15 years. The data were collected through online mode by providing a link to fill Google Form. The survey tool was disseminated in various messenger groups and social media networks. The survey tool comprises demographics, COVID-19 stressors, and DAS Scale 21 (DASS-21). Multi and Univariate linear regression analysis was used to correlate patient characteristics and COVID-19 stressors with DASS-21 subscales. Results: A total of 2515 (males = 1274;females = 1241) people participated in this web-based survey. The mean age of the study respondents was 31.3 Â± 13.4 years. The mean scores of depression, anxiety, and stress were 6.8 Â± 8.6, 5.0 Â± 7.3, and 7.3 Â± 8.6, respectively. The majority of the participants are normal in all sub-scales of DASS-21. Very few are experiencing symptoms of severe or extremely severe depression (4.2%, 4.3%), anxiety (3.3%, 6.9%), and stress (3.0%, 2.3%). Geriatrics, females, health-care workers, homemakers/unemployed/retired people, rural residents, and people suffering from co-morbidities have a significant elevation of DAS scores with a P &lt; 0.05. Conclusion: Even though most of the respondents are free from the DAS symptoms, few are still (post-COVID-19 second wave) experiencing symptoms of severe or extremely severe DAS subscales. More interview-based and probability sampling future studies are warranted to minimize the biases present in the study.","Mekala, Jyothi Suchitra, Goruntla, Narayana, Nayaka, Bharathi, Velpula, Kavyasree, Biswas, Raghavendra, Veerabhadrappa, Kasturi Viswanathasetty, Pradeepkumar, Bhupalam","https://doi.org/10.4103/injms.injms_103_21","","Database: CINAHL; Publication type: article; Publication details: Indian Journal of Medical Specialities; 13(2):87-94, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-16","",30164,""
"Conservation biology meets medical science","that syndemics are a new path to global health research. Many medical researchers have since picked up on the topic, leading to the suggestion that the ongoing Covid-19 crisis is a syndemic and not a pandemic (Horton 2020). In a syndemic, the Covid-19 virus is not the primary cause of the current pandemic, but only a trigger due to the globally deteriorating human health (Horton 2020). Kenyon (Kenyon 2020) added that the syndemic approach needs to include an ecological dimension, while Mendenhall (Mendenhall 2020) stated that the context matters. None of the colleagues was wrong. However, it shows how little researchers from different disciplines interact and exchange on concepts. Syndemics is already well captured in the more medical-orientated OneHealth concept (Gibbs 2014), as well as in the more ecologically-orientated EcoHealth concept (Rapport 2007). All of these concepts and terms have in common to state that human health is inextricably linked to the environmental health and health-determining factors in the highly complex socio-ecological system. The complexity of this socio-ecological system, in which human health is embedded, is the underlying factor for the emergence of these slightly differently centred concepts, while the aim of all of these are the same: understanding the underlying causes for the increasing frequency of epidemics or panattributed to climate change, biodiversity loss, habitat degradation and an increasing rate of wildlife-human contacts, but that all of these are caused by synergies between","Schmeller, D.

"Two Years and Four Time Points: Description of Emotional State and Coping Strategies of French University Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic","While it is now clear that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on the mental health of individuals, especially the most vulnerable ones such as students, we have very little knowledge about the long-term consequences. The objective of this study was to compare the mental health and coping of French university students during the different phases of the pandemic in the first 2 years. To this end, French university students were evaluated at four time points: during France's first lockdown (April&ndash;May 2020;nT1 = 1357), the period after lockdown (June 2020;nT2 = 309), 1 year after the first lockdown, which was also a lockdown period (April&ndash;May 2021;nT1&prime;= 2569);and 1 year after the end of the first unlock (June 2021;nT2&prime;= 1136). Anxiety and depressive symptoms, coping and concerns were measured. In order to compare scores between the lockdown and unlock periods within the same year, paired samples t-tests were performed. To compare scores between the 2 years for different participants, independent samples t-tests were conducted. Our results showed that maladaptive strategies, concerns and symptoms were higher during lockdown periods, compared with unlock periods. In addition, symptom levels were higher in the second year of the pandemic compared with the first one. These argue that the psychological effects of COVID-19 were exacerbated by lockdowns but also by time. This highlights the need for more attention to be paid to students' mental health.","Charbonnier, Elodie, Goncalves, AurÃ©lie, Puechlong, CÃ©cile, Montalescot, Lucile, Le Vigouroux, Sarah","https://doi.org/10.3390/v14040782","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Viruses; 14(4):782, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-16","",30166,""
"Research Framework Built Natural-Based Solutions (NBSs) as Green Hotels","In this study, value-belief-norm (VBN) theory and the social exchange theory (SET) were applied to predict hotel customersâ€™ pro-environmental responsibility behavior intention (PRBI) for the characteristics of NBSs in green hotelsâ€”specifically, to investigate the relationship between NBSs as green hotel and PRBI, and to test its mediating effect on pro-environmental perceived (PPV), pro-environmental perceived belief (PPVBE), personal pro-environmental norms (PPN), attitude toward environmental behavior (ATEB), mental health (MH), well-being (WB), and satisfaction (SA) and the moderating effect of locations (urban, rural) among these variables toward pro-environmental responsibility behavior intention (PRBI). Data were collected using a survey of 440 customers who had visited green hotels in the Republic of Korea within the last 12 months. We used to test the research hypotheses by structural equation modeling (SEM). The findings generally supported the hypothesized associations between variables within our proposed theoretical framework and confirmed the moderating effect of location. The studyâ€™s results have important theoretical and practical implications for the environment. We investigated the relationship between the characteristics of NBSs and PRBI of green hotels, and we investigated the relationship between psychological state, attitude, and behavior of green hotel customers by applying variables suitable for ART, SET, and VBN. In addition, we verified the moderating effect of customersâ€™ green behavior and attitudes toward green hotels located in urban and rural areas. Moreover, these findings herein may encourage green hotels to participate in preventing environmental problems. It provides primary data on customersâ€™ perception of ecofriendliness in establishing corporate management strategies.","Kim, Taeuk, Yun, Sunmi","https://doi.org/10.3390/su14074282","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sustainability; 14(7):4282, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-16","",30167,""
"Requirements and Solution Approaches to Personality-Adaptive Conversational Agents in Mental Health Care","Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies enable Conversational Agents (CAs) to perform highly complex tasks in a human-like manner and may help people cope with anxiety to improve their mental health and well-being. To support patients with their mental well-being in an authentic way, CAs need to be imbued with human-like behavior, such as personality. In this paper we cover an innovative form of CA, so-called Personality-Adaptive Conversational Agents (PACAs) that automatically infer usersâ€™ personality traits and adapt accordingly to their personality. We empirically investigate their benefits and caveats in mental health care. The results of our study show that PACAs can be beneficial for mental health support, but they also raise concerns about trust and privacy issues. We present a set of relevant requirements for designing PACAs and provide solution approaches that can be followed when designing and implementing PACAs for mental health care.","Siemon, Dominik, Rangina, Ahmad, Harms, Henrik, de Vreede, Triparna","https://doi.org/10.3390/su14073832","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sustainability; 14(7):3832, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-16","",30168,""
"Carbon Fibers Waste Recovery via Pyro-Gasification: Semi-Industrial Pilot Plant Testing and LCA","Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers (CFRPs) are increasingly used in a variety of applications demanding a unique combination of mechanical properties and lightweight characteristics such as automotive and aerospace, wind turbines, and sport and leisure equipment. This growing use, however, has not yet been accompanied by the setting of an adequate recycling industry, with landfilling still being the main management route for related waste and end-of-life products. Considering the fossil-based nature of carbon fibers, the development of recovery and recycling technologies is hence prioritized to address the environmental sustainability challenges in a bid to approach mitigating the climate emergency and achieving circularity in materialsâ€™ life cycles. To this aim, we scaled up and tested a novel semi-industrial pilot plant to pyrolysis and subsequent oxidation of uncured prepreg offcuts and cured waste of CFRPs manufacturing. The environmental performance of the process proposed has been evaluated by means of a life cycle assessment to estimate the associated carbon footprint and cumulative energy demand according to three scenarios. The scale-up of the process has been performed by investigating the influence of the main parameters to improve the quality of the recovered fibers and the setting of preferable operating conditions. The pyro-gasification process attested to a reduction of 40 kgCO2eq per kg of recycled CFs, compared to virgin CFs.

"Being a Parent during COVID-19: Risk for Psychological Distress in the United States and Italy","The COVID-19 pandemic has had significant effects on people worldwide, yet the psychological impact of collective traumas may differ at the individual and societal level. Parents may be exposed to greater pandemic-related stressors, yet also are more likely than non-parents to have social interactions during social distancing mandates. Furthermore, varying degrees of pandemic severity in countries may alter the adverse outcomes of pandemic stressors on psychopathology across nations. The purpose of this investigation was to cross-nationally explore how COVID-19 stress exposure relates to psychological distress and whether the association differed by parental status and nationality. Individuals from the United States (n = 2449) and Italy (n = 579) completed assessments measuring traumatic stress, depressive symptoms, and COVID-19-related stressors. COVID-19-related stressors were positively associated with traumatic stress and depressive symptoms. The association between COVID-19-related stressors and psychological distress did not differ by parental status or nationality. We also found that being a young adult, having a lower educational status, not being a parent, and being Italian were related to exposure to COVID-19-related stressors. We discuss these findings and their implications for our understanding of unique contexts that may pose as risk or resiliency factors during a global collective trauma, particularly on parental psychological distress as a way of promoting whole-family wellness.","Lai, Jocelyn, Pham, Phoebe T.; Bate, Jordan, Prout, Tracy A.; Carollo, Alessandro, Setoh, Peipei, Esposito, Gianluca, Borelli, Jessica L.","https://doi.org/10.3390/socsci11040173","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Social Sciences; 11(4):173, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-16","",30170,""
"Examination of PTSD and Depression Levels and Demographic Data of Syrian Refugee Children during the Pandemic","Background: The worldwide population of child refugees is estimated to be over 10 million. Refugee children and adolescents are among the most vulnerable groups in the world, and the pandemic created new challenges for them. Objective: This study aimed to examine the PTSD and depression levels of Syrian refugee children and adolescents, the difficulties they experienced in access to food and education, and the changes in their family income, and evaluate the effects of these factors on symptom severities of depression and PTSD. Methods: We used data obtained from 631 Syrian refugee children between the ages of 7 and 15. Assessment measures for exposure to PTSD and depression included a socio-demographic form, stressors related to COVID-19, the Child and Adolescent Trauma Survey (CATS), and the patient-rated Children's Depression Inventory (CDI). ANCOVA is conducted to evaluate the differences between the symptoms of PTSD and depression. The regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between the scales and the demographic data. Results: The study finds that 40.7% of the refugee children experienced at least one trauma, 24.9% met the criteria for PTSD, and 15.5% met the criteria for depression. The changes in income and food access are associated with PTSD and depression, while access to education is not associated with PTSD and depression. The adolescents aged between 12 and 15 show more depression and PTSD symptoms then the children aged between 7 and 11. Conclusions: The study revealed that the most risky group in refugee children and adolescents in terms of PTSD and depression were the adolescents aged between 12 and 15 and the children and adolescent whose family income was decreased and had limited access to food.","Erol, Elif, SeÃ§inti, Dilara DemirpenÃ§e","https://doi.org/10.3390/psych4020018","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psych; 4(2):215-225, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-16","",30171,""
"Impact of a Prepharmacy Program on Students' Self-Awareness of Pharmacist Professional Identity: Comparison between Virtual and In-Person Settings","Ensuring an adequate preparation for undergraduate students transitioning to pharmacy school is challenging. A significant barrier is changing from a subordinate to a critical thinking mindset while self-identifying as a professional. Here, we aimed to (1) determine whether our prepharmacy program called 'Professional Identity and Me';(PRIME) could enhance learners' self-awareness of their professional identity and (2) compare the effectiveness of the in-person and online versions of PRIME. PRIME introduced prepharmacy students to aspects of pharmacists' professional identity including community, hospital, and interprofessional work, as well as mental health, wellness, and time and stress management skills, Top-200 drugs, prerequisite foundational sciences, and calculations. Concepts of professionalism, graduate writing, and ownership were also presented. Bridging exercises were introduced to exemplify application. We used a mixed-methods approach to assess the outcomes. The average performance in knowledge-based assessments increased before and after the PRIME program from 53.8 to 74.6% and from 47.7 to 75.9%, while the difference in the test scores was statistically significant, with a 21% increase (p &lt; 0.001, 95% CI 15&ndash;26%) and a 28% improvement (p &lt; 0.001, 95% CI 23&ndash;34%) for face-to-face versus virtual PRIME. The results of a student perception survey revealed PRIME was equally effective as a virtual program during the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting transferability to other pharmacy programs.","Malhotra, Ashim, Kreys, Eugene, Feng, Xiaodong","https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmacy10020044","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Pharmacy; 10(2):44, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-16","",30172,""
"Before the COVID-Vaccine-Vulnerable Elderly in Homecare","Background: At the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 virus was spreading all over the world. Frail elderly were at risk for illness and death. Isolation seemed to be the best solution. The aim of this paper was to describe how the lockdown affected elderly homecare patients. Methods: We used an international self-reported screening instrument built on well-documented risk factors adapted to COVID-19. We considered ethical, legal, and practical concerns. The research included telephone interviews with 30 homecare patients. Results: Seventy percent lived alone. Seventy-three percent of the sample suffered from major comorbidity. Cardiovascular disorder was the most frequent diagnosis. Nineteen (63.3%) needed help for personal care. Several of the participants were lonely and depressed. The homecare teams struggled to give proper care. The health authorities encouraged the population to reduce their outside physical activities to a minimum. The restrictions due to COVID-19 affected daily life and several respondents expressed uncertainties about the future. Conclusions: It is important to describe the patients' experiences in a homecare setting at the initiation of lockdowns due to COVID-19. The isolation protected them from the virus, but they struggled with loneliness and the lack of physical contact with their loved ones. In the future, we need to understand and address the unmet needs of elderly homecare patients in lockdown.","SÃ¸rbye, Liv Wergeland, Grue, Else Vengnes, Hogeveen, Sophie","https://doi.org/10.3390/nursrep12020027","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Nursing Reports; 12(2):270-280, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-16","",30173,""
"Gender Differences in the Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Health of Italian Academic Workers","The 2020 pandemic for coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infection has required strict measures for virus spreading reduction, including stay-at-home orders. To explore gender differences in mental health status after the first wave of the pandemic and in teleworking, we analyzed the frequency and distribution of emotions and coping strategies for facing the pandemic stratified by gender using data from an online survey conducted at the University of Salerno, Italy, between 11 May and 10 June 2020. The online questionnaire included 31 items on demographics, teleworking, COVID-19 emergency, and gender-based violence, with multiple-choice answers for some questions. Females felt significantly sadder (p = 0.0019), lonelier (p = 0.0058), more fearful (p = 0.0003), and more insecure (p = 0.0129) than males, experienced more sleep disorders (p = 0.0030), and were more likely to sanitize surfaces compared to males (p &lt; 0.0001).

In times of restricted social contact, online self-help programs offer a low-threshold first aid to cope with the psychological burden. This current study evaluates the online self-help protocol 'COVID Feel Good';in a German sample. The multicentric study was designed as a single cohort with a waiting list control condition. The convenience sample consisted of 38 German individuals who experienced at least two months of restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. The 7-day self-help protocol included the VR video 'Secret Garden';as well as a social or cognitive exercise each day. General distress, depression, anxiety, stress, and hopelessness were assessed as primary outcomes. Social connectedness and fear of coronavirus were measured as secondary outcomes. Results showed a significant decrease in all primary outcomes except for hopelessness. Furthermore, the results indicated a significant improvement in social connectedness.

"Adverse Mental Health Sequelae of COVID-19 Pandemic in the Pregnant Population and Useful Implications for Clinical Practice","The COVID-19 pandemic has increased risk of disturbances in the functioning of everyday life, directly or indirectly has influenced the risk of mental disorders in the most vulnerable populations, including pregnant women. The aim of this study was to analyze adverse mental health effects in the pregnant population during the COVID-19 pandemic, investigate risk factors for adverse mental health outcomes, identify protective factors, and create practical implications for clinical practice, bearing in mind the need to improve perinatal mental healthcare during such pandemics. Qualitative research was conducted in the electronic databases PubMed and Web of Sciences for the keywords COVID-19, pregnancy, depression, anxiety, and telemedicine for relevant critical articles (n = 3280) published from 2020 until October 2021, outlining the outcomes of control studies, meta-analysis, cross-sectional studies, face-to-face evaluation survey studies, remotely administered survey studies, and observational studies regarding the main topic;all were evaluated. Mental health problems among pregnant women linked to the COVID-19 pandemic, in most cases, show symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and PTSD and may cause adverse outcomes in pregnancy and fetus and newborn development, even at later stages of life. Therefore, useful implications for clinical practice for improving the adverse mental health outcomes of pregnant women associated with the COVID-19 pandemic are highly desirable. Our research findings support and advocate the need to modify the scope of healthcare provider practice in the event of a disaster, including the COVID-19 pandemic, and may be implemented and adopted by healthcare providers as useful implications for clinical practice.","Mazurkiewicz, Dariusz Wojciech, Strzelecka, Jolanta, Piechocka, Dorota Izabela","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm11082072","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Clinical Medicine; 11(8):2072, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-16","",30176,""
"The Impact of Maternal Prenatal Stress Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic during the First 1000 Days: A Historical Perspective","The COVID-19 pandemic has a major impact on society, particularly affecting its vulnerable members, including pregnant women and their unborn children. Pregnant mothers reported fear of infection, fear of vertical transmission, fear of poor birth and child outcomes, social isolation, uncertainty about their partner's presence during medical appointments and delivery, increased domestic abuse, and other collateral damage, including vaccine hesitancy. Accordingly, pregnant women's known vulnerability for mental health problems has become a concern during the COVID-19 pandemic, also because of the known effects of prenatal stress for the unborn child. The current narrative review provides a historical overview of transgenerational effects of exposure to disasters during pregnancy, and the role of maternal prenatal stress. We place these effects into the perspective of the COVID-19 pandemic. Hereby, we aim to draw attention to the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on women of reproductive age (15&ndash;49 year) and its potential associated short-term and long-term consequences for the health of children who are conceived, carried, and born during this pandemic.

We conducted semi-structured interviews with 21 first responders during the COVID-19 pandemic, asking about the impact of COVID-19. Data collected from our study interviews revealed that, despite large numbers of COVID-19 infections among the staff of police and fire departments, some-but not all-first responders were concerned about COVID-19. A similar divide existed within this group regarding whether or not to receive a COVID-19 vaccination. Many first responders reported frustration over COVID-19 information because of inconsistencies across sources, misinformation on social media, and the impact of politics. In addition, first responders described increased stress due to the COVID-19 pandemic caused by factors such as the fear of COVID exposure during emergency responses, concerns about infecting family members, and frustration surrounding new work policies.

"Anxiety, Motives, and Intention for Physical Activity during the Italian COVID-19 Lockdown: An Observational Longitudinal Study","Background: The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic led governments to adopt strict containment measures to avoid spreading the virus. These essential measures led to home confinement that influenced both the physical and mental health of populations. Physical activity plays a key role in preventing chronic diseases and promoting protective psychological factors. In the context of a lockdown, understanding the motives that guide people to enact physical activity is an important issue for public health. The present study aimed to evaluate the relation between autonomous motivation and physical activity, considering the role of behavioral intention and anxiety in a longitudinal moderated mediation model. Methods: Italian participants (N = 86;meanage = 29.74, standard deviation = 9.74;female = 53.5%) completed a booklet composed of different questionnaires (motivation, intention, anxiety, and physical activity) 3 weeks apart. Results: The hypothesized model is supported by the evidence;both autonomous motivation and intention are direct predictors of physical activity. The results also show that the direct effect of autonomous motivation on physical activity is stronger in participants with low anxiety, while high levels of anxiety are a significant moderator of the intention&ndash;behavior relation. Conclusions: In conclusion, a multidisciplinary approach should be promoting methods and infrastructures to permit people to adhere to physical activity, as a front line against any health emergency.","Galli, Federica, Giancamilli, Francesco, Palombi, Tommaso, Vitale, Jacopo Antonino, Borghi, Stefano, De Maria, Alessandra, Cavicchiolo, Elisa, Diotaiuti, Pierluigi, La Torre, Antonio, Zelli, Arnaldo, Lucidi, Fabio, Codella, Roberto, Chirico, Andrea","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19084689","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(8):4689, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-16","",30179,""
"Social Media Addiction during COVID-19-Mandated Physical Distancing: Relatedness Needs as Motives","In the early stages of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, national lockdowns and stay-at-home orders were implemented by many countries to curb the rate of infection. An extended stay-at-home period can frustrate people's need for relatedness, with many turning to social media to interact with others in the outside world. However, social media use may be maladaptive due to its associations with social media addiction and psychosocial problems. Our study was set at this special context to examine the associations among social media addiction, two aspects of relatedness needs (i.e., satisfaction and frustration), and two prominent psychosocial problems (i.e., depressive symptoms and loneliness). The participants were 1048 residents of the U.K. or U.S. (46% men, mean age = 44.10 years, SD = 12.59, age range: 18&ndash;65). The results indicated significant positive associations between relatedness need frustration and social media addiction as well as significant positive associations between social media addiction and the two types of psychosocial problems. More importantly, both of these significant associations were strong enough to partially explain the significant positive associations between relatedness need frustration and the two types of psychosocial problems.

"How Will Video Conference Fatigue Affect Participants of MICE in the With-COVID-19 Era? Focusing on Video Conference Quality, Social Presence Theory, and Flow","Is our mental health at risk due to spending a significant amount of time online due to the COVID-19 pandemic? In the new era that we are living in, where we live a life that coexists with the virus, we are participating in video conferences held online rather than on-site in order to slow the spread of the virus. Video conferencing has become our necessity since March 2020, and is becoming a new standard, especially in the MICE industry. Recently, however, people who have excessively used video conference platforms are complaining of video conference fatigue, which is a new negative emotion such as stress, anxiety, and worry as well as general work fatigue. Therefore, this study focused on the mechanism of video conferencing in MICE, which is rapidly digitally converted by the virus, and the digital psychological factors of the participants. This study derived the quality attributes of video conferencing in MICE and empirically analyzed the relationship with digital psychological factors of the video conference participants, such as video conference fatigue, social presence, and flow. One hundred and thirty-eight valid questionnaires collected from participants of several international academic conferences held in EXCO, Daegu, Korea, from 23 to 28 May 2021, were analyzed. The main results are as follows. First, unlike general video conference fatigue, MICE video conference fatigue was not found to be related to the preceding and following variables. This is due to the characteristics of the MICE video conference and the expertise of the participants. Second, social presence was identified as an important variable in MICE video conferencing. Although media-mediated, the feeling of being present with the presenter and participants was found to affect the participants' flow in the video conference. Third, in this study, the fun factor was identified as the most important video conference quality that can enhance the social presence of the video conference participants of MICEs.","Jang, Mi-Hwa, Choi, Eui-Yul","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19084601","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(8):4601, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-16","",30182,""
"Psychological Distress and COVID-19 Related Anxiety among Malaysian Women during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The combination of COVID-19 outbreaks and nationwide lockdown led to an increased prevalence of psychological distress among the population, especially women, as they have to cope with greater family and work demands. We aimed to identify the factors contributing to psychological distress among Malaysian women during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional study was conducted between October 2020 and April 2021, in a teaching hospital in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed among women, which consisted of (1) Participant's demographics, (2) COVID-19 knowledge and awareness, (3) Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21), and (4) COVID-19-related anxiety. Chi-square test and univariate analysis were performed to determine the significant factors associated with psychological distress. The mean scores for knowledge, COVID-19 anxiety, and DASS-21 subcomponents were compared using the Mann&ndash;Whitney U test. A total of three hundred and thirty-eight women completed the survey. The majority of respondents demonstrated adequate knowledge (95.6%) on COVID-19. The proportion of our women who reported symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress were 17.2%, 25.1%, and 0.9%, respectively, resulting in a prevalence of psychological distress of 27.8%. Low education level (p = 0.017), unemployment (p = 0.028), loss of income (p = 0.033), and hospital admission for surgical procedures (p = 0.021) were significantly associated with a higher psychological burden. A greater level of COVID-19 anxiety was found among Malays (p = 0.027), pregnant women (p = 0.013), and those who suffered a loss of income (p = 0.038) during this pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic had a negative effect on women's psychological wellbeing, especially those from the lower socio-economic background. Therefore, adequate information, as well as support, must be provided to the vulnerable groups during the ongoing pandemic, to lessen their psychological burden.","Abdul Latif, Nurul Ilani, Mohamed Ismail, Nor Azlin, Loh, Sweet Yi Esther, Nur Azurah, Abdul Ghani, Midin, Marhani, Shah, Shamsul Azhar, Kalok, Aida","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19084590","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(8):4590, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-16","",30183,""
"Mental Health and Access to Information in Times of COVID-19: The Role of Social Work","The confinements and limited social interactions that have derived from COVID-19 have aggravated the situation of people with previous pathologies. As a result, access to health and its rehabilitation or support resources has been limited and redirected toward online care. People with mental health problems have considerably suffered during the pandemic because, for many of them, accessing different information resources through telematic means proved to be a great difficulty in their everyday lives. This exploratory research work aims to establish which elements have successfully facilitated access to online information for people with mental health problems. This is especially urgent in times of COVID-19 when misinformation has significantly harmed this group. To do so, we followed the communicative methodology and held interviews with two professionals and nine users who participated in the case study. The main results show that, in developing digital communicative competencies in accessing information with this group, individualization of care to overcome barriers, the link with social workers as references of truthful information, and the importance of emotional work and interactions are critical elements.","Romea, Ana C.; Valero, Diana, Elboj, Carmen, Melgar, Patricia","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19084483","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(8):4483, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-16","",30184,""

HCWs (n = 202) completed a survey containing the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), Perceived Vulnerability to Disease (PVD), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). FCV-19S and sleep quality were significant predictors for psychological distress. Female gender was a significant predictor for depression and stress. Single, divorced, and widowed marital status were predictive for anxiety. FCV-19S was weakly correlated with PVD but moderately with depression, anxiety, and stress. Of the two PVD subscales, perceived infectability was weakly correlated with psychological distress. PVD and previous experience with COVID-19 were not significant predictors. Sleep quality and FCV-19S were major predictors of psychological distress. Findings indicated that poor sleep quality was strongly associated with psychological distress, while fear of COVID-19 had a moderate association. Such results support the need to design and implement psychological programs to assist HCWs in dealing with the psychological impact of this ongoing pandemic.","Alyami, Hussain, KrÃ¤geloh, Christian U.; Medvedev, Oleg N.; Alghamdi, Saleh, Alyami, Mubarak, Althagafi, Jamal, Lyndon, Mataroria, Hill, Andrew G.","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19084459","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(8):4459, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-16","",30185,""
"How Did the COVID-19 Pandemic Affect the Use of Emergency Medical Services by Patients Experiencing Mental Health Crises?","The COVID-19 pandemic and its resulting social restrictions have significant implications for mental health. The objective of this study was to determine the monthly trends and types of patients experiencing a mental health crisis (MHC) who used emergency medical services (EMSs) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. A retrospective observational study was conducted using EMS data. During the study period, 8577 patients used EMSs for MHCs. EMS dispatches for MHCs and suicide completion after the COVID-19 pandemic were decreased by 12.4% and 12.7%, respectively, compared to those before the COVID-19 pandemic. Segmented regression analysis found that the number of patients per month was 6.79 before the COVID-19 pandemic. The number decreased to 4.52 patients per month during the COVID-19 pandemic, although the decrease was not statistically significant. The monthly number of patients experiencing an MHC decreased during strict social distancing measures but increased during relaxed social distancing measures. The percentage of hanging increased from 14.20% before the COVID-19 pandemic to 14.30% (p = 0.03) during the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas the percentages of jumping (from 15.55% to 15.28%, p = 0.01) and self-harm by smoke (from 4.59% to 3.84%, p &lt; 0.001) during the COVID-19 pandemic were decreased compared to those before COVID-19. However, the effect size for the above findings was small (below 0.20). More than 25% of the patients experiencing an MHC who used EMSs refused to transfer to the ED over both study periods (26.49% in the pre-COVID-19 period and 28.53% in the COVID-19 period). The COVID-19 pandemic and social restrictions seemed to have some effects on the use of EMSs by MHC patients. Hanging is mainly performed indoors and is not found easily if social distancing persists, and a patient experiencing an MHC who refuses to be transferred could potentially attempt suicide. Subsequent studies should be performed to determine whether these findings are temporary during the COVID-19 pandemic or whether they will show different aspects after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Park, Song-Yi, Kim, Sun-Hyu","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10040716","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Healthcare; 10(4):716, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-16","",30186,""
"Transform Suffering by Cultivating Resilience: Embedding SDGs into Intergenerational Digital Health Platform for Navigating the Post-Pandemic Landscape","The world is being upended by the COVID-19 pandemic which has posed considerable challenges-deaths, fears, unemployment, social distancing, isolation, and lockdowns. Behind the apparent negative impact of an economic downturn, the pandemic has also caused soaring levels of stress and mental health crises, especially in the elderly. Although existing digital health products, services, and platforms are making use of innovative technologies, these alone cannot ensure success, and the scaling up of application of innovative technology for social good requires overcoming numerous bottlenecks. Therefore, it is imperative to identify the integrated needs of stakeholders within the healthcare system and synthesize a holistic approach for sustainable development.","Cheng, Lan","https://doi.org/10.3390/environsciproc2022015012","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Environmental Sciences Proceedings; 15(1):12, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-16","",30187,""
"Predicting the Severity of Lockdown-Induced Psychiatric Symptoms with Machine Learning","During the COVID-19 pandemic, an increase in the incidence of psychiatric disorders in the general population and an increase in the severity of symptoms in psychiatric patients have been reported. Anxiety and depression symptoms are the most commonly observed during large-scale dramatic events such as pandemics and wars, especially when these implicate an extended lockdown. The early detection of higher risk clinical and non-clinical individuals would help prevent the new onset and/or deterioration of these symptoms. This in turn would lead to the implementation of public policies aimed at protecting vulnerable populations during these dramatic contingencies, therefore optimising the effectiveness of interventions and saving the resources of national healthcare systems. We used a supervised machine learning method to identify the predictors of the severity of psychiatric symptoms during the Italian lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Via a case study, we applied this methodology to a small sample of healthy individuals, obsessive-compulsive disorder patients, and adjustment disorder patients. Our preliminary results show that our models were able to predict depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms during the lockdown with up to 92% accuracy based on demographic and clinical characteristics collected before the pandemic. The presented methodology may be used to predict the psychiatric prognosis of individuals under a large-scale lockdown and thus supporting the related clinical decisions.","Dâ€™Urso, Giordano, Magliacano, Alfonso, Rotbei, Sayna, Iasevoli, Felice, de Bartolomeis, Andrea, Botta, Alessio","https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics12040957","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Diagnostics; 12(4):957, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-16","",30188,""
"Long COVID-19 in Children: From the Pathogenesis to the Biologically Plausible Roots of the Syndrome","Long Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) refers to the persistence of symptoms related to the infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). This condition is described as persistent and can manifest in various combinations of signs and symptoms, such as fatigue, headache, dyspnea, depression, cognitive impairment, and altered perception of smells and tastes. Long COVID-19 may be due to long-term damage to different organs-such as lung, brain, kidney, and heart-caused by persisting viral-induced inflammation, immune dysregulation, autoimmunity, diffuse endothelial damage, and micro thrombosis. In this review, we discuss the potential and biologically plausible role of some vitamins, essential elements, and functional foods based on the hypothesis that an individual's dietary status may play an important adjunctive role in protective immunity against COVID-19 and possibly against its long-term consequences.","Piazza, Michele, Di Cicco, Maria, Pecoraro, Luca, Ghezzi, Michele, Peroni, Diego, Comberiati, Pasquale","https://doi.org/10.3390/biom12040556","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Biomolecules; 12(4):556, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-16","",30189,""
"Emissions of Carbonaceous Particulate Matter and Ultrafine Particles from Vehiclesâ€”A Scientific Review in a Cross-Cutting Context of Air Pollution and Climate Change","Featured ApplicationKey conclusions and recommendations are proposed to enlighten decision makers in view of the next regulations on vehicle emissions in Europe and worldwide through the synergistic contexts of air quality and climate change.Airborne particulate matter (PM) is a pollutant of concern not only because of its adverse effects on human health but also on visibility and the radiative budget of the atmosphere. PM can be considered as a sum of solid/liquid species covering a wide range of particle sizes with diverse chemical composition. Organic aerosols may be emitted (primary organic aerosols, POA), or formed in the atmosphere following reaction of volatile organic compounds (secondary organic aerosols, SOA), but some of these compounds may partition between the gas and aerosol phases depending upon ambient conditions. This review focuses on carbonaceous PM and gaseous precursors emitted by road traffic, including ultrafine particles (UFP) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that are clearly linked to the evolution and formation of carbonaceous species. Clearly, the solid fraction of PM has been reduced during the last two decades, with the implementation of after-treatment systems abating approximately 99% of primary solid particle mass concentrations. However, the role of brown carbon and its radiative effect on climate and the generation of ultrafine particles by nucleation of organic vapour during the dilution of the exhaust remain unclear phenomena and will need further investigation. The increasing role of gasoline vehicles on carbonaceous particle emissions and formation is also highlighted, particularly through the chemical and thermodynamic evolution of organic gases and their propensity to produce particles. The remaining carbon-containing particles from brakes, tyres and road wear will still be a problem even in a future of full electrification of the vehicle fleet. Some key conclusions and recommendations are also proposed to support the decision makers in view of the next regulations on vehicle emissions worldwide.","Bessagnet, Bertrand, Allemand, Nadine, Jean-Philippe, Putaud, Couvidat, Florian, Jean-Marc, AndrÃ©, Simpson, David, Pisoni, Enrico, Murphy, Benjamin N.; Thunis, Philippe","https://doi.org/10.3390/app12073623","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Applied Sciences; 12(7):3623, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-16","",30190,""
"Narrative Exposure Therapy: A Case for Use With Refugees via Telehealth With the use of an Interpreter","Rates of PTSD and depression are as high as or higher among samples of refugees than in the general population. There have been few randomized controlled trials of trauma-focused therapies conducted with refugees. Additionally, there has been little research on the use of interpreters in psychotherapy with refugees, but across the studies included in a meta-analysis, a nonsignificant difference between studies that used an interpreter and those that did not was found. Due to COVID-19, mental health providers have had to adapt to the crisis by utilizing telemental health. Research on telemental health with refugee clients is limited, despite a recognition in the literature that telemental health can address some mental healthcare disparities. We review the case of a 26-year-old Afghani/Iranian bilingual diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) who presented with intrusive thoughts, panic attacks, nightmares, and flashbacks. Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET) was used with an interpreter via telehealth because it is effective in reducing symptoms of trauma in refugee populations. Treatment success for this case was reflected in the client?s self-reported reduction in symptoms. From this case study, we can conclude that (a) NET is a short-term, cost-effective means for providing trauma-focused care for refugees/asylum-seekers;(b) NET diminishes trauma symptoms with the use of an interpreter via telehealth;(c) a good relationship between therapist, interpreter, and client aids in the effectiveness of NET;and (d) clinician flexibility in the delivery of telemental health and interventions being utilized with refugee/asylum-seeker populations is imperative.","Olavarrieta, Gabriela A.; Benuto, Lorraine","https://doi.org/10.1177/15346501221077703","","Database: Sage; Publication type: article; Publication details: Clinical Case Studies;: 15346501221077703, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-16","",30191,""
"Emerging adultsâ€™ cultural values, prosocial behaviors, and mental health in 14 countries during the COVID-19 pandemic","Evidence suggests an impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health, particularly among emerging adults. However, theories on altruism born of suffering or adversarial growth suggest that we might also see prosocial behavior as a function of the pandemic, which may protect against mental health challenges. Because cultural values are central in determining prosocial behavior, the current study explored how cultural values were differentially associated with adaptive prosocial behaviors that might protect against mental health challenges. Participants for the current study included 5,682 young people aged 18?25 years from 14 different countries around the world (68% female, 62% college students). Path analyses suggested that there were few differences in patterns as a function of culture, but revealed that horizontal individualism and horizontal and vertical collectivism were indirectly associated with lower levels of depression via prosocial behavior toward family members. Discussion focuses on the importance of coping by strengthening family relationships via prosocial behavior during the pandemic.","Padilla-Walker, Laura M.; Van der Graaff, Jolien, Workman, Katey, Carlo, Gustavo, Branje, Susan, Carrizales, Alexia, Gerbino, Maria, GÃ¼lseven, Zehra, Hawk, Skyler T.; Luengo Kanacri, Paula, Mesurado, BelÃ©n, Samper-GarcÃ­a, Paula, Shen, Yuh-Ling, Taylor, Laura K.; Trach, Jessica, van Zalk, Maarten H.

In this article we show that a capitalist ethics is capable to deal with the challenges of pandemics and comes with important advantages such as the prevention of overreactions. We apply both utilitarian and rights-based ethics to the case of epidemics in general and COVID-19 in particular. First a libertarian natural law ethics is used to assess the government interventions in the Corona pandemic. We maintain that these interventions cannot be justified from a libertarian point of view despite of the possible objections that are discussed such as the ?potential threat argument?. Moreover, the utilitarian argument in favor of government lockdowns is evaluated. The negative effects of lockdown on mental health, addictions, domestic violence, etc. have to be taken into account. The utilitarian argument in favor of lockdown is far from convincing, as economic calculation is not possible.","Bagus, Philipp, PeÃ±a-Ramos, JosÃ© Antonio, SÃ¡nchez-BayÃ³n, Antonio","https://doi.org/10.1111/beer.12431","","Database: Wiley; Publication type: article; Publication details: Business Ethics, the Environment & Responsibility; n/a(n/a), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-16","",30193,""

"People Who Need People (and Some Who Think They Don't): On Compensatory Personal and Social Means of Goal Pursuit","We propose a new theoretical model depicting the compensatory relations between personal agency and social assistance. It suggests two general hypotheses, namely that (1) the stronger the individualsâ€™ sense of personal agency, the weaker their motivation to utilize social assistance and the greater their consequent tendency to develop anti-social attitudes. Conversely, (2) the stronger the individualsâ€™ reliance on social assistance, the weaker their motivation to be agentic, and the lesser their tendency to develop a strong sense of self. These relations are assumed to apply across levels of generality, that is, concerning agency and assistance within a single goal domain, as well as across domains where the source of agency (e.g., money, power) or assistance facilitates the attainment of multiple goals.At the time of this writing, the world finds itself in the grip of an unprecedented calamity: the COVID 19 pandemic, the worst such outbreak in living memory. Starting at the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019, the virus spread quickly across the planet. Over 37 million persons, globally, have been infected so far and the worst may be yet to come. Over 7.6 million Americans were infected, and over 214,000 died as a consequence. Millions are expected to succumb to the plague, the world economy is taking a historic hit. People are losing jobs, some to be never recovered. Factories and small business are shuttered, many to never reopen. Health systems of the worldâ€™s nations are stretched to their limits, social services and functions (transportation, education, entertainment, leisure) are near paralysis. Millions are cooped up in their homes: lonely and disoriented, the structures of their daily routines in shambles. Nobody is exempt. All are vulnerable.These somber circumstances induce a sense of fragility and helplessness in millions of individuals. Their sense of personal agency is severely threatened, their need for assistance and support is much magnified. And a fundamental question to psychological science is what impact this has on peopleâ€™s social relations, their attachment to others, their interpersonal orientations, and their attitudes. In the present article, we address such questions by reviewing an extensive body of relevant empirical findings in the social psychological literature and proposing an integrative model that offers new perspectives on the phenomena at stake.","Milyavsky, Maxim, Kruglanski, Arie W.; Gelfand, Michele, Chernikova, Marina, Ellenberg, Molly, Pierro, Antonio","https://doi.org/10.1080/1047840X.2022.2037986","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychological Inquiry; 33(1):1-22, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-16","",30197,""

Data were collected during Belgiumâ€™s first and strictest lockdown. The results largely confirmed the applicability of the PWM in a public health context. Posting of and exposure to anti-governmental social media messages positively related to violations of the regulations via higher descriptive norm perceptions of peers violating the measures and positive attitudes towards violations. Pro-governmental media interactions (i.e., exposure to news media and pro-governmental social media messages) negatively related to violations via negative attitudes towards violations. No support emerged for the role of (televised) series, prototype favorability, or subjective norms in the PWM. Differences in posting versus exposure of social media messages were found. Posting generally related stronger to risk cognitions and behaviors compared to exposure. Gender and age moderated some of the examined relations in the PWM.

"Influence of physical activity on well-being at times of the COVID-19 pandemic: a review","Summary Background Physical activity (PA) has been shown to be advantageous to one's health. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown measures have reportedly led to substantial decrease of PA and to drastic reduction of well-being (WB). In light of this, the purpose of this review was to assess the impact of PA on WB during the COVID-19 pandemic. Material and Methods In May 2021, Literature search was conducted in Pubmed/Medline. The eligible publication period was one year from the search date. Results Synthesis of results from eight publications reporting on data from around 100 countries showed that PA positively influences diverse dimensions of the multivariate construct of WB, all of them relating to mental health. Young adults and women showed lowest PA concomitant with lowest self-reported WB. Conclusions Reduced PA levels resulted in lower WB levels, which might have a negative impact on mental health. Forthcoming, initiatives will be needed to facilitate PA â€“ ideally whilst promoting joy of moving â€“ in consideration of pandemic circumstances. By this means it will be possible to effectively promote WB and to prevent arising mental health issues. The current findings are fundamental to develop suitable approaches to improve PA in pandemic situations. Zusammenfassung Hintergrund KÃ¶rperliche AktivitÃ¤t (PA) hat sich als gesundheitsfÃ¶rdernd erwiesen. Die EindÃ¤mmungsmaÃŸnahmen der Coronavirus-Krankheit-2019 (COVID-19) fÃ¼hrten zu einem RÃ¼ckgang der PA und zu einer Verringerung des Wohlbefindens (WB). Das Ziel dieser Arbeit war, Auswirkungen von PA auf WB wÃ¤hrend der COVID-19-Pandemie zu evaluieren. Material und Methoden Eine Literatursuche in Pubmed/Medline wurde im Mai 2021 durchgefÃ¼hrt. Der eingeschlossene Publikationsszeitraum betrug ein Jahr ab Recherchedatum. Ergebnisse Die Synthese der Ergebnisse aus acht Publikationen, die Ã¼ber Daten aus rund 100 LÃ¤ndern berichteten, zeigte, dass PA verschiedene Dimensionen des multivariaten Konstrukts von WB positiv beeinflusst;alle mit Bezug zur psychischen Gesundheit. Junge Erwachsene und Frauen zeigten die niedrigste PA, die mit dem niedrigsten selbstberichteten WB einherging. Schlussfolgerungen Reduzierte PA fÃ¼hrte zu niedrigerem WB, was sich generell negativ auf die psychische Gesundheit auswirken kÃ¶nnte. In der Zukunft werden Initiativen benÃ¶tigt, um PA â€“ idealerweise mit gleichzeitiger FÃ¶rderung der Bewegungsfreude â€“ unter BerÃ¼cksichtigung der pandemie-bedingten UmstÃ¤nde zu erleichtern. Nur auf diese Weise wird es mÃ¶glich sein, WB effektiv zu fÃ¶rdern und aufkom Menden psychischen Problemen vorzubeugen. Die aktuellen Erkenntnisse sind grundlegend, um geeignete AnsÃ¤tze zur Verbesserung der PA in Pandemiesituationen zu entwickeln.","Symanzik, Cara, Hagel, Clara, Hotfiel, Thilo, Engelhardt, Martin, John, Swen Malte, Grim, Casper","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.orthtr.2022.03.012","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sports Orthopaedics and Traumatology;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-16","",30200,""
"Psychological distress among outpatient physicians in private practice linked to COVID-19 and related mental health during the second lockdown","Background Outpatient physicians in private practice, as inpatient physicians, are on the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic. Mental-health consequences of the pandemic on hospital staff have been published, but the psychological distress among outpatient physicians in private practice due to COVID-19 has never been specifically assessed. Methods A French national online cross-sectional survey assessed declared psychological distress among outpatient physicians in private practice linked to COVID-19, sociodemographic and work conditions, mental health (Copenhagen Burn-out Inventory, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the Insomnia severity Index), consequences on alcohol, tobacco, and illegal substance misuse, and sick leave during the 2nd COVID-19 wave. Findings Among the 1,992 physicians who answered the survey, 1,529 (76.8%) declared psychological distress linked to COVID-19. Outpatient physicians who declared psychological distress linked to COVID-19 had higher rates of insomnia (ORÂ =Â 1.4;CI95 [1.1â€“1.7], pÂ =Â 0.003), burnout (ORÂ =Â 2.7;CI95 [2.1;3.2], pÂ &lt;Â 0.001), anxiety and depressive symptoms (ORÂ =Â 2.4;CI95 [1.9â€“3.0], pÂ &lt;Â 0.001 and ORÂ =Â 1.7;CI95 [1.3â€“2.3], pÂ &lt;Â 0.001) as compared to physicians who did not. They also had higher psychotropic drug use in the last twelve months, or increased alcohol or tobacco consumption due to work-related stress and were more frequently general practitioners. Interpretation The feeling of being in psychological distress due to COVID-19 is highly frequent among outpatient physicians in private practice and is associated with mental health impairment. There is a need to assess specific interventions dedicated to outpatient physicians working in private practice.","Frajerman, Ariel, Colle, Romain, Hozer, Franz, Deflesselle, Eric, Rotenberg, Samuel, Chappell, Kenneth, Corruble, Emmanuelle, Costemale-Lacoste, Jean-FranÃ§ois","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2022.04.003","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Psychiatric Research;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-16","",30201,""

"Navigating Mental Health Struggles and Illness as a Palliative Care Clinician (TH112)","Outcomes 1. Describe the challenges faced by HPM clinicians navigating mental illness 2. Identify effective strategies for navigating mental illness as an HPM clinician and for supporting colleagues facing mental health challenges 3. Reflect on the opportunities afforded by the experience of mental illness to influence one's practice as a clinician, educator, and colleague Although burnout, wellness, and resilience are well-described topics in the HPM community, mental illness and its impact are underrecognized and remain stigmatized. This forum brings together palliative care physicians who have faced mental illness and reflected carefully on how the experience has affected their practice. During the session, clinicians will share their personal and professional experiences, highlighting challenges, helpful strategies, and opportunities for a pathway forward. There is growing societal awareness of the mental health crisis among healthcare workers, catalyzed in part by the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the stigma and poor access to care faced by most people with mental illness, healthcare workers face concerns about transparency in the workplace, job security, and licensing as they seek evaluation and treatment. Palliative care practice is challenging even in times of emotional stability and presents unique work-related mental health threats and opportunities. Clinicians support patients and families struggling with crises and difficult emotions, often at the intersection of life and death. This close proximity to death heightens the awareness of the shared vicissitudes of life, serving as both an opportunity for transformation and a professional hazard. As mental illness is a biopsychosocial process, treatment often requires a multidimensional approach. Individuals, teams, extended support networks, and the field of palliative care can employ physical, emotional, practical, spiritual, and social approaches to management and healing. Additionally, despite the many challenges, positive reflections and unexpected opportunities may arise as clinicians navigate mental health concerns. Vulnerability can foster strength in our shared experiences and empathy in our work. Ultimately, these experiences may help us grow in our roles as clinicians and educators. This session aims to build community, model how clinicians can navigate care, and expand the dialogue about mental illness among palliative care professionals.","Collins, Molly, Thomas, Jane deLima, Lawton, Andrew, Scott, Erin, Stevens, Erin","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2022.02.204","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Pain and Symptom Management; 63(5):784, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-16","",30203,""
"Feasibility, Acceptability and Qualitative Analysis of a Narrative Writing Intervention with Parents of Children in Pediatric Critical Care (S557)","Outcomes 1. Differentiate the content in diary and narrative 2. Locate study within the NIH ORBIT model of behavioral trial development 3. Name at least 3 writing prompts for people who may not know how to begin writing a narrative while their child is in a pediatric ICU Original Research Background Parents of children in a pediatric ICU (PICU) have reported mental health symptoms 6 months after discharge. Writing is associated with positive health outcomes;however, studies with adult diaries focus on factual events, and pediatric data are limited. Research Objectives Quantify acceptability and feasibility of a narrative intervention and qualitatively examine written texts. Methods Prospective, proof-of-concept, 3-arm trial with legal guardians of children in the PICU of a 365-bed quaternary pediatric referral hospital. Randomly allocated participants received a blank composition book with encouragement to write (Arm 1), writing prompts (Arm 2), or at least one session (Arm 3) with narrative medicine coordinator (NMC). Feasibility was calculated as the ratio of books returned to distributed, number of books used, and ratio of completed to scheduled NMC meetings. Acceptability was measured with the Treatment Acceptability Questionnaire and the ratio of enrolled to approached persons. Descriptive statistics were calculated;between-group comparisons were made via Kruskal-Wallis tests. Thematic analysis identified emergent themes from independently coded texts. Results NÂ =Â 20 participants enrolled in 6 months. Acceptability was high (49% enrollment;mean [SD] acceptability scores MÂ =Â 24.8 [2.4]). Feasibility was good: 100% completed-to-scheduled Arm 3 sessions and 40% book return. There were significant between-group differences in journal use (chi-squareÂ =Â 8.7, dfÂ =Â 2, pÂ =Â 0.013) (Arm 1, 25%;Arm 2, 80%;Arm 3, 100%). Texts revealed emotions (primarily â€œterrified,â€ â€œangry,â€ and â€œsadâ€) yet notably expressed more cognitive processes (wishing and advice giving). Conclusion The intervention was feasible and acceptable. Participants allocated to arms without the NMC appeared to produce texts with more disorganized thinking as well as lists and texts unrelated to the hospital or child's experience. Limitations include single-site, predominantly White female participants, and COVID-19 recruitment limitations. Implications for Research, Policy, or Practice Findings warrant proceeding to a controlled pilot trial. Parents appreciated and may benefit from guided narrative opportunities while their child is in a PICU.","Grossoehme, Daniel, Robinson, Nicole, Aultman, Julie, Friebert, Sarah","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2022.02.180","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Pain and Symptom Management; 63(5):937-938, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-16","",30204,""
"Decreased Resiliency Associated with Increased Hospitalizations for Children with Sickle Cell Disease (S535)","Outcomes 1. Identify how resiliency contributes to chronic illnesses such as SCD 2. Discuss technique for assessing child resiliency (ie, parental assessment) 3. Identify potential for interventions to improve resiliency and associated markers of disease management Original Research Background Families with a child with sickle cell disease (SCD) have unique stressors and challenges. A key adaptive response to these is resiliency. Previous studies have focused on parental resiliency and psychosocial factors that affect the child's health. None have measured the resiliency of children with SCD or its relationship with their parent's resiliency or SCD complications. Research Objectives Thegoal of this study was to examine the relationship between child's and parent's resiliency and perceived stress. Our primary outcome was the association between resiliency scores and SCD specific stressors including acute access to healthcare and previous stroke or stem cell transplant. The impact of the COVID pandemic and sources of stress were surveyed. Methods Connor-Davidson Resiliency Scale (CD-RISC), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), PROMIS 8a Depression Scale, and PROMIS 8a Anxiety Scale data were collected from children &gt;12 years old with SCD and their parents (nÂ =Â 55). Parents scored their child with a modified CD-RISC. Frequency of hospitalization, acute clinic visits, and emergency room visits over previous year and history of stroke and stem cell transplant were ed from medical record. Sources of stress and SCD management during pandemic versus before were assessed with Likert scale. Results Parentassessment of their child's resiliency was accurate (p &lt; 0.0001). Increased hospitalization was associated with lower child CD-RISC score (pÂ =Â 0.0386). No relationship between child and parent CD-RISC or PSS-10 scores was observed. Both reported no difference in SCD management during the COVID pandemic. However, â€œconcern about getting sick from COVIDâ€ and â€œconcern about SCDâ€ were the most common stressors. Conclusion SCD resiliency may affect how often children need hospitalization. The COVID pandemic did not affect parent and child assessment of SCD management, despite being a common stressor. Implications for Research, Policy, or Practice Interventions to improve resiliency of children with SCD may help reduce the frequency of hospitalizations.","Zavadil, Jessica, Carpenter, Brian, Calhoun, Cecelia","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2022.02.158","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Pain and Symptom Management; 63(5):924-925, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-16","",30205,""
"We Are Not Heroes;Elevating the Discourse of Burnout in Hospice and Palliative Care Nurses (HPCNs) in the Pre/Post COVID Era: A Scoping Review (S504)","Outcomes 1. Describe results from a scoping review related to personal factors, organizational and workplace factors, and nursing professional development factors related to hospice and palliative care nurses 2. Recognize characteristics of hospice and palliative care nurses (HPCNs) that are associated with burnout and strategies to mitigate burnout Background and Objective Burnout among HPCNs has been rising throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and threatens patient safety and quality of care. The extant literature provides insight into burnout within the interdisciplinary hospice and palliative care team, but little attention has been given among HPCNs specifically. We conducted a scoping review to examine burnout among HPCNs and unify disparate findings. Study Identification Using the Arksey and O'Malley framework, we systematically searched 8 major databases from 2015 to 2020. Studies were included if they focused on HPCN experiences of burnout, were published in English within the last 5 years with the exception of seminal works, and were discoverable in electronic databases. Exclusion factors included articles that were not focused solely on hospice and palliative nursing, specifically focused on burnout (ie, depression, compassion fatigue, workplace environment), or research articles. Data Extraction and Synthesis Two authors extracted data from the full-text inclusion studies. Results were presented in tabular summary and descriptive summary of quantitative findings. Results Among 1,893 studies, 8 met inclusion criteria. All studies were quantitative, classified as level IV within the rating system for hierarchy of evidence for literature, and spanned across 6 countries. HPCNs working across settings such as inpatient, outpatient, community, and inpatient hospice were represented. Results of studies were coalesced into 3 overarching categories: personal factors, organizational or workplace factors, and nursing professional development factors. Each of these categories was then divided into three cross-cutting subcategories: contributory and noncontributory factors, mitigating factors, and workplace issues. Conclusions and Implications for Practice, Policy, and Research Burnout among HPCNs may not be entirely preventable, but the recognition of contributory and mitigating factors should be taken into consideration by professional nurses and organizations. Additional research is needed to test workplace interventions suggested in the literature, including whether resilience or self-care measures affect burnout in HPCNs. Qualitative research is needed to capture HPCN experiences of burnout, especially in a post-COVID-19 era.","Frechman, Erica, Wright, Patricia","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2022.02.127","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Pain and Symptom Management; 63(5):907, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-16","",30206,""

"Mental health among the Moroccan population during SARS-CoV-2 outbreak: MAROCOVID study","Background The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic's unpredictability and ambiguity, combined with the lockdown, social distancing, containment measures, and economic impact could increase the risk of mental health issues. Objective To assess the magnitude of mental health outcomes and risk factors among Moroccans, using an online survey, during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Methods This cross-sectional, survey-based study collected demographic data and mental health measurements from 11,123 participants. The degree of depression, anxiety, and insomnia symptoms were assessed by the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, the 7-items Generalized Anxiety disorder, and the 7-items Insomnia Severity Index. Results The survey was completed by 11,123 individuals out of a total of 15,008 contacts. 7315 (65.8%) were women, and 7182 (64.6%) were aged 18 to 34. A significant proportion of respondents experienced depression (5894 [53%]), anxiety (5544 [49.8%]), and insomnia (4410 [39.6%]). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that being a woman, being married, and being a parent of children aged less than five years were associated with severe symptoms of depression and anxiety (e.g. severe depression among women vs. men (OR, 1.19;95%CI, 1.06â€“1.33;PÂ =Â .003), severe depression among married compared to unmarried respondents (OR, 1.92;95%CI, 1.71â€“2.16;PÂ &lt;Â .000), e.g. severe anxiety among women vs. men (OR, 1.40;95%CI, 1.24â€“1.58;&lt;0.000), severe anxiety among married people compared to unmarried (OR, 1.14;95%CI, 1.00â€“1.28;PÂ &lt;Â .003).

"Social support coping styles and psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic: The moderating role of sex","Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic led to the onset and exacerbation of mental health problems, such as stress, anxiety, and depression;yet stay-at-home-orders affected individuals' ability to make use of social support as a coping skill in managing distress. We aimed to evaluate how social support (emotional and instrumental) and biological sex were associated with stress, anxiety, and depression early in the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Participants (nÂ =Â 7256) had an average age of 50.13Â years (SDÂ =Â 16.75) and 51.6% were male. Using a cross-sequential design, seven cohorts of individuals completed baseline (T1) and one-month follow-up (T2) questionnaires online from March to July of 2020. We used a series of hierarchical regressions to identify types of social support (Brief-COPE, T1) associated with stress (Perceived Stress Scale-10, T1 and T2), anxiety and depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-4, T2). Results Greater emotional support was associated with less perceived stress, and anxiety and depression (all psÂ &lt;Â 0.001), whereas greater instrumental support predicted increased distress (all psÂ &lt;Â 0.036) on all four outcomes. Moderation analyses revealed that greater emotional social support was associated with lower perceived stress at T1 for both women and men. For women, emotional social support predicted lower anxiety, whereas instrumental social support predicted increased anxiety. Limitations Self-selection may have introduced bias and participant self-report on brief measures may not have fully captured coping and distress. Conclusions Interventions enhancing emotional social support strategies, which appear especially important for women, might help manage enduring stressors such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","McLean, Caitlin L.; Chu, Gage M.; Karnaze, Melissa M.; Bloss, Cinnamon S.; Lang, Ariel J.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.04.036","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Affective Disorders;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-16","",30209,""
"Worsening Mental Health in Adolescent Heart Failure and Transplant Patients During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Center for Disease Control data shows a significant increase in percentage of adults with symptoms of anxiety or depressive disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic. Adolescent heart failure (HF) and heart transplant (HT) recipients report higher prevalence of mood symptoms compared to general adolescent population. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health outcomes in Adolescent HF and HT recipients remains unknown. Electronic Mental Health Screens, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), were administered at quarterly intervals to patients aged 11 years and older presenting for ambulatory HF and HT care at our center. Screening results from August 2020- February 2021 (COVID Screen) were compared to results from August 2019- March 2020 (Pre-COVID Screen). When multiple Pre-COVID screens were available, the one closest to pandemic start date (April 2020) was used and in case of multiple COVID screens, the one completed during the peak of COVID wave (November-January 2021) was used. Demographic data for 37 patients with paired screens is summarized in Table 1. There was a significant increase in mean GAD-7 score, 2.51 (Â±2.98) Pre-COVID to 3.76 (Â±4.99) during COVID (p=0.04) and no significant change in mean PHQ-9 score, 2.73 (Â±3.71) Pre-COVID to 4.05 (Â±4.83) during COVID (p=0.06). Although there was no significant difference in Pre-COVID screen scores by age or race, the COVID Screen scores were significantly higher for younger adolescents and Black patients for both PHQ-9 and GAD-7 (Table 1). Nine patients (24.3%) were receiving treatment for mood disorders pre-COVID and 11 (29.7%) during COVID (p=0.50). Adolescents with HF and HT reported worsening anxiety symptoms during COVID similar to the worsening mental health trends for young adults noted nationwide. Younger and Black adolescents with HF or HT reported worse anxiety and depression symptoms during the pandemic compared to other demographics.

"Increased severity of mental health symptoms among adolescent inpatients during COVID-19","Objective Prior research suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has been detrimental to adolescent mental health. However, no research has examined whether the pandemic is associated with increased symptom severity among high-risk youth, such as those hospitalized for a psychiatric crisis. Method Over a four-year period, upon admission to an adolescent psychiatric inpatient unit, youth completed measures of depression (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale), feeling like a burden and lack of belongingness (Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire), trauma-related symptoms (Child Trauma Screen), suicidal thoughts and behaviors (Self-Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Interview Self-Report Version). We compared the severity of these symptoms for patients admitted during the pandemic to the severity for patients admitted to the same unit in the three years before the pandemic. Results Across most symptoms, youth hospitalized during the pandemic reported increased severity compared to those hospitalized before the pandemic. Conclusions Adolescents requiring psychiatric hospitalization during the pandemic reported increased symptom severity compared to adolescents hospitalized on the same inpatient unit in the three years prior to the pandemic.","Millner, Alexander J.; Zuromski, Kelly L.; Joyce, Victoria W.; Kelly, Flynn, Richards, Cassidy, Buonopane, Ralph J.; Nash, Carol C.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2022.04.004","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: General Hospital Psychiatry;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-16","",30211,""
"Evaluating interventions to facilitate opioid agonist treatment access among people who inject drugs in Toronto, Ontario during COVID-19 pandemic restrictions","Background In March 2020, following a provincial COVID-19 emergency declaration, modifications to opioid agonist treatment (OAT) were introduced in Ontario, Canada to promote treatment access amid the pandemic and ongoing opioid overdose crisis. Modifications included federal exemptions to facilitate OAT prescription re-fills, extensions, and deliveries and interim treatment guidance emphasizing take-home (non-observed) doses and reduced urine drug screening for OAT patients. Methods We conducted an interrupted time series study using health administrative data from September 17th, 2019â€“September 21st, 2020, on 359 people who inject drugs with suspected opioid use disorder in Toronto, Ontario. We used segmented regression analyses to evaluate the joint effects of the provincial COVID-19 emergency declaration, federal OAT exemptions, and interim treatment guidanceâ€”all implemented between March 17thâ€“23rd, 2020â€”on the weekly proportion of participants enrolled in OAT (i.e., =1 day(s) covered with methadone or buprenorphine/naloxone), with an opioid-related overdose (based on emergency department visits and hospitalizations), and who died (all-cause), and the weekly proportion of OAT-enrolled participants receiving take-home doses (i.e., =1 day(s) covered) and undergoing urine drug screening. Results Post-implementation, the interventions were associated with immediate absolute changes in OAT enrollment (+1.95%;95% CI=0.04%â€“3.85%), receipt of take-home doses (+18.3%;95% CI=13.2%â€“23.4%), and urine drug screening (-22.4%;95% CI=[-26.9%]â€“[-17.9%]) and a gradual absolute increase of 0.56% in urine drug screening week-to-week (95% CI=0.27%-0.86%) beyond the pre-implementation trend. At 26 weeks post-implementation, OAT enrollment and urine drug screening approached pre-implementation levels whereas the increase in take-home doses was largely sustained (+15.0%;95% CI=4.33%â€“25.6%). No post-implementation increases in opioid-related overdoses were observed. Death was not modelled (low event frequency). Conclusion Changes to OAT provision following provincial COVID-19 restrictions were associated with an immediate and sustained increase in take-home dose coverage among OAT-enrolled participants, without corresponding increases in opioid-related overdoses among all participants.","Bouck, Zachary, Scheim, Ayden I.; Gomes, Tara, Ling, Vicki, Caudarella, Alexander, Werb, Dan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2022.103680","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Drug Policy;: 103680, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-16","",30212,""

"Role of maternal emotion in child maltreatment risk during the COVID-19 pandemic","Purpose: Preliminary research early in the COVID-19 pandemic suggested children appeared to be at increased risk for child maltreatment, particularly as parents struggled with mental health and economic strains. Such strains were likely to influence parental emotions about their children, affecting their parent-child interactions to contribute to elevated maltreatment risk. To identify the potential affective elements that may contribute to such increased maltreatment risk, the current study focused on whether maternal worry about childrenâ€™s behavior specifically as well as maternal anger were related to increased risk for neglect or physical or psychological aggression six months into the pandemic.The racially diverse sample included 193 mothers who completed an online survey during the COVID-19 pandemic in late September-early October 2020.Mothersâ€™ reported increases in neglect and physical and psychological aggression during the pandemic were significantly related with established measures of maltreatment risk. Furthermore, path models indicated that maternal anger and worry about childrenâ€™s behavior, as well as their interaction, were significantly related to indicators of physical aggression risk and neglect during the pandemic, but only maternal anger related to increased psychological aggression during the pandemic.Maternal worry and anger about childrenâ€™s behavior may have exacerbated risk for maltreatment under the stressful conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings suggest affective reactions of both parental worry and anger focused on child behavior warrants greater empirical attention and consideration in intervention efforts both during the pandemic and potentially post-pandemic.Method: Preliminary research early in the COVID-19 pandemic suggested children appeared to be at increased risk for child maltreatment, particularly as parents struggled with mental health and economic strains.

Furthermore, path models indicated that maternal anger and worry about childrenâ€™s behavior, as well as their interaction, were significantly related to indicators of physical aggression risk and neglect during the pandemic, but only maternal anger related to increased psychological aggression during the pandemic.Maternal worry and anger about childrenâ€™s behavior may have exacerbated risk for maltreatment under the stressful conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings suggest affective reactions of both parental worry and anger focused on child behavior warrants greater empirical attention and consideration in intervention efforts both during the pandemic and potentially post-pandemic.Results: Preliminary research early in the COVID-19 pandemic suggested children appeared to be at increased risk for child maltreatment, particularly as parents struggled with mental health and economic strains.

"Alienated and unsafe: Experiences of the first national UK COVID-19 lockdown for vulnerable young people (aged 11â€“24Â years) as revealed in Web-based therapeutic sessions with mental health professionals","Background Methods Results Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns have disproportionately affected young people, and those who are vulnerable are disadvantaged further. Here, we seek to understand the experiences of vulnerable young people accessing Web-based therapeutic support during the pandemic and early lockdown, as revealed through the observations of mental health professionals.Four focus groups with 12 professionals from a digital mental health service were conducted to understand the experiences of vulnerable young people during the pandemic lockdown. Workshops with young people with diverse experiences resulted in the co-design of the focus group topic guide and the interpretation and validation of analysis. The experiential inductiveâ€“deductive framework of thematic analysis was used to analyse the workshop transcripts.Four main themes and subsequent subthemes were identified: escalation of risk;the experience and consequence of loss;feeling supported and empowered;and feeling separate and isolated.Findings reflect early data that suggest that those with existing vulnerability face an increased risk of poor outcomes through the pandemic and the restrictions of lockdown, but evidence is also provided of positive outcomes from lockdown and its function as a catalyst for change. Results reinforce the need for focused support for vulnerable young people as we emerge from lockdown, and point to supportive and protective factors of relevance to online and offline support provision.
