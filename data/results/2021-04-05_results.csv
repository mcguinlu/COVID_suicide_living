"Comparison of post-COVID depression and major depressive disorder","Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic rates of depressive symptoms are markedly elevated, particularly among survivors of infection. Understanding whether such symptoms are distinct among those with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, or simply a nonspecific reflection of elevated stress, could help target interventions. Method: We analyzed data from multiple waves of a 50-state survey that included questions about COVID-19 infection as well as the Patient Health Questionnaire examining depressive and anxious symptoms. We utilized multiple logistic regression to examine whether sociodemographic features associated with depression liability differed for those with or without prior COVID-19, and then whether depressive symptoms differed among those with or without prior COVID-19. Results: Among 91,791 respondents, in regression models, age, gender, race, education, and income all exhibited an interaction with prior COVID-19 in risk for moderate or greater depressive symptoms (p<0.0001 in all cases), indicating differential risk in the two subgroups. Among those with such symptoms, levels of motoric symptoms and suicidality were significantly greater among those with prior COVID-19 illness. Depression risk increased with greater interval following acute infection. Discussion: Our results suggest that major depressive symptoms observed among individuals with prior COVID-19 illness may not reflect typical depressive episodes, and merit more focused neurobiological investigation.","Roy H Perlis; Mauricio Santillana; Katherine Ognyanova; Jon Green; James N Druckman; David Lazer; Matthew A.

"Investigation of SARS-CoV-2 virus on nozzle surfaces of fuel supply stations in North West of Iran","There are several ways for transmitting the SARS-CoV-2 virus to humans, and one of these ways is the contact with infected surfaces. Fuel stations have been a major concern for people and health experts due to the frequent use of common nozzles. This study was performed to identify the COVID-19 virus in the nozzles of fuel supply stations. In the current research, 25 fuel supply stations along the main street ways were investigated to recognize Coronavirus infection on the surfaces of the nozzles. For each fuel supply station, 4 nozzles were chosen (a total of 100 samples). The sampling was carried out at two periods of time, that is, before and after quarantine restrictions. Swapping was used for surface sampling, and Real-time PCR was used to determine the positive and negative results. The results showed that out of nine fuel supply stations (36 samples of nozzle surfaces), five were positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 on the nozzle surfaces before the corona restriction. The results showed that in the conditions after corona restriction, all samples were negative in terms of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 on the surfaces of the nozzles. In spite of the fact that gas stations can be one of the foremost inclined places for the transmission and spread of coronavirus due to the nearness and visit of individuals, but through the observance of health behaviors and implementing some procedures, cutting the transmission chain in gas stations can be facilitated.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.146641","20210801","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-05","",12592,""
"Perceived family adaptability and cohesion and depressive symptoms: A comparison of adolescents and parents during COVID-19 pandemic","Objective: To compare the differences of depressive symptoms and perceived family cohesion and adaptability between adolescents and parents during the pandemic; to explore the association between depressive symptoms and family cohesion and adaptability. Methods: A total of 8,940 adolescents (45.77% males; Mean age=15.31Â±0.018 years old) and their parents (24.34% males; Mean age=40.78Â±0.60 years old) from Shenyang, Liaoning Province, China, participated in the survey and completed several questionnaires online. We used the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Family Adaptability Cohesion Scale, Second Edition, Chinese version (FACES II-CV) to evaluate depressive symptoms and family cohesion and family adaptability from the perception of parents and adolescents. Results: Results indicated significant differences between adolescentsâ€™ and parentsâ€™ perspectives of family functions. Significant negative correlations exist between depressive symptoms and family cohesion and family adaptability from the perspectives of both adolescents and parents. In addition, regression models with demographic characteristics adjusted showed that the perceived family cohesion and adaptability of parents and adolescents and the agreements between them could be predicted by their depressive symptoms. Limitation: Cross-sectional study and limited population-wide are limitations. Conclusion: Detecting the depressive symptoms of adolescents and parents earlier and promptly providing family intervention are of great significance to promote their perceptions of family cohesion and adaptability, which contribute to the mental health development of adolescents and parents during the COVID-19 pandemic.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.03.048","20210515","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-05","",12593,""
