"The impact on the mental health and well-being of unpaid carers affected by social distancing, self-isolation and shielding during the COVID 19 pandemic in England - a systematic review","Objective This study explores the impact of the COVID 19 lockdown measures on the mental health and well-being of unpaid carers, who make up the largest number of the carer population in England. Study design A systematic review research protocol was designed and used to conduct the review along with the Enhancing Transparency in Reporting the synthesis of Qualitative Research - ENTREQ statement [43]. Pre-determined inclusion and exclusion criteria were used. EndNote X9 reference management was used and the search process was represented using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram [76]. Appraisal of the included research was carried out using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) [57]. Line by line coding was done using inductive thematic synthesis and EPPI Reviewer 4 software [60]. Results Four themes emerged; immediate worries or fears, adapting to change, post pandemic fears and use of technology. Conclusion The measures put in place during the first lockdown period have had detrimental impacts on unpaid carers, putting them at greater risk of burnout. However, use of digital platforms could have a positive impact on well-being. Recommendations for further research are provided.

"Population birth outcomes in 2020 and experiences of expectant mothers during the COVID-19 pandemic: a Born in Wales mixed methods study using routine data","Background: Pregnancy can be a stressful time and the COVID 19 pandemic has affected all aspects of life. This study aims to investigate the impact of the pandemic on population birth outcomes in Wales, rates of primary immunisations and examine expectant mothers experiences of pregnancy including self reported levels of stress and anxiety. Methods: Population level birth outcomes in Wales: Stillbirths, prematurity, birth weight and Caesarean section births before (2016 to 2019) and during (2020) the pandemic were compared using national level routine anonymised data held in the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank. The first three scheduled primary immunisations were compared between 2019 and 2020. Self reported pregnancy experience: 215 expectant mothers (aged 16+) in Wales completed an online survey about their experiences of pregnancy during the pandemic. The qualitative survey data was analysed using codebook thematic analysis. Findings: There was no significant difference between annual outcomes including gestation and birth weight, stillbirths, and Caesarean sections for infants born in 2020 compared to years 2016 to 2019. There was an increase in late term births (>42 weeks gestation) during the first lockdown (OR: 1.28, p=0.019) and a decrease in moderate to late preterm births (32 to 36 weeks gestation) during the second lockdown (OR: 0.74, p=0.001). Fewer babies were born in 2020 (N=29,031) compared to years 2016 to 2019 (average N=32,582). All babies received their immunisations in 2020, but there were minor delays in the timings of vaccines. Those due at 8 weeks were 8% less likely to be on time (within 28 days) and at 16 weeks, they were 19% less likely to be on time. The pandemic had a negative impact on the mental health of 71% of survey respondents, who reported anxiety, stress and loneliness; this was associated with attending scans without their partner, giving birth alone, and minimal contact with midwives. Interpretation: The pandemic had a negative impact on mothers experiences of pregnancy; however, population level data suggests that this did not translate to adverse birth outcomes for babies born during the pandemic.","Hope Jones; Mike Seaborne; Laura Cowley; David E Odd; Shantini Paranjothy; Ashley Akbari; Sinead Brophy","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.23.21262209","20210823","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-24","",17310,""
"COVID-19 lung infection segmentation with a novel two-stage cross-domain transfer learning framework","With the global outbreak of COVID-19 in early 2020, rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 has become the urgent need to control the spread of the epidemic. In clinical settings, lung infection segmentation from computed tomography (CT) images can provide vital information for the quantification and diagnosis of COVID-19. However, accurate infection segmentation is a challenging task due to (i) the low boundary contrast between infections and the surroundings, (ii) large variations of infection regions, and, most importantly, (iii) the shortage of large-scale annotated data. To address these issues, we propose a novel two-stage cross-domain transfer learning framework for the accurate segmentation of COVID-19 lung infections from CT images. Our framework consists of two major technical innovations, including an effective infection segmentation deep learning model, called nCoVSegNet, and a novel two-stage transfer learning strategy. Specifically, our nCoVSegNetÃ‚Â conducts effective infection segmentation by taking advantage of attention-aware feature fusion and large receptive fields, aiming to resolve the issues related to low boundary contrast and large infection variations. To alleviate the shortage of the data, the nCoVSegNetÃ‚Â is pre-trained using a two-stage cross-domain transfer learning strategy, which makes full use of the knowledge from natural images (i.e., ImageNet) and medical images (i.e., LIDC-IDRI) to boost the final training on CT images with COVID-19 infections. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves superior segmentation accuracy and outperforms the cutting-edge models, both quantitatively and qualitatively.","Liu, Dong, Wang, Cui, Fan, Ma, Chen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2021.102205","20210823","COVID-19; Computed tomography; Lung infection segmentation; Transfer learning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-24","",17311,""

"Effect of emergency declaration on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan: A social network service-based difference-in-differences approach","Strong lockdowns to control COVID-19 pandemic have been enforced globally and strongly restricted social activities with consequent negative effects on mental health. Japan has effectively implemented a unique voluntary policy to control COVID-19, but the mental health impact of the policy has not been examined on a large scale. In this study, we examined the effect of the first declaration on the mental health of affected residents. We used population-level questionnaire data of 17,400 people living under the state of emergency and 9208 who were not through a social-networking-service app and applied a difference-in-differences regression model to estimate the causal effect of the declaration of the state of emergency on psychological wellbeing, stratified by job category. No statistically significant effect of the declaration was observed among all job categories. This suggests that residents' psychological situation has gradually changed, possibly influenced by other factors such as the surrounding environment, rather than the declaration itself. Given that Japan has a unique policy to control COVID-19 instead of a strict lockdown, our results showed the Japanese-style policy may serve as a form of harm reduction strategy, to control the epidemic with minimal psychological harm, and enable a policy that balances disease control and mental health. Caution is necessary that this study used self-reported data from a limited time period before and after the first declaration in April 2020.","Eguchi, Yoneoka, Shi, Tanoue, Kawashima, Nomura, Makiyama, Uryu, Sawada, Kawamura, Takayanagi, Gilmour, Miyata","https://doi.org/10.1177/00368504211029793","20210823","COVID-19; Japan; Mental health; difference-in-differences design; social network service","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-24","",17313,""
"Covid-19 Effects on Psychological Outcomes: How Do Gender Responses Differ?","The study aims at understanding the relationships between the fear of COVID-19 and perceived stress, wellbeing, and life satisfaction. The study also analyses the role of gender on the relationship of fear of COVID-19 with these study variables. For this, a cross-sectional study was conducted among 1125 participants in India, comprising 638 men and 487 women. Structural equation model was used to analyse the data. It was found that the fear of COVID-19 is positively related to perceived stress and negatively related to wellbeing and life satisfaction. It was also found that, these relationships are stronger among women than among men. The study shows the importance of psychiatric assessment during pandemic times and alerts policy makers and society in general, to take measures for ensuring mental health among people during times of crisis.

"Implication of COVID-19 on the mental health of Egyptian dermatologists: A cross-sectional study","Major epidemic outbreaks create an increased demand for healthcare workers (HCWs) and pose increased health risk and psychological distress to them as well. The aim of this cross sectional study was to find out the prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress among Egyptian dermatologists and their possible predictor factors. A cross sectional study was designed and data were collected using structured self-administered online depression, anxiety, and stress scale (DASS-21). The depression scale of DASS was 18.98 Ã‚Â± 9.56 among which 38% of dermatologists had either severe or extremely severe depression and 34.2% complained of moderate depression. Meanwhile, the anxiety scale was 12.92 Ã‚Â± 7.75 and 35.4 % of surveyed dermatologists had either severe or extremely severe anxiety. Thirty three percent of dermatologists were normal on stress score. Female dermatologists possessed more significant depression and stress than males (19.70 Ã‚Â± 9.71 vs. 16.62 Ã‚Â± 8.68, p = 0.003; 21.42 Ã‚Â± 9.53 vs. 17.40 Ã‚Â± 8.49, p &lt;0.001 respectively). On the contrary, male dermatologists expressed more anxiety than female dermatologists however this was not statistically significant (13.26 Ã‚Â± 7.99 vs. 12.82 Ã‚Â± 7.69, p = 0.625).

"The experience of delayed health care access during the COVID 19 pandemic in Australian women: A mixed methods exploration","Delayed health care access is a potential collateral effect of pandemic conditions, health rationing strategies and social distancing responses. We investigated experiences of delayed health care access in Australian women during COVID-19. A mixed methods study used quantitative and free-text data from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health COVID-19 survey 4 (health care access or delay). Logistic regression models were used to estimate factors associated with delaying access to general practitioners (GPs), specialists and allied health services. Free-text comments were analysed thematically, employing a process of constant comparison. COVID-19 survey 4 was completed by 8,200 women and 2,727 provided free-text comments. Of the women who needed the health service, 25% (1,268/5,071) delayed seeing their GP, 23.6% (570/1,695) delayed seeing a specialist and 45% (791/1,757) delayed use of an allied health service. Younger age was most significantly associated with delaying attendance. Women born 1989-95 were significantly more likely to delay compared to women born 1946-51 (OR (95% CI): GPÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.28 (0.22, 0.35)); SpecialistÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.65 (0.45, 0.92; Allied HealthÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.59 (0.42, 0.82)). Women born 1973-78 were also likely to delay GP visits (0.69, (0.58, 0.83)). Four qualitative themes emerged including: (1) Challenges negotiating care during a pandemic; (2) Ongoing uncertainty towards accessing health care when a specialist delays an appointment; (3) Accessing health care (or not) using Telehealth and (4) Managing complex care needs. COVID-19 has had a significant effect on access to health care. Women delayed seeking help for cancer screening, mental health, and other health conditions involving chronic and complex needs for health and social care. While there is a need to rationalise and optimise health access during a pandemic, our outcomes suggest a need for public health campaigns that clarify how to access care, engage with telehealth and respond to missed appointments.","White, Cavenagh, Byles, Mishra, Tooth, Loxton","https://doi.org/10.1111/hsc.13546","20210823","Australia; COVID-19; health care access; mental health; qualitative; screening; surveys","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-24","",17316,""
"Leveraging built environment interventions to equitably promote health during and after COVID-19 in Toronto, Canada","A key public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic is the mandate to stay home and practice physical distancing. In Canada, with essential activities such as grocery shopping, outdoor exercise and transportation, people need to be able to safely navigate dense, urban spaces while staying at least two metres or six feet apart. This pandemic has exacerbated the health inequities across neighbourhoods in cities like Toronto, Canada which are often segregated along racial and income lines. These inequities impact who has access to urban infrastructure that promotes health and quality of life. Safety in a time of COVID-19 goes beyond just exposure to the virus, it is complicated by notions of who belongs where, and who has access to what resources. The built environment has a role in maintaining and promoting physical and mental health during this pandemic and beyond it. This paper puts forwards three considerations for built environment interventions to promote health equitably: (i) addressing structural determinants of health and embedding anti-racist intersectional principles, (ii) revisiting tactical urbanism as a health promotion tool and (iii) rethinking community engagement processes through equity-based placemaking. This paper outlines four built environment interventions in Toronto, Canada that seek to address the challenges in navigating urban space safely in the short term, including street design that prioritizes pedestrians, protected cycling infrastructure, access to inclusive green space and safe, affordable housing. Longer-term strategies to create health-promoting urban environments that are equitable are discussed and may be valuable to other cities with similar urban equity concerns.","Hassen","https://doi.org/10.1093/heapro/daab128","20210823","anti-oppression; built environment; health equity; social determinants of health; structural determinants of health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-24","",17317,""
"Mental Health Service Provision During COVID-19: Results of the Third Survey of Licensed Psychologists","A third survey of the practice of licensed psychologists during the pandemic conducted in June 2021 revealed that the rapid adoption of telepsychological service provision has continued approximately 15Ã‚Â months after a national public health emergency was declared. Most respondents intend to make telepsychology a permanent component of their practice going forward. Other notable findings from our survey revealed that after an initial decline in caseload reported in the early days of the pandemic, the majority of psychologists surveyed now report an increase in caseload, often necessitating the establishment of a waitlist. Respondents reported that their patients/clients are more accepting of telepsychology than in our previous survey. That said, a significant minority of psychologists expressed concerns that this technology will negatively affect their future practice. Results also indicated that psychologists are encountering greater symptom acuity among their patients associated with the pandemic, including an increase in reports of suicidal thinking or behavior.

"Innovation Inspired by COVID: A Virtual Treatment Program for Patients With Mild Cognitive Impairment at Mayo Clinic","Limited access to mental health and behavioral interventions is a public health issue that predated and is further worsened by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) social distancing restrictions. The Healthy Action to Benefit Independence and Thinking (HABIT) program is a cognitive rehabilitation and wellness program for patients with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment and their partners that involves groups of up to 32 people (16 dyads) at a time. Thus, the public health recommendation to avoid groups at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic immediately impacted our ability to offer this treatment protocol. This brief report provides patient and partner satisfaction data as well as clinical outcomes with a virtual adaptation of the HABIT program developed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time of their participation, patients who attended in-person sessions had an average age of 74.4 years and those who attended virtual sessions had an average age of 75.4 years (<i>P</i>=.60). Both groups had an average of 16.3 years of education (<i>P</i>=.95). Approximately half of the patients in both groups were male (30 of 57 [53%]), most were White (54 of 57 [95%]) and were accompanied to the program by a spouse (50 of 57 [88%]). Overall, patient and partner satisfaction with the HABIT program remained high, ranging from a mean score of 5.8 to 6.6 on a rating scale of 1 to 7 for patients and partners, and clinical outcomes remained consistent with our face-to-face formatting when compared with pre-COVID pandemic sessions. The most notable changes across both formats were improvements in patient anxiety (Cohen's <i>d</i>=0.25 face-to-face; <i>d</i>=0.39 virtual), partner anxiety (<i>d</i>=0.37 face-to-face; <i>d</i>=0.34 virtual), and partner depression (<i>d</i>=0.37 face-to-face; <i>d</i>=0.35 virtual). This preliminary program evaluation suggests that transitioning the HABIT program to virtual formatting provides high-quality care similar to our in-person care models. Ongoing program evaluation is planned as we continue using virtual treatment for safety. Even after COVID-19 pandemic public health restrictions are lifted, these findings will have continued relevance to ongoing demand for telehealth.","Locke, Khayoun, Shandera-Ochsner, Cuc, Eilertsen, Caselli, Abrew, Chandler","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocpiqo.2021.06.004","20210823","COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; ECog, everyday cognition; ES, effect size; HABIT, Healthy Action to Benefit Independence and Thinking; HIPAA, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act; MCI, mild cognitive impairment; MSS, memory support system","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-24","",17319,""

"Prevalence, Pattern and Functional Outcome of Post COVID-19 Syndrome in Older Adults","Introduction COVID-19 pandemic has been shown to produce high infection rates, significant morbidity and mortality among older adults. A significant proportion of people who have recovered from acute COVID-19 illness seem to suffer from post COVID-19 syndrome. Post COVID-19 syndrome is thought to be a multisystem disease involving physical, functional, mental and psychological domains. This analysis tries to estimate the prevalence, pattern and functional outcomes of post COVID-19 syndrome in hospitalized older adults. Methods A prospective cohort study was done on 279 older adults who were discharged from our centre between August 1st, 2020 and November 30th 2020. Information was collected through a telephonic interview after 90 days of discharge from the hospital using a standard questionnaire by a trained physician. Collected data were analyzed with IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 23.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Results After 90 days of recovery, the most common symptoms prevalent in the study population were fatigue (8.9%) followed by cough (4.3%), breathlessness (1.8%), dizziness (1.4%), myalgia (1.1%), loss of smell and taste (0.8%) and chest discomfort (0.7%). TheÃ‚Â prevalence of risk of anxiety in the study population after 90 days of recovery was 7.5% while that of risk of depression was 12.2%. After 90 days of recovery, 66 (23.6%) patients reported the presence of at least one clinical feature while 9.3%Ã‚Â had two or more clinical features. On comparing the mean activities of daily living (ADL) 5.58 (.795) and mean instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) 5.84 (1.49) before the illness and 90 days following recovery there was no statistical difference for the study population. Conclusion The prevalence of post COVID-19 syndrome in older adults is about 9.3%. The most common symptoms reported by older adults after 90 days following recovery were fatigue followed by cough and breathlessness. Most older adults retained their baseline functional status after 90 days of recovery from acute COVID-19.","P, Madhavan, Pandurangan","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.17189","20210823","anxiety; covid-19; depression; elderly; older adults; postcovid syndrome","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-24","",17321,""
"Attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination and willingness to pay: comparison of people with and without mental disorders in China","Acceptance and willingness to pay for the COVID-19 vaccine are unknown. We compared attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination in people suffering from depression or anxiety disorder and people without mental disorders, and their willingness to pay for it. Adults with depression or anxiety disorder (<i>n</i> = 79) and healthy controls (<i>n</i> = 134) living in Chongqing, China, completed a cross-sectional study between 13 and 26 January 2021. We used a validated survey to assess eight aspects related to attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccines. Psychiatric symptoms were assessed by the 21-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale. Seventy-six people with depression or anxiety disorder (96.2%) and 134 healthy controls (100%) reported willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. A significantly higher proportion of people with depression or anxiety disorder (64.5%) were more willing to pay for the COVID-19 vaccine than healthy controls (38.1%) (<i>P</i> Ã¢â€°Â¤ 0.001). After multivariate adjustment, severity of depression and anxiety was significantly associated with willingness to pay for COVID-19 vaccination among psychiatric patients (<i>P</i> = 0.048). Non-healthcare workers (<i>P</i> = 0.039), health insurance (<i>P</i> = 0.003), living with children (<i>P</i> = 0.006) and internalised stigma (<i>P</i> = 0.002) were significant factors associated with willingness to pay for COVID-19 vaccine in healthy controls. To conclude, psychiatric patients in Chongqing, China, showed high acceptance and willingness to pay for the COVID-19 vaccine. Factors associated with willingness to pay for the COVID-19 vaccine differed between psychiatric patients and healthy controls.","Hao, Wang, Tan, Husain, McIntyre, Tang, Zhang, Han, Jiang, Chew, Tan, Tran, Zhang, Vu, Vu, Ho, Ho, Sharma","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2021.979","20210823","Anxiety; COVID-19; depression; insomnia; vaccine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-24","",17322,""
"Prevalence and predictors of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms among pregnant women during COVID-19-related lockdown in Abakaliki, Nigeria","Several studies have been published on the topic of COVID-19 and pregnancy over recent months. However, few studies have evaluated the impact of this pandemic on maternal mental health, particularly in low-resource settings. To determine the prevalence and predictors of COVID-19-related depression, anxiety and stress symptoms among pregnant women. This was a cross-sectional study that involved 456 pregnant women attending prenatal care at Abakaliki, Nigeria, during the COVID-19 lockdown. These patients were screened for psychological morbidities using the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). Severe and extremely severe depression were reported in 7.2% (n=33) and 6.4% (n=29) of participants, respectively. Analysis also revealed that 3.3% (n=15) and 7.7% (n=35) of women had severe and extremely severe anxiety, respectively. In total, 23% (n=105) of the participating women had severe stress while 16.7% (n=76) reported extremely severe stress. Multiparity (2-4) and occupation, such as trading and farming, were predictors of depression whereas grand-multiparity, urban residence, and trading, were identified as predictors of anxiety and stress.

"Effects of Coronavirus Fears on Anxiety and Depressive Disorder Symptoms in Clinical and Subclinical Adolescents: The Role of Negative Affect, Intolerance of Uncertainty, and Emotion Regulation Strategies","Fears related to COVID-19 (""coronavirus fears"") have emerged as a new psychological effect of the current COVID-19 pandemic and have been associated with psychological distress and impairment. Other adverse effects include an increase in anxiety and depression symptoms and the respective disorders. The purpose of the current study was to examine the incremental validity of coronavirus fears and transdiagnostic factors in the prediction of the severity of anxiety and depressive disorder symptoms. A sample of 144 adolescents [aged 12-18 years, 55 boys (38.2%) and 89 girls (61.8%)] most of whom showed elevated levels of anxiety and depressive disorder symptoms completed several self-report measures online assessing coronavirus fears, transdiagnostic vulnerability and protective factors, and emotion regulation strategies. Results based on a series of hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that coronavirus fears, negative affect, intolerance of uncertainty, acceptance/tolerance, rumination and suppression explained unique variance in the severity of anxiety and depressive disorder symptoms. Path analysis demonstrated that acceptance/tolerance, rumination and suppression mediated the association between higher level transdiagnostic factors and the severity of major depressive disorder symptoms. Findings provide support for the hierarchical transdiagnostic model of emotional disorders and suggest that clinicians should be aware of coronavirus fears. Also, the results warrant the need to consider transdiagnostic vulnerability and protective processes in the new protocols for the treatment of emotional disorders.","SandÃƒÂ­n, Espinosa, Valiente, GarcÃƒÂ­a-Escalera, Schmitt, ArnÃƒÂ¡ez, Chorot","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.716528","20210823","COVID-19; anxiety; coronavirus fears; depression; emotion regulation; intolerance of uncertainty; negative affect; transdiagnostic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-24","",17324,""
"Depression, Anxiety, and Suicidal Ideation in Chinese University Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has seriously threatened the global public health security and caused a series of mental health problem. Current research focuses mainly on mental health status and related factors in the COVID-19 pandemic among Chinese university students. Data from 11133 participants was obtained through an online survey. The Patient Health Question-9 (PHQ-9) was used to assess depressive symptoms, the Social Support Rate Scale (SSRS) was used to assess social support. We also used 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) to assess anxiety symptoms. Totally, 37.0% of the subjects were experiencing depressive symptoms, 24.9% anxiety symptoms, 20.9% comorbid depressive and anxiety symptoms, and 7.3% suicidal ideation. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed an increased presence of mental health problems in female students, graduate students, and those with personal COVID-19 exposure. Awareness of COVID-19, living with family were protective factors that reduced anxiety and depression symptoms. In addition, male, personal COVID-19 exposure, depressive and anxiety symptoms were risk factors for suicidal ideation. Social support, COVID-19 preventive and control measures, prediction of COVID-19 trends, living with family and graduate students are protective factors for reducing suicidal ideation.","Zhou, Wang, Qi, Yang, Gao, Zhang, Zhang, Yang, Chen","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.669833","20210823","COVID-19; anxiety symptoms; depressive symptoms; social support; suicidal ideation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-24","",17325,""
"Financial and Mental Health Concerns of Impoverished Urban-Dwelling Bangladeshi People During COVID-19","<b>Background:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the physical, mental and financial health of many individuals. Individuals living in impoverished crowded settings may be particularly vulnerable to COVID-19-related stressors. How substantially marginalized groups like impoverished urban-dwelling individuals have been impacted during this pandemic is poorly understood. The present study aimed to investigate the associated factors of financial concerns and symptoms of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during the COVID-19 pandemic among impoverished urban-dwelling individuals residing in Dhaka, Bangladesh. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional survey was conducted between August and September 2020 using face-to-face interviews in six disadvantaged neighborhoods (""slums"") in Dhaka. Individuals were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire consisting of questions assessing socio-demographics, lifestyle, financial well-being relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, depression, and PTSD. <b>Results:</b> Four-hundred-and-thirty-five individuals (male = 54.7%; mean age = 45.0 Ã‚Â± 12.0 years; age range = 18-85 years) participated. Most (96.3%) reported that their household income decreased due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Factors associated with decreased household incomes included female gender, primary education, joblessness, food scarcity and depression. Depression symptoms were linked to female gender, joblessness, divorce, living in a joint family, excessive sleep and smoking. Low incomes, excessive sleep, joblessness and food scarcity were positively associated with PTSD symptoms. In contrast, less sleep appeared protective against PTSD. <b>Conclusions:</b> Public health initiatives, in particular mental health services that target stress and biocentric approaches that consider how humans interact with multiple facets of nature, should be introduced to mitigate against potential financial and psychological effects of the pandemic on impoverished urban-dwelling individuals in Bangladesh.","Islam, Rahman, Banik, Emran, Saiara, Hossain, Hasan, Sikder, Smith, Potenza","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.663687","20210823","Bangladesh; COVID-19 pandemic; depression; post-traumatic stress disorder; poverty; sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-24","",17326,""
"The Relationship Between Perceived Stress and Subjective Cognitive Decline During the COVID-19 Epidemic","During the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic, fear of disease and its consequences, recommended lifestyle changes, and severe restrictions set by governments acted as stressors and affected people's mood, emotions, mental health, and wellbeing. Many studies conducted during this crisis focused on affective and physiological responses to stress, but few studies examined how the crisis affected cognition. The present cross-sectional study examined the relationship between physiological, affective, and cognitive responses to the epidemic. In an online survey conducted at the height of the first wave of the epidemic in Slovenia (April 15-25, 2020), 830 Slovenian residents aged 18-85 years reported the effects of stressors (confinement, problems at home, problems at work, lack of necessities, and increased workload), experienced emotions, generalized anxiety, perceived stress, changes in health, fatigue and sleep quality, and perceived changes in cognition during the epidemic. Risk factors for stress (neuroticism, vulnerability, general health, gender, and age) were also recorded. We hypothesized that stressors and stress risk factors will be related to subjective cognitive decline, with negative emotions, generalized anxiety, perceived stress, and physical symptoms acting as mediator variables. On average, the results showed a mild subjective cognitive decline during the epidemic. In structural equation modeling, 34% of its variance was predicted by the mediator variables, with negative emotions and physical symptoms having the largest contribution. Stress risk factors were predictably related to the four mediator variables. Among the stressors, confinement showed the strongest effect on the four mediator variables, implying the importance of thoughtful communication about necessary restrictive measures during emergency circumstances. The results of this study indicate that the possibility of altered cognitive function should be considered when planning work and study activities during the epidemic.","Podlesek, Komidar, Kavcic","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.647971","20210823","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; cognitive complaints; cognitively normal adults; emotions; physical health; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-24","",17327,""
"Cultural Responses to Covid-19 Pandemic: Religions, Illness Perception, and Perceived Stress","Many psychological researchers have proven the deteriorating effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic on public mental health. In Malaysia, various Covid-19 clusters were associated with religious gatherings. From a cultural psychology perspective, how ethno-religious groups respond to this crisis originating from their unique rationality and ecological systems. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the illness perceptions of major religious groups (Christian, Muslim, and Buddhist) in Malaysia toward the Covid-19 pandemic, their stress levels, and the relationship between illness perception, stress, and forms of religious expression during the lockdown period. Through an online survey method, 608 Malaysian religious believers were included in this mixed-method empirical study, which adapted standardized instruments [Duke University Religion Index (DUREL), Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (BIPQ), and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)]. Statistical analysis showed that all three groups reported moderate levels of stress in average without any significant difference after controlling for age. Both internal and external forms of religious expression had a significant negative relationship with stress levels. Personal control, comprehension, and emotions domains of illness perception accounted for a significant variance in the stress level. Furthermore, religious expression significantly moderated the relationship between some illness perception domains and stress. Qualitative coding revealed that most participants perceived human behavior and attitudes, sociopolitical, and sociological factors as causal factors to the current pandemic. These findings confirmed the relationship between religious expression, illness belief, and stress regulation during the pandemic lockdown. Incidental findings of age as a potential protective factor for Malaysian believers warrants further study. In the conclusion, implications for public health policymakers and religious communities on pandemic prevention and well-being promotion were discussed.","Ting, Aw Yong, Tan, Yap","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.634863","20210823","Covid-19; culture; illness perception; religions; religious expression; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-24","",17328,""
"Prevalence, Risk Factors, and Clinical Correlates of Insomnia in China College Student During the COVID-19","<b>Objective:</b> The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) broke out in Hubei Province and spread rapidly to the whole country, causing huge public health problems. College students are a special group, and there is no survey on insomnia among college students. The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence and related factors of insomnia in college students during the period of COVID-19. <b>Method:</b> A total of 1,086 college students conducted a cross-sectional study through the questionnaire star platform. The survey time was from February 15 to February 22, 2020. The collected information included demographic informatics and mental health scale, Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) to assess sleep quality, Self-Reporting Questionnaire-20 (SRQ-20) to assess general psychological symptoms, Chinese perceived stress scale (CPSS) to assess stress. We used logistic regression to analyze the correlation between related factors and insomnia symptoms. <b>Results:</b> The prevalence of insomnia, general psychological symptoms and stress were 16.67, 5.8, and 40.70%, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that gender (<i>OR</i> = 1.55, <i>p</i> = 0.044, 95% <i>CI</i> = 1.00-2.41), general psychological symptoms (<i>OR</i> = 1.49, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01, 95% <i>CI</i> = 1.40-1.60) and living in an isolation unit (<i>OR</i> = 2.21, <i>p</i> = 0.014, 95% <i>CI</i> = 1.17-4.16) were risk factors for insomnia of college students. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our results show that the insomnia is very common among college students during the outbreak of covid-19, and the related factors include gender, general psychological symptoms and isolation environment.

"Sexual activities during the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia","Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread globally starting from late 2019. The WHO declared it a global pandemic in March 2020, causing nations around the world to introduce various control measures to halt the rapid spread of the disease, such as quarantines, lockdowns, and work from home (WFH) policies. These policies often force people to spend more time at home with their cohabitants, or possibly sexual partners. Various negative feelings experienced during those policies are considered to affect the general mood and sexual life of the population. This study aimed to investigate the difference in mood and sexual activity before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. This research was a cross-sectional pilot study. Authors collected data from 131 randomlyÃ‚Â selected, sexually active volunteer subjects using a self-administered online questionnaire. Subjects' mood status, behavior, and frequency of sexual intercourse before and during COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia were analyzed. Subjects consisted of 67 (51.1%) men and 64 (48.9%) women. Our analysis shows that there was a decline in overall mood scale, and also sexual activity frequency, before and during the pandemic (4.63 vs. 4.03; 80.2% vs. 67.9%, respectively). The COVID-19 pandemic control measures may enable subjects to have more time with their sexual partners at home, but it does not increase the frequency of their sexual activities. There was a slight decrease in overall mood scale and sexual activity frequency during the COVID-19 pandemic recorded among subjects. The authors suspect that depression symptoms, fear, anxiety, irritability, boredom, confusion, and feeling of being isolated experienced during strict pandemic control measures, caused by stressors such as job loss, decreased monthly income, and the current state of the pandemic are influencing these phenomena.","Kusuma, Brodjonegoro, Soerohardjo, Hendri, Yuri","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12301-021-00227-w","20210823","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Fear; Isolation; Pandemic; Sexual activity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-24","",17331,""
"Psychiatry's Dark Secrets: Black Lives Don't Matter","There have been significant advances in the diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric disorders; however, racial disparities continue to create inequity in mental health care. In this commentary, we explore mental health disparities disfavoring African Americans in the psychiatric literature. We discuss how discrimination over time has resulted in a difference of perception, misdiagnoses, and conflicts in patient care. The literature reviewed reveals a pattern wherein African Americans are more likely to be misdiagnosed for all types of mental illness compared with other ethnicities due to fallacies perpetuated throughout the history of African Americans. In addition, the aggregation of current information and research on the current COVID-19 pandemic will justify future research on the epidemic of police brutality and shootings of unarmed African Americans. If we address this issue, we will reduce medical mistrust and ultimately reduce racial health inequities.","Saldana, Saldana, Mohayed, Bailey","https://doi.org/10.1353/hpu.2021.0128","20210823","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-24","",17332,""
"University professors' mental and physical well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic and distance teaching","Strict strategies including lockdowns and working from home were adopted worldwide during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. University professors suddenly shifted to work from home adopting distance teaching. This study aimed to investigate Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and its associated occupational and health factors during COVID-19 among university professors. A cross-sectional design targeted university professors of all majors in Jordan. The study self-administered survey included demographics and lifestyle data, 12-item Short Form health survey (SF-12), Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS 21), professor' evaluation of distance teaching, Neck Disability Index (NDI), and International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Descriptive analyses were conducted to demonstrate primary outcome measures data. Factors associated with HRQoL were determined using a multiple variable linear regression analysis. A total of 299 university professors successfully completed the study. Participants' SF-12 physical health component score was 74.08 (Ã‚Â±18.5) and 65.74 (Ã‚Â±21.4) for mental health component. Higher depression, stress, neck disability, and weight change were significantly associated with lower HRQoL level. While higher satisfaction with distance teaching, health self-evaluation, and work load change were significantly and associated with higher HRQoL level. The regression model explained 66.7%of the variance in professors' HRQoL (r2Ã¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.667, FÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 82.83, PÃ¢â‚¬Å &lt; Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.001).

"Feasibility and Effectiveness of Assessing Subhealth Using a Mobile Health Management App (MibyeongBogam) in Early Middle-Aged Koreans: Randomized Controlled Trial","Mobile health (mHealth) is a major source of health management systems. Moreover, the demand for mHealth, which is in need of change due to the COVID-19 pandemic, is increasing worldwide. Accordingly, interest in health care in everyday life and the importance of mHealth are growing. We developed the MibyeongBogam (MBBG) app that evaluates the user's subhealth status via a smartphone and provides a health management method based on that user's subhealth status for use in everyday life. Subhealth is defined as a state in which the capacity to recover to a healthy state is diminished, but without the presence of clinical disease. The objective of this study was to compare the awareness and status of subhealth after the use of the MBBG app between intervention and control groups, and to evaluate the app's practicality. This study was a prospective, open-label, parallel group, randomized controlled trial. The study was conducted at two hospitals in Korea with 150 healthy people in their 30s and 40s, at a 1:1 allocation ratio. Participants visited the hospital three times as follows: preintervention, intermediate visit 6 weeks after the intervention, and final visit 12 weeks after the intervention. Key endpoints were measured at the first visit before the intervention and at 12 weeks after the intervention. The primary outcome was the awareness of subhealth, and the secondary outcomes were subhealth status, health-promoting behaviors, and motivation to engage in healthy behaviors. The primary outcome, subhealth awareness, tended to slightly increase for both groups after the uncompensated intervention, but there was no significant difference in the score between the two groups (intervention group: mean 23.69, SD 0.25 vs control group: mean 23.1, SD 0.25; P=.09). In the case of secondary outcomes, only some variables of the subhealth status showed significant differences between the two groups after the intervention, and the intervention group showed an improvement in the total scores of subhealth (P=.03), sleep disturbance (P=.02), depression (P=.003), anger (P=.01), and anxiety symptoms (P=.009) compared with the control group. In this study, the MBBG app showed potential for improving the health, especially with regard to sleep disturbance and depression, of individuals without particular health problems. However, the effects of the app on subhealth awareness and health-promoting behaviors were not clearly evaluated. Therefore, further studies to assess improvements in health after the use of personalized health management programs provided by the MBBG app are needed. The MBBG app may be useful for members of the general public, who are not diagnosed with a disease but are unable to lead an optimal daily life due to discomfort, to seek strategies that can improve their health.

"Risk Factors of Psychological Disorders After the COVID-19 Outbreak: The Mediating Role of Social Support and Emotional Intelligence","The present study examined the risk factors of psychological disorders after COVID-19 outbreak and tested the possible mediating role of social support and emotional intelligence on the relationship between COVID-19 pandemic exposure and psychological disorders. We conducted an online survey from May 25, 2020 until June 10, 2020 among Chinese university students who had been quarantined at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Social support was assessed using the Social Support Rating Scale. Self-perceived emotional competency was measured using a Chinese version of the self-report Wong Law Emotional Intelligence Scale. The 10-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale was used to assess nonspecific symptoms of psychological disorders. A total of 6,027 college students participated in the survey, of whom 2,732 (45.3%) reported mental health issues. Men and people in a relationship showed higher frequencies of psychological disorders. Social support and emotional intelligence were both negatively associated with psychological disorders. Stepwise linear regression revealed that the most important predictors of psychological disorders were self-emotion appraisal, family relationships, and showing panic about COVID-19 on the social media. Path analysis suggested that the association between pandemic exposure and psychological disorders was partially mediated by emotional intelligence, but not by social support. Emotional intelligence may mediate the relationship between COVID-19 pandemic exposure and psychological disorders. Psychological interventions fostering emotional intelligence and social support should be implemented among university students to reduce the psychological harm caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Li, Li, Fan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2021.07.018","20210823","COVID-19; Emotional intelligence; Psychological disorders; Social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-24","",17335,""

We found that autistic adults had higher odds of living in a residential facility, receiving in-home services from outside caregivers, having had an avoidable hospitalization, and having a high-risk health condition, compared to neurotypical adults without mental health conditions. Adults with intellectual disability had similar odds of having these conditions. Adults with other mental health conditions were also more likely to live in a residential facility, receive services from outside caregivers, and have had avoidable hospitalizations compared to the neurotypical population without mental health conditions.

Children completed a mental health screening form prior to the pandemic (October 2019) and at two time points during the pandemic (May, August 2020). We examined the impact of SES on mental health changes over time, COVID-19 fears and behaviors, and perceived impact of the pandemic. We also tested whether baseline mental health predicted the impact of COVID-19. Children's fears of illness increased over time, and these effects were independent of race and SES. However, lower SES children reported more fears about social distancing during the pandemic as compared to higher SES children. Lower SES children also reported more internalizing symptoms at baseline, which decreased in this group following stay-at-home orders.

"Effect of passive antibodies derived from rotavirus-like particles on neonatal calf diarrhea caused by rotavirus in an oral challenge model","Our objective was to evaluate the efficacy of bovine rotavirus antigen-specific passive antibody for reducing the duration of diarrhea induced by oral challenge with bovine rotavirus in a neonatal calf model. The bovine rotavirus-specific passive antibodies were produced before the study by hyperimmunization of pregnant cows during the dry period with an adjuvanted vaccine containing recombinantly-expressed rotavirus virus-like particles. Eighty-three calves were cleanly collected at birth and randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups as follows: (1) control group that was colostrum deprived and fed milk replacer for first feeding, (2) group that was colostrum deprived and fed milk replacer mixed with antirotavirus antibodies for first feeding, or (3) group that was fed colostrum replacer mixed with antirotavirus antibodies and a product approved by the US Department of Agriculture containing antibodies against Escherichia coli K99 and bovine coronavirus for first feeding. One of the 3 treatments was administered within 6 h of birth to each calf, followed by oral challenge with bovine rotavirus 3 h later. Calves were observed through 7 d of age and scored according to a standardized scale for clinical signs of diarrhea, change in appetite, depression, and dehydration. Twice daily, measurements of rectal temperature and collection of feces were performed. Fecal samples were assessed for infectious agents commonly associated with diarrhea, and bovine rotavirus shedding was quantified. There were 24 of 28 (86%) calves in the control group that received no antibodies that had signs of severe diarrhea, whereas 57% of the calves that received antirotavirus in milk replacer experienced severe diarrhea, and 7% of calves that received colostrum replacer mixed with antigen-specific bovine rotavirus antibodies showed signs of severe diarrhea. Calves that received colostrum replacer mixed with antigen-specific bovine rotavirus antibodies had a mean duration of 0.9 d of diarrhea compared with 2.7 d in the control group. Calves in the group that was colostrum deprived and fed milk replacer with antirotavirus antibodies had a mean duration of diarrhea of 1.7 d. Rotavirus peak fecal shedding was 3.5 d in the group with milk replacer only, 5.5 d in the milk replacer with antibody group, and 6.5 d in calves in the colostrum replacer group. When bovine rotavirus antigen-specific antibody was fed in milk replacer to colostrum-deprived calves or in conjunction with colostrum replacer that also contained supplemental antibodies against Escherichia coli K99 and bovine coronavirus, those calves were observed to have reduced the onset, duration, and severity of diarrhea when compared with milk replacer placebo.","Bristol, Duhamel, Zinckgraf, Crabb, Nydam","https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2020-19834","20210822","antibodies; calves; diarrhea; passive immunity; rotavirus","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-24","",17339,""
"Internet-based stress recovery intervention FOREST for healthcare staff amid COVID-19 pandemic: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial","The demand for care during the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the mental health of healthcare workers (HCWs), thus increasing the need for psychosocial support services. Internet-based interventions have previously been found to reduce occupational stress. The study aims to test the effects of an Internet-based stress recovery intervention-FOREST-among HCWs. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) parallel group design with three measurement points will be conducted to assess the efficacy of an Internet-based stress recovery intervention FOREST for nurses. The FOREST intervention is a 6-week Internet-based CBT and mindfulness-based program which comprises of six modules: (1) Introduction, (2) Detachment (relaxation and sleep), (3) Distancing, (4) Mastery (challenge), (5) Control, and (6) Keeping the change alive. We will compare the intervention against a waiting list group at pre-test, post-test, and follow-up. Stress recovery, PTSD, complex PTSD, moral injury, the level of stress, depression, anxiety, and psychological well-being will be measured. The study will contribute to the development of mental healthcare programs for the HCWs. Based on the outcomes of the study, the FOREST intervention can be further developed or offered to healthcare staff as a tool to cope with occupational stress. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04817995 .

"Perceived stress and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms among intensive care unit staff caring for severely ill coronavirus disease 2019 patients during the pandemic: a national study","Intensive care unit (ICU) staff have faced unprecedented challenges during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which could significantly affect their mental health and well-being. The present study aimed to investigate perceived stress and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms reported by ICU staff working directly with COVID-19 patients. The Perceived Stress Scale was used to assess perceived stress, the PTSD Diagnostic Scale for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th edition) was used to determine PTSD symptoms, and a sociodemographic questionnaire was used to record different sociodemographic variables. Altogether, 124 participants (57.2% of whom were men) were included in the analysis. The majority of participants perceived working in the ICU with COVID-19 patients as moderately to severely stressful. Moreover, 71.4% of doctors and 74.4% of nurses experienced moderate-to-severe perceived stress. The staff with previous ICU experience were less likely to have a probable diagnosis of PTSD than those without previous ICU experience. Assessing perceived stress levels and PTSD among ICU staff may enhance our understanding of COVID-19-induced mental health challenges. Specific strategies to enhance ICU staff's mental well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic should be employed and monitored regularly. Interventions aimed at alleviating sources of anxiety in a high-stress environment may reduce the likelihood of developing PTSD.","Kader, Elhusein, Chandrappa, Nashwan, Chandra, Khan, Alabdulla","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12991-021-00363-1","20210822","COVID-19; ICU; Nurses; PTSD; Perceived stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-24","",17341,""
"Attitudes and stressors related to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic among emergency medical services workers in Germany: a cross-sectional study","The aim was to investigate attitudes and stressors related to the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak among emergency medical services (EMS) workers in Germany. We further aimed to detect possible changes within a 5-week period and potential determinants of attitudes and stressors. We conducted two cross-sectional studies using an online questionnaire in early April 2020 (i.e., the first peak of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Germany) and five weeks later. The study instrument comprised sociodemographic items, self-devised items on pandemic-related attitudes, stressors and work outcomes, and established instruments assessing depressive symptoms and symptoms of anxiety. Logistic regression was performed to identify possible determinants. Data of 1537 participants was included in the analysis (April: nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1124, May: nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°413, 83.1% male, median age 32). Most participants agreed that their personal risk of infection was higher compared to the general population (April: 87.0% agreement, May: 78.9%). The greatest stressor was uncertainty about the pandemic's temporal scope (82.0 and 80.9%, respectively). Most participants (69.9, 79.7%) felt sufficiently prepared for the pandemic and only few felt burdened by their financial situation (18.8, 13.3%). Agreement to all stressors decreased from April to May except related to the childcare situation. Regression analysis identified subgroups to be burdened more frequently such as older employees, those with SARS-CoV-2 cases among their colleagues, and those with lower paramedic training levels. We identified key SARS-CoV-2-related stressors whose levels generally decreased within a 5-week period. Our results indicate that EMS workers are less affected by existential fears and rather worry about their personal infection risk.","Dreher, Flake, Pietrowsky, Loerbroks","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-021-06779-5","20210822","COVID-19; Cross-sectional study; Emergency medical services workers; Epidemiology; Occupational health; Psychological stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-24","",17342,""
"Developing an explanatory theoretical model for engagement with a web-based mental health platform: results of a mixed methods study","With the growing need for accessible, high-quality mental health services, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been increasing development and uptake of web-based interventions in the form of self-directed mental health platforms. The Big White Wall (BWW) is a web-based platform for people experiencing mental illness and addiction that offers a range of evidence-based self-directed treatment strategies. Drawing on existing data from a large-scale evaluation of the implementation of BWW in Ontario, Canada (which involved a pragmatic randomized controlled trail with an embedded qualitative process evaluation), we sought to investigate the influences on the extent to which people engage with BWW. In this paper we drew on BWW trial participants' usage data (number of logins) and the qualitative data from the process evaluation that explored participants' experiences, engagement with and reactions to BWW. Our results showed that there were highly complex relationships between the influences that contributed to the level of engagement with BWW intervention. We found that a) how people expected to benefit from using a platform like BWW was an important indicator of their future usage, b) moderate perceived symptoms were linked with higher engagement; whereas fewer actual depressive symptoms predicted use and anxiety had a positive linear relationship with usage, and that c) usage depended on positive early experiences with the platform. Our findings suggest that the nature of engagement with platforms such as BWW is not easily predicted. We propose a theoretical framework for explaining the level of user engagement with BWW that might also be generalizable to other similar platforms.","Gordon, Hensel, Bouck, Desveaux, Soobiah, Saragosa, Jeffs, Bhatia, Shaw","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03391-z","20210822","Anxiety; Depression; Digital health; Mental health; Mixed-method; Virtual care; Web-based","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-24","",17343,""
"Physical and mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic among college students who are undocumented or have undocumented parents","The COVID-19 pandemic may have disproportionately affected the mental and physical health of undocumented students and students with undocumented parents. We analyzed primary data from 2111 California college students collected March-June 2020. We estimated the odds of mental or physical health being affected ""a great deal"" by COVID by immigration group and then examined whether this was moderated by campus belonging or resource use. Students with undocumented parents were least likely to report COVID-related mental and physical health effects. Undocumented students and students whose parents have lawful immigration status did not differ in their COVID-related physical and mental health. For all students, more campus resource use and higher campus belonging were associated with negative mental and physical health effects. Negative COVID-related mental and physical health was widespread. Separation from campus-based resources was detrimental during the early stages of the pandemic.","Ro, Rodriguez, Enriquez","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11606-x","20210822","COVID-19; Mixed-status families; Undocumented immigrants; Young adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-24","",17344,""

"Exploring unprecedented problems of academicians during the COVID 19 pandemic and their relationships with fatigue and mental health","This study aimed to explore the unprecedented problems of academicians during the COVID-19 pandemic and investigate the effects of these problems on perceived fatigue and mental health of academicians. A number of academicians were first interviewed and the main problems created by the pandemic were explored. Based on the explored items a questionnaire was developed and using Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) the main components of the questionnaire were extracted. Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory and General Health Questionnaire were used to measure perceived fatigue and mental health. Regression analysis was used to analyze data. A total number of 172 academicians from an Iranian university participated in this study. The use of new technologies for online/offline education, delays in research projects, conflicts with students, and taking care of children were the main concerns of academicians during the pandemic. According to EFA, unprecedented problems of academicians (UPPA) were categorized into two main groups: those related to the university and those related to family. UPPA components affected mental fatigue significantly. However, their effects on physical fatigue were not significant. UPPA components significantly affected all dimensions of mental health. Gender was significantly associated with somatic symptoms and anxiety/insomnia. Academicians have faced new problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. These problems can affect fatigue and mental health among them. Authorities should take actions to remedy these problems.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.genrep.2021.101098","20210601","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-24","",17347,""
