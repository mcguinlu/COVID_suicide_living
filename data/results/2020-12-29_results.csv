"Building Online and Telephone Psychological First Aid Services in a Low Resource Setting During COVID-19: The Case of Kosovo","The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures brought for prevention of infections are associated with considerable psychosocial and psychological morbidity in the general population. Providing continuous mental health services during the pandemics is a challenge worldwide, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This paper reports on the strategies and activities taken to protect public mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in Kosovo. This included establishing online and phone psychological first aid services and developing psychoeducational videos and webinars. The paper concludes with several lessons learned during the process of establishing and maintaining these interventions, such as: initial political endorsement is crucial to gain and maintain the momentum of services; continuous training of volunteers is crucial for both addressing the needs/problems, which arise during the process of work and maintain the motivation of volunteers; promotion of the services is crucial; academic curricula training mental health professionals should include digital mental health related courses and manualization on how to establish this kind of services in midst of crisis is crucial in order to ensure quick operationalization when needed again especially in LMIC settings. The interventions developed provide opportunity for further research especially by evaluating the impact of the services and exploring how online and provision of mental health and psychoeducation services online could help to cover services gap in times of isolation, limited movement and situations similar to pandemics in settings with limited mental health services and resources. The situation with pandemics with COVID 19 is still far from ending. Future waves of infections and restriction could again spike the mental health and psychosocial and psychological strain of the general population, therefore being prepared in provisions of psychological first aid and other mental health services online is crucial.","Arenliu, Uka, Weine","https://doi.org/10.24869/psyd.2020.570","20201228","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-29","",8547,""
"The Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Anxiety Level of Emergency Medical Services Professionals","Healthcare professionals are one of the groups most affected by a pandemic that affects the whole world. This study aimed to determine the anxiety level of emergency medical services professionals in Ankara, Turkey after the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the first part of the survey, the participants of the study were asked about their socio-demographic characteristics and their contact with the COVID-19 patients. In the second part, a survey with 20 questions that determined the state anxiety level derived from the State Anxiety Inventory was performed after obtaining verbal consent. The mean age of the participants was 33.1Ã‚Â±6.9, while 52.7% of all participants were males. In this study, the mean STAI Anxiety Score was 50.7Ã‚Â±11.6. Anxiety scores were higher in females and those who had family members at risk of COVID-19 infection (p&lt;0.05). The majority of those who had family members at risk of the infection started to stay in guesthouses instead of going home. Participants were worried about transmitting the infection to their family members (p&lt;0.05). They felt more anxious when treating COVID-19 diagnosed or other patients (p&lt;0.05). In addition, they thought that their anxiety level increased in general (p&lt;0.05). The COVID-19 pandemic caused an anxiety increase in EMS workers in Turkey. Protecting the physical and mental health of the EMS employees who work at the front line against the COVID-19 pandemic and who have a high risk of infection, and ensuring their efficient work should be the main priority.","Usul, Ã…Å¾an, BekgÃƒÂ¶z","https://doi.org/10.24869/psyd.2020.563","20201228","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-29","",8548,""
"Self-care of Frontline Health Care Workers: During COVID-19 Pandemic","The world is amidst the COVID-19 pandemic that has used social distancing as a tool for containing the virus from spreading exponentially among other individuals. Previous literature suggests that human contact and attachment is a key for well-being which is why punishments like solitary confinement in detention centers like jail has always been debated as being torturous (Wolfendal 2020). With this notion, anxiety and stress may become more prevalent in individuals who experience self-isolation or are under a forced lockdown. For health-care workers like doctors and psychologists, who advocate for physical health, mental health and wellbeing; the challenges might increase during the pandemic phase as they are expected to go through the crises just like others while simultaneously contributing in rendering services related to dealing with physical and psychological health issues present in patients and clients with their continued practice from either on-site or online platforms. Although all health care professional's training inoculates the ill effects of compassion fatigue by other's overwhelming situations and discussions but they might still be prone to vicarious burnout, trauma and stress. Hence, they may become exposed to being at risk of experiencing anxiety more than the general population. This review discusses facets of the importance of self-care as mental health first aid tool for health care professionals including doctors and psychologists using research and supportive techniques to help them process stress and anxiety during and after the global pandemic.","Waris Nawaz, Imtiaz, Kausar","https://doi.org/10.24869/psyd.2020.557","20201228","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-29","",8549,""
"Stress and Anxiety among Healthcare Workers Associated with COVID-19 Pandemic in Russia","Mental health of medical workers treating patients with COVID-19 is an issue of increasing concern worldwide. The available data on stress and anxiety symptoms among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 are relatively limited and have not been evaluated in Russia yet. The cross-sectional anonymous survey included 1,090 healthcare workers. Stress and anxiety symptoms were assessed using Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics - 9 (SAVE-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder - 7 (GAD-7) scales. Logistic regression, Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin two component factor model, Cronbach's alpha and ROC-analysis were performed to determine the influence of different variables, internal structure and consistency, sensitivity and specificity of SAVE-9 compared with GAD-7. The median scores on the GAD-7 and SAVE-9 were 5 and 14, respectively. 535 (49.1%) respondents had moderate and 239 (21.9%) had severe anxiety according to SAVE-9. 134 participants (12.3%) had severe anxiety, 144 (13.2%) had moderate according to GAD-7. The component model revealed two-factor structure of SAVE-9: &quot;anxiety and somatic concern&quot; and &quot;social stress&quot;. Female gender (OR - 0.98, p=0.04) and younger age (OR - 0.65, p=0.04) were associated with higher level of anxiety according to regression model. The total score of SAVE-9 with a high degree of confidence predicted the GAD-7 value in comparative ROC analysis. Healthcare workers in Russia reported high rates of stress and anxiety. The Russian version of the SAVE-9 displayed a good ratio of sensitivity to specificity compared with GAD-7 and can be recommended as a screening instrument for detection of stress and anxiety in healthcare workers.","Mosolova, Chung, Sosin, Mosolov","https://doi.org/10.24869/psyd.2020.549","20201228","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-29","",8550,""
"Mental Health of Psychiatrists and Physicians of Other Specialties in Early COVID-19 Pandemic: Risk ind Protective Factors","Many research has indicated that, during the COVID-19 pandemic, health care workers are under greatly increased pressure and at increased risk for the development of mental health problems. Furthermore, previous research has indicated that psychiatrists are exposed to a number of unique stressors that may increase their risk for poor mental health. The aims of the present study were to assess the level of COVID-19 related concerns, psychological distress and life satisfaction among psychiatrists and other physicians during the first period of the pandemic and to examine whether individual differences in COVID-19 concerns, psychological flexibility, psychological resilience and coping behaviors account for differences in mental health indicators. The sample consisted of N=725 physicians, among whom 22.8% were psychiatrists. This study was conducted online during the first lockdown in Croatia and collected data regarding COVID-19 related concerns, coping behaviors and mental health indicators (Psychological Distress and Life Satisfaction). Physicians of other specialties had higher scores on a measure of COVID-19 anxiety than psychiatrists (p=0.012). In addition, a number of differences in coping behaviors are evident. Specifically, psychiatrists were less likely than physicians of other specializations to believe that being informed about COVID-19 is an effective coping strategy (p=0.013), but more prone to using sedatives and drugs as a coping strategy (p=0.002; p=0.037). Psychiatrists are at special risk for substance abuse. Younger age, psychological inflexibility, low resilience and greater COVID-19 concerns might act as specific risk factors for distress. Our findings highlight the need for promoting a healthy lifestyle and psychological flexibility as universal protective factors.","JokiÃ„â€¡-BegiÃ„â€¡, Lauri Korajlija, BegiÃ„â€¡","https://doi.org/10.24869/psyd.2020.536","20201228","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-29","",8551,""
"Peer Education Intervention on Adolescents' Anxiety, Depression, and Sleep Disorder during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Adolescents' anxiety and depression during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic outbreak cannot be ignored. In public health crisis events, adolescents are prone to negative psychological problems, such as anxiety and depression. Hence, this research focuses on the use of reasonable and efficient methods to intervene in adolescents' psychological problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. From February to April 2020, we conducted an anonymous online survey on a total of 1,200 adolescents in the provinces of Hunan and Guangxi in China. Moreover, we randomly divided a total of 150 middle school students with anxiety scores greater than 50 and volunteered to participate in the intervention experiment into control and intervention groups, with 75 members in each group. On the basis of the proposed routine treatment, we conducted 8 weeks of model 328-based peer education intervention in the intervention group. After the intervention, the self-rating anxiety scale scores (SAS) of the intervention group are better than those of the control group (P&lt;0.001). Moreover, the self-rating depression scale (SDS) scores of both groups are reduced, but the effect is more significant on the intervention group (P&lt;0.001) than on the control group. Finally, the total Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) scores of both groups are reduced, but the effect is more significant on the intervention group than on the control group (P=0.001 and &lt;0.001, respectively). Model 328-based peer education intervention can significantly reduce the level of anxiety and depression in adolescents and improve their sleep quality.","Ding, Yao","https://doi.org/10.24869/psyd.2020.527","20201228","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-29","",8552,""
"Anxiety and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms in Pregnant Women during the COVID-19 Pandemic's Delay Phase","The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic emerged in Wuhan, China and has spread all over the world and affected global mental health. Pregnant women may be particularly vulnerable and experience high levels of distress during an infectious disease outbreak. The aim of this study was to determine anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sectional study surveyed a total of 283 pregnant women within the period of May 11 to May 28,2020. During their regular antenatal visit, pregnant women were invited to participate in the study. The self-created personal information form was used to assess the main characteristics of the participants. Anxiety and PTSD symptoms of the pregnant women were measured by the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R), respectively. The mean age of the pregnant women was 29.20Ã‚Â±5.55 years. Regarding gestational age, 72 (25.4%), 86 (30.4) and 125 (44.2) were in the first, second and third trimesters, respectively. The mean gestational age was 23.82Ã‚Â±11.05 weeks. The mean STAI-S and STAI-T scores were 39.52Ã‚Â±10.56 within the cut-off value (39-40) of the instrument and 42.74Ã‚Â±8.33, respectively. Furthermore, the mean total IES-R score was 36.60Ã‚Â±15.65 within the cut-off value (24) of the instrument. Multiple regression analysis revealed that pregnancy complication (p=0.01) and employment status of husband (p=0.04) were the best predictors of state anxiety. Additionally, the presence of COVID-19-related symptoms (p=0.01) and educational level (p=0.01) were found to predict PTSD symptoms. Pregnant women would be likely to experience high levels of anxiety and PTSD symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic's delay phase. The results should sensitize the medical team to increased anxiety and PTDS symptoms of the pregnant women in order to prevent negative outcomes for women and their fetuses.","Hocaoglu, Ayaz, Gunay, Akin, Turgut, Karateke","https://doi.org/10.24869/psyd.2020.521","20201228","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-29","",8553,""
"Health Anxiety and Emotion Regulation during the Period of COVID-19 Outbreak in Turkey","The process of COVID-19 outbreak has affected Turkey as it has affected the whole world. The purpose of the current study is to investigate individuals' health anxiety and emotion regulation during the period of COVID-19 outbreak in Turkey in relation to some variables. The study also aims to explore the relationship between emotion regulation and health anxiety. The study was conducted on 874 individuals reached online through the google e-forms. The participants were administered the &quot;Health Anxiety Scale and Emotion Regulation Scale&quot; to collect data. In the analysis of the collected data, Mann- Whitney U Test, Kruskal Wallis-H Test, Spearman Correlation Coefficient were used. In the current study, healthy anxiety scores of the participants were analyzed depending on some variables. Health anxiety was found to be higher in women, 18-30 age group, singles, students, and groups with physical and mental health problems. The research also found that there is a low and negative relationship between health anxiety and cognitive reappraisal. It is understood that men's suppression scores are higher than women. There is no significant difference between suppressing emotions and health anxiety. It was found that educators received the highest scores in terms of cognitive reappraisal. The cognitive reappraisal level of the group without mental disorder was found to be higher than the other group. According to the results of the research, more supportive services should be provided for the groups with the higher health anxiety. Considering that especially students and young people are affected more, it can be said that mental health preventive services should be included more in these groups. At the same time, the fact that men have higher emotion suppression scores than women shows that this situation should also be taken into consideration in mental health services.","CanlÃ„Â±, KaraÃ…Å¸ar","https://doi.org/10.24869/psyd.2020.513","20201228","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-29","",8554,""

"The Impact of Coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) Epidemic on Individuals Mental Health: The Protective Measures of Pakistan in Managing and Sustaining Transmissible Disease","This study performed a focalized examination of the global impact of the coronavirus epidemic. This current review is one of the few kinds of research, which has sought to check the effect of the coronavirus on mental health issues and the need for psychological well-being in the standard population and patients in response to the global wake of the epidemic and its effects in Pakistan. This study has utilized the data on coronavirus patients from the Ministry of Health, National Institute of Health Pakistan. The age of the confirmed coronavirus patients ranged from 12 to over 80 years, including international and local transmitters. Recorded data delivered by the National Institute of Health, Pakistan has quantified that the outbreak of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) entered Pakistan through international travelers. They carried the virus after they visited different countries, such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, the USA, China, and European countries. By April 30, 2020, there were 16,473 confirmed cases of coronavirus. Total deaths are 361, with a mortality rate of 2.20%, and ultimately recovered cases reported 4,105 with a percentage of 24.90%. As of October 24, 2020, there were 327,063 confirmed cases of the COVID-19 in Pakistan, which posed vast social, economic, health, and environmental problems in the society. The epidemic has affected individuals across the country and confirmed patients in the country increased rapidly. The government officials had initially estimated over 50,000 corona patents by April 30, which would be a great challenge; however, the situation remained under control because of suppression and smart-lockdown strategies by the Government.

The most important arena that require significant changes have been divided into four categories. First of all, the high mental health issues and low mental health services in Pakistan are not sufficient to control the mental health problem ratio. There is a need to develop more mental health services with trans-formative changes to mitigate the obnoxious post-pandemic effects. Secondly, the implementation of online therapeutic interventions must be available prior or after pandemic situation. Thirdly, as the pharmacy and mental health services in Pakistan are not capable to meet the international standards to provide patient care. Therefore, the advanced researchers are needed to investigate the fractures and gaps in social, economic and health care systems.

"A text-messaging study to help cope with social distancing: clinical trial protocol for the Stay Well at Home study","Social distancing is a crucial intervention to slow down person-to-person transmission of COVID-19. However, social distancing has negative consequences including increases in depression and anxiety. Digital interventions, like text-messaging, can provide accessible support on a population wide scale. We developed text messages in English and Spanish to help individuals manage their depressive mood and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. In a two-arm randomized controlled trial we aim to examine the effect of our 60 days text-messaging intervention. Additionally, we aim to assess if the use of machine learning to adapt the messaging frequency and content improves the effectiveness of the intervention. Finally, we will examine the differences in daily mood ratings between the message categories and time windows. The messages are designed within two different categories: behavioral activation and coping skills. Participants will be randomized into 1) a random messaging arm, where message category and timing will be chosen with equal probabilities, and 2) a reinforcement-learning arm, with a learned decision mechanism for choosing the messages. Participants in both arms will receive one message per day within three different time windows and will be asked to provide their mood rating 3 hours later. We will compare self-reported daily mood ratings, self-reported Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale 8-item (PHQ-8) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) at baseline and at intervention completion.

We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, and World Health Organization COVID-19 databases (Dec 2019-15 July 2020). We included cross-sectional studies that reported factors associated with psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Primary outcomes were self-reported symptoms of anxiety and depression. Random-effects models were used to pool odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (#CRD42020186735). We included 68 studies comprising 288,830 participants from 19 countries. The prevalence of anxiety and depression was 33% (95% CI: 28%-39%) and 30% (26%-36%). Women versus men (OR: 1.48 [95% CI: 1.29-1.71; I2 = 90.8%]), younger versus older (&lt; versus Ã¢â€°Â¥35 years) adults (1.20 [1.13-1.26]; I2 = 91.7%), living in rural versus urban areas (1.13 [1.00-1.29]; I2 = 82.9%), lower versus higher socioeconomic status (e.g. lower versus higher income: 1.45 [1.24-1.69; I2 = 82.3%]) were associated with higher anxiety odds. These factors (except for residential area) were also associated with higher depression odds. Furthermore, higher COVID-19 infection risk (suspected/confirmed cases, living in hard-hit areas, having pre-existing physical or mental conditions) and longer media exposure were associated with higher odds of anxiety and depression.

"The Influence of Forced Social Isolation on the Auditory Ecology and Psychosocial Functions of Listeners With Cochlear Implants During COVID-19 Mitigation Efforts","The impact of social distancing on communication and psychosocial variables among individuals with hearing impairment during COVID-19 pandemic. It was our concern that patients who already found themselves socially isolated (Wie et al. 2010) as a result of their hearing loss would be perhaps more susceptible to changes in their communication habits resulting in further social isolation, anxiety, and depression. We wanted to better understand how forced social isolation (as part of COVID-19 mitigation) effected a group of individuals with hearing impairment from an auditory ecology and psychosocial perspective. We hypothesized that the listening environments would be different as a result of social isolation when comparing subject's responses regarding activities and participation before COVID-19 and during the COVID-19 pandemic. This change would lead to an increase in experienced and perceived social isolation, anxiety, and depression. A total of 48 adults with at least 12 months of cochlear implant (CI) experience reported their listening contexts and experiences pre-COVID and during-COVID using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA; methodology collecting a respondent's self-reports in their natural environments) through a smartphone-based app, and six paper and pencil questionnaires. The Smartphone app and paper-pencil questionnaires address topics related to their listening environment, social isolation, depression, anxiety, lifestyle and demand, loneliness, and satisfaction with amplification. Data from these two-time points were compared to better understand the effects of social distancing on the CI recipients' communication abilities. EMA demonstrated that during-COVID CI recipients were more likely to stay home or be outdoors. CI recipients reported that they were less likely to stay indoors outside of their home relative to the pre-COVID condition. Social distancing also had a significant effect on the overall signal-to-noise ratio of the environments indicating that the listening environments had better signal-to-noise ratios. CI recipients also reported better speech understanding, less listening effort, less activity limitation due to hearing loss, less social isolation due to hearing loss, and less anxiety due to hearing loss. Retrospective questionnaires indicated that social distancing had a significant effect on the social network size, participant's personal image of themselves, and overall loneliness. Overall, EMA provided us with a glimpse of the effect that forced social isolation has had on the listening environments and psychosocial perspectives of a select number of CI listeners. CI participants in this study reported that they were spending more time at home in a quieter environments during-COVID. Contrary to our hypothesis, CI recipients overall felt less socially isolated and reported less anxiety resulting from their hearing difficulties during-COVID in comparison to pre-COVID. This, perhaps, implies that having a more controlled environment with fewer speakers provided a more relaxing listening experience.","Dunn, Stangl, Oleson, Smith, Chipara, Wu","https://doi.org/10.1097/AUD.0000000000000991","20201228","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-29","",8564,""
"[Effects of wearing a mask on oxygenation of subjects with spontaneous breathing during supplementary oxygen through facemask]","During the COVID-19 epidemic, our national guidelines have suggested that surgical patients should wear a mask to decrease the potential transmission of COVID-19 in the operating room, as long as the condition allows. However, so far, there is no study to discuss the influence of wearing a mask on the ventilation and blood oxygenation status in patients of spontaneous breathing with supplementary oxygen through an anesthetic facemask. This is a before-after study in the same patient, and 10 healthy volunteers were recruited, by testing the arterial blood gas parameters at key time points before and after oxygen inhalation to evaluate the effects of two different supplementary oxygen methods ('disposable medical mask + anesthetic facemask' and 'anesthetic facemask only') on the oxygenation of subjects. Our data demonstrated whether wearing a disposable medical mask or not could effectively increase the oxygen supply of the subjects compared with the basic value before oxygen inhalation; however, compared with the group without mask, the arterial oxygen partial (PaO <sub>2</sub>) reduced significantly at each time points when subjects wearing a disposable medical mask. There was no significant difference in other parameters, and our data showed that age growth and smoking had no significant effects on the difference of PaO <sub>2</sub> between the groups with and without masks. This study demonstrates effective oxygen supplementation through anesthetic facemask in subjects with spontaneous breathing who is wearing a disposable medical mask, whose pulse oxygen saturation and arterial oxygen saturation can reach 100% rapidly, and this provides a theoretical basis for the management of patients with disseminated respiratory diseases to wear masks in the operating room; however, the rate and amount of PaO <sub>2</sub> increase are both decreased as compared to those who is not wearing a disposable medical mask during supplementary oxygenation. Whether this difference will affect the clinical outcome needs further study.

"Mental health shame, self-compassion and sleep in UK nursing students: Complete mediation of self-compassion in sleep and mental health","To explore relationships between mental health problems, mental health shame, self-compassion and average length of sleep in UK nursing students. The increasing mental health problems in nursing students may be related to a strong sense of shame they experience for having a mental health problem. Self-compassion has been identified as a protective factor for mental health and shame in other student populations. Further, studies highlight the importance of sleep relating to mental health. A cross-sectional design. A convenient sampling of 182 nursing students at a university in the East Midlands completed a paper-based questionnaire regarding these four constructs, from February to April 2019. Correlation, regression and mediation analyses were conducted. Mental health problems were positively related to shame and negatively related to self-compassion and sleep. Mental health shame positively predicted and self-compassion negatively predicted mental health problems: sleep was not a significant predictor of mental health problems. Lastly, self-compassion completely mediated the impacts of sleep on mental health problems (negative relationship between mental health problems and sleep was fully explained by self-compassion). The importance of self-compassion was highlighted as it can reduce mental health problems and shame. Self-compassion can protect nursing students from mental distress when they are sleep deprived. Nurses and nursing students are required to work irregular hours (e.g. COVID-19) and mental distress can cause serious consequences in clinical practice. Our findings suggest that nurturing self-compassion can protect their mental health and the negative impacts of sleep deprivation on mental health.","Kotera, Cockerill, Chircop, Forman","https://doi.org/10.1002/nop2.749","20201228","mediation analysis; mental health; mental health shame; nursing students; self-care; self-compassion; sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-29","",8567,""
"Perceived stress and social support in a large population of people with Multiple Sclerosis recruited online through COVID 19 pandemic","The COVID-19 emergency may cause post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and as concerns people with MS (pwMS) chronic exposure to a wide range of challenging life events has shown to be correlated with worsening of neurological symptoms, increased lesion burden on brain MRI and relapses. The aim was to investigate perceived stress, depression, perceived social support, habits, and behavior changes in pwMS through COVID19 in comparison to control people. A web-based survey was posted on SMsocialnetwork.com to investigate perceived stress (using Perceived Stress Scale), depression (with PHQ-2), and perceived social support (using Social Provision Scale-10 item) in pwMS and control group through COVID 19 pandemic. A secondary group of people with migraine has been investigated. 1286 answers from 612 pwMS and 674 control people were included in the final analysis. The answers from 318 people with migraine have been included for a secondary analysis. A higher proportion of pwMS were depressed (43.1% vs 23.1%; p&lt;0.001), had high level of perceived stress (58% vs 39.8%; p&lt;0.001) and felt significantly less social support (median 33 vs 35; Q1-Q3 28-36 vs 32-37; p&lt;0.001).) compared to the control group. A higher percentage of people with migraine were depressed (50% vs 43%, p=0.04) compared to pwMS.

We also recruited through the University of Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and other health care systems around Pittsburgh. The primary outcomes were clinically significant depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, suicidal ideation or behavior, and grief reactions since COVID-19. Adolescents were significantly more likely to report moderate to severe symptoms of depression (55% vs. 29%; Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°122, dfÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), anxiety (48% vs. 29%; Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°73; dfÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), PTSD (45% vs. 33%; Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°12; df = 1; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), suicidal ideation or behavior (38% vs. 16%; Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°117; dfÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), and sleep problems (69% vs. 57%; Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°26; dfÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) compared to adults. The rates of intense grief reactions among those who lost someone to COVID-19 was 55%. Loneliness was the most common predictor across outcomes and higher number of hours spent on social media and exposure to media about COVID-19 predicted depression symptoms and suicidal ideation or behavior in adolescents.

"PREDICTING OUTCOMES AND SUDDEN GAINS FROM INITIAL IN-SESSION INTERACTIONS DURING REMOTE COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY FOR SEVERE HEALTH ANXIETY","There has been a dramatic increase in remote psychotherapy since the onset of the COVID-19 crisis. There is also expected to be an increase in mental health problems in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. An increase in severe health anxiety (SHA) is particularly anticipated, for which Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is a frontline treatment. However, it is unclear what interaction-types are associated with outcome-improvement in remote-CBT (rCBT) for SHA. This study aimed to identify interaction-types that predict outcomes and sudden gains in rCBT for SHA using initial therapy session content. Forty-eight participants in rCBT for SHA had interactions at their first sessions categorized and rated in terms of patient activation: An individual's confidence and ability to manage their health. Multilevel modelling assessed whether early interaction-types predicted session-by-session wellbeing. For participants experiencing sudden gains (n = 12) interactions at the session directly prior to the gain were similarly categorised and rated. The scores were then compared to ratings for the preceding session. A smaller proportion of early sessions was taken up with problem descriptions amongst those with greater outcome-improvements. There was also a significant reduction in the proportion of the session spent describing problems in the session directly prior to a sudden gain, as compared to the previous session. Conversely, clients with better outcomes made more positive evaluations of themselves and therapy, noticed more positive changes, and made more contributions to structuring interactions at initial sessions. Conclusion. Specific early interaction-types predict session-by-session outcomes and precede sudden gains in rCBT for SHA.","Malins, Moghaddam, Morriss, SchrÃƒÂ¶der, Brown, Boycott","https://doi.org/10.1002/cpp.2543","20201228","Cognitive Behavioral Therapy; health anxiety; interaction-style; patient activation; sudden gains; video therapy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-29","",8570,""
"Psychiatric Symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak in Older Adults with Bipolar Disorder","Older adults with bipolar disorder (OABD) are vulnerable for a COVID-19 infection via multiple pathways. It is essential for OABD to adhere to the COVID-19 measures, with potential consequences for the psychiatric symptoms. This situation offers the unique opportunity to investigate factors of vulnerability and resilience that are associated with psychiatric symptoms in OABD. This study included 81 OABD patients aged over 50 years. Factors measured at baseline in patients that participated in 2017/18 were compared with factors measured during the COVID-19 outbreak. Participants experienced less psychiatric symptoms during COVID-19 than (67.9% euthymic) than at baseline (40.7% euthymic). There was no difference in loneliness between COVID-19 and baseline. Not having children, more feelings of loneliness, lower mastery, passive coping style and neuroticism were associated with more psychiatric symptoms during COVID-19 measures. Participants experienced less psychiatric symptoms during COVID-19 measures when compared to baseline. Our results indicate promising targets for psychological interventions aimed at curing and preventing recurrence in OABD and improving quality of life in this growing vulnerable group.

"Editorial Perspective: Rethinking child and adolescent mental health care after COVID-19","While COVID-19 pandemic has allegedly passed its first peak in most western countries, health systems are progressively adapting to the 'new normality'. In child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS), such organizational envisioning is needed to cope with the foreseeable psychological effects of prolonged social isolation induced by nation-wide public health measures such as school closure. CAMHS need to ensure flexible responses to the psychopathological consequences of evolving societal dynamics, as dramatically actualized by the unexpected COVID-19 pandemic. This would imply (a) shifting the focus of intervention from symptom reduction and containment of acute crises in a comparatively small number of severe cases to a broader preventive strategy, guided by a gradient of increasing intensity and specificity of treatment; (b) promoting smooth access pathways into services and encouraging participation of families; (c) adopting a transdiagnostic staging model to capture the developmental fluctuations from subsyndromal to syndromal states and back, with related changes in the intensity of the need of care; and (d) implementing digital tools to encourage help-seeking and compliance by digitally native youth.","Raballo, Poletti, Valmaggia, McGorry","https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpp.13371","20201228","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-29","",8573,""
"&quot;School of hard knocks&quot; - what can mental health researchers learn from the COVID-19 crisis?","Since the COVID-19 pandemic took hold in the first quarter of 2020, children and their families across the world have experienced extraordinary changes to the way they live their lives - creating enormous practical and psychological challenges for them at many levels. While some of these effects are directly linked to COVID-related morbidity and mortality, many are indirect - due rather to governmental public health responses designed to slow the spread of infection and minimise the numbers of deaths. These have often involved aggressive programmes of social distancing and quarantine, including extended periods of national social and economic lockdown, unprecedented in the modern age. Debates about the appropriateness of these measures have often referenced their potentially negative impact on people's mental health and well-being - impacts which both opponents and advocates appear to accept as being inevitable.","Sonuga-Barke","https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpp.13364","20201228","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-29","",8574,""
"Giving birth during the COVID-19 pandemic: The impact on birth satisfaction and postpartum depression","The objective of this study was to understand how giving birth during the COVID-19 pandemic affected women based on birth parameters (gestational age, type of birth and body weight at birth), satisfaction with childbirth, and development of postpartum depression. This is a cross-sectional study of 162 Spanish women. They were divided into two groups: those who gave birth before the pandemic (n = 82; from 1 September 2019 to 1 March 2020) and during the pandemic (n = 75; from 1 April 2020 to 1 July 2020). They were assessed using psychological instruments for postpartum childbirth satisfaction and postpartum depression. It was found that women who gave birth during the pandemic suffered higher levels of stress during childbirth (U = 2652.50; p = .040) and gave a worse rating of the quality of care received (U = 2703.50; p = .041). In addition, the percentage of postpartum depression was much higher in women who gave birth during the pandemic (ÃªÂ­â€œ<sup>2</sup> = 4.31; p = .038).

"Psychological and Behavioral Impact of Lockdown and Quarantine Measures for COVID-19 Pandemic on Children, Adolescents and Caregivers: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","During the current ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, psychological problems like anxiety, depression, irritability, mood swings, inattention and sleep disturbance are fairly common among quarantined children in several studies. A systematic review of these publications to provide an accurate burden of these psychiatric/behavioral problems is needed for planning mitigating measures by the health authorities. Different electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, CENTRAL, medRxiv and bioRxiv) were searched for articles describing psychological/behavioral complications in children/adolescents with/without pre-existing behavioral abnormalities and their caregivers related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Only original articles with/without comparator arms and a minimum sample size of 50 were included in the analysis. The pooled estimate of various psychological/behavioral problems was calculated using a random-effect meta-analysis. Fifteen studies describing 22Ã‚Â 996 children/adolescents fulfilled the eligibility criteria from a total of 219 records. Overall, 34.5%, 41.7%, 42.3% and 30.8% of children were found to be suffering from anxiety, depression, irritability and inattention. Although the behavior/psychological state of a total of 79.4% of children was affected negatively by the pandemic and quarantine, at least 22.5% of children had a significant fear of COVID-19, and 35.2% and 21.3% of children had boredom and sleep disturbance. Similarly, 52.3% and 27.4% of caregivers developed anxiety and depression, respectively, while being in isolation with children. Anxiety, depression, irritability, boredom, inattention and fear of COVID-19 are predominant new-onset psychological problems in children during the COVID-19 pandemic. Children with pre-existing behavioral problems like autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder have a high probability of worsening of their behavioral symptoms.","Panda, Gupta, Chowdhury, Kumar, Meena, Madaan, Sharawat, Gulati","https://doi.org/10.1093/tropej/fmaa122","20201228","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; behavioral problems; child psychology; neuropsychiatric features","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-29","",8577,""

We aimed to study whether there is risk of incident depression, suicidal ideation or psychosis associated with HCQ as used for RA. We performed a new-user cohort study using claims and electronic medical records from 10 sources and 3 countries (Germany, UK and USA). RA patients Ã¢â€°Â¥18Ã¢â‚¬â€°years of age and initiating HCQ were compared with those initiating SSZ (active comparator) and followed up in the short (30Ã¢â‚¬â€°days) and long term (on treatment). Study outcomes included depression, suicide/suicidal ideation and hospitalization for psychosis. Propensity score stratification and calibration using negative control outcomes were used to address confounding.

Emotional distress included depression and anxiety symptoms. COVID-19 stressors included current and expected income, housing, healthcare, and food insecurities. Older persons of color reported higher rates of stressors and emotional distress than their White counterparts. In relation to current stressors, older Black persons responded with less emotional distress and older Latino persons responded with more emotional distress than older White persons. In addition, older persons of color were more likely to expect future resource losses related to COVID-19, and the association between these expectations and emotional distress varied by race-ethnic group. The findings reflected the disproportionate negative impact of COVID-19 stressors on emotional distress among older persons of color, providing a baseline for future studies to further examine the impacts of the pandemic among diverse older adult populations.","Bui, Peng, Mutchler, Burr","https://doi.org/10.1093/geront/gnaa217","20201228"," Household Pulse Survey ; anxiety; depression; stress; vulnerable populations","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-29","",8580,""
"Psychological impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on the university students in Egypt","University students are at elevated risk for mental health problems. The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent public health measures taken to combat it burdened the students' life with additional dramatic psychological impacts. The aim of this study was to investigate the psychological impacts that affected the university students in Egypt during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online survey was sent to the Egyptian university students via all means of online communication during the first week of May 2020 by using a non-probability snowball sampling. A survey included a short version Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) and socio-demographic data. Overall, 70.5, 53.6 and 47.8% of Egyptian students had depression, anxiety and stress, respectively. Being a female, having a relative or acquaintance infected with COVID-19, having a preexisting chronic disease and lacking of psychological support from families, community and universities increase the risk of depression, anxiety and stress among Egyptian students. Being a medical student is associated with depression while, spending more time to follow news of COVID-19 pandemic is associated with increased anxiety. Egyptian students experience varying levels of psychological disturbance during COVID-19 pandemic. This study suggests that mental health of the university students should be carefully, monitored during the crisis and the universities should provide psychological-oriented services, adapted to these circumstances to mitigate its emotional impact on the students.","Ghazawy, Ewis, Mahfouz, Khalil, Arafa, Mohammed, Mohammed, Hassan, Abdel Hamid, Ewis, Mohammed","https://doi.org/10.1093/heapro/daaa147","20201228","COVID-19; Egypt; psychological impacts; university students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-29","",8581,""
"Thyroid Hormone Changes in Early Pregnancy Along With the COVID-19 Pandemic","COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) was first reported in December 2019 and quickly swept across China and around the world. Levels of anxiety and depression were increased among pregnant women during this infectious pandemic. Thyroid function is altered during stressful experiences, and any abnormality during early pregnancy may significantly affect fetal development and pregnancy outcomes. This study aimed to determine whether the COVID-19 pandemic induces thyroid hormone changes in early pregnant women. This study comprised two groups of pregnant women in Shanghai in their first trimester - those pregnant women before the COVID-19 outbreak from January 20, 2019, to March 31, 2019 (Group 1) and those pregnant during the COVID-19 outbreak from January 20, 2020, to March 31, 2020 (Group 2). All women were included if they had early pregnancy thyrotropin (TSH), free triiodothyronine (FT3), free thyroxine (FT4), total triiodothyronine (TT3), and total thyroxine (TT4) concentrations, thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibody or thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb) available and did not have a history of thyroid diseases or received thyroid treatment before or during pregnancy. We used propensity score matching to form a cohort in which patients had similar baseline characteristics. Among 3338 eligible pregnant women, 727 women in Group 1 and 727 in Group 2 had similar propensity scores and were included in the analyses. Pregnant women in Group 2 had significantly higher FT3 (5.7 vs. 5.2 pmol/L, P&lt;0.001) and lower FT4 (12.8 vs. 13.2 pmol/L, P&lt;0.001) concentrations compared with those in Group 1.

"Where Did All the Sport Go? Negative Impact of COVID-19 Lockdown on Life-Spheres and Mental Health of Spanish Young Athletes","During the 2020, the pandemic caused by the massive spread of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (COVID-19) resulted in a global crisis. In Spain, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a lockdown for almost 100 days and forced the sudden stop of sport practices and competitions. This interruption had a negative impact on high-level athletes' mental health. However, its impact on young athletes, who are intrinsically developing a high-demanding dual career, remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed at (1) describing and characterizing the general impact that COVID-19 lockdown had on Spanish young athletes' life-spheres and mental health, and (2) identifying different profiles of athletes regarding life-conditions and sport-related variables. A sample of 544 young athletes (<i>M</i> = 15.9; <i>SD</i> = 1.51) participated in this study. Measures included life-conditions and sport-related information along with the Holistic Monitoring Questionnaire (HMQ) and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). After the screening and description of the data, profiles were defined using a two-level cluster analysis using HMQ and GHQ-12 subscales. We explored differences in demographic and sports information between profiles using MANOVA and subsequent ANOVA. Results suggest a general negative impact of COVID-19 on young athletes' life-spheres and mental health, but with three different clusters regarding the degree of such impact. Cluster 1 grouped the 54.78% of the sample and exhibited a low negative impact of COVID-19 lockdown on life-spheres and few mental health issues. Cluster 2 grouped a 29.96% of the participants who reported a medium negative impact on life-spheres and moderate mental health issues. Cluster 3 represented 15.26% of the sample including participants who showed a high negative impact of the COVID-19 lockdown with high mental health issues. The paradigmatic participant in this third group would be a female student-athlete from a medium or low socioeconomic status with high academic demands and poor or inexistent training conditions during lockdown. Current findings emphasize the need to pay attention to young athletes' mental health and suggest possible influencing contextual variables. We suggest some applied recommendations aimed at helping clubs and sports institutions to mitigate the negative effects of such difficult circumstances on athletes' mental health.","Pons, Ramis, Alcaraz, Jordana, Borrueco, Torregrossa","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.611872","20201228","SARS-CoV-2; adolescent; cluster analysis; holistic approach; student-athletes; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-29","",8583,""
"Bibliotherapy: Reading OVID During COVID","An epidemic of an infectious disease such as COVID-19 is often a source of emotional distress, even among those who have not been directly exposed to the disease. The period following the acute phase of the coronavirus epidemic and the mitigation measures will likely be hardest for medical professionals in terms of psychological impact. Bibliotherapy is a systematic intervention regarding the use of carefully selected reading materials in order to help persons to cope with stress and personal problems. This therapy can be used easily during the pandemic. The review of evidence shows that this kind of intervention can be helpful in educational and clinical contexts. During the crisis, it can be an alternative to video and film entertainment and a transition from serious medical journal clubs to a softer medical humanities experience. In this article, we summarized the historical background of bibliotherapy. We also proposed a reading list from different times, and cultures relating to pandemic, quarantine, symptoms, confinement, and social impacts (e.g., Camus, Moravia, London, Le Clezio etc.). Bibliotherapy can be a way for doctors and healthcare workers fighting on the frontline of the pandemic to find psychological support and for debriefing. Bibliotherapy can help individuals that need support for emotional distress during the pandemic to verbalize their feelings and emotions and identify new ways of addressing problems.","Stip, Ãƒâ€“stlundh, Abdel Aziz","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.567539","20201228","bibliotherapy; depression; medical literature; pandemic (COVID-19); psychotherapy; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-29","",8584,""
"Moving More and Sitting Less as Healthy Lifestyle Behaviors are Protective Factors for Insomnia, Depression, and Anxiety Among Adolescents During the COVID-19 Pandemic","This study aimed to investigate associations of physical activity time (PAT) and sitting time (ST) independently and jointly with insomnia, depressive and anxiety symptoms among Chinese adolescents in the context of COVID-19. A cross-sectional study including 965 adolescents (mean age = 15.26, SD = 0.46) was conducted in May 2020. PAT, ST and the symptoms of insomnia, depression and anxiety were assessed with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form, the Youth Self-Rating Insomnia Scales, the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale via an online survey platform. Logistic regression was used to analyze the association between COVID-19-related fear, PAT, ST and combinations of PAT and ST with insomnia, depressive and anxiety symptoms. COVID-19-related fear was associated with higher odds of insomnia, depressive and anxiety symptoms. PAT was associated with lower odds of insomnia and depressive symptoms, while ST was associated with higher odds of these three symptoms. After combining PAT and ST, the group with both low PAT and high ST was set as the referent. For insomnia, groups with low ST reported significantly lower odds of symptoms. For depression, groups with high PAT and/or low ST reported lower odds of symptoms. Regarding anxiety, only the group with both high PAT and low ST reported lower odds of symptoms. Generally, group with both high PAT and low ST reported lower odds of the three symptoms than the referent. COVID-19-related fear was a risk factor for developing insomnia, depressive and anxiety symptoms among Chinese adolescents. Fortunately, moving more and sitting less were good for sleep and mental health in Chinese adolescents during the pandemic. Educators should help adolescents to be more physically active in their daily life in the primary prevention of adolescent insomnia, depression and anxiety.","Lu, Chi, Liang, Chen, Huang, Guo, Jiao, Yu, Veronese, Soares, Grabovac, Yeung, Zou","https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S284103","20201228","exercise; mental health; physical activity; sedentary behavior; sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-29","",8585,""

Although a review of the literature shows that digital technology overuse in youth represents an important topic to be studied itself (during the pandemic and afterwards), the present work also takes into account findings from Affective Neuroscience Theory (ANT). An investigation of digital overuse while the COVID-19 pandemic (and beyond) against the background of ANT calls for a shift of perspective in research, at least as an important supplement to research efforts querying the actual nature of digital overuse. In the present work, we argue that it is high time to more comprehensively address why children spend too much time with screens and to also highlight the <i>indirect</i> media effects of screen time use (e.g. less mammalian rough and tumble PLAY time outside and elevated SADNESS due to parental neglect).

"Psychological Typhoon Eye Effect During the COVID-19 Outbreak","<b>Background:</b> The COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei, has brought serious consequences to the lives and mental health of people and has induced psychological stress and affected behavior. <b>Methods:</b> This study used self-designed questionnaires and SPSS to analyze the psychological and behavioral responses of people in different regions during the COVID-19 pandemic and to check for the presence of &quot;psychological typhoon eye&quot; (PTE) effects. The questionnaires adopted three measurement subscales, namely, the risk cognitive subscale, stress response subscale, and behavioral response subscale, and these were administered online (www.wjx.cn) to investigate the psychological and behavioral conduct of respondents from three areas that have been affected by COVID-19 to varying degrees. Exploratory factor analysis and principal component analysis were conducted to explore the factorial structure of these subscales, and confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to explore the structural validity of the questionnaires. The analysis results were used to build a revised 18-item questionnaire which validity was evaluated via ANOVA and LSD. <b>Results:</b> Results confirm the presence of PTE in the research areas during the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak and highlight some significant differences in the cognition and emotions of the residents in these areas.

The residents of those areas worst hit by the pandemic, who may not have taken the situation seriously, require emotional guidance the most. Meanwhile, the residents of other areas, who showed the most negative psychological reactions to the pandemic, require a sense of security, a timely &quot;disconnection&quot; from negative information, an accurate cognition of stress, and an acceptance of self-responses.","Wang, Zhang, Xie, Wang, Lei, Bian, Huang, Zhang, Cao, Luo, Luo, Xiao","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.550051","20201228","COVID-19 epidemic; mental health intervention; psychological stress; psychological typhoon eye effect; self-designed questionnaire","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-29","",8588,""
"Mental Health Outcomes Among Healthcare Workers and the General Population During the COVID-19 in Italy","During the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare workers in Italy have been exposed to an unprecedented pressure and traumatic events. However, no direct comparison with the general population is available so far. The aim of this study is to detail mental health outcomes in healthcare workers compared to the general population. 24050 respondents completed an on-line questionnaire during the contagion peak, 21342 general population, 1295 second-line healthcare workers, and 1411 front-line healthcare workers. Depressive, anxious, post-traumatic symptoms and insomnia were assessed. Specific COVID-19 related potential risk factors were also considered in healthcare workers. Depressive symptoms were more frequent in the general population (28.12%) and front-line healthcare workers (28.35%) compared to the second-line healthcare workers (19.98%) groups. Anxiety symptoms showed a prevalence of 21.25% in the general population, 18.05% for second-line healthcare workers, and 20.55% for front-line healthcare workers. Insomnia showed a prevalence of 7.82, 6.58, and 9.92% for the general population, second-line healthcare workers, and front-line healthcare workers, respectively. Compared to the general population, front-line healthcare workers had higher odds of endorsing total trauma-related symptoms. Both second-line healthcare workers and front-line healthcare workers had higher odds of endorsing core post-traumatic symptoms compared to the general population, while second-line healthcare workers had lower odds of endorsing negative affect and dissociative symptoms. Higher total traumatic symptom score was associated with being a front-line healthcare worker, having a colleague infected, hospitalized, or deceased, being a nurse, female gender, and younger age. This study suggests a significant psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Italian general population and healthcare workers. Front-line healthcare workers represent a specific at-risk population for post-traumatic symptoms. These findings underline the importance of monitoring and intervention strategies.","Rossi, Socci, Pacitti, Mensi, Di Marco, Siracusano, Di Lorenzo","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.608986","20201228","PTSD; anxiety; depression; epidemiology; risk factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-29","",8589,""
"How Can Alternative Exercise Traditions Help Against the Background of the COVID-19 in Cancer Care? An Overview of Systematic Reviews","To evaluate the quality of systematic reviews/meta-analyses (SR/MAs) on alternative exercise traditions in cancer care. PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Ovid, EBSCOhost, WanFang Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and VIP Database were searched from their inception to June 30, 2020. The search used a combination of subject words and free words. The search terms included &quot;Tai Chi,&quot; &quot;Qigong,&quot; &quot;Baduanjin,&quot; &quot;Yoga,&quot; &quot;Pilates,&quot; &quot;Cancer,&quot; &quot;Meta-analysis,&quot; and &quot;Systematic review.&quot; Two researchers independently performed literature screening and data extraction and used AMSTAR scale and PRISMA statement to evaluate the methodology and the quality of the evidence. A total of 26 SR/MAs were included. The AMSTAR scale score was 5-10 points, with an average of 7.46Ã‚Â±1.33 points. Overall, the methodological quality was considered to be moderate. The PRISMA list score was 13-24 points, with an average of 19.19Ã‚Â±2.86 points. Among the papers evaluated, eight reports were relatively complete. A total of 15 papers indicated certain defects. A total of three papers showed relatively serious information defects. Relative to the control group, alternative exercise traditions may be effective in improving the quality of life, anxiety, depression, distress, and fatigue of cancer patients. However, they may not necessarily improve patients' sleep outcome, body mass index, and pain. During convalescence, cancer patients can be encouraged to start engaging in physical exercise, and professionals can develop appropriate exercise alternatives to ensure the expected effect of exercise while ensuring the safety of patients. The methodological quality of the systematic evaluations of the intervention effects of alternative exercise traditions on cancer patients is not satisfactory. Hence, focus should be directed to the improvement of the preliminary design scheme, publication status, literature retrieval, conflict of interest, and other aspects.","Zhang, Yao, Kuang, Li, Huang, Zhou, Peng, Chang","https://doi.org/10.2147/CMAR.S282491","20201228","COVID-19; alternative exercise traditions; cancer care; overview","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-29","",8590,""
"The Relevance of Complementary and Integrative Medicine in the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Review of the Literature","<b>Background:</b> During the COVID-19 pandemic people are facing risks of adverse health effects due to the restrictions implemented such as quarantine measures, reduced social contact, and self-isolation. In this qualitative review, we collected data on potential preventive and therapeutic health benefits of Complementary and Integrative Medicine (CIM) that might be useful during the COVID-19 pandemic. We have reviewed the scientific literature to summarize CIM practices that could be beneficial for improving physical and mental health and well-being of the population under the current pandemic circumstances. It must be noted that this review is not SARS-CoV-2 specific and we explicitly do not intend to make any SARS-CoV-2 specific health claims in this article. <b>Methods and Findings:</b> A qualitative, non-systematic literature review was conducted in Medline to identify literature describing preventive and therapeutic CIM approaches for strengthening mental and physical health. For a variety of CIM approaches clinical evidence was identified, indicating beneficial effects. CIM approaches include specific dietary measures and selected micronutrients, physical activity, techniques from Mind-Body Medicine, single botanicals or botanical compounds, and spending time in nature among others. The effects of CIM measures on conditions like obesity and hypertension are of special relevance here, as these conditions are considered as risk factors for a severe course of COVID-19. Moreover, a possibly direct effect of CIM approaches on immune functions and clinical parameters in respiratory tract infections, such as influenza, were identified. The findings of this review could be helpful for clinicians, patients, and the general population during the current pandemic when discussing and/or considering CIM options. <b>Conclusions:</b> CIM offers a variety of preventive and therapeutic options for strengthening physical and mental resilience, which could also be useful in the current COVID-19 pandemic. The evidence of CIM approaches with a potential benefit in the COVID-19 pandemic in different areas is worth to be analyzed. While this qualitative review has several obvious limitations, it might serve as useful starting point for further research on this topic.","Seifert, Jeitler, Stange, Michalsen, Cramer, Brinkhaus, Esch, Kerckhoff, Paul, Teut, Ghadjar, Langhorst, HÃƒÂ¤upl, Murthy, Kessler","https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2020.587749","20201228","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; botanicals; complementary medicine; integrative medicine; mind-body medicine; phytomedicine; traditional medicine systems","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-29","",8591,""
"&quot;Recovering With Nature&quot;: A Review of Ecotherapy and Implications for the COVID-19 Pandemic","Connection with nature has been considered beneficial for psychological well-being since times of evolution. Differences in Indian and Western thoughts have viewed natural elements in different lights, varying between eco-centrism to anthropocentrism. The intrusion of technology and digitalized lives as a result of globalization has decreased connectedness with nature. Ecotherapy is a novel form of psychotherapeutic technique based on explicit environmental or ecological interventions. Social and therapeutic horticulture, animal-assisted interventions, care farming, green exercise, environmental conservation and wilderness therapy are some of the ecosystem-based approaches used in mental health. Based on the principles of positive and client-centered psychology, ecotherapy-related techniques have been shown to be effective in medical disorders like hypertension, obesity, post-surgical recovery and psychosocial conditions like depression, stress reduction, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), attention deficit hyperkinetic disorder (ADHD) and adjustment disorders. The principles of ecotherapy have been integrated into other psychotherapeutic techniques for better efficacy. This review attempts provides an overview of techniques, applications and challenges related to ecotherapy in psychology. The implications of its use during the ongoing Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) crisis, social isolation and consequent psychosocial aftermath are also discussed.","Chaudhury, Banerjee","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.604440","20201228","COVID-19; ecosystem; ecotherapy; mental health; nature; psychology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-29","",8592,""
"Potential Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Future Birth Rate","Here, we examine the potential effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on future birth rates. This highly contagious disease originated in China, and rapidly spread worldwide, leading to extensive lockdown policies being implemented globally with the aim of containing the infection rates and its serious attendant consequences. Based on previous extant literature, this paper overviews the potential demographic consequences of the current progressively widespread epidemic on conception and fertility as driven by the data obtained during similar prior incidents. In general, epidemics manifest a common pattern as far as their impact on population, which is remarkably similar to natural disasters, i.e., a steep decline in birth rates followed by gradual increases and then followed by a baby boom. Additionally, we have also depicted how economic conditions, mental health, fear, and mortality may also influence future birth rates.","Ullah, Moin, Araf, Bhuiyan, Griffiths, Gozal","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.578438","20201228","COVID-19; birth rate; demography; fertility; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-29","",8593,""
"Epidemic Rumination and Resilience on College Students' Depressive Symptoms During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Mediating Role of Fatigue","The restriction of numerous sectors of society and the uncertainty surrounding the development of the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in adverse psychological states to college students isolated at home. In this study, we explored the mediating role of fatigue in the effects of epidemic rumination and resilience on depressive symptoms as well as how epidemic rumination and resilience may interact with one another. A large sample of Chinese college students (<i>N</i> = 1,293) completed measures on epidemic rumination, resilience, fatigue, and depressive symptoms. Results indicated depressive symptomology was positively predicted by epidemic rumination while negatively predicted by resilience. In both cases, fatigue partially mediated these effects and positively predicted depressive symptoms. Unexpectedly, epidemic rumination and resilience interacted in a manner where the effect of rumination on fatigue became stronger as resiliency increased. Theoretical and practical implications are provided to further interpret the results.","Ye, Zhou, Im, Liu, Wang, Yang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.560983","20201228","COVID-19; depression; epidemic rumination; fatigue; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-29","",8594,""
"Exploring Responses to Body Weight Criticism: Defensive Avoidance When Weight Is Seen as Controllable","In Western society, weight moralization is reflected in the belief that weight is controllable across the weight spectrum. However, the effect of holding such beliefs is unclear. We therefore propose that these beliefs affect people differently depending on their BMI. When confronted with negative, self-related feedback, people's coping strategies are often reflected in the ways they relate to their self. We examine three such self-to-self relations (i.e., reassured, inadequate, and hated self). Extending prior research, we predict that weight controllability beliefs are related to positive self-to-self relations for adults with a low, and to negative self-to-self relations for adults with a high BMI. Accordingly, we expected that weight controllability beliefs would be associated with defensive avoidance among people with a high, but not with a low BMI. We tested our hypotheses in a sample of 348 adults who participated in an online survey. Weight controllability beliefs were associated with increased defensive avoidance in people with high BMI, and with decreased defensive avoidance in adults with a low BMI. Forms of self-to-self relating fully mediated this association, demonstrating positive effects on adults with a low, and negative effects on adults with a high BMI. Additionally, in an open ending section, we found seven social settings that deprive people from satisfying their need to belong and to be accepted due to their weight. We discuss our findings against a call for a less moralized public discourse about overweight and obesity that is particularly relevant in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic.","TÃƒÂ¤uber, Flint, Gausel","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.598109","20201228","belongingness and acceptance; body mass index; defensive avoidance; obesity controllability beliefs; self-to-self relating; weight moralization","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-29","",8595,""

"A Postcard From Italy: Challenges and Psychosocial Resources of Partners Living With and Without a Chronic Disease During COVID-19 Epidemic","The new Coronavirus (COVID-19) has been declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The sudden outbreak of this new virus and the measure of lockdown adopted to contain the epidemic have profoundly changed the lifestyles of the Italian population, with an impact on people's quality of life and on their social relationships. In particular, due to forced and prolonged cohabitation, couples may be subject to specific stressors during the epidemic. In addition, living with a chronic health condition may add specific challenges to the ones posed by the epidemic itself. The present cross-sectional study aimed to provide a picture of the challenges as well as the resources for both individual and relational well-being of Italian individuals in a couple relationship (<i>N</i> = 1921), with a specific attention to the comparison between individuals living with and without a chronic disease. Results showed that people with a chronic disease had lower psychological well-being and more fears and worries about the COVID-19. People with a chronic disease perceived fewer resources than healthy people. Moreover, the challenges are shown to be associated with less psychological well-being and high pessimism about the future. Instead individual, relational, and social resources play a protective role during the pandemic for both healthy and chronically ill people.","Rapelli, Lopez, Donato, Pagani, Parise, Bertoni, Iafrate","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.567522","20201228","COVID-19; chronic illness; psychological well-being; relational well-being; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-29","",8598,""
"The Influence of Factors Such as Parenting Stress and Social Support on the State Anxiety in Parents of Special Needs Children During the COVID-19 Epidemic","The study aims to investigate the state anxiety of parents of special needs children during the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic and the influence of parental stress, social support, and other related variables on the anxiety of parents. Bespoke questionnaires of children's and parent's mental and behavioral problems during the epidemic were used in the study. We also used the State Anxiety Inventory (S-AI), the Parenting Stress Index-Short Form-15 (PSI-SF-15), the NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI), and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). The data used in the study were pooled from an online survey of parents of special needs children and analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multiple linear regression. Overall, 1,451 individuals were included, of which 402 were fathers (27.71%) and 1,049 were mothers (72.29%). ANOVA results showed that educational background, family monthly income, and type of their child's disability made parents' state anxiety significantly different. The results of multiple linear regression showed that during the epidemic, social support negatively predicted parents' state anxiety (<i>B</i> = -0.15, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), whereas parenting stress (<i>B</i> = 0.07, <i>p</i> = 0.001) and parental mental and behavioral problems (<i>B</i> = 0.37, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) positively predicted parents' state anxiety. During the outbreak of COVID-19, parents of special needs children suffered mental and behavioral problems, together with parenting stress and social support, which influenced their state anxiety.

"Psychological Impact of the COVID-19 Outbreak on Nurses in China: A Nationwide Survey During the Outbreak","<b>Background:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic is a major public health issue and challenge to health professionals. In similar epidemics, nurses experienced more distress than other providers. <b>Methods:</b> We surveyed both on-duty nurses caring for infected patients and second-line nurses caring for uninfected patients from Hubei and other provinces throughout China. <b>Results:</b> We received completed surveys from 1,364 nurses from 22 provinces: 658 front-line and 706 second-line nurses.

"Policies to Improve the Mental Health of People Influenced by COVID-19 in China: A Scoping Review","<b>Background:</b> In response to the potentially concurrent mental health crisis due to the COVID-19 outbreak, there have been ongoing mental health policies put in place in China. This review aims to systematically synthesize the implemented national-level mental health policies released by the Chinese government during the COVID-19 outbreak, and summarize the implementation of those mental health policies. <b>Methods:</b> Six databases and two websites were systematically searched, including published studies and gray literature published between December 1, 2019 and October 29, 2020. <b>Results:</b> A total of 40 studies were included. Among them, 19 were national-level policies on mental health released by the Chinese government, and 21 studies reported data on the implementation of those mental health policies. Mental health policies were issued for COVID-19 patients, suspected cases, medical staff, the general population, patients with mental illness, and mental institutions. In the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic, attention was paid to psychological crisis intervention. In the later stage of the epidemic, the government focused mainly on psychological rehabilitation. During the COVID-19 outbreak, more than 500 psychiatrists from all over China were sent to Wuhan, about 625 hotlines were notified in 31 provinces, several online psychological consultation platforms were established, social software such as TikTok, Weibo, and WeChat were used for psychological education, and many books on mental health were published. Responding quickly, maximizing the use of resources, and emphasizing the importance of policy evaluation and implementation quality were characteristics of the mental health policies developed during the COVID-19 outbreak. Challenges facing China include a low rate of mental health service utilization, a lack of evaluation data on policy effects, and no existing national-level emergency response system and designated workforce to provide psychological crisis interventions during a national emergency or disaster. <b>Conclusions:</b> This review suggests that China has responded quickly and comprehensively to a possible mental health crisis during the COVID-19 outbreak, appropriate mental health policies were released for different members of the population.

Verbal abuse was experienced by 304 participants (57.1%) and physical abuse in 93 (17.5). Gender was associated with high emotional exhaustion and high depersonalization. Being 35 years or older was associated with high depersonalization. Professional specialty was significantly associated with high emotional exhaustion and depersonalization. Fear of COVID-19 infection was associated with high emotional exhaustion and high depersonalization. <b>Conclusion:</b> The rising prevalence of mental disorders and inadequate availability of health services facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic and civil war demonstrated the need for healthcare policies to address the well-being of healthcare workers to decrease the risk of loss, suicide, and medical negligence.","Elhadi, Msherghi, Elgzairi, Alhashimi, Bouhuwaish, Biala, Abuelmeda, Khel, Khaled, Alsoufi, Elmabrouk, Alshiteewi, Hamed, Alhadi, Alhaddad, Elhadi, Zaid","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.579563","20201228","COVID-19; coronavirus disease; medical staff; pandemic; professional burnout; psychiatric illness; war exposure","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-29","",8602,""
"Postpartum mood among universally screened high and low socioeconomic status patients during COVID-19 social restrictions in New York City","The mental health effects of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on postpartum women are of increasing concern among mental health practitioners. To date, only a handful of studies have explored the emotional impact of the pandemic surrounding pregnancy and none have investigated the consequence of pandemic-related social restrictions on the postpartum mood of those living among different socioeconomic status (SES). All postpartum patients appearing to the Mount Sinai Health System for their postpartum appointment between January 2, 2020 and June 30, 2020, corresponding to before and during pandemic imposed social restrictions, were screened for mood symptomatology using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Each patient's socioeconomic status (high/low) was determined by their location of clinical service. A total of 516 postpartum patients were screened. While no differences in EPDS scores were observed by SES prior to social restrictions (UÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°7956.0, zÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.05, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.293), a significant change in mood symptomatology was observed following COVID-19 restrictions (UÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4895.0, zÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.48, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), with patients living in lower SES reporting significantly less depression symptomatology (UÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°9209.0, zÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.56, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). There was no change in symptomatology among patients of higher SES (UÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4045.5, zÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.06, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.288). Postpartum depression, the most common complication of childbearing, is a prevalent, cross-cultural disorder with significant morbidity. The observed differences in postpartum mood between patients of different SES in the context of temporarily imposed COVID-19-related social restrictions present a unique opportunity to better understand the specific health and social support needs of postpartum patients living in urban economic poverty. Given that maternal mental illness has negative long-term developmental implications for the offspring and that poor mental health reinforces the poverty cycle, future health policy specifically directed towards supporting postpartum women living in low SES by ameliorating some of the early maternal burdens associated with balancing employment-family-childcare demands may assist in interrupting this cycle while simultaneously improving the long-term outcomes of their offspring.","Silverman, Burgos, Rodriguez, Afzal, Kalishman, Callipari, Pena, Gabay, Loudon","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-79564-9","20201228","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-29","",8603,""

During lockdown, ambulance patients were more likely to be attended at home and less likely to be aged between 16 and 25 years. There was a significant increase in the proportion of lower acuity patients (Status 3 and Status 4) attended (p&lt;0.001) and a corresponding increase in patients not transported from scene (p&lt;0.001). Road traffic crashes (p&lt;0.001) and alcohol-related incidents (p&lt;0.001) significantly decreased. There was a decrease in the absolute number of weekly ambulance attendances (ratio (95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI), 0.89 (0.87 to 0.91), p&lt;0.001), attendances to respiratory conditions (0.74 (0.61 to 0.86), p=0.01), and trauma (0.81 (0.77 to 0.85), p&lt;0.001). However, there was a significant increase in ambulance attendances for mental health conditions (1.37 (1.22 to 1.51), p=0.005). Despite the relative absence of COVID-19 in the community during the 5-week nationwide lockdown, there were significant differences in ambulance utilisation during this period. The lockdown was associated with an increase in ambulance attendances for mental health conditions and is of concern. In considering future lockdowns, the potential implications on a population's mental well-being will need to be seriously considered against the benefits of elimination of virus transmission.","Dicker, Swain, Todd, Tunnage, McConachy, Drake, Brett, Spearing, Howie","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-044726","20201228","COVID-19; accident &amp; emergency medicine; health policy; mental health; primary care; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-29","",8604,""
"The psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on secondary school teachers","Historically, major public health issues, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, trigger abruptHistorically, major public health issues, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, trigger abruptand radical changes in daily life, thus causing severe psychological distress to the population.The ease with which the virus seems to be transmitted, combined with the exponentiallyrising number of new cases and the social distancing measures applied, create an atmosphereof fear and alarm. This, in turn, has a pivotal effect on the population's mental health. The aimof this study is to initially investigate the psychological effects of the new COVID-19 pandemic onsecondary school teachers, who in addition to the general aggravation take on the burden of forcedabstinence from their regular work duties and the simultaneous need to adapt themselves to the unprecedentedprocess of distance learning. This is a cross-sectional study in secondary school teachersand was conducted using simple random sampling at the beginning of the pandemic in Greece. Thex2 test was used to examine associations between psychological and other variables. 34% of teacherswere found to feel anxious and very anxious during the pandemic, while only 8% of teachers exhibitsevere depressive emotions. It is also clear that the educators as a professional group are predominantlypossessed by optimism about the outcome of the pandemic, as 71.5% was placed in the higherlevels of the relevant scale. Female gender was found to have a positive correlation to feelings of fear,depression, and a negative correlation to optimism. Furthermore, a negative correlation between theteachers' high educational level and their feelings of optimism emerged from the data. This optimismmay well be related with the large acceptance of the measures taken by the government to curb theexpansion of the pandemic. Finally, it was found that distance teaching, which was abruptly and unpreparedlyimplemented by educators on account of the pandemic, was not a major concern. Thefindings of our study indicate a specific profile of secondary school teachers characterized by mentalresilience, a quality that must be exploited and strengthened by the state with appropriate interventionsin order to maximize their complex, creative work.","Stachteas, Stachteas","https://doi.org/10.22365/jpsych.2020.314.293","20201228","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-29","",8605,""
"The international initiatives of the collaboration between the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki School of Medicine, the Panhellenic Medical Association and the World Psychiatric Association, concerning mental health during the COVID-19 outbreak","During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, all European countries were hit, but mortality rates were heterogenous, with some countries being hit very hard, while others including Greece had a much lower death rate during the first wave of spring 2020. The ultra-fast application of measures was probably the reason of this outstanding success. This outbreak is expected to trigger feelings of fear, worry, and stress, as responses to an extreme threat for the community and the individual. In addition, changes in social behavior, as well as in working conditions, daily habits and routine, are expected to impose further stress, especially with the expectation of an upcoming economic crisis and possible unemployment. In Greece, where the lockdown was extremely successful in terms of containing the outbreak, worries concerning the possible adverse effects on mental health were also predominant. A collaboration concerning mental health during the COVID-19 outbreak was established, between the Aristotle University School of Medicine, the Panhellenic Medical Association and the World Psychiatric Association. Two large multinational studies were launched, one concerning the general population and one university students. Students' mental health is an area of special interest, both because of the vulnerability of this age group as well as because any disruption during the time of the studies has profound long-term consequences in the lives of the individuals, and this might trigger feelings of fear, worry, and stress. According the results from the Greek arm of the students' study, during the lockdown, two-thirds of university students reported at least 'much' increase in anxiety, one third in depressive feelings and in 2.59% concerning suicidal thoughts. There was also a worsening of quality of life and deterioration of lifestyle issues. Major depression was present in 12.43% with an additional 13.46% experiencing severe distress. Beliefs in conspiracy theories enjoyed wide acceptance ranging from 20-68%, with students of law, literature, pedagogics, political sciences and related studies manifesting higher acceptance rates. Female sex and depression/dysphoria both independently but also in interaction were related to higher rates of such beliefs. The results of the Greek arm of the general population study suggested that during the lockdown, clinical depression was present in 9.31%, with an additional 8.5% experiencing severe distress. Increased anxious and depressive emotions (including subclinical cases) were present in more than 40% of the population. In persons with a previous history of depression, 23.31% experienced depression vs. 8.96% of cases without previous history, who were experiencing their first depressive episode. Family dynamics suggested that fewer conflicts and better quality of relationships were surprisingly related to higher anxiety and depressive emotions, higher rates of depression and distress, and greater rates of suicidal thoughts. Eventually, spiritual and religious affiliation could protect the individual from the emerging suicidal thoughts. As correlation does not imply causation, the results suggest that conspiracy theories could be either the cause of depression or on the contrary a coping mechanism against depression. After taking into consideration that also in the family environment the expression of anger seemed to be a protective factor, the most likely explanation could be that the beliefs in conspiracy theories are a coping and 'protective' mechanism against the emergence of depression. These studies were among the first published, they went deeper in the data collection and even led to the creation of a model with distinct stages for the development of mental disorders during the lockdown. The analysis of the international data will probably provide further insight into the prevalence of mental disorders and the universal but also culturally specific models and factors pertaining to their development. At the time this editorial was in press, more than 40 countries representing more than two thirds of earth's population were participating with more than 45,000 responses already gathered.","Fountoulakis, Exadactylos, Anastasiadis, Papaioannou, Javed","https://doi.org/10.22365/jpsych.2020.314.289","20201228","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-29","",8606,""
"Suicidal and self-harm ideation among Chinese hospital staff during the COVID-19 pandemic: Prevalence and correlates","The COVID-19 pandemic put global medical systems under massive pressure for its uncertainty, severity, and persistence. For detecting the prevalence of suicidal and self-harm ideation (SSI) and its related risk factors among hospital staff during the COVID-19 pandemic, this cross-sectional study collected the sociodemographic data, epidemic-related information, the psychological status and need, and perceived stress and support from 11507 staff in 46 hospitals by an online survey from February 14 to March 2, 2020. The prevalence of SSI was 6.47%. Hospital staff with SSI had high family members or relatives infected number and the self-rated probability of infection. Additionally, they had more perceived stress, psychological need, and psychological impact. On the contrary, hospital staff without SSI reported high self-rated health, willingness to work in a COVID-19 ward, confidence in defeating COVID-19, and perceived support. Furthermore, they reported better marital or family relationship, longer sleep hours, and shorter work hours. The infection of family members or relatives, poor marital status, poor self-rated health, the current need for psychological intervention, perceived high stress, perceived low support, depression, and anxiety were independent factors to SSI. A systematic psychological intervention strategy during a public health crisis was needed for the hospital staff's mental well-being.","Xu, Wang, Chen, Ai, Shi, Wang, Hong, Zhang, Hu, Li, Cao, Lv, Du, Li, Yang, He, Chen, Chen, Luo, Zhou, Tan, Tu, Jiang, Han, Kuang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113654","20201228","Anxiety; Coronavirus; Depression; Hospital staff; Self-harm ideation; Suicidal ideation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-29","",8607,""
"Students' mental health problems before, during, and after COVID-19 lockdown in Italy","The lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic may have exacerbated mental health problems. To what degree mental health may be affected by social isolation is still poorly known. We collected prospective data on students' mental health in two instances: (i) in October and December 2019, and (ii) 6 months later, in April 2020 amidst the COVID-19 lockdown in Italy and in mid-May/June 2020, after the lifting of lockdown. A total of 358 Italian students aged 18-30 completed socio-demographic questionnaires and the Beck Depression Inventory - 2 (BDI-2), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory - Revised (OCI-R), the Eating Habits Questionnaire (EHQ), and the Eating Disorder Inventory-3 (EDI-3). We applied multiple regression models to evince any changes in the aforementioned questionnaire scores during and after lockdown with respect to the scores before lockdown. Students reported on average worse depressive symptoms during lockdown than 6 months before isolation (median increase in the BDI-2 score +2; IQRÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â -3, 6; ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.09Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 0.03, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.005), with students without any established diagnosis of psychopathology being affected the most. The regression models predict that 86.2% (IQRÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 67.9, 91.4%) of students would not experience a clinically significant worsening of symptoms, while approximately 6% of our target population could develop more severe depressive symptoms. This study supports the view that depressive symptomatology may be aggravated during lockdown, but also highlights that after the lifting of lockdown any changes quickly vanished, as the BDI-2 scores were not different from the ones reported before lockdown.","Meda, Pardini, Slongo, Bodini, Zordan, Rigobello, Visioli, Novara","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.12.045","20201228","COVID-19; Lockdown; Mental health; Social isolation; Students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-29","",8608,""
"Associations between insecurity and stress among Chinese university students: The mediating effects of hope and self-efficacy","In the context of the pandemic, exploration on the association between insecurity and stress among university students is limited. The current study aims to investigate the parallel mediation role of hope and self-efficacy in the relationship between insecurity and stress among university students during the COVID-19 pandemic. We employed a cross-sectional research design in a university by distributing questionnaires online. 5286 participants were recruited (mean ageÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 19.65; SDÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.13). Items were from the Security Questionnaire, Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21, and the Positive Psychology Capital (Psycap) Questionnaire (PPQ). Parallel mediation analysis was performed using PROCESS macro in SPSS. The results indicate that insecurity predicted students' stress positively and that students with high-level perceived insecurity are more likely to perceive stress. Moreover, hope and self-efficacy mediated the relationship between insecurity and stress, indicating that hope and self-efficacy could buffer the negative effects of insecurity on stress. This study examines the mediating model between insecurity and stress among Chinese university students. The generalizability of the findings in other regions remains to be explored. Additionally, the roles of other positive self-beliefs including optimism and resilience in relieving stress can be further explored in future research. This research provides direct evidence of insecurity effects on stress among university students, enriching relevant theories in the field of stress. Moreover, this research suggests that enhancing positive self-beliefs such as hope, and self-efficacy helps to relieve students' stress during COVID-19.","Wen, Zhu, Ye, Li, Ma, Wen, Zuo","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.12.047","20201228","COVID-19; Hope; Insecurity; Self-efficacy; Stress; University student","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-29","",8609,""
"Prevalence of stress, depression, anxiety and sleep disturbance among nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review and meta-analysis","The new coronavirus disease's (COVID-19) high risk of infection can increase the workload of healthcare workers, especially nurses, as they are most of the healthcare workforce. These problems can lead to psychological problems. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis to ascertain the present impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression and sleep disturbance among nurses. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. The following databases were searched: PubMed, CHINAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, MedRxiv and Google Scholar, from January 2020 up to 26th October 2020. Prevalence rates were pooled with meta-analysis using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was tested using I-squared (I<sup>2</sup>) statistics. A total of 93 studies (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 93,112), published between January 2020 and September 2020, met the inclusion criteria. The overall prevalence of stress was assessed in 40 studies which accounted for 43% (95% CI 37-49). The pooled prevalence of anxiety was 37% (95% CI 32-41) in 73 studies. Depression was assessed in 62 studies, with a pooled prevalence of 35% (95% CI 31-39). Finally, 18 studies assessed sleep disturbance and the pooled prevalence was 43% (95% CI 36-50). This meta-analysis found that approximately one third of nurses working during the COVID-19 epidemic were suffering from psychological symptoms. This highlights the importance of providing comprehensive support strategies to reduce the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak among nurses under pandemic conditions. Further longitudinal study is needed to distinguish of psychological symptoms during and after the infectious disease outbreaks.","Al Maqbali, Al Sinani, Al-Lenjawi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2020.110343","20201228","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression, sleep disturbance; Meta-analysis; Nurses, stress; Systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-29","",8610,""
"Containment measures limit environmental effects on COVID-19 early outbreak dynamics","Environmental factors are well known to affect spatio-temporal patterns of infectious disease outbreaks, but whether the rapid spread of COVID-19 across the globe is related to local environmental conditions is highly debated. We assessed the impact of environmental factors (temperature, humidity and air pollution) on the global patterns of COVID-19 early outbreak dynamics during January-May 2020, controlling for several key socio-economic factors and airport connections. We showed that during the earliest phase of the global outbreak (January-March), COVID-19 growth rates were non-linearly related to climate, with fastest spread in regions with a mean temperature of ca. 5Ã‚Â Ã‚Â°C, and in the most polluted regions. However, environmental effects faded almost completely when considering later outbreaks, in keeping with the progressive enforcement of containment actions. Accordingly, COVID-19 growth rates consistently decreased with stringent containment actions during both early and late outbreaks. Our findings indicate that environmental drivers may have played a role in explaining the early variation among regions in disease spread. With limited policy interventions, seasonal patterns of disease spread might emerge, with temperate regions of both hemispheres being most at risk of severe outbreaks during colder months. Nevertheless, containment measures play a much stronger role and overwhelm impacts of environmental variation, highlighting the key role for policy interventions in curbing COVID-19 diffusion within a given region. If the disease will become seasonal in the next years, information on environmental drivers of COVID-19 can be integrated with epidemiological models to inform forecasting of future outbreak risks and improve management plans.","Ficetola, Rubolini","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.144432","20201228","Absolute humidity; COVID-19, pathogen growth rate; Climate; Global analysis; PM 2.5; Pollution; Population size; Temperature","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-29","",8611,""
"Change in Youth Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic in a Majority Hispanic/Latinx US Sample","Children and adolescents, individuals from racial and ethnic minority groups, and those with mental health conditions may be at greater risk of worsened mental health due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This study examined change in mental health from before to during the pandemic among predominantly Hispanic/Latinx adolescents. 322 young adolescents (M<sub>age</sub> = 11.99, 55% female), with a racial/ethnic composition of 72.7% Hispanic/Latinx, 9.3% Black or African American, 5.9% Multiple Races, 5.0% Asian, 1.6% White, and 1.2% American Indian, completed a mental health screening measure prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and at three points during the pandemic. A subsample also completed a survey about their experience at home during COVID-19. Repeated measures mixed ANCOVA was used to evaluate change in each mental health domain, and whether youth who had elevated symptoms at baseline differed in their level of change, controlling for age and gender. For youth who had elevated levels of mental health problems pre-pandemic, symptoms were significantly reduced across domains during the pandemic. Reductions in internalizing, externalizing, and total problems were clinically significant. For other youth, there were statistically significant reductions in internalizing and total problems, and no change in attention or externalizing problems. Post-hoc analyses revealed that better family functioning was consistently related to lower mental health symptoms in youth during COVID-19 follow-ups. COVID-19 stay-at-home regulations may offer protective effects for youth mental health. Study results may be specific to this population of predominantly Hispanic/Latinx youth from a large city in the southwestern US.","Penner, Ortiz, Sharp","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaac.2020.12.027","20201228","COVID-19; adolescence; epidemiology; mental health; risk and resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-29","",8612,""
"Factors influencing social distancing to prevent the community spread of COVID-19 among Chinese adults","The global outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in 2020 has been an international public health threat. Early strong social distancing efforts is needed to stop transmission of the virus. The purpose of the present study is to identify individual and environmental factors related to individuals' compliance with the recommended social distancing, as well as the moderating role of social media in influencing individuals' implementation of social distancing. A total of 2130 Chinese adults were surveyed in March 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Logistic regression analyses were performed to ascertain the predictors of social distancing. Overall, the majority of respondents (95.6%) reported compliance with social distancing. Women were more likely to practice social distancing compared to men (odds ratio [OR] = 3.12, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.93-5.02). Psychological distress, depressive symptoms, and social media were significant predictors of social distancing after controlling for other individual and environmental factors. Social media moderated the effects of psychological distress on social distancing (OR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.94-0.99). Findings from the study indicates that mental health status and social media are influential factors of social distancing, which have significant implications in enhancing the effectiveness of prevention strategies to contain the spread of COVID-19.","Guo, Qin, Wang, Yang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2020.106385","20201228","Adult Chinese; COVID-19; Media; Mental health; Social distancing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-29","",8613,""

In addition, the use of adaptive coping strategies (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.89; 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.79-0.98) and high perceived social support (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.97; 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.93- 0,99) had a negative association with depression symptoms. Longitudinal studies involving the return to normality phase of the COVID-19 pandemic are needed to investigate the effects of factors such as coping strategies and perceived social support that could increase the psychological adjustment and resilience of individuals on anxiety and depression.","KandeÃ„Å¸er, AydÃ„Â±n, AltÃ„Â±nbaÃ…Å¸, CansÃ„Â±z, Tan, Tomar Bozkurt, EÃ„Å¸ilmez, Tekdemir, Ã…Å¾en, AktuÃ„Å¸ Demir, SÃƒÂ¼mer, Ural, Yormaz, ErgÃƒÂ¼n, TÃƒÂ¼lek, Kanat","https://doi.org/10.1177/0091217420982085","20201228","Anxiety; COVID-19; coping strategies; depression; perceived social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-29","",8620,""
"Levels and predictors of depression, anxiety, and suicidal risk during COVID-19 pandemic in Argentina: the impacts of quarantine extensions on mental health state","This research is aimed to: analyze differences in mental health state (MHS) indicators (depression, state-anxiety, trait-anxiety, and suicidal risk), during three quarantine sub-periods (starting since the first quarantine extension); assess multiple relationships between each MHS indicator and potentially affecting factors. We used a cross-sectional design with a convenience sample including 1100 participants. Data were collected online. Depression revealed a worsening pattern as quarantine sub-periods went by. Anxiety (both state and trait), just like suicidal risk, partially follow such a pattern, with mean scores increasing from the first to the second/third quarantine extensions, but then maintaining to the fourth extension. Predictors having protective effects on almost all the MHS indicators were: availability of current economic income (except for state-anxiety, without significant effect) and absence of suicide attempt history. Conversely, sex (woman), younger age, and mental disorder history had an increasing risk effect on all the MHS indicators. Overall, our findings indicate that quarantine have negative mental health impacts and that quarantine duration is a relevant aspect to be taken into account when measuring such an impact. More attention needs to be paid to vulnerable groups such as the young, women, and people with history of mental disorder.","LÃƒÂ³pez Steinmetz, Dutto Florio, Leyes, Fong, Rigalli, Godoy","https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2020.1867318","20201228","COVID-19; anxiety disorders; depression; psychological distress; quarantine; suicidal ideation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-29","",8621,""
"Application of Remote Follow-Up Via the WeChat Platform for Patients who Underwent Congenital Cardiac Surgery During the COVID-19 Epidemic","To investigate the effect of WeChat-based telehealth services on the postoperative follow-up of children who underwent congenital heart surgery during the COVID-19 epidemic. This study retrospectively analyzed the clinical and family data of 108 children who underwent congenital heart surgery and underwent remote follow-up via the WeChat platform from December 2019 to March 2020 in our hospital. During the follow-up period, the WeChat platform was used to refer 8 children with respiratory infection symptoms to local hospitals for treatment. Two children with poor incision healing were healed after we used the WeChat platform to guide the parents in dressing the wounds on a regular basis at home. Nutritional guidance was given via the WeChat platform to 13 patients with poor growth and development. The psychological evaluation results of the parents showed that the median (range) SDS score was 43 (34-59), and 7 parents (6.5%) were classified as depressed; the median (range) SAS score was 41 (32-58), and 12 parents (11.1%) were classified as having mild anxiety. The use of WeChat-based telehealth services was effective for the remote postoperative follow-up of children who underwent congenital cardiac surgery during the COVID-19 epidemic. Providing WeChat-based telehealth services can reduce the amount of travel required for these children and their families, which is helpful for controlling and preventing the spread of COVID-19.","Zhang, Huang, Xu, Wang, Cao, Chen","https://doi.org/10.21470/1678-9741-2020-0256","20201228","Attitude to Health; COVID-19. . . ; Cardiovascular System; China, Severe Acute Respiratory coronavirus 2.; Social Media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-29","",8622,""
"Physical Distancing Behavior: The Role of Emotions, Personality, Motivations, and Moral Decision-Making","Physical distancing behavior (PDB) is a key disease prevention strategy for limiting the spread of COVID-19. In order to effectively encourage it among adolescents, it is necessary to understand the associated mental mechanisms. Health behavior theories suggest that emotions, personality, motivation, and moral disengagement could all play a role. On the basis of a longitudinal study, we investigated the importance of these factors in predicting PDB. The participants were 347 adolescents residing in Italy. Data were collected in four waves starting from 1Ã¢â‚¬â€°year before the pandemic. A structural equation model based on health behavior theory was tested. After the COVID-19 national lockdown, adolescents experienced fewer positive emotions and more negative emotions compared with 1 year earlier. Nevertheless, these emotional changes, and adolescents' personality (except for openness to experiences), were not related to the adoption of PDB. Instead, the autonomous motivation of adolescents significantly predicted a higher likelihood to adopt PDB by increasing the intention to engage in this behavior and, more indirectly, by substantially decreasing moral disengagement, which was negatively related to PDB. In contrast, controlled motivation corresponded to significantly higher levels of moral disengagement and predicted less likelihood of adopting PDB. Messages and interventions targeted at adolescents should be oriented towards supporting autonomy, emphasizing the personal and social value of PDB. Communications should avoid the use of coercive strategies based on eliciting emotions such as shame and guilt in adolescents who do not adopt PDB, which appear to trigger off mechanisms of moral disengagement.","Alivernini, Manganelli, Girelli, Cozzolino, Lucidi, Cavicchiolo","https://doi.org/10.1093/jpepsy/jsaa122","20201223","health promotion and prevention; longitudinal research; mental health; psychosocial functioning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-29","",8623,""

During the study period, 234 patients were admitted for suicide behaviours (28% male; mean age 13.4 years). Using Poisson regression, we found a significant decrease in the incidence of admissions for suicide behaviour during the lockdown (adjusted incidence rate ratio: 0.46; 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 0.24 to 0.86). This association might result from reduced help-seeking and decreased hospital admission rates during the lockdown, as well as cognitive and environmental factors. Further multicentre studies should be conducted to confirm these findings and investigate whether a compensatory rise in admissions for suicide behaviour occurred in the postlockdown period.","Mourouvaye, Bottemanne, Bonny, Fourcade, Angoulvant, Cohen, Ouss","https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2020-320628","20201223","COVID-19; adolescent health; child psychiatry; epidemiology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-29","",8625,""

"Group therapy via videoconferencing for individuals with early psychosis: A pilot study","The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced many mental health professionals to therapy via videoconferencing. Mostly individual teletherapy has been offered and studied, although group therapy is often offered in clinics. In fact, little is known regarding group therapy's acceptability, feasibility, and potential impact when offered via videoconferencing. This pilot study offered group cognitive-behavioural therapy for psychosis via videoconferencing to 14 individuals with early psychosis either living in remote areas or confined during the pandemic. The rate of consenting to the study (79%) and actual participation rates were acceptable (18.5 sessions out of 24). Although some technological obstacles were encountered, solutions offered allowed the videoconferencing group to be considered feasible for most participants and therapists. Prepost results on symptoms and self-esteem were comparable to those of other studies using the same group treatment but in-person. Alliance scores seemed similar as well. More studies are warranted on the efficacy of group therapy via videoconferencing. This pilot study does offer promising results, suggesting that a wider range of people with early psychosis can be reached and benefit from the advantages of receiving an evidence-based group intervention.","Lecomte, Abdel-Baki, Francoeur, Cloutier, Leboeuf, Abadie, Villeneuve, Guay","https://doi.org/10.1111/eip.13099","20201223","cognitive-behavioural therapy; early psychosis; group intervention; group therapy; videoconferencing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-29","",8627,""
"COVID-19: challenges for dementia care and research","The COVID-19 pandemic has raised significant concerns about the management and care for people with dementia and their caregivers. In this context, this work will discuss how social isolation or social distancing caused by the pandemic may impact the clinical management of people with dementia, caregivers' health, and dementia research. The pandemic disrupts all forms of social interaction and may increase the behavioral impairment of people with dementia. Regarding pharmacological treatment, telemedicine is an option, but the context of social isolation raises questions about how to manage people with dementia with lack of cognitive stimulation and non-pharmacological treatment. In addition, the impact of the pandemic on caregivers should be considered. There is some evidence that telephone counseling can reduce depressive symptoms of caregivers of people with dementia. In dementia research, social isolation imposes researchers to modify their study protocols in order to continue collecting data by developing remote tools to assess the participants such as electronic informed consent and online questionnaires and tests. Thus, there is an urgent need for the evaluation and refinement of interventions to address several cognitive, behavioral, and clinical aspects of the long-term impact of the pandemic in dementia. A pandemia causada pelo COVID-19 desencadeia grandes preocupaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂµes sobre o manejo e cuidados com as pessoas com demÃƒÂªncia e seus cuidadores. Neste contexto, discutiremos como o isolamento social causado pela pandemia pode impactar o manejo clÃƒÂ­nico de pessoas com demÃƒÂªncia, a saÃƒÂºde do cuidador e a pesquisa sobre demÃƒÂªncia. A pandemia interrompe todas as formas de interaÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o social e pode causar aumento do comprometimento dos sintomas neuropsiquiÃƒÂ¡tricos nas pessoas com demÃƒÂªncia.

"Who is Left Behind? Altruism of Giving, Happiness and Mental Health during the Covid-19 Period in the UK","The UK government has decided to implement lockdown measures at the end of March 2020 as a response to the outbreak and spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. As a consequence, households have experienced job losses and a significant drop in their finances. During these unprecedented and difficult times, people provide financial assistance to those who are in need and have to cope with falls in their living standards. In this study we are interested to investigate the subjective well-being, which is expressed by mental health and components of general happiness, of the givers rather than of receivers. We apply a difference-in-differences framework to investigate the impact of altruism on the givers' SWB in the UK. Altruism is denoted by transfers made to adult children, parents, siblings, and friends. Using the DiD estimator and the estimated coefficient of the household income we calculate the implicit willingness-to-pay (WTP) for altruism. We perform various regressions by gender and racial-ethnic background using data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS). The analysis shows that altruistic behaviours impact different domains of SWB between men and women, as well as, among people with different racial-ethnic background.","Giovanis, Ozdamar","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11482-020-09900-8","20201223","Altruism; Covid-19; Difference-in-differences; Happiness; Money transfer; Subjective mental well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-29","",8629,""
"Telerehabilitation in Psychiatry","The COVID-19 pandemic has interrupted the usual mechanisms of healthcare delivery and exacerbated symptoms of mental illnesses. Telemedicine has morphed from niche service to essential platform, with newly released guidelines that cover various aspects of tele-mental health delivery. Rehabilitation services, which incorporate a range of psychosocial interventions and liaison services, have been significantly impacted too. They are currently more institute-based than community-based in India. However, recent legislation has mandated that community-based rehabilitation options be available. While a large treatment gap for mental health issues has always existed, telemedicine provides an opportunity to scale services up to minimize this gap. Community-based rehabilitation can be delivered over various platforms, from text to phone to videoconferencing, and various devices. Telemedicine is cost-effective, and enables delivery of services where existing services are inadequate. The recent guidelines allow other healthcare workers to be involved in mental health service delivery. Hence, in addition to direct delivery of services, telerehabilitation can facilitate task-shifting, with mental health professionals mentoring and supervising existing human resources, such as ASHA workers, VRWs, DMHP programme staff, and others. Tele-rehabilitation also poses challenges - not all needs can be met; access and privacy can be a problem in resource-scarce settings; liaison with existing services is required; and organisations need to plan appropriately and re-allocate resources. Digital access to welfare benefits and interventions must be expanded without disadvantaging those without internet access. Yet, many rehabilitation interventions can be adapted to telemedicine platforms smoothly, and task-shifting can broaden access to care for persons with disability.","Jayarajan, Sivakumar, Torous, Thirthalli","https://doi.org/10.1177/0253717620963202","20201223","Community psychiatry; rehabilitation; telemedicine/telecare; telerehabilitation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-29","",8630,""
"Patient's Perspectives of Telepsychiatry: The Past, Present and Future","Access to mental health care has significant disparities due to treatment gap, more so particularly for the remotely residing, physically vulnerable, aging populations. Adoption of technology will enable more people to receive specialty care addressing distance, transportation and cost-related barriers to treatment engagement from the comfort of home. Telemedicine has been regarded as &quot;electronic personal protective equipment&quot; by reducing the number of physical contacts and risk contamination for patients during COVID-19 crisis. This review aimed to give a broad view of patients' perception of the use of telepsychiatry in terms of clinical outcome, cost-effectiveness, and solutions to address patients' challenges with the adoption of technology. Over the years, telepsychiatry, both in synchronous and asynchronous modalities, had shown to improve patients' adherence to treatment, follow-up rates, and clinical symptoms, overcome stigma and discrimination, and save cost expenses accessing health care with better satisfaction and usability outcomes. Its utility is widespread such as in delivering care emergency evaluation, crisis intervention, conducting neuropsychological assessments, psychotherapy, promoting lifestyle modification, enhancing self-efficacy, and overcoming patients' linguistic and cultural barriers to care. However, patients' privacy and confidentiality and psychiatrists' legal liability remain as matter of major concern in digital platform. To keep up with the pace of technology and patients' expectations, a more agile approach is essential to develop, improve, and evaluate telepsychiatric interventions.","Naik, Manjunatha, Kumar, Math, Moirangthem","https://doi.org/10.1177/0253717620963341","20201223","Access to mental health care; cyberpsychiatry; patientÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s perspective; telemedicine; telepsychiatry; userÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s perspective","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-12-29","",8631,""

The results showed that there were significant differences among parents of children with different challenges. Parents of children with autism spectrum disorder were more likely to have mental health problems compared to parents whose children had an intellectual disability or a visual or hearing impairment. Behavioral problems of children and psychological demands of parents were common factors predicting the mental health of all parents. Parent-child dysfunctional interactions and parenting distress were associated with parents of children with autism spectrum disorder.
