"Experiences and challenges faced by patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalised and participated in a randomised controlled trial: a qualitative study","As part of a randomised controlled trial, this qualitative study aimed to identify experiences and challenges of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 during illness and treatment (objective 1: COVID-19-related perspectives; objective 2: trial participation-related perspectives). Semistructured interviews following a prespecified interview guide, transcribed verbatim and analysed in accordance with the grounded theory process. Investigator triangulation served to ensure rigour of the analysis. Interviews were embedded in a multicentre, randomised, active-controlled, open-label platform trial testing efficacy and safety of experimental therapeutics for patients with COVID-19 (Austrian Corona Virus Adaptive Clinical Trial). 20 patients (60Ã‚Â±15 years) providing 21 interviews from 8 June 2020 to 25 April 2021. Qualitative data analysis revealed four central themes with subthemes. Theme 1, 'A Severe Disease', related to objective 1, was characterised by subthemes 'symptom burden', 'unpredictability of the disease course', 'fear of death' and 'long-term aftermaths with lifestyle consequences'. Theme 2, 'Saved and Burdened by Hospitalization', related to objective 1, comprised patients describing their in-hospital experience as 'safe haven' versus 'place of fear', highlighting the influence of 'isolation'. Theme 3, 'Managing One's Own Health', related to objective 1, showed how patients relied on 'self-management' and 'coping' strategies. Theme 4, 'Belief in Medical Research', related to objective 2, captured patients' 'motivation for study participation', many expressing 'information gaps' and 'situational helplessness' in response to study inclusion, while fewer mentioned 'therapy side-effects' and provided 'study reflection'. Investigator triangulation with an expert focus group of three doctors who worked at the study centre confirmed the plausibility of these results. Several of the identified themes (2, 3, 4) are modifiable and open for interventions to improve care of patients with COVID-19. Patient-specific communication and information is of utmost importance during clinical trial participation, and was criticised by participants of the present study. Disease self-management should be actively encouraged.

"Loneliness is associated with nutrition risk after the first wave of COVID-19 in community-dwelling older Canadians","Nutrition risk is linked to hospitalization, frailty, depression, and death. Loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic may have heightened nutrition risk. We sought to determine prevalence of high nutrition risk and if loneliness, mental health, and assistance with meal preparation/delivery were associated with risk in community-dwelling older adults (65+ years) after the first wave of COVID-19, in association analyses and when adjusting for meaningful covariates. Data were collected from May 12 to August 19, 2020. Descriptive statistics, association analyses, and linear regression analyses were conducted. For our total sample of 272 participants (78Ã‚Â±7.3 years old, 70% female), the median SCREEN-8 score (nutrition risk) was 35 [1st Quartile, 3rd Quartile: 29, 40] and 64% were at high risk (SCREEN-8 &lt; 38). Fifteen percent felt lonely two or more days a week. Loneliness and meal assistance were associated with high nutrition risk in association analyses. In multivariable analyses controlling for other lifestyle factors, loneliness was negatively associated with SCREEN-8 scores (-2.92, 95% CI [-5.51, -0.34]), as was smoking (-3.63, [-7.07, -0.19]). Higher SCREEN-8 scores were associated with higher education (2.71, [0.76, 4.66]), living with others (3.17, [1.35, 4.99]), higher self-reported health (0.11, [0.05, 0.16]), and resilience (1.28, [0.04, 2.52]). Loneliness was associated with nutrition risk in older adults after the first wave of COVID-19, but not mental health and meal assistance. Future research should consider longitudinal associations between loneliness, nutrition, and resilience.","Wei, Beauchamp, Vrkljan, Vesnaver, Giangregorio, Macedo, Keller","https://doi.org/10.1139/apnm-2022-0201","20221011","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-12","",38971,""
"Problematic Social Media Use and Its Relationship with Depression or Anxiety: A Systematic Review","There has been a notable increase in social media and Internet use over recent decades, not only for social interaction or entertainment, but also for working and meeting tools, as seen during the COVID-19 pandemic. A relationship between this usage and the development of mental illness is frequently hypothesized, but a few studies have empirical findings. This study is a systematic review of the relationship between social media use and depression or anxiety. Our Medline search yielded 1,747 papers. Our study found a strong and often bidirectional relationship between social media use and depression or anxiety. This relationship was frequently related to problematic social media use. No definite linear relationship was found between time spent using social media and depressive or anxious symptoms, but usually, the longer the time spent in that activity, the worse the outcomes. Factors related to problematic social media use were often different for men and women. Other variables may also play a role, such as nighttime-specific use, emotional involvement, and whether the individual behaves as an active or passive user. Evidence from this review provides a solid base for recommending cautious use of social media. Intense use and unhealthy habits, evidenced by addiction symptoms, may be problematic in less resilient individuals.","Lopes, Valentini, Monteiro, Costacurta, Soares, Telfar-Barnard, Nunes","https://doi.org/10.1089/cyber.2021.0300","20221011","anxiety; depression; problematic social media use; social media; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-12","",38972,""
"A chatbot to support New Zealand young people during the COVID-19 pandemic: Evaluation of a real world roll out of an open trial","The number of young people in New Zealand (Aotearoa) who experience mental health challenges is increasing. As those in Aotearoa went into the initial COVID-19 lockdown, an ongoing digital mental health project was adapted and underwent rapid content authoring to create the Aroha chatbot. This dynamic digital support was designed with and for young people to help manage pandemic-related worry. Aroha was developed to provide practical evidence-based tools for anxiety management using cognitive behavioral therapy, and positive psychology. The chatbot included practical ideas to maintain social and cultural connection, and to stay active and well. Stay at home orders under Aotearoa's lockdown commenced on 20 March 2020. By leveraging previously developed chatbot technology and broader existing online trial infrastructure, the Aroha chatbot was launched promptly on 7 April 2020. Dissemination of the chatbot for an open trial was via a URL, feedback on experience of the lockdown and on the experience of Aroha was gathered via online questionnaires, a focus group, and from community members. In the two weeks following the launch of the chatbot there were 393 registrations and 238 users logged into the chatbot, of whom 127 were in the target age range (13-24 years). Feedback guided iterative and responsive content authoring to suit the dynamic situation and motivated engineering to dynamically detect and react to a range of conversational intents. The experience of the implementation of the Aroha chatbot highlights the feasibility of providing timely event-specific digital mental health support, and the technology requirements for a flexible and enabling chatbot architectural framework.","Ludin, Holt-Quick, Hopkins, Stasiak, Hetrick, Warren, Cargo","https://doi.org/10.2196/38743","20221011","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-12","",38973,""
"Population Health Metrics During the Early Stages of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Correlative Pilot Study","COVID-19 has caused nearly 1 million deaths in the United States, not to mention job losses, business and school closures, stay-at-home orders, and mask mandates. Many people have suffered increased anxiety and depression since the pandemic began. Not only have mental health symptoms become more prevalent, but alcohol consumption has also increased during this time. Helplines offer important insight into both physical and mental wellness of a population by offering immediate, anonymous, cheap, and accessible resources for health and substance use that was unobstructed by many of the mandates of the pandemic. Further, the pandemic also launched the use of wastewater surveillance, which has the potential for tracking not only population infections but also consumption of substances such as alcohol. This study assessed the feasibility of using multiple public surveillance metrics, such as helpline calls, COVID-19 cases, and alcohol metabolites in wastewater, to better understand the need for interventions or public health programs in the time of a public health emergency. Ethanol metabolites were analyzed from wastewater collected twice weekly from September 29 to December 4, 2020, in a Midwestern state. Calls made to the helpline regarding housing, health care, and mental health/substance use were correlated with ethanol metabolites analyzed from wastewater samples, as well as the number of COVID-19 cases during the sampling period. Correlations were observed between COVID-19 cases and helpline calls regarding housing and health care needs. No correlation was observed between the number of COVID-19 cases and mental health/substance use calls. COVID-19 cases on Tuesdays were correlated with the alcohol metabolite ethyl glucuronide. Finally, ethyl glucuronide levels were negatively associated with mental health/substance use helpline calls. Although helpline calls provided critical services for health care and housing-related concerns early in the pandemic, evidence suggests helpline calls for mental health/substance use-related concerns were unrelated to COVID-19 metrics. Instead, COVID metrics were associated with alcohol metabolites in wastewater. Although formative research, with continued and expanded monitoring of population metrics, such as helpline usage, COVID-19 metrics, and wastewater, strategies can be implemented to create precision programs to address the needs of the population.","Severson, Cassada, Huber, Snow, McFadden","https://doi.org/10.2196/40215","20221011","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-12","",38974,""
"Association between medication adherence and health-related quality of life of patients with diabetes","The purpose was to evaluate the association between medication adherence and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients with diabetes. In this cross-sectional study, a total of 518 patients were recruited from the outpatient departments of different general public and private hospitals in Greece during the COVID-19 pandemic using a consecutive sampling method. HRQoL was assessed with the EQ-5D-5L instrument and medication adherence with the corresponding subscale of the Adherence Starts with Knowledge 20 questionnaire. The relationship between HRQoL and adherence was explored by employing Spearman's correlations and multiple binary logistic and linear stepwise regressions using robust standard errors. A total of 15.1 and 1.9% of the patients reported that they had taken a medicine either more or less often than prescribed in the last month and week, respectively. Statistically significant but modest correlations of medication non-adherence with the EQ-5D index (rhoÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.223), EQ-VAS (rhoÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.230), and all the HRQoL domains (rho ranging from 0.211, for pain/discomfort, to 0.136, for mobility issues) were found. These significant associations persisted even after controlling for several other known potential factors of HRQoL in the multivariable analyses, except for the mobility and anxiety/depression dimensions. Medication non-adherence appears to be independently associated with lower HRQoL and health levels in patients with diabetes. It is crucial to plan interventions to enhance medication adherence not only to obtain greater value from the available resources, but also to improve HRQoL of patients with diabetes.","Chantzaras, Yfantopoulos","https://doi.org/10.1007/s42000-022-00400-y","20221011","Compliance; Diabetes mellitus; Greece; Medication adherence; Quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-12","",38975,""

"A ""health message"" on sustainable physical and mental health for the prolonged COVID-19 and other pandemics","The world has been living with another pandemic physical inactivity (PI) and sedentary behavior (SB) and of other nature for years. As social measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 have been strengthened, the physical activity (PA) barrier has been hit and the PI/SB pandemic has been exacerbated, and in the current situation, triggered by its prolonged period, it is emerging as a problem to be considered in order to combat the PI/SB pandemic through PA and to maintain continuous physical and mental health. This review aims to summarize existing and recent studies on the effects of PA/SB on physical and mental health in preparation for the context of prolonged COVID-19 and provides an easy and fun way to motivate, access PA, and PA recommendations for maintaining physical and mental health. We performed search strategies on PubMed, Medline, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases, and used a literature review of the current available literature on the COVID-19 and the effects of PI, SB, and PA on physical and mental health. The clinical relevance of this review shows that integrating PA into daily life and reducing prolonged sitting time is an important strategy for continuing a healthy life physically and mentally. As a result, for those who have not yet incorporated exercise as part of their daily routine, fun and easy access to PA suggests that in the long run, may be an opportunity to implement newer habits. In addition, in an emergency such as the COVID-19 quarantine period or other pandemics, it is essential for one to maintain health through PA at home, and underscore the ""health message"" of the current review that reducing SB, progressively increasing PA, and doing more PA regularly in the current context prolonged COVID-19 can bring significant benefits to long-term habits and physical and mental health.","So, Kwon","https://doi.org/10.1080/00325481.2022.2134693","20221011","COVID-19; health; mental health; physical activity; physical health; physical inactivity; sedentary behavior","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-12","",38977,""
"Endobariatrics: well past infancy and maturing rapidly","This review summarizes the key developments with regard to FDA-approved endoscopic bariatric metabolic therapies (EBMTs) in the last 2Ã¢â‚¬Å years. The prevalence of obesity has increased during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and obesity worsens COVID-19 related outcomes. Several studies have confirmed the safety and short-term efficacy of intragastric balloons (IGBs). In the short-term IGBs may improve steatosis and fibrosis in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and improve quality of life and mental health. Unfortunately weight loss from these temporarily placed devices is not sustained long-term. Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) may be more effective and durable than IGBs, and result in fewer adverse events compared to bariatric surgery. The recently completed MERIT trial may catapult ESG as a first-line EBMT. Aspiration therapy meets safety and effectiveness thresholds for incorporation into routine practice, but overall acceptance has been lower than other FDA-approved EBMTs. The field of endobariatrics is rapidly maturing. Significant knowledge gaps remain with regards to combining EBMTs with pharmacologic therapy to improve durability of weight loss. The rapid expansion in the literature supporting safety and long-term efficacy ESG may prompt revision of existing guidelines.","Shrestha, Shrestha, Shah","https://doi.org/10.1097/MOG.0000000000000884","20221011","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-12","",38978,""
"Receipt of Out-of-State Telemedicine Visits Among Medicare Beneficiaries During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, states implemented temporary changes allowing physicians without a license in their state to provide care to their residents. There is an ongoing debate at both the federal and state levels on whether to change licensure rules permanently to facilitate out-of-state telemedicine use. To describe out-of-state telemedicine use during the pandemic. This cross-sectional study of telemedicine visits included all patients with traditional Medicare from January through June 2021. Telemedicine visits from January through June 2021 where the patient's home address and the physician's practice address were in different states. In describing which patients and specialties were using out-of-state telemedicine, we focused on the period between January to June 2021. We chose this period because it was after the turmoil of the early pandemic, when vaccines became widely available and the health care system had stabilized, but before many of the temporary licensing regulations began to lapse by mid-2021. In the first half of 2021, there were 8Ã¢â‚¬Â¯392Ã¢â‚¬Â¯092 patients with a telemedicine visit and, of these, 422Ã¢â‚¬Â¯547 (5.0%) had 1 or more out-of-state telemedicine visits. Those who lived in a county close to a state border (within 15 miles) accounted for 57.2% of all out-of-state telemedicine visits. Among the out-of-state visits in this time period, 64.3% were with a primary care or mental health clinician. For 62.6% of all out-of-state visits, a prior in-person visit occurred between the same patient and clinician between March 2019 and the visit. The demographics and conditions treated were similar for within-state and out-of-state telemedicine visits, with several notable exceptions. Among those with a telemedicine visit, people in rural communities were more likely to receive out-of-state telemedicine care (33.8% vs 21.0%), and there was high of out-of-state telemedicine use for cancer care (9.8% of all telemedicine visits for cancer care). The findings of this cross-sectional study suggest that licensure restrictions of out-of-state telemedicine would have had the largest effect on patients who lived near a state border, those in rural locales, and those who received primary care or mental health treatment.","Mehrotra, Huskamp, Nimgaonkar, Chaiyachati, Bressman, Richman","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamahealthforum.2022.3013","20221011","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-12","",38979,""
"The impact of COVID-19 on the psychosocial well-being of older adults: A literature review","The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19) was declared a global pandemic in 2020 with the greatest risk to older adults. Prolonged restrictions and isolation threaten the social and emotional welfare of vulnerable groups with concerns focused on the long-term impact of this pandemic on the health and well-being of aging populations. Using the Socioemotional Selectivity Theory (STT) as a conceptual framework, the purpose of this literature review was to explore the impact of COVID-19 on the psychological and social well-being of older adults. Numerous academic and healthcare-related databases were searched to yield 24 relevant primary research articles, published during the pandemic (2020-2022), for analysis. Overall results indicated the pandemic had a significant negative affect on the psychological and social well-being of older adults to include those with cognitive impairments and dementia despite perceptions of reduced awareness. There were significant differences between age groups with older adults reporting greater emotional stability and coping skills than younger cohorts. Although supportive services and the use of technology-enhanced well-being these resources were reduced during the pandemic due to lack of trained staff, funding, and other socioeconomic or political barriers. The SST proposes that feelings of satisfaction, a sense of belonging, and purpose are important for emotional well-being but the pandemic challenged these goals and, for many, resulted in stress, anxiety, and depression. Healthcare providers and policymakers need to be aware of the negative consequences triggered by the prolonged pandemic and take measures to provide services that support the psychosocial well-being of older adults.","Seckman","https://doi.org/10.1111/jnu.12824","20221011","anxiety; depression; gerontology; health policy; mental health; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-12","",38980,""
"[COVID-19 and chronic pain: online survey in the domestic population]","The problems caused by the COVID-19 epidemic have the worst impact on chronic patient populations. People with chronic pain are one of the most vulnerable groups due to stress, disruption of daily routine, family problems, illness and difficulty in hospital care. It is therefore essential to assess the situation and mental well-being of this group. The aim of this survey was to assess chronic pain patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, addressing psychological background factors that might affect pain symptoms, such as depression, emotion regulation, alexithymia, well-being, health literacy and social support. 158 people participated in the survey, reporting pain for at least 3 months but had not received medical treatment. Data was collected at two dates: February and December 2021. Participants completed an online questionnaire due to the pandemic situation. The following six psychological questionnaires were used in the survey: Toronto Alexithymia Scale, Beck Depression Inventory 9-item version, Difficulty in Emotion Regulation Scale, Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, Chew-questions measuring health literacy, WHO Well-being Index. The participants ranged from 20 to 80 years in age, of whom 140 (88%) were female. 42 participants (27%) achieved severe alexithymia. 118 people (75%) had depression, of which 72 people (46%) had mild depression, 26 (16%) had moderate depression, and 20 (13%) had severe depression. The degree of pain and alexithy-mia (r(158) = 0.16, p = 0.004), depression (r(158) = 0.41, p &lt; 0.001), difficulties in emotion regulation (r(158) = 0.26, p = 0.004), and health literacy, and difficulties in emotion regulation (r(158) = 0.25, p = 0.001) were positively and significantly related. In addition to the characteristic comorbidities of people living with pain (e.g. anxiety, emotion disorder, sleep disorder), the epidemic-induced prolonged social isolation, stress and fear of illness may explain the proportion of high depression, emotion regulation difficulties or health literacy problems in the study sample which exacerbate alexithymia and the degree of pain. Based on these results it is important to draw the attention of professionals to the appropriate health care and educational needs of those affected.

"Factors associated with insomnia symptoms: A cross-sectional study during a Covid-19 fully restrictive lockdown","Insomnia is the most frequent sleep disorder and a public health concern that increased during the Covid 19 pandemic. Fully restrictive lockdowns during Covid are interesting periods to examine the impact of environmental and behavioural changes on the emergence of insomnia symptoms. In this cross-sectional study we aimed to (1) determine the main factors associated with insomnia symptoms during a Covid-19 fully restrictive lockdown examining the associated daily life alterations and (2) create a predictive model of insomnia symptoms. We used the data drawn from the ""Covid-RythmE"" study that reached volunteers from the general French population through an online survey during the last 2Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks of the 2 month full lockdown. Associations with insomnia symptoms were tested and significant associations were entered in a Backward Stepwise Logistic Regression (BSLR) to assess the best combination to classify individuals with or without insomnia symptoms. From the 1624 participants, 50.64% suffered from mild to severe insomnia symptoms as assessed by the ISI. The best combination for explaining insomnia symptoms with 74.26% of accuracy included: age (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.15), females (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.26), smaller home sizes (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.77), environmental noises (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.59), anxiety symptoms (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.24), depressive symptoms (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.15), regularity of sleep-wake schedules (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.25), exposure to screen during the morning (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.13), and LED light during the evening (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.17). Thus, lifestyle schedule and exposure to natural synchronizers such as light, are primordial in considering in insomnia physiopathology, prevention and treatment, as well as the associated mental health status.","Christodoulou, Bertrand, Palagini, Frija-Masson, d'Ortho, Lejoyeux, Riemann, Maruani, Geoffroy","https://doi.org/10.1111/jsr.13752","20221011","chronotype; covid-19; insomnia; sleep disorders; sleep habits; sleep-wake cycles","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-12","",38982,""
"Has the COVID-19 pandemic influenced suicide rates differentially according to socioeconomic indices and ethnicity? More evidence is needed globally","The COVID-19 pandemic has harmed many people's mental health globally. Whilst the evidence generated thus far from high-income countries regarding the pandemic's impact on suicide rates is generally reassuring, we know little about its influence on this outcome in lower- and middle-income countries or among marginalised and disadvantaged people. There are some signals for concern regarding the pandemic's potentially unequal impact on suicide rates, with some of the affected demographic subgroups and regions being at elevated risk before the pandemic began. However, the evidence-base for this topic is currently sparse, and studies conducted to date have generally not taken account of pre-pandemic temporal trends. The collection of accurate, complete and comparable data on suicide rate trends in ethnic minority and low-income groups should be prioritised. The vulnerability of low-income groups will likely be exacerbated further by the current energy supply and cost-of-living crises in many countries. It is therefore crucial that reassuring messaging highlighting the stability of suicide rates during the pandemic does not lead to complacency among policymakers.","Webb, John, Knipe, BojaniÃ„â€¡, Dekel, Eyles, Marchant, Mughal, Pirkis, Schmidt, Gunnell","https://doi.org/10.1017/S2045796022000543","20221011","Economic issues; epidemiology; social factors; suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-12","",38983,""
"Comparison of anxiety and depressive symptoms of head and neck cancer patients in a closed-loop management system before and during the 2019 coronavirus pandemic: a comparative study","The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) poses an unprecedented challenge to health and the financial system, especially the healthcare of patients with cancer. However, the research on the negative effect of the pandemic on the anxiety and depressive symptoms of cancer patients in closed-loop is rarely reported at present. In view of the limitations of previous studies. In this study, we compared the anxiety and depressive symptoms of head and neck cancer patients in the closed-loop management system before and during the 2019 coronavirus pandemic. In this comparative study, a total of 526 head and neck cancer patients (269 and 257 patients before and during the COVID-19 pandemic) were enrolled in the present study. The two groups of patients' median age (53 years, 52 years), female distribution (70.26%, 66.15%) and male distribution (29.74%, 33.85%) were analyzed before and after the COVID-19 epidemic. They received questionnaires using the standardized data forms of Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) to collect the relevant data of patients for retrospective investigation. For data analysis, either the chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test was employed for categorical variables, and we described the time trend of psychological states before and after the outbreak with Cochran-Armitage trend (CAT) test. A total of 526 head and neck cancer patients were included in the final analysis; 26.85% and 50.19% of cases experienced anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 epidemic. In contrast, 18.22% and 33.46% of cases had experienced anxiety and depression before the pandemic. According to the statistical results, the prevalence of anxiety and depression in patients during the COVID-19 epidemic was higher compared to that of patients prior to the pandemic (P=0.018). More importantly, both anxiety and depression incidence trends increased significantly before and after the outbreak of COVID-19 (P=0.000). The present study demonstrates the significant impact of COVID-19 on the psychological states of cancer patients in the case of closed-loop management system, effectively indicating the need for appropriate changes in treatment decisions, enhanced psychotherapy, and interventions to reduce the incidence of anxiety, depression, and even suicide during this pandemic.","Liu, Yu, Qiu, Luo, Fang, Yang, Xu, Zeng","https://doi.org/10.21037/apm-22-1013","20221011","Coronavirus disease of 2019 epidemic (COVID-19 epidemic); anxiety symptoms; closed-loop management; depressive symptoms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-12","",38984,""
"Prevalence and associated risk factors for mental health problems among female university students during COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study findings from Dhaka, Bangladesh","The COVID-19 pandemic has tremendously affected the physical and mental health of people at all levels worldwide. The present study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and contributing factors for mental health problems among female university students in the urban area of Bangladesh. We conducted this online cross-sectional study among 451 female university students. Here we assessed the symptomatic prevalence of common mental health problems among the participants. The prevalence rate of loneliness, anxiety, and depressive symptoms among female university students in Bangladesh was 55.88%, 69.18%, and 45.23%, respectively. Also, we noticed that mild, moderate, and severe symptoms of loneliness, generalized anxiety, and depression were 36.90%, 40.48%, and 22.62%; 48.08%, 22.44%, and 29.48%; and 37.31%, 26.87%, and 35.52%; respectively. According to the present study results, marital status, financial condition, education level, and family structure (nuclear/joint) are potential contributing factors to mental health problems among female university students living in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted the academic performance and emotional well-being of students in Bangladesh. Also, the closure of university classes for a long time in Bangladesh was responsible for the poor mental health of students. Promoting good mental health has become a vital public health concern during this ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Female university students residing in urban areas in Bangladesh are more prone to developing mental health problems during any crisis. Therefore, the healthcare authorities of Bangladesh should promote the good mental health of students during and after the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Keeping in touch with students to support them psychologically and mentally during the pandemic is crucial for promoting their good mental health.","Nahar, Sohan, Supti, Hossain, Shahriar, Bhuiyan, Islam","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e10890","20221011","Anxiety; Bangladesh; Covid-19; Depression; Loneliness; Mental health; Students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-12","",38985,""
"An 18-month follow-up of the Covid-19 psychology research consortium study panel: Survey design and fieldwork procedures for Wave 6","Established in March 2020, the C19PRC Study monitors the psychological and socio-economic impact of the pandemic in the UK and other countries. This paper describes the protocol for Wave 6 (August-September 2021). The survey assessed: COVID-19 related experiences; experiences of common mental health disorders; psychological characteristics; and social and political attitudes. Adult participants from any previous wave (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 3170) were re-invited, and sample replenishment procedures helped manage attrition. Weights were calculated using a survey raking algorithm to ensure the on-going original panel (from baseline) was nationally representative in terms of gender, age, and household income, amongst other factors. 1643 adults were re-interviewed at Wave 6 (51.8% retention rate). Non-participation was higher younger adults, those born outside UK, and adults living in cities. Of the adults recruited at baseline, 54.3% (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1100) participated in Wave 6. New respondent (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 415) entered the panel at this wave, resulting in cross-sectional sample for Wave 6 of 2058 adults. The raking procedure re-balanced the longitudinal panel to within 1.3% of population estimates for selected socio-demographic characteristics.

"Lifting lockdown: Renewed access to arts and cultural activities","The effects of COVID-19 on mental health are profound. While there is a growing body of evidence on arts supporting mental health, the re-engagement with in-person arts and cultural activity has remained slow following the lifting of restrictions. Interviews with 14 representatives, including providers and practitioners, from 12 arts and cultural organisations within the Liverpool City Region (LCR) were conducted. The aim was to examine the impact of COVID-19 restrictions easing on arts and cultural provision in the LCR, and on the mental health and wellbeing of those whom arts and cultural organisations serve, including those who would usually access arts through formal healthcare routes (e.g., those usually served via arts organisations' partnership with health or social care providers). Data were analysed using framework analysis. Three overarching themes were identified: The new normal: 'Out of crisis comes innovation'; Complexities of operating 'in the new COVID world'; and Reimagining arts in mental healthcare. As engagement in community and cultural activities plays a public health role, a hybrid delivery of arts and culture - ensuring continued online access alongside in-person provision - will be vital for people's recovery. Alongside efforts to reimagine arts in mental healthcare in the wake of the crisis caused by the pandemic, the role of arts and culture in providing stigma-free environments to reconnect the vulnerable and isolated is more critical than ever. Recommendations on the role of arts and culture in sustaining the mental health and wellbeing of the population and embedding the arts within clinical care and public health prevention schemes are provided.","Worsley, Billington, Balabanova, Chapple","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-14282-7","20221010","COVID-19; Hybridity; Public mental health; Re-connecting; Renewed access; Social prescribing; Wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-12","",38987,""
"Obstructive Sleep Apnea with COVID-19","The novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) and the ensuing pandemic have greatly impacted the global healthcare system due to its high infectiousness, associated high mortality, and a complete lack of immunity in the population. Globally, the COVID-19 pandemic has unleashed a health crisis that has not only seriously disrupted people's lives but also affected their normal sleep, along with physical and mental health; this situation is especially exacerbated in people suffering from pre-existing conditions, such as sleep apnea. A recent meta-analysis of 18 studies by Miller et al. (September 2020) showed that obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is related to higher mortality and morbidity in patients with COVID-19 and is most likely independent of other risk factors. A recent meta-analysis indicated that COVID-19 patients with OSA are more severely affected than those without OSA, thereby providing further evidence that concurrent OSA may elevate the severity of COVID-19 infection, along with the risk of mortality. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the diagnosis and therapeutic management of patients with OSA. Thus, it is necessary to identify and develop new diagnostic and therapeutic avenues in the future. In this context, the current study summarizes known associations between COVID-19 and OSA and the regular diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for OSA in the light of COVID-19 pandemic prevention and control.","Huang, Chen, Fietze, Penzel","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-06413-5_17","20221010","Coronavirus disease-2019; Diagnosis; Obstructive sleep apnea; Treatment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-12","",38988,""
"Anxiety, insomnia, and depression during COVID-19 lockdown in elite individual and team sport athletes","Pandemic-induced lockdowns disrupted sport training and competition. We aimed to identify the impact on the mental health of high-level athletes and clarify whether the effects differ for team-based and individual athletes. This cross-sectional survey, stratified by sex and sport type, collected demographic data and mental health measurements from 274 Brazilian high-performance athletes (142 from team sports and 132 from individual sports) involved with the Brazilian Olympic Committee program for the Tokyo Olympics 2021. Depression, disturbed sleep, and anxiety were assessed by the 9-Item Patient Health Questionnaire, 7-Item Insomnia Severity Index, and 7-Item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale respectively. Responses were analyzed dichotomously according to published threshold values, characterizing the relative frequency distribution of prevalence (PCRS) or non-prevalence of clinically relevant symptoms (NPCRS). Out of all participants, 47 [17.1%], Z(274) = 15.38, p = .001, 32 [11.7%], Z(274) = 17.94, p = .001, and 49 [17.9%], Z(274) = 15.04, p = .001 had PCRS of anxiety, insomnia, and depression, respectively. There were no significant differences in the PCRS among genders. Compared with individual sport athletes, team sport athletes were more likely to report PCRS of insomnia (12 [37.5%] vs 20 [62.5%], Z(274) = -2.00, p = .046), and depression (18 [36.7%] vs 31 [63.3%], Z(274) = -2.63, p = .009) but not for anxiety. Athletes reported high levels of mental health problems during the lockdown. Team sport athletes reported worse symptoms of insomnia and depression than individual sport athletes, possibly due to the impact of unaccustomed social isolation and lack of social team activity. Therefore, it becomes relevant to consider psychological support to team sport athletes who for some reason, such as a pandemic, enduring crisis even injury rehabilitation needs to be isolated.","Salles, Silva, Wolff, Orwert, Ribeiro, Velasques, Morrissey","https://doi.org/10.1186/s41155-022-00233-z","20221010","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Individual athletes; Insomnia; Team sports","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-12","",38989,""
"Internet use and psychological wellbeing among older adults in England: a difference-in-differences analysis over the COVID-19 pandemic","Longitudinal evidence on how Internet use affects the psychological wellbeing of older adults has been mixed. As policymakers invest in efforts to reduce the digital divide, it is important to have robust evidence on whether encouraging Internet use among older adults is beneficial, or potentially detrimental, to their wellbeing. We observe depressive symptoms and loneliness of adults aged 50 + in the nationally representative English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, from before (2018/19) to during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (June/July and November/December 2020). Our quasi-experimental difference-in-differences strategy compares within-individual wellbeing changes between older adults who desired to use the Internet more but experienced barriers including lack of skills, access, and equipment, with regular Internet users who did not desire to use the Internet more. To reduce selection bias, we match both groups on demographic and socioeconomic characteristics that are predictive of Internet use. We assume that in the absence of COVID-19 - a period of increased reliance on the Internet - the wellbeing trajectories of both groups would have followed a common trend. Compared with matched controls (<i>N</i> = 2983), participants reporting barriers to Internet use (<i>N</i> = 802) experienced a greater increase in the likelihood of depressive symptoms from before to during the pandemic, but not worse loneliness levels. This effect was stronger for women, those aged above 65 years, and those from lower-income households. Besides enabling access to digital services, efforts to ensure older adults continue to be engaged members of an increasingly digital society could deliver returns in terms of a buffer against psychological distress.","Kung, Steptoe","https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291722003208","20221011","Barriers to Internet use; English Longitudinal Study of Ageing; depression; digital divide; loneliness; quasi-experimental study","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-12","",38990,""
