"Prevalence and Factors Associated with Mental Illness Symptoms among School Students Post Lockdown of the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United Arab Emirates: A Cross-Sectional National Study","Data from the United Arab Emirates about the mental health status of the younger population is limited. The current study aimed to assess the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and risk for PTSD among school students post lockdown of the current COVID 19 pandemic. Findings showed that the risk for PTSD was the most prevalent, followed by symptoms of anxiety, and depression. For gender differences, symptoms of the three conditions were higher in female students. Moreover, symptoms of depression and anxiety were found to be higher among late adolescents. Further analysis revealed that having medical problems and witnessing the death of a close family member due to COVID 19 were positive predictors associated with PTDS, depression, and anxiety. The study concluded that post COVID 19 lockdown, symptoms of anxiety, depression, and risk for PTSD are prevalent among students in the UAE. Researchers recommend the initiation of a national school mental health screening program and the provision of follow up services for vulnerable students. Another must have is the integration of a mental health support system in the emergency and disaster preparedness future plans.","Nariman Ghader; Noor Al Mheiri; Asma Fikri; Hira AbdulRazzak; Hassan Saleheen; Basema Saddik; Yousef Aljawarneh; Heyam Dalky; Ammar Al Banna; Shamma Al Memari; Budoor Al Shehhi; Shereena Al Mazrouei; Omniyat Al Hajeri","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.07.20.22277866","20220721","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-22","",34699,""
"Parents of Preadolescentsâ€™ Experiences of Childâ€“Parent Relationship Therapy","Preadolescence is a time of emotional, physical, social, and relational changes, which can lead to mental health concerns. Parents of preadolescents also experience changes within their roles as parents, and both parents and preadolescents experienced a wide range of changes and challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. This phenomenological study explored the experiences of parents of preadolescents after participating in a virtual Child-Parent Relationship Therapy (CPRT) intervention. Participants were seven parents ages 35 to 56Â years-old with preadolescent children between the ages of 9 to 12Â years-old. Semi-structured interviews were conducted following the CPRT intervention and analyzed using an adaptation of classic data analysis. Six themes were found, including impact of group on learning, childâ€™s engagement with parent, child qualities, parentâ€™s understanding of self, importance of parent-child relationship, and integration of CPRT skills. The emerging themes indicated that the seven participants experienced changes in themselves, in their child, and in their parent-child relationships. Participants discussed their experiences with the virtual format and their integration of CPRT skills. The participants also reported feeling closeness and support from other group members, even with the virtual format. Findings from this study highlight several clinical implications for working with parents of preadolescents virtually using CPRT.

"IoT-Galvanized pandemic special E-Toilet for generation of sanitized environment","The entire world is enmeshing the pandemic COVID-19, which affected the public health and it is spread all over the world. Every countryâ€™s authority is making more and more efforts towards maintaining the public health as well as mental health and are developing the vaccination to control the COVID-19. As COVID-19 is an infected disease for which a sanitized environment must be chosen at top most priority to prevent infection. Most of the countries are facing the problem of incrementing the infection rate of COVID due to griminess problems. Most healthcare industries are also working to create a sanitized environment with incorporation of the Internet of Things (IoT) which is resulting in the smart health care appliances for generating the sanitized environment. In this paper the researchers have developed an IoT- Galvanized Pandemic Special E-Toilet for generation of sanitized environment which resolves the issues of griminess problem. The proposed architecture has been comprising with three levels of working methodology as Occupancy Check, Auto Flush and Auto control of Appliances using Mobile Application. It is implemented using a raspberry pi board, Arduino Uno as a core unit of the system with interfacing the peripherals: IR sensor, Ultrasonic sensor and HC05 Bluetooth module, servo motor, Relay module, CFL lamp and LED. The proposed architecture has been simulated individually using single piece of sensor, then later assembled all the peripheral together and simulated. The proposed architecture can be used in field of education, industries, corporate offices, multiplexes, hospitals etc. [ FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Journal of Discrete Mathematical Sciences & Cryptography is the property of Taylor & Francis Ltd and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

"Patientsâ€™ attachment avoidance and their perceived quality of the real relationship predict patientsâ€™ attitudes towards telepsychotherapy","During the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, patients in individual psychotherapy needed to suddenly transition to telepsychotherapy (TPT), and for many patients it was their first experience of remote treatment. Since TPT appears to be here to stay after the pandemic ends, it is crucial to understand which factors determine whether TPT is a good fit for patients. We aimed to examine patientsâ€™ relational predictors, both trait- (attachment avoidance and attachment anxiety) and state-like (working alliance, real relationship) of patientsâ€™ attitudes towards TPT, and the potential mediating role of state-like relational variables between trait-like variables and attitudes. We used a longitudinal design, where patients (N = 719) who were in individual TPT participated in an online survey at the beginning of the pandemic and at follow-up three months later. Patients completed measures of symptom severity, Covid-related distress, attachment anxiety and avoidance, perceived quality of the therapeutic relationship (working alliance and real relationship), and attitude towards TPT. Results suggested that higher levels of attachment avoidance predicted more negative attitudes towards TPT, and that patient-reported quality of the real relationship in their TPT sessions mediated this negative relationship between attachment avoidance and attitudes towards TPT. Patientâ€™s attachment avoidance and the real relationship are important predictors of patientsâ€™ attitudes towards TPT, and could indicate suitability of the TPT format, as well as inform cliniciansâ€™ efforts in building a real and genuine connection with their patients online.

"Creating Knowledge Assets under Biocapitalism: Analyzing Chinaâ€™s Biomedical Industry and Its Patent Networks","Breakthroughs in biotechnology, globalizing intellectual property rights legislations, and growing venture capital in the past thirty years have given rise to new forms of capitalist accumulation that scholars called biocapitalism. Bioscientific knowledge under biocapitalism is increasingly parceled out from a global common to private enclosures for biotech and pharmaceutical companies, contributing to vast inequalities and fractures of global access to innovation evident in the COVID-19 pandemic. The assetization and financialization of knowledge have shifted the ground of innovation from competitive commodity production and exchanges to generating, managing, and commercializing patents and associated monopoly rights, thus raising the challenges of innovation for those developing countries specialized in production. Many Asian countries have invested heavily in biomedical sciences to enhance their knowledge assets but had limited success in translating the scientific development to a globally significant biomedical industry. This article discusses the evolution of Chinaâ€™s biomedical industry from a technological laggard to a recent innovation boom after a regulatory overhaul in 2015. Analyzing the patent collaborative networks of Chinaâ€™s biomedical industry since 2003, we found the central roles of domestic public research institutions, in contrast to multinational corporations, as cutting-edge knowledge providers. We argue that Chinaâ€™s path of the biomedical industry is distinct from its other technology industries that rely on multinational corporations for core knowledge. It represents a national articulation in response to global biocapitalism by situating the domestic research institutions and biomedical firms at the center of knowledge assets production and engaging globally in the science and drug regulatory systems.

"Illness stigma, health anxiety, illness intrusiveness, and depressive symptoms in adolescents and young adults: A path model","Adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with a chronic medical condition (CMC) transition to adulthood with the burden of independently managing their health care. AYAs with a CMC are at elevated risk for depression, and available research suggests that illness-related cognitive appraisals play a critical role in this risk. Bakula et al. (2019) demonstrated that illness stigma and illness intrusiveness are two particularly salient cognitive appraisals (illness stigma -&gt; illness intrusiveness -&gt; depressive symptoms). The present study replicated and extended those findings by testing health anxiety as a mediator between stigma and illness intrusiveness in the serial mediation model (illness stigma -&gt; health anxiety -&gt; illness intrusiveness -&gt; depressive symptoms). College students (N = 97) with a CMC completed self-report measures of illness-related stigma, health-related anxiety, illness intrusiveness, and depressive symptoms. The illness stigma -&gt; illness intrusiveness -&gt; depressive symptoms simple mediation path was significant, ab = .50, 95% CI [0.27-0.73]. The illness stigma -&gt; health anxiety -&gt; illness intrusiveness -&gt; depressive symptoms serial mediation path was also significant, a1d21b2 = 0.16, 95% CI [0.05-0.31]. Illness stigma indirectly related to depressive symptoms through the consecutive influence of illness stigma on health anxiety and health anxiety on illness intrusiveness. The present study replicated and extended findings by Bakula et al. by identifying that illness stigma may elicit anxiety about health and amplify perceived illness intrusiveness, thus increasing depressive symptoms in AYAs with a CMC. These findings further confirm the importance of assessing cognitive appraisals among AYAs with a CMC. When working with AYAs with a CMC who endorse depression, it may be particularly important to assess health anxiety, illness stigma, and illness intrusiveness.

"Introduction to the Special Issue on Exceptional Canadian Contributions to Research in Depression","Major Depressive Disorder is a highly prevalent, recurrent, and debilitating condition, affecting more than 264 million individuals worldwide. Canadian researchers have made significant contributions to the scientific understanding and treatment of depression. For example, Canada ranks first in the world on the number of articles published on depression (and second on papers determined to be Highly Cited in Field) when considering the proportion of researchers in each country. Canadian psychologists have played a critical role in advancing our knowledge of the epidemiology, vulnerability, treatment, and prevention of depression. This special issue presents a series of state-of-the-art empirical reviews that highlight many of the important contributions-covering cognitive vulnerability, perfectionism, epidemiology, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), mindfulness, and emotion-focused therapy-that Canadian psychologists have made to our understanding of depression. Some of the key themes from these reviews are summarized in this editorial. Aside from featuring outstanding scholarship, this special issue also serves as a tribute honoring the monumental contributions that many Canadian psychologists have made and as a catalyst to inspire next generation of depression researchers in Canada.Alternate :La dÃ©pression majeure (aussi appelÃ©e Â« dÃ©pression clinique Â») est un trouble trÃ¨s rÃ©pandu, pÃ©riodique et dÃ©bilitant qui touche plus de 264 millions d'individus de par le monde. Les chercheurs et les chercheures du Canada ont grandement contribuÃ© aux connaissances scientifiques sur la dÃ©pression et sur ses traitements. Par exemple, le Canada est au premier rang dans le monde pour le nombre d'articles publiÃ©s sur la dÃ©pression (et au deuxiÃ¨me rang parmi les plus citÃ©s dans le domaine) lorsqu'on tient compte de la proportion de chercheurs dans chaque pays. Les psychologues canadiens ont jouÃ© un rÃ´le dÃ©terminant dans l'avancement des connaissances sur l'Ã©pidÃ©miologie, la vulnÃ©rabilitÃ©, le traitement et la prÃ©vention de la dÃ©pression.

"The insecure skin-ego: Conspiracy theories as a source of containment in a pandemic","In analyzing the psychological reactions to the recent COVID-19 pandemic, we have tried to show that the existing societal protective skin that gives unity to people by creating a secure containment was too thin and fragile to cope with an annihilation situation such as the pandemic. This healthy and protective societal skin acts continuously as a maternal environment, providing physical and mental security. As a modest contribution, we provide psychoanalytic, social, cultural, and political analyses of the conspiracy theories and infodemics in the mid-COVID-19 era. We extend Anzieu's theory of skin-ego from a maternal-centered conceptualization to one based on a wider range of caregivers, including politicians, health care professionals, scientists, and researchersâ€”who act as the suppliers of containment. During the pandemic, the common protective skin showed initial flexibility as it tried to regenerate a secure common skin with the help of the health care system and other state organizations responsible for managing the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the common protective skin is under continuous attack by various politicians around the world, like the hyper-masculine figure of Donald Trump who attacked this common skin, increasing the insecurity and helplessness of people. Like hermit crabs, thin-skinned people with insecure skin-egos sought refuge inside the shell of Trump's safer and thicker skin. A shell of conspiracy theories and infodemics provided by crustacean Trump functioned as a thick, protective skin. To illustrate our ideas, we present events and reactions from the pandemic and also cite two illustrative examplesâ€”the story of Noah's Ark and the children's classic, The Three Little Pigs.

In the original article, the second affiliation lacks information;therefore the information of ''Islamic Science University of Malaysia (USIM)'' has been added in parenthesis. The article has been updated in the journal's archive. You may access the updated article via the link below.] Objective: Long-term social distancing, isolation, and economic fallout may be significant psychological triggers during pandemic, such as COVID-19, especially for those with underlying psychiatric illness. This study was conducted to address the psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic among patients with depression based at a teaching hospital in Malaysia. Methods: This is a cross-sectional online study among patients with depression from University Malaya Medical Centre, using Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale-Self Assessment (MADRS-S), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (KAP), and Social Media Addiction during COVID-19 Pandemic (SMACOP). Results: One hundred seventy-eight patients participated in this study. The mean total of the KAP score is 12.65 (SD = 2.65), with knowledge section (mean = 7.34 [SD = 2.13]), attitudes section (mean = 2.63 [SD = 0.58]), and practices section (mean = 2.69 [SD = 1.00]). They scored moderately on the MADRS-S (mean = 21.03 [SD = 4.62]) and ISI (mean = 20.25 [SD = 4.62]) but had high GAD-7 scores (mean = 16.8 (SD = 6.27]). From the multiple logistic regression analyses, depressive symptoms of greater severity (MADRS-S 18-34) are significantly associated with more severe insomnia (P &lt; .001, adjusted OR = 9.101, 95% CI: 3.613-22.924). Furthermore, the high anxiety level is associated with the younger age group (P = .029, Adjusted OR = 2.274, 95% CI: 1.090-4.746), greater severity of insomnia (P &lt; .001, Adjusted OR = 22.9, 95% CI: 6.145-85.343), and higher risk of COVID-19 related social media addiction (P = .011, adjusted OR = 2.637, 95% CI: 1.253-5.550). Conclusion: This study demonstrates the high levels of sleep disturbances and anxiety symptoms experienced by outpatients with depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. These are closely linked to the younger age group and at-risk social media addiction related to COVID-19.

The introduction of anti-epidemic measures with different duration and severity temporarily deprived of any of democratic freedoms and achievements and marked social communication with new rules. The tension and fear of the unknown, caused by the new disease, limited access to health facilities, impoverishment and job loss, increased mortality, restriction of contacts affected somewhat the mentality of every human being.

"Patient Perceptions of Cancer and Reconstructive Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic Perceptions du cancer et des soins de reconstruction par les patients au cours de la pandÃ©mie de COVID-19","Background: The Coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic profoundly impacted care for breast cancer patients. Oncologic and reconstructive surgeries were delayed as hospitals attempted to preserve personal protective equipment and bed capacity. Little is known about how this unprecedented time has affected breast cancer patientsâ€™ mental health and perceptions regarding their care. Methods: A survey was sent to surgical oncology and plastic surgery patients who received breast cancer care between March and May 2020, during which our institution suspended elective surgery. The survey questions included patient demographics, as well as questions focused on worries related to COVID-19, individualized cancer and reconstructive care, and patient satisfaction with telemedicine. Descriptive statistics were used to assess patient responses. Results: 56 breast cancer patients completed the survey, which reflected a 25% response rate. A majority of patients expressed moderate concern about contracting COVID-19, accessing high-quality cancer care (78%), and receiving timely surgical care (68%). Only 43% of patients reported delays in their surgical cancer and reconstructive care, when in actuality 57% of patients experienced surgical delays. Overall, patients were satisfied with telemedicine and did not feel it negatively impacted their care (69%). Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to disruptions of routine oncologic and reconstructive care for breast cancer patients.

"Clinical efficacy of Vortioxetine and escitalopram in the treatment of depression","Objectives: This study was aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of vortioxetine hydrobromide in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods: One hundred and eighty patients with the newly diagnosed depression in our hospital between August 2018 and August 2019 were selected and randomly divided into an observation group and a control group, 90 each group. The control group was treated with escitalopram, and the observation group was treated with voltaxetine. The efficacy and adverse reactions were evaluated by the Hamilton Depression scale-17 (HAMD-17), Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), Perceived Deficits Questionnaire-Depression (PDQ-D), and treatment emergent symptom scale (TESS) before treatment and at the end of the 8th and 24th week after treatment. Results: At the end of the 8th and 24th week after treatment, the HAMD-17 scores of the two groups were lower than those before treatment (P&lt;0.05);at the end of the 8th and 24th week after treatment, the PDQ-D and SDS scores of the two groups were lower than those before treatment (P&lt;0.05), and the above scores of the observation group were lower than those of the control group (P&lt;0.05). There was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse reactions between the two groups (P&gt;0.05). Conclusion: Voltaxetine can improve cognitive function and clinical symptoms of patients with severe depression and has high safety, which is worth clinical attention.","Shao, Shichuan, Sun, Baomin, Sun, Huiqing","https://www.google.com/search?q=Clinical+efficacy+of+Vortioxetine+and+escitalopram+in+the+treatment+of+depression","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Pakistan Journal of Medical Sciences Quarterly; 38(5):1389, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-22","",34712,""
"Relationships between working-class, first-generation college students and their parent(s)/guardian(s): A phenomenological study on the impacts of middle-class socialization","This constructionist phenomenological dissertation study explored stories from nine working-class, first-generation college students, specifically how middle-class socialization on a four-year university campus located in the Mountain West region of the United States impacts the relationships with their parent(s)/guardian(s). My primary research question was: How does attending college at a 4-year public university influence first-generation, working-class students' relationships with the ir parent(s)/guardian(s)? My sub-research questions were: What role does middle-class socialization that occurs on a 4-year public university campus play in impacting this relationship? And what role does online learning/remote learning during this COVID-19 period play in impacting this relationship? I used Yosso's (2005) Community Cultural Wealth theory and Hurst's (2010) Loyalist, Renegade, and Double Agent study as the two main theoretical frameworks for this study. For data collection, I use semi-structured interviews, a researcher diary, and a panel of experts from the research site. My data analysis revealed eight significant shared stories amongst the participants. This manuscript style dissertation offers a deep dive into two of the findings, space and work ethic. Space was revealed as a class-influenced value. Space showed up as geographical space between family, privacy, such as having a private bedroom, and consistently sharing space with family to do chores together. Additionally, being a strong worker to be valued by both the student and their parent(s)/guardian(s), but difficult to demonstrate through coursework. The working-class parent(s)/guardian(s) defined working hard as physical labor. It was difficult for their student to demonstrate that they are working hard when their work does not require physical exertion. My conclusion chapter includes a brief description of the remaining six shared stories: Being successful in college to make sure their parent(s)'/guardian(s)' sacrifices were worth it, particularly if the parent/guardian immigrated to the United States;starting to value mental health;religious parent(s)/guardian(s) being nervous about their child being away from the church;transitioning from a strict household to an environment that encourages freedom of choice;transitioning from a high school where most of the students are of color to a predominantly white institution;and lastly, I found it significant that every participant was able to identify a specific program or service on campus that helped them be successful. Reflection questions and programmatic recommendations for higher education professionals are provided in the two manuscripts.

"Discussion about the prevention of Coronavirus disease 19 based on the thought of treating non-disease and the theory of constitution of traditional Chinese medicine","Objective To summarize and analyze the susceptible constitution of coronavirus disease 19(COVID-19), put forward the diet prescription of traditional Chinese medicine for prevention based on the thought of treating non-disease and the theory of constitution, and to provide reference for COVID-19's prevention. Methods The relevant literatures in the past 5 years were reviewed, and the current situation of COVID-19's clinical manifestations, etiology, pathogenesis, disease location, disease transmission, susceptible physique, physique differentiation and prevention were summarized. Results The symptoms of COVID-19 were similar in the initial stage of infection, which was caused by damp pathogen. People with different physique were different in susceptibility to COVID-19 and the development and outcome of syndrome type after infection. The susceptible constitution was phlegm-dampness, dampness-heat, Qi deficiency and yang deficiency, blood stasis and Qi depression. Invigorating vital Qi, dispelling dampness, and nourishing lung are the basic treatment principles. Combined with physical differences and dialectical prevention, tonifying, invigorating spleen and stomach, and aromatic dampness-transforming drugs are major drugs, which are supplemented by drugs for promoting lung-Qi. Conclusion The formulation of preventive prescriptions of traditional Chinese medicine according to different physique can provide some guidance for the clinical prevention of COVID-19.","Gao, Xin, Sun, WenJun, Gao, Fang, Zhang, YiRong, Li, YunZhe, Liu, Xia, Gao, Yang, Zhang, HaiLong","https://www.google.com/search?q=Discussion+about+the+prevention+of+Coronavirus+disease+19+based+on+the+thought+of+treating+non-disease+and+the+theory+of+constitution+of+traditional+Chinese+medicine","","Database: CAB Abstracts; Publication type: article; Publication details: Northwest Pharmaceutical Journal; 37(1):168-171, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-22","",34714,""
"Can COVID-19 pandemic worsen previous neurological/psychiatric diseases? Â¿Puede la pandemia de COVID-19 empeorar enfermedades neurolÃ³gicas/psiquiÃ¡tricas previas?â€","Introduction The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has been affecting the world since January 2020. Although its pathogenesis is primarily directed to the respiratory tract, other organs may be affected, including the nervous system. It has also been shown that the social context (confinement, lack of treatment) has affected neurological patients during this period. The aim of the study it was to assess the subjective worsening of neurological/psychiatric diseases in the context of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic. Methods Three groups of neurological/psychiatric patients were included: Patients who had symptomatic COVID-19 (nÂ =Â 89), patients who had asymptomatic COVID-19 (nÂ =Â 40), and a control group (nÂ =Â 47), consisting of neurological/psychiatric patients without a history of SARS-Cov-2 infection. Results 30.7% of the included individuals considered that their basal pathology had worsened during the study period. This feeling was significantly more frequent (pÂ =Â 0.01) in patients with symptomatic COVID-19 (39.3%) than in patients of the other 2 groups (21.8%). Worsening was not related to the severity of COVID-19. The neurological conditions that significantly worsened after COVID-19, comparing symptomatic COVID-19 with the other 2 groups, were demyelinating and degenerative diseases. Conclusions These results confirmed the impact of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic on patients with neurological/psychiatric diseases. Confinement, lack of medical care, and the threat of diagnÃ³stico are surely contributing factors. Although the finding of a higher frequency of worsening in symptomatic COVID-19 patients may be related to greater anxiety/depression in this group of patients, we cannot exclude the role of direct affectation of the nervous system by the virus or damage due to neuroinflammation.","Fleury, AgnÃ¨s, QuiÃ±ones, Manuel Alejandro Del RÃ­o, Cruz, Lucinda Aguirre, Rojas, Andrea Toledo, Hernandez, Ilse Murrieta, Jimenez, Kimberly Santiago, Gutierrez, Eric Uribe, Rodriguez, Luis Miranda, Arrazola, Vidaris Toledo, Hernandez, Walter Soto, SÃ¡nchez, Daniel SÃ¡nchez, Cruz, Lya Fernanda","https://www.google.com/search?q=Can+COVID-19+pandemic+worsen+previous+neurological/psychiatric+diseases?+Â¿Puede+la+pandemia+de+COVID-19+empeorar+enfermedades+neurolÃ³gicas/psiquiÃ¡tricas+previas?â€","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Neurology Perspectives;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-22","",34715,""
"Antidepressant effect of prolonged twice-weekly intranasal esketamine treatments after nonresponse to electroconvulsive therapy in a patient with treatment-resistant depression","Presents a case report of a woman with depressive episodes, which began in early 2019 and was worsened by the change of her long-standing antidepressant regimen of fluoxetine to mirtazapine. Subsequently, she received 12 right unilateral ultrabrief pulse electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) treatments without any benefit. She experienced no benefit from 4 additional trials of antidepressants and during our evaluations over several weeks, her mood remained severely depressed. After 6 treatments, she experienced &gt;50% reduction in her depression. However, her esketamine treatments were paused for 8 weeks due to COVID-19. Her depression worsened and a 4-week-long course of twice-weekly treatments was initiated, which resulted in a &gt;50% reduction in her depression. After switching to weekly maintenance treatments, her symptoms of low mood, anhedonia, and suicidal ideation returned to her pre-treatment baseline. As she had responded well to twice-weekly treatments, the frequency of treatments was increased. In summary, this patient responded to twice-weekly esketamine treatments, experienced symptomatic worsening after switching to weekly treatments, but was able to attain remission with prolonged twice-weekly treatments.

"Unmediated connection of mental health decline and suicide among medical and nonmedical undergraduates during the pandemic of COVID-19: A cross-sectional comparative study","Background and Objectives: All medicine and healthcare undergraduates were encountered with terminations and delays of professional examinations. These alterations were on topmost of other tasks the COVID-19 pandemic carried out for instance not roaming, covered faces with masks and specifically segregation. This interruption of normal life was a major cause of mental health disaster and it is no surprise that medicine and healthcare undergraduate has had high rates of psychological effects including hopelessness, stress and suicidal thoughts. This study aimed to investigate the unmediated connection of anxiety and stress related mental health decline and suicide among medical and nonmedical undergraduates during the pandemic of covid-19. Methods: A multidiscipline online cross-sectional comparative study design was chosen for this study conducted from November 2020 to January 2021 with a pre-validated questionnaire to collect responses from sample size 1290. SPSS- 21 used for descriptive analysis of means, S.D, ANOVA and spearman's correlations.

"Online counseling: Perceptions of counselors, counselor educators and trainees","Online counseling is gradually finding its way into therapy in universities in Ghana. The recent outbreak of COVID-19 accompanied by uncertainties and the fears of physical contact signaled a consideration of complete acceptability of online counseling, in addition to face-to-face counseling. Nonetheless, the level of counselors, counselor educators and counselor trainees' knowledge, attitude, and usage of online counseling in Ghanaian universities is unclear. Thus, this study used an explanatory sequential mixed-method design to assess the perception of sampled respondents' and participants' viewpoints on online counseling available at a public university. Amid findings that counselors, counselor educators and counselor trainees have little awareness of online counseling and share a generally negative attitude towards it, the study concluded that online counseling is a highly unexplored option available on the university campus. Suggestions for augmented online counseling opportunities to assist students to resolve their difficulties on the university campus were also made.

"Impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on delivery of and models for supportive and palliative care for oncology patients","Supportive and palliative care services have been an important component of the overall COVID-19 pandemic response. However, significant changes in the provision and models of care were needed in order to optimize the care delivered to vulnerable cancer patients. This review discusses the evolution of palliative and supportive care service in response to the pandemic, and highlights remaining challenges. Direct competition for resources, as well as widespread implementation of safety measures resulted in major shifts in the mode of assessment and communication with cancer patients by supportive care teams. Telemedicine/virtual consultation and follow-up visits became an integral strategy, with high uptake and satisfaction amongst patients, families and providers. However, inequities in access to the required technologies were sometimes exposed. Hospice/palliative care unit (PCU) bed occupancy declined markedly because of restrictive visitation policies. Collection of patient-reported outcome (PRO) data was suspended in many cancer centers, with resulting under-recognition of anxiety and depression in ambulatory patients. As in many other areas, disparities in delivery of supportive and palliative care were magnified by the pandemic. Virtual care platforms have been widely adopted and will continue to be used to include a wider circle of family/friends and care providers in the provision of palliative and supportive care. To facilitate equitable delivery of supportive care within a pandemic, further research and resources are needed to train and support generalists and palliative care providers. Strategies to successfully collect PROs from all patients in a virtual manner must be developed and implemented.","Kazazian, Ng, Swallow","https://doi.org/10.1097/SPC.0000000000000606","20220721","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-22","",34724,""
"Assessing the Effect of the COVID-19 Outbreak on Didactic Education and Mental Health of Physician Assistant Students in the New York City Region","COVID-19 has profoundly affected life throughout the world, and it greatly affected physician assistant (PA) education programs when the virus spread across the New York region 2 years ago. PA programs at Stony Brook University, Hofstra University, and the New York Institute of Technology were located in the epicenter of the pandemic and were forced to transition to online learning during the spring of 2020. The purpose of this study was to explore didactic PA students' perceptions of virtual learning, their mental health status, and the challenges and unexpected benefits they have faced during this historic time. A consent form that linked to an 11-question electronic Qualtrics survey was emailed to all didactic students enrolled in the 3 participating PA programs. The survey data were used to conduct a descriptive analysis and a Spearman's ÃÂ correlation analysis using SPSS 24 software. The survey response rate was 39% (89/229). The students perceived it to be more challenging to maintain the same level of academic achievement with virtual learning, although they felt they were able to meet learning objectives and be prepared for clinical clerkships. They reported experiencing greater stress, anxiety, and depression related to decreased socialization and isolation. However, the students said that their PA program provided enough support to assist with student needs, and they noted unexpected benefits of remote learning, including more time to spend with family members, increased schedule flexibility, and lower commuting costs. The PA students' education and mental health were negatively affected because of the abrupt transition from in-person to virtual learning. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, most of the students in the 3 participating PA programs in New York were affected by the change to remote learning and the subsequent lack of socialization. PA students experienced both challenges and benefits during this unscheduled virtual learning period. While students noted increases in mental health issues, they felt supported by faculty members and prepared to start clinical rotations.","Kuriakose, Timko-Swaim, Loscalzo, L'Eplattenier","https://doi.org/10.1097/JPA.0000000000000450","20220721","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-22","",34725,""
"Symptoms of Mental Health Conditions and Suicidal Ideation Among State, Tribal, Local, and Territorial Public Health Workers - United States, March 14-25, 2022","An increase in adverse mental health symptoms occurred in the general population at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which peaked in 2020 and subsequently decreased (1-3). The pandemic exacerbated existing stress and fatigue among public health workers responding to the public health crisis.* During March-April 2021, a survey of state, tribal, local, and territorial (STLT) public health workers found that 52.8% of respondents experienced symptoms of at least one of the following mental health conditions: depression, anxiety, or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (4); however, more recent estimates of mental health symptoms among this population are limited. To evaluate trends in these conditions from the previous year, the prevalence of symptoms of mental health conditions and suicidal ideation, a convenience sample of STLT public health workers was surveyed during March 14-25, 2022. In total, 26,069 STLT public health workers responded to the survey. Among respondents,<sup>Ã¢â‚¬Â </sup> 6,090 (27.7%) reported symptoms of depression, 6,467 (27.9%) anxiety, 6,324 (28.4%) PTSD, and 1,853 (8.1%) suicidal ideation. Although the prevalences of depression, anxiety, and PTSD among public health workers were lower (p&lt;0.001)<sup>Ã‚Â§</sup> among 2022 survey respondents compared with those of 2021 survey respondents (4), the prevalences of symptoms of suicidal ideation, anxiety, depression, and PTSD remained high among those who worked &gt;60 hours per week (rangeÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 11.3%-45.9%) and those who spent Ã¢â€°Â¥76% of their work time on COVID-19 response activities (rangeÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 9.0%-37.6%). Respondents were less likely to report mental health symptoms if they could take time off (prevalence ratio [PR] rangeÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.48-0.55), or if they perceived an increase in mental health resources from their employer (PR rangeÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.58-0.84).

"Resting-state functional connectome predicts individual differences in depression during COVID-19 pandemic","Stressful life events are significant risk factors for depression, and increases in depressive symptoms have been observed during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study is to explore the neural makers for individuals' depression during COVID-19, using connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM). Then we tested whether these neural markers could be used to identify groups at high/low risk for depression with a longitudinal dataset. The results suggested that the high-risk group demonstrated a higher level and increment of depression during the pandemic, as compared to the low-risk group. Furthermore, a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was used to discriminate major depression disorder patients and healthy controls, using neural features defined by CPM. The results confirmed the CPM's ability for capturing the depression-related patterns with individuals' resting-state functional connectivity signature. The exploration for the anatomy of these functional connectivity features emphasized the role of an emotion-regulation circuit and an interoception circuit in the neuropathology of depression. In summary, the present study augments current understanding of potential pathological mechanisms underlying depression during an acute and unpredictable life-threatening event and suggests that resting-state functional connectivity may provide potential effective neural markers for identifying susceptible populations.

"Prospective examination of psychological trauma among adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic","This longitudinal study investigated the predictors of and changes in psychological trauma during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants included 236 adolescents (130 males; <i>M</i><sub>age</sub> = 16.74 years in spring 2020; 49.6% diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder; 16.1% diagnosed with an anxiety or depressive disorder) in the United States who completed online questionnaires at four timepoints (spring 2020, summer 2020, fall 2020, spring 2021). Repeated measures ANOVA showed that psychological trauma was highest during stay-at-home orders in spring 2020, and decreased for a majority of adolescents by the summer of 2020. However, ~20% of adolescents exhibited moderate-to-clinical levels of psychological trauma at each timepoint. Four groups were identified based on the presence of psychological trauma symptoms: (a) <i>resilient group</i> (normal range across all timepoints; 60.6%); (b) <i>moderate fluctuating group</i> (moderate range at 1 or more timepoints; 18.2%); (c) <i>severe fluctuating group</i> (clinical range at 1 or more timepoints; 14.0%); and (d) <i>chronic psychological trauma group</i> (moderate or clinical range across all timepoints; 7.2%). Females, adolescents with preexisting internalizing disorders, and participants whose families were most impacted by the pandemic were more susceptible to experiencing psychological trauma symptoms. Findings highlight at-risk populations and suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in psychological trauma symptoms for approximately 20% of adolescents at some point during the first year of the pandemic. There is critical need to provide mental health services to adolescents, such as through school-based services, to reduce the negative long-term psychological impact of the pandemic.

"Editorial: Schools on the frontline of suicide prevention","The world has experienced an unprecedented mental health crisis associated with the COVID-19 pandemic (Liu etÃ‚Â al., 2020). After more than two years navigating the associated uncertainty and distress, the impact on youth mental health continues to be a pressing concern. Those in the mental health field, as well as the children and families plagued by its impact, are inundated with seeing firsthand the impact on youth's functioning. This includes increases in depression and suicide (Asarnow &amp; Chung, 2021; Manzar etÃ‚Â al., 2021), and having to navigate siloes in care and often even an inability when in crisis to access a continuum of services (Zhai, 2021). This has highlighted the significant issues with accessibility of mental health care and inequitable access to care for youth mental health both in the United States and globally. We continue to experience daily the impact of insufficient resources for youth behavioral health. For those in the field who prioritize the need for more robust intervention approaches, the child mental health crisis associated with the pandemic has highlighted the need for us to develop more novel and innovative interventions.","Kamody, Bloch","https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpp.13663","20220721","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-22","",34729,""
"""COVID-Somnia"" in healthcare workers during the pandemic","Sleep disorders associated with COVID-19 pandemic are termed as ""COVID-somnia"". In this study, we sought to assess the prevalence of COVID-somnia in healthcare workers, establish the factors that trigger this condition, and to investigate its relationship with anxiety and depression symptoms. This cross-sectional study was conducted between April 2021 and June 2021, and it included healthcare workers who served during the pandemic. Participants' demographic data, Beck Depression and Anxiety Inventories, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) were used, and the results were statistically analyzed. Multiple analyses of factors affecting ESS and ISI scores were evaluated using binary logistic regression model and PSQI score were analyzed using a multiple linear regression model. A total of 1,111 healthcare workers who served during the pandemic voluntarily enrolled to the study. The mean age was 37.3 Ã‚Â± 8.48 years, and 63.5% were females. Our study showed that the healthcare workers, evaluated with the PSQI, experienced a deterioration of sleep quality. Primary factors affecting this are working on the front line, the presence of chronic diseases, depression, and anxiety. Regression analyses identified depression and anxiety as the common factors affecting ESS, ISI, and PSQI scores. Raising awareness regarding COVID-somnia among healthcare workers, who play a leading role in curbing the pandemic, would reduce sleep disturbances, depression, and anxiety. It would also contribute to the planning and implementation of preventive and therapeutic mental health programs with a multidisciplinary approach.","Ãƒâ€“zÃƒÂ§elik, Kesin, Telatar, Ãƒâ€“zyurt, YÃ„Â±lmaz Kara, GÃƒÂ¼mÃƒÂ¼Ã…Å¸, HocaoÃ„Å¸lu, Ã…Å¾ahin","https://doi.org/10.1080/21548331.2022.2102777","20220721","Anxiety; COVID-19; COVID-somnia; depression; insomnia; sleep disturbances","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-22","",34730,""
"The psycho-social health of students during first part of COVID-10 pandemy","In 2020, the world was gripped by a global pandemic caused by a new strain of coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. Highly contagious, rapidly spreading virus caused massive infections around the world and forced isolation of patients and quarantine of contact persons. Social isolation, caused by the introduction of compulsory distance or resulting from the course of the quarantine process, may result in the loss of emotional ties between individuals, thus leading to the weakening of the social support network. The aim of the study was to assess whether and to what extent the restrictions caused by the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemics affected emotional state and everyday behavior of students of Polish universities. 1,095 students took part in the study - 82.1% of women and 17.9% men, aged 19 and over up to 55 years of age, living mostly in cities. The diagnostic survey method was applied using proprietary questionnaires. The questionnaire was distributed by Internet. The results were processed using the Statistica v.13.3 program with the application of descriptive statistics and tests Ãâ€¡2 and Anova. According to 80% of respondents, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a serious threat for health. During the first wave of the pandemic, students were accompanied mainly by difficult emotions: uncertainty (61%), depression (28.9%), worry (28.7%), nervousness (37.7%) and anger (24%). According to 50.2%, their relations with household members were not changed, while students declaring changes in family relationships pointed to their loosening and limitation. A significant majority of students stated that the COVID-19 pandemic is a serious threat to health and has a regular interest in epidemiological data concerning coronavirus. Medical students declared the highest risk. The first wave of the pandemic resulted in the intensification of difficult emotions and for half of the respondents changes in the functioning of their family relationships.","Mazur, Janus, Michalik-Marcinkowska, Kulik, MusioÃ…â€š","https://doi.org/10.32394/pe.76.11","20220721","COVID-19; coronavirus; health; student","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-22","",34731,""
"Using Social Networking Sites During Lockdown: Risks and Benefits","Previous research about use of Social Networking Sites (SNS) use during the COVID-19 lockdown has examined benefits and risks of SNS use (i.e., support through SNS, problematic SNS use and interaction about COVID-19) without comparing them. This study has two objectives: (i) to evaluate which SNS uses (problematic SNS use and interaction about COVID-19 on SNS) predict increased emotional distress, and (ii) to analyse if social support and interaction about COVID-19 mediated the relationship between time spent on SNS and increased emotional distress. A total of 1,003 participants (75.5% women) over 18 years old took part (M = 42.33; SD = 14.32 years). Three hierarchical linear regressions were performed for the first objective and a path analysis was performed for the second. Results showed that negative social comparison on SNS had the highest positive regression weight, followed by interaction about COVID-19 and addictive consequences. Also, an indirect effect of time spent on SNS on anxiety, depression, and life satisfaction through interaction about COVID-19 and support through SNS was found. The results indicate that comparative SNS use is the best predictor of emotional distress. The mediation model proposed was confirmed, highlighting the importance of assessing specific SNS uses.","GonzÃƒÂ¡lez-Nuevo, Cuesta, Postigo, MenÃƒÂ©ndez-Aller, GarcÃƒÂ­a-FernÃƒÂ¡ndez, Kuss","https://doi.org/10.7334/psicothema2022.51","20220721","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-22","",34732,""
"[Long COVID: Pathogenesis and Therapeutic Approach]","A group of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exhibited various persistent or new systemic symptoms, including psychiatric symptoms, sleep disturbances, exercise intolerance, arthralgia, headache, cognitive decline, brain fog, and autonomic symptoms, all of which persisted long after the resolution of infectious symptoms. Several imaging studies have shown that long COVID cases present with decreased glucose metabolism and progressive brain atrophy. Although no single pathological hypothesis thoroughly explains the varied clinical presentations and timings, the following have attracted attention: 1) persistent viral infection, 2) persistent inflammation, 3) involvement of the autoimmune system, and 4) mitochondrial dysfunction. In all these hypotheses, inflammatory cytokines may be involved in orthostatic dysregulation by decreasing the expression and activity of ACE2, consequently changing the blood pressure through vagus nerve hyperactivation. Myopathy and peripheral neuropathy may also be caused by direct infection of the muscles and nerves, hypoxia, mitochondrial damage, and cytokine storm. Furthermore, multiple theories regarding the mechanisms by which systemic inflammatory findings affect the central nervous system have been postulated, including neuroinflammation caused by inflammatory cells crossing the blood-brain barrier via choroid plexus cells and the involvement of various autoantibodies. Despite these findings, no definitive consensus has been reached due to the complexity and diversity of COVID-19 pathophysiology. Thus, it is essential to understand the neurological symptoms and pathophysiology involved in long COVID.","Watanabe, Shima, Mizutani, Ueda, Ito","https://doi.org/10.11477/mf.1416202142","20220721","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-22","",34733,""

"COVID-19 Vaccination in Patients with Rheumatic Diseases Leads to a High Seroconversion Rate and Reduced Self-Imposed Isolation and Shielding Behavior","We investigated the effect of a two-dose mRNA vaccine on antibody levels against SARS-CoV-2 and patient behavior and shielding concerning fear of COVID-19 in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis. Three-hundred-and-three patients and 44 blood donors were included. All patients received two doses of an mRNA vaccine and had total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 measured before vaccination and 2 and 9 weeks after the second vaccination. Further, patients answered an electronic questionnaire before and after vaccination concerning behavior, anxiety, and symptoms of depression (PHQ-9). Significantly fewer patients (90%) had measurable antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 compared to blood donors (100%) after the second vaccination (p&lt;0.001). Treatment with rituximab was the strongest predictor of an unfavorable vaccine response, as only 27% had measurable antibodies. Nearly all patients (97%) not treated with rituximab experienced seroconversion. Prednisone and methotrexate had a negative effect on seroconversion, but no effect of age or comorbidity was observed. Patients experienced significant improvement after vaccination in 10 out of 12 questions regarding behavior and fear of COVID-19, while no change in PHQ-9 or anxiety was observed. We find a very high seroconversion rate among rheumatic patients, and reduced self-imposed isolation and shielding after COVID-19 vaccination.","AmmitzbÃƒÂ¸ll, Thomsen, Andersen, Bartels, Hermansen, Johannsen, Mistegaard, Mikkelsen, Vils, Erikstrup, Hauge, Troldborg","https://doi.org/10.1093/mr/roac069","20220721","Arthritis; Covid-19; Lupus Erythematosus; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Rheumatoid; SARS-CoV-2 antibodies; Systemic; Vaccination; Vaccine response","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-22","",34735,""

"Changes in activity locations during the COVID-19 pandemic and associations with depression, anxiety, loneliness, and alcohol use","Restrictions and guidelines to limit the spread of COVID-19 caused considerable and rapid changes to individuals' daily routines. This study examines how activity locations changed during the COVID-19 pandemic and associated social distancing restrictions, and whether these changes were associated with depression, anxiety, loneliness, and alcohol use. A web-based survey was conducted early in the COVID-19 pandemic (May-June 2020) in Allegheny County (Pittsburgh), Pennsylvania. Participants (<i>n</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 265) reported visits to activity locations in the last 30 days and retrospectively for February 2020 (pre-pandemic). A principal components analysis was conducted to assess change in utilization of activity locations. Component scores of changes to activity locations were compared by sociodemographics. Poisson and zero-inflated negative binomial models were used to examine the relationship between component scores and pandemic depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, loneliness, and drinking days. Five distinct principal components of activity location changes were identified. The first component, characterizing broad reductions in activity locations during the early phases of the pandemic, was associated with increased depression and loneliness. Results indicate non-uniform shifts in routine activities during the pandemic and highlight the importance of understanding how changes to the social environment affect individuals' psychological wellbeing and alcohol use.","Frankeberger, Sumetsky, Friedman, Burke, Coulter, Mair","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wss.2022.100092","20220721","Activity locations; Alcohol use; COVID-19; Loneliness; Mental health; Routine activities","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-22","",34737,""

"Blood metabolic signatures of hikikomori, pathological social withdrawal","A severe form of pathological social withdrawal, 'hikikomori,' has been acknowledged in Japan, spreading worldwide, and becoming a global health issue. The pathophysiology of hikikomori has not been clarified, and its biological traits remain unexplored. Drug-free patients with hikikomori (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°42) and healthy controls (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°41) were recruited. Psychological assessments for the severity of hikikomori and depression were conducted. Blood biochemical tests and plasma metabolome analysis were performed. Based on the integrated information, machine-learning models were created to discriminate cases of hikikomori from healthy controls, predict hikikomori severity, stratify the cases, and identify metabolic signatures that contribute to each model. Long-chain acylcarnitine levels were remarkably higher in patients with hikikomori; bilirubin, arginine, ornithine, and serum arginase were significantly different in male patients with hikikomori. The discriminative random forest model was highly performant, exhibiting an area under the ROC curve of 0.854 (confidential interval = 0.648-1.000). To predict hikikomori severity, a partial least squares PLS-regression model was successfully created with high linearity and practical accuracy. In addition, blood serum uric acid and plasma cholesterol esters contributed to the stratification of cases. These findings reveal the blood metabolic signatures of hikikomori, which are key to elucidating the pathophysiology of hikikomori and also useful as an index for monitoring the treatment course for rehabilitation.","Setoyama, Matsushima, Hayakawa, Nakao, Kanba, Kang, Kato","https://doi.org/10.1080/19585969.2022.2046978","20220721","COVID-19; Hikikomori; acylcarnitine; plasma metabolome; social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-22","",34740,""
"Online Short-Term Mindfulness-Based Intervention During COVID-19 Quarantine in Italy: Effects on Wellbeing, Stress, and Anxiety","To limit the first spread of COVID-19 in March 2020, the Italian government imposed strict lockdown measures to the population. Despite necessary to reduce the virus transmission and the burden to the hospitals, social isolation has caused detrimental effects on psychological wellbeing and mental health. Moreover, during this period, it was also difficult to deliver psychological treatments and psychiatric assistance. A short (a weekly session for 9 weeks) mindfulness-based meditation program, named Integral Meditation (IM), was administered entirely online to healthy adults from Italy. This is a two-groups pre-post-quasi-experimental study in which the two groups, treated and control, were not randomized. Through matching procedures aimed at overcoming the absence of randomization, we analyzed a sample of 84 subjects (42 for each group). By applying linear mixed effect models, we tested the hypothesis of a beneficial effect of IM on wellbeing, perceived stress, and state anxiety, as measured by three self-reported questionnaires (WEMWBS, PSS, and STAI-X1, respectively), assuming that this effect could be different according to the level of baseline trait anxiety, as measured by STAI-X2. The results showed a statistically significant effect of STAI-X1 (ÃŽÂ² = -8.24 [95%CI -15.39; -1.09], <i>p</i> = 0.02) and WEMWBS (ÃŽÂ² = 4.61 [95%CI 0.94; 8.29], <i>p</i> = 0.01) in the higher trait anxiety subgroup only. No statistically significant effect of IM was observed for PSS.

"Discussing the Effect of Students' Crisis Awareness on Emotion During the COVID-19 Pandemic From the Perspective of Trust","The effects of crises vary among individuals, societies, and nations. Governments' crisis management is quite different from that of non-governmental organizations, especially in terms of ""publicity,"" since it involves bureaucracy to address people's accountability concerns. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between students' crisis awareness, trust, and emotions in the event of a major public health emergency. A questionnaire survey was conducted for this study. A total of 500 copies of questionnaires were distributed to the college students in Jiangxi. Among those, 437 valid copies were retrieved, with a retrieval rate of 87%. A structural equation model (SEM) was used to conduct the statistical analyses. The research results were summarized as follows: (1) At the stage of epidemic spread, people can easily fall into the negative emotion. (2) The society with a good trust relationship considers schools less responsible for critical incidents and more helpful for crisis communication. (3) Reducing the negative emotions of the public after the occurrence of critical incidents can effectively reduce the damage of critical incidents to the organization. Avoiding a loss of student confidence and increasing anger, protecting the school's reputation, having a good communication effect, and minimizing the impact of the crisis can help the students develop better trust toward the school. When a crisis occurs on campus, this can reduce the possibility of students' showing negative emotions and spreading rumors. It is considered that the findings provide guidance on how to optimize the management of public health crisis situations and improve students' mental health.","Yang, Miao","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.803372","20220721","coronavirus disease 2019; crisis awareness; emotion; time pressure; trust","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-22","",34742,""
"Characteristics of Hospital Workers Using a Wellbeing Center Implemented During the COVID-19 Pandemic to Prevent the Emotional Impacts of the Crisis","The COVID-19 pandemic has posed an unprecedented challenge worldwide for healthcare workers (HCWs) and other hospital employees. Disruptions in work and personal life may have led to mental health problems. To prevent or limit the severity of such issues, a local initiative has been implemented in a French hospital: a dedicated lounge, also called ""<i>Bulle</i>"" (literally bubble and meaning safe space) has been created to provide a quiet caring environment and health support. Other similar wellbeing centers have been implemented in other countries, but very little data are available on their practical effectiveness. The purpose of our study was to assess what type of hospital workers have frequented the <i>Bulle</i> and to describe their psychological state in terms of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) just after the first wave, compared to those who had not come to the <i>Bulle</i>. From 15 July to 1 October 2020, a cross-sectional survey was conducted among all workers, collecting demographic information, professional data (experience and satisfaction), emotional experience during the first wave of COVID-19, and psychological specificities, including a history of burnout or symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD. We asked them if they had accessed the <i>Bulle</i> or not. A total of 675 employees (out of 2,408; 28.0%) fully completed the survey. Approximately 199 respondents (29%) reported having accessed the <i>Bulle</i> during the first wave of the pandemic. Significant symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD were reported by, respectively, 41, 20, and 14% of the participants.

"Prevalence of antenatal depression and associated factors among pregnant women during COVID-19 pandemic in North Shewa zone, Amhara region, Ethiopia","Antenatal depression is a form of depression that occurs during pregnancy. This problem may worsen during the COVID-19 epidemic and may result in serious consequences for pregnant women, including depression and other multiple psychosocial problems. However, the prevalence of depression during the COVID-19 pandemic in pregnant women and its associated factors has not been studied in the study area, even in Ethiopia. An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 422 pregnant women who were attending antenatal care in public health institutions in the North Shewa Zone, Ethiopia. The data were collected from May 1- June 30, 2021. A logistic regression model with adjusted odds ratio (AOR) and P-valueÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.05 at the 95% confidence interval was used to determine significantly associated factors. The prevalence of antenatal depression among pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic was 34.1% (95% CI: 29.6-38.9). Divorced marital status (AORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 7.52, CI: 2.707-20.911), husband's educational status ""cannot read and write"" (AORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 4.05, CI: 1.834-8.962) and ""can read and write without formal education"" (AORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2.39, CI: 1.107-5.154) are statistically significant variables associated with depression among pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, the prevalence of antenatal depression in pregnant women during the novel coronavirus pandemic was high. To reduce the level of depression in pregnant women, strategies have to be designed for the early detection of divorced pregnant women with inadequate social support and address enough information for pregnant women and their husbands about depression and COVID-19 during the pandemic.","Sewnet Amare, Nibret Gessesse, Solomon Kinfu, Melesew Mekuriyaw, Amera Tizazu, Mossie Menalu, Tsegaw Taye, Gonie Mekonnen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijans.2022.100459","20220721","COVID-19; Depression; Ethiopia; Pregnant women; Prevalence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-22","",34744,""
"Immediate and short-term prevalence of depression in covid-19 patients and its correlation with continued symptoms experience","The COVID-19 infection can result in prolonged illness in those infected irrespective of disease severity. Infectious diseases are associated with a higher risk of mood disorders. A better understanding of convalescence, symptom duration, as well as the prevalence of depression among recovering patients, could help plan better care for the survivors of COVID-19. The study aimed to estimate the immediate and short-term prevalence of major depressive disorder and its correlation with continued symptom experience. In this non-interventional, observational, and cross-sectional telephone survey study, 273 participants were included from January 2021 to April 2021 and 261 completed follow-up by July 2021. The symptoms at the time of RT-PCR testing and during the two phone calls were captured and the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 item (PHQ-9) version was administered. During the immediate and short-term period following COVID-19, 144/261 (55.1%) and 71/261 (27.2%) patients had not returned to usual health, respectively, and 33/261 (12.8%) and 13/261 (5%) of the patients developed depression, respectively. The binary logistic regression analysis revealed that the independent predictors of depression in short-term period following COVID-19 were comorbid diabetes mellitus (OR = 32.99, 95% CI- 2.19-496, <i>P</i> = 0.011), number of symptoms at the time of RT-PCR testing (OR = 1.89, 95% CI 1.23-1.92, <i>P</i> = 0.018), and number of symptoms at short-term period following COVID-19 (OR = 2.85, 95% CI 1.47-5.51, <i>P</i> = 0.002).

"Mindfulness-based online intervention for mental health during times of COVID-19","As the COVID-19 pandemic progresses, mental health begins to be affected. In this sense, practical and low-cost solutions are necessary to minimize the impact on the population. This study aimed to determine the effect of a mindfulness-based online intervention for mental health during times of COVID-19. A quasi-experimental study was carried out with pre-test and post-test measurements in a sample of 62 participants divided into an experimental group whose members were administered a 12-session mindfulness online program, and a control group on the waiting list. The Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) was used to assess anxiety, the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) to measure depression, and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14) to determine stress levels. The levels of anxiety, depression, and stress decreased after the intervention, finding significant differences between the groups and study phases (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). In addition, moderate changes in anxiety (d = 0.849, g = 0.847) and depression (d = 0.533, g = 0.530) were found, as well as important changes in stress reduction (d = 1.254, g = 1.240). There is evidence of a potential for the use of mindfulness program to reduce stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms in stressful situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Alvarado-GarcÃƒÂ­a, Soto-VÃƒÂ¡squez, Rosales-CerquÃƒÂ­n","https://doi.org/10.4103/indianjpsychiatry.indianjpsychiatry_642_21","20220721","Anxiety; depression; mental health; mindfulness; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-22","",34746,""

"Responding to a surge in overdose deaths: perspectives from US syringe services programs","US overdose deaths have reached a record high. Syringe services programs (SSPs) play a critical role in addressing this crisis by providing multiple services to people who use drugs (PWUD) that help prevent overdose death. This study examined the perspectives of leadership and staff from a geographically diverse sample of US SSPs on factors contributing to the overdose surge, their organization's response, and ongoing barriers to preventing overdose death. From 2/11/2021 to 4/23/2021, we conducted semi-structured interviews with leadership and staff from 27 SSPs sampled from the North American Syringe Exchange Network directory. Interviews were transcribed and qualitatively analyzed using a Rapid Assessment Process. Respondents reported that increased intentional and unintentional fentanyl use (both alone and combined with other substances) was a major driver of the overdose surge. They also described how the COVID-19 pandemic increased solitary drug use and led to abrupt increases in use due to life disruptions and worsened mental health among PWUD. In response to this surge, SSPs have increased naloxone distribution, including providing more doses per person and expanding distribution to people using non-opioid drugs. They are also adapting overdose prevention education to increase awareness of fentanyl risks, including for people using non-opioid drugs. Some are distributing fentanyl test strips, though a few respondents expressed doubts about strips' effectiveness in reducing overdose harms. Some SSPs are expanding education and naloxone training/distribution in the broader community, beyond PWUD and their friends/family. Respondents described several ongoing barriers to preventing overdose death, including not reaching certain groups at risk of overdose (PWUD who do not inject, PWUD experiencing homelessness, and PWUD of color), an inconsistent naloxone supply and lack of access to intranasal naloxone in particular, inadequate funding, underestimates of overdoses, legal/policy barriers, and community stigma. SSPs remain essential in preventing overdose deaths amid record numbers likely driven by increased fentanyl use and COVID-19-related impacts. These findings can inform efforts to support SSPs in this work. In the face of ongoing barriers, support for SSPs-including increased resources, political support, and community partnership-is urgently needed to address the worsening overdose crisis.","Frost, Austin, Corcorran, Briggs, Behrends, Juarez, Frank, Healy, Prohaska, LaKosky, Kapadia, Perlman, Schackman, Des Jarlais, Williams, Glick","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12954-022-00664-y","20220721","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Fentanyl; Harm reduction; Naloxone; Opioids; Overdose; Qualitative; Syringe exchange; Syringe services program; Analgesics, Opioid; COVID-19; Drug Overdose; Fentanyl; Humans; Naloxone; Pandemics; Syringes","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-22","",34748,""
"COVID-19 epidemic lockdown-induced changes of cereals and animal protein foods consumption of Iran population: the first nationwide survey","The COVID-19 epidemic has affected diverse issues of life including economy, health and nutrition. This nationwide study was conducted to evaluate the effects of the epidemic lockdown-induced socio-economic changes on animal source proteins and cereals intakes of Iran population for the first time. This was a cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study using a web-based electronic self-administered questionnaire. A questionnaire was designed with the aim of detecting any changes in the dietary pattern of the Iranian household following coronavirus epidemic. A total of 21,290 households participated in the study. Approximately 33%, 24%, 14.2% and 7% of the households had decreased the weekly consumption of red meat, white meat, eggs and rice/bread, respectively, following COVID-19 epidemic. The results of ordered logistic regression showed that the female-headed households, as compared with male-headed ones, were 30% more likely to decrease their weekly consumption of white meat (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.3, 95% CI: 1.1-1.5). About 8.6% of the households had reduced all three major dietary sources of animal protein. Close to half of the households (46.9%) who decreased their intake of the animal protein sources had increased their intake of rice or bread, too. The major reasons for these changes were decrease of income and job loss. In conclusion, animal protein food consumption decreased during epidemic lockdown but the amounts of rice and bread, as the major sources of dietary energy, have increased. These changes, if persist long enough, can seriously affect micronutrient status of the whole population. Early nutritional interventions for needy families are warranted.","Nikooyeh, Rabiei, Amini, Ghodsi, Rasekhi, Doustmohammadian, Abdollahi, Minaie, Sadeghi, Neyestani","https://doi.org/10.1186/s41043-022-00310-0","20220721","Animal proteins; COVID-19; Cereals; Households; Lockdown; Animals; COVID-19; Communicable Disease Control; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diet; Edible Grain; Female; Humans; Iran; Male; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-22","",34749,""
"Improving resident well-being: a narrative review of wellness curricula","To improve wellness among residents, many graduate medical education programs have implemented formal wellness curricula. Curricular development has recently shifted focus from drivers of burnout to promotion of wellness. The specific components of successful wellness curricula, however, are not yet well defined. To review the published literature assessing core components of wellness curricula in graduate medical education programs. Searches were conducted through June 2020 in PubMed, Education Resources Information Center, Google Scholar and Web of Science using the search terms wellness curricula, wellness programs, well-being and graduate medical education. Additional articles were identified from reference lists. Curricula from primarily undergraduate medical education, singular interventions, non-peer-reviewed studies and non-English language studies were excluded. Eighteen articles were selected and reviewed by three authors. Critical drivers of success included support from program leadership and opportunities for resident involvement in the curriculum implementation. Most curricula included interventions related to both physical and mental health. Curricula including challenging components of professionalisation, such as critical conversations, medical errors and boundary setting, seemed to foster increased resident buy-in. The most frequently used curricular assessment tools were the Maslach Burnout Inventory and resident satisfaction surveys. Different specialties have different wellness needs. A resource or 'toolbox' that includes a variety of general as well as specialty-specific wellness components might allow institutions and programs to select interventions that best suit their individual needs. Assessment of wellness curricula is still in its infancy and is largely limited to single institution experiences.","Ahart, Gilmer, Tenpenny, Krase","https://doi.org/10.1136/postgradmedj-2022-141541","20220719","COVID-19; education and training; medical education &amp; training; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-22","",34750,""
"Challenges faced by people experiencing homelessness and their providers during the COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative study","People experiencing homelessness are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection and its consequences. We aimed to understand the perspectives of people experiencing homelessness, and of the health care and shelter workers who cared for them, during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted an interpretivist qualitative study in Toronto, Canada, from December 2020 to June 2021. Participants were people experiencing homelessness who received SARS-CoV-2 testing, health care workers and homeless shelter staff. We recruited participants via email, telephone or recruitment flyers. Using individual interviews conducted via telephone or video call, we explored the experiences of people who were homeless during the pandemic, their interaction with shelter and health care settings, and related system challenges. We analyzed the data using reflexive thematic analysis. Among 26 participants were 11 men experiencing homelessness (aged 28-68 yr), 9 health care workers (aged 33-59 yr), 4 health care leaders (aged 37-60 yr) and 2 shelter managers (aged 47-57 yr). We generated 3 main themes: navigating the unknown, wherein participants grappled with evolving public health guidelines that did not adequately account for homeless individuals; confronting placelessness, as people experiencing homelessness often had nowhere to go owing to public closures and lack of isolation options; and struggling with powerlessness, since people experiencing homelessness lacked agency in their placelessness, and health care and shelter workers lacked control in the care they could provide. Reduced shelter capacity, public closures and lack of isolation options during the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the displacement of people experiencing homelessness and led to moral distress among providers. Planning for future pandemics must account for the unique needs of those experiencing homelessness.","Hodwitz, Parsons, Juando-Pratts, Rosenthal, Craig-Neil, Hwang, Lockwood, Das, Kiran","https://doi.org/10.9778/cmajo.20210334","20220721","COVID-19; COVID-19 Testing; Homeless Persons; Humans; Male; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-22","",34751,""
"COVID-19 Infections in Gonads: Consequences on Fertility?","COVID-19 may influence human fertility and sexuality in several ways. Different cell types in gonads show a constitutive expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine subtype 2 (TMPRSS2), which provide potential entry pathways for SARS-CoV-2. In addition to the biological effects of a COVID-19 infection on the gonads, the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on mental health issues and sexual behavior may affect reproduction. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the influence of COVID-19 on the gonads and discusses possible consequences on human fertility. In this context, the close interaction between the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in response to COVID-19-related stress is discussed. Some women noticed changes in their menstrual cycle during the COVID-19 pandemic, which could be due to psychological stress, for example. In addition, occasional cases of reduced oocyte quality and ovarian function are described after COVID-19 infection. In men, COVID-19 may cause a short-term decrease in fertility by damaging testicular tissue and/or impairing spermatogenesis. Moreover, decreased ratio testosterone/LH and FSH/LH in COVID-19 compared to aged-matched healthy men has been reported. Available data do not suggest any effect of the available SARS-CoV-2 vaccines on fertility. The effects of long COVID on human fertility have been reported and include cases with premature ovarian failure and oligomenorrhoea in women and erectile dysfunction in men. Despite the increasing knowledge about the effects of COVID-19 infections on human gonads and fertility, the long-term consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic cannot yet be assessed in this context.","Bechmann, Maccio, Kotb, Dweik, Cherfane, Moch, Bornstein, Varga","https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1891-6621","20220719","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-22","",34752,""
"Published Research on COVID-19 in the Eastern Mediterranean Region: Bibliometric Analysis","The challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic have led to unprecedented global research activity. The Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) continues to contribute to COVID-19 research driven by the unique challenges of the region, including the protracted conflicts, already stressed health systems, and serious health and social inequalities. This study aims to provide an overview of the publication activities and trends in COVID-19 research in the EMR from the onset of the disease to early 2022 using bibliometric methods. A literature search using Scopus was conducted from December 1, 2019, to January 31, 2022, using keywords relevant to COVID-19 and the World Health Organization (WHO) EMR country list. Data were exported and analyzed using Microsoft Excel and the Citation Overview function on Scopus. The quality of journals was determined using SCImago Journal Rank and CiteScore. VOSviewer software was used to visualize the relationships between authors, countries, and key terms used in the retrieved documents. A total of 6880 documents were retrieved, of which 1805 (26.24%) were from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and 1782 (25.90%) from Iran, followed by Pakistan, Egypt, and Jordan. Most published documents were affiliated with EMR universities, primarily the Tehran University of Medical Sciences in Iran and King Saud University in KSA (396/6880, 5.76%, and 370/6880, 5.4%, respectively), while only 407 (5.92%) of 6880 documents were associated with universities outside the EMR. For most of the identified publications (5020/6880, 72.97%), no funding source was reported, while King Saud University contributed the largest share (282/1860, 15.16%) of funded publications. Retrieved documents were cited 53,516 times, with an average of 7.78 (SD 34.30). Iran was the EMR country with the most links to other countries (77 links and total link strength of 1279). The 5 authors with the most publications were from KSA, Qatar, and Jordan. There were 290 high-frequency keywords that occurred Ã¢â€°Â¥10 times and were linked in 7 different clusters. The cluster with the most linked keywords was related to epidemiology and mortality. Recent topics included vaccines, vaccination, machine learning, and online learning. This is the first study to show trends in and project future developments of COVID-19 research activity in the EMR. Authors and institutions who led research on COVID-19 in the region were from Iran and KSA. There were multiple regional collaborative efforts; however, international collaboration was limited. Recently, interest has been shifting toward topics related to vaccination, machine learning, and online learning.

"Lower-Income Predicts Increased Smartphone Use and Problematic Behaviors Among Schoolchildren During COVID-19 Related School Modification: A Longitudinal Study","As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has continued for a couple of years, the long-term effects of the pandemic and the subsequent school curriculum modification on the mental health of children and parents need to be investigated. To clarify the changes that can occur during one school year and to predict the risk factors for vulnerable groups, this study identified parameters relative to children's screen time, their problematic behavior, and parental depression. A total of 186 participants were analyzed who were parents of elementary schoolchildren in South Korea. These parents were required to complete a web-based questionnaire twice. The questionnaires were conducted in June 2020 and September 2021. Participants' general demographics including family income, children's screen time, sleep patterns, problematic behavior, and parental depression were assessed via the parental questionnaire that included various measurement tools. Children's body mass index (BMI) increased significantly in 2021 (18.94 Ã‚Â± 3.75 vs. 18.14 Ã‚Â± 3.30, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). Smartphone frequency of use per week (5.35 vs. 4.54, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) and screen time per day (3.52 vs. 3.16, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) significantly increased during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic. The television screen time (2.88 vs. 3.26, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), frequency of viewing (3.77 vs. 4.77, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), and children's problematic behaviors significantly decreased (9.15 vs. 11.85, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). A lower income household was a key predictor of increased smartphone frequency (B = 1.840, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.923-2.757, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) and smartphone screen time (B = 1.992, 95% CI, 1.458-2.525, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). The results showed that the lower income household (B = 5.624, 95% CI, 2.927-8.320, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) and a child's psychiatric treatment history (B = 7.579, 95% CI, 5.666-9.492, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) was the most significant predictor of problematic behaviors of children and parental depression (B = 3.476, 95% CI, 1.628-5.325, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001; B = 3.138, 95% CI, 1.827-4.450, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). This study suggested that children's smartphone screen time and BMI increased during COVID-19 because of the school curriculum modification following school closures in South Korea. The increased children's problematic behaviors and parental depression were predicted by lower-income households and the previous psychiatric history of children. These results indicate that multiple social support systems to the vulnerable group are needed during the ongoing pandemic and that a modified school setting is required.","Her, Lee, Yang, Park, Park, Kim, Shin","https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2022.37.e225","20220720","Child Behavior; Covid-19; Longitudinal Study; School; Screen Time; COVID-19; Child; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Pandemics; Parents; Smartphone; Surveys and Questionnaires; Television","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-22","",34754,""
"Online singing interventions for postnatal depression in times of social isolation: a feasibility study protocol for the SHAPER-PNDO single-arm trial","Postnatal depression (PND) affects 13% of new mothers, with numbers rising during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this prevalence, many women have difficulty with or hesitancy towards accessing pharmacological and/or psychological interventions. Group-based mother-baby activities, however, have a good uptake, with singing improving maternal mental health and the mother-infant relationship. The recent lockdowns highlight the importance of adapting activities to an online platform that is wide-reaching and accessible. The SHAPER-PNDO study will primarily analyse the feasibility of a 6-week online singing intervention, Melodies for Mums (M4M), for mothers with PND who are experiencing barriers to treatment. The secondary aim of the SHAPER-PNDO study will be to analyse the clinical efficacy of the 6-week M4M intervention for symptoms of postnatal depression. A total of 120 mothers and their babies will be recruited for this single-arm study. All dyads will attend 6 weekly online singing sessions, facilitated by Breathe Arts Health Research. Assessments will be conducted on Zoom at baseline and week 6, with follow-ups at weeks 16 and 32, and will contain interviews for demographics, mental health, and social circumstances, and biological samples will be taken for stress markers. Qualitative interviews will be undertaken to understand the experiences of women attending the sessions and the facilitators delivering them. Finally, data will be collected on recruitment, study uptake and attendance of the programme, participant retention, and acceptability of the intervention. The SHAPER-PNDO study will focus on the feasibility, alongside the clinical efficacy, of an online delivery of M4M, available to all mothers with PND. We hope to provide a more accessible, effective treatment option for mothers with PND that can be available both during and outside of the pandemic for mothers who would otherwise struggle to attend in-person sessions, as well as to prepare for a subsequent hybrid RCT.

We investigated the effect of working from home on sleep quality/quantity and insomnia symptoms within the morningness-eveningness continuum, and its indirect repercussions on depressive symptomatology. A total of 610 Italian office workers (mean ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°standard deviation, 35.47Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°10.17Ã‚Â years) and 265 remote workers (40.31Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°10.69Ã‚Â years) participated in a web-based survey during the second contagion wave of COVID-19 (28 November-11 December 2020). We evaluated chronotype, sleep quality/duration, insomnia, and depression symptoms through validated questionnaires. Three moderated mediation models were performed on cross-sectional data, testing the mediation effect of sleep variables on the association between morningness-eveningness continuum and depression symptoms, with working modality (office vs. remote working) as moderator of the relationship between chronotype and sleep variables. Remote working was associated with delayed bedtime and get-up time. Working modality moderated the chronotype effect on sleep variables, as eveningness was related to worse sleep disturbances and shorter sleep duration among the office workers only. Working modality also moderated the mediation of sleep variables between chronotype and depression. The above mediation vanished among remote workers. The present study suggests that evening-type people did not show their characteristic vulnerability to sleep problems when working from home. This result could imply a reduction of the proposed sleep-driven predisposition to depression of late chronotypes. A working environment complying with individual circadian preferences might ensure an adequate sleep quantity/quality for the evening-type population, promoting their mental health.","Salfi, D'Atri, Amicucci, Viselli, Gorgoni, Scarpelli, Alfonsi, Ferrara","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-16256-6","20220721","COVID-19; Circadian Rhythm; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Pandemics; Sleep; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders; Sleep Wake Disorders; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-22","",34756,""
"Factors associated with poor mental health outcomes in nurses in COVID-19-designated hospitals in the postepidemic period in Guangdong Province: a cross-sectional study","The early days of the COVID-19 pandemic placed enormous pressure and subsequent negative psychological problems on nurses, but at this stage of the year-long COVID-19 outbreak, the level of stress and negative emotions that nurses experience is unclear. Our study attempted to assess the factors influencing mental health status in nurses during the postepidemic period of COVID-19. Cross-sectional study. COVID-19 designated hospitals. 1284 Chinese nurses. Electronic questionnaires, including the Chinese version of the Perceived Stress Scale (CPSS) and Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90), were distributed for self-evaluation. Regression analysis was used to analyse the associated factors of psychological stress among variables such as age, years of nursing experience, weekly working hours, anxiety symptoms, somatisation symptoms and compulsive symptoms. A total of 1284 respondents from COVID-19-designated hospitals in Guangdong Province were studied. The average CPSS score for all respondents was 22.91Ã‚Â±7.12. A total of 38.5% of respondents scored Ã¢â€°Â¥26 on the CPSS, indicating a significant degree of psychological stress. Nurses with high psychological stress had higher levels of anxiety symptoms (41.7% vs 8.0%), somatisation symptoms (31.4% vs 7.7%) and compulsion symptoms (62.3% vs 27.0%) than nurses with low psychological stress. Stepwise multiple linear regression revealed that weekly working hours, years of nursing experience, anxiety symptoms, somatisation symptoms and compulsion symptoms had a linear relationship with the participants' psychological stress scores. Nurses experienced significant physical and psychological risk while working in the postepidemic period. Our findings suggest that nurses still need support to protect their physical and mental health.","Zhang, Huang, Chen, Deng","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2022-061116","20220721","COVID-19; epidemiology; health &amp; safety; mental health; Anxiety; COVID-19; China; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Hospitals; Humans; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-22","",34757,""
"Moral and exhausting distress working in the frontline of COVID-19: a Swedish survey during the first wave in four healthcare settings","To describe the prevalence and sources of experienced moral stress and anxiety by Swedish frontline healthcare staff in the early phase of COVID-19. Cross-sectional survey, quantitative and qualitative. 1074 healthcare professionals (75% nurses) in intensive, ward-based, primary and municipal care in one Swedish county. A study-specific closed-ended and an open-ended questionnaire about moral stress and the Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale measuring anxiety, followed by an open question about anxiety. Moral stress was experienced by 52% of respondents and anxiety by 40%. Moral stress in concern for others attributed to institutional constraints comprised experiences of being deprived of possibilities to respond to humane and professional responsibility. Staff experienced being restricted in fulfilling patients' and families' need for closeness and security as well as being compelled to provide substandard and inhumane care. Uncertainty about right and good, without blame, was also described. However, a burdensome guilt also emerged as a moral distress, blaming oneself. This comprised feeling complicit in the spread of COVID-19, inadequacy in care and carrying patients' suffering. Staff also experienced an exhausting distress as a self-concern in an uncontrollable work situation. This comprised a taxing insecurity by being in limbo, being alone and fear of failing, despair of being deprived control by not being heard; unable to influence; distrusting management; as well as an excessive workload. We have not only contributed with knowledge about experiences of being in the frontline of COVID-19, but also with an understanding of a demarcation between moral stress/distress as a concern for patients and family, and exhausting distress in work situation as self-concern. A lesson for management is that ethics support should first include acknowledgement of self-concern and mitigation of guilt before any structured ethical reflection. Preventive measures for major events should focus on connectedness between all parties concerned, preventing inhumane care and burn-out.","Svantesson, Durnell, HammarstrÃƒÂ¶m, Jarl, Sandman","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-055726","20220721","COVID-19; ETHICS (see Medical Ethics); MEDICAL ETHICS; MENTAL HEALTH; SOCIAL MEDICINE; Attitude of Health Personnel; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Morals; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires; Sweden","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-22","",34758,""
"Face masks affect perception of happy faces in deaf people","The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led significant social repercussions and forced people to wear face masks. Recent research has demonstrated that the human ability to infer emotions from facial configurations is significantly reduced when face masks are worn. Since the mouth region is specifically crucial for deaf people who speak sign language, the current study assessed the impact of face masks on inferring emotional facial expressions in a population of adult deaf signers. A group of 34 congenitally deaf individuals and 34 normal-hearing individuals were asked to identify happiness, sadness, fear, anger, and neutral expression on static human pictures with and without facial masks presented through smartphones. For each emotion, the percentage of correct responses with and without face masks was calculated and compared between groups. Results indicated that face masks, such as those worn due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, limit the ability of people to infer emotions from facial expressions. The negative impact of face masks is significantly pronounced when deaf people have to recognize low-intensity expressions of happiness. These findings are of essential importance because difficulties in recognizing emotions from facial expressions due to mask wearing may contribute to the communication challenges experienced by the deaf community during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, generating feelings of frustration and exclusion.","Amadeo, Escelsior, Amore, Serafini, Pereira da Silva, Gori","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-16138-x","20220720","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-22","",34759,""
"Long-term cognitive functioning is impaired in ICU-treated COVID-19 patients: a comprehensive controlled neuropsychological study","Cognitive impairment has emerged as a common post-acute sequela of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We hypothesised that cognitive impairment exists in patients after COVID-19 and that it is most severe in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). This prospective controlled cohort study of 213 participants performed at the Helsinki University Hospital and the University of Helsinki, Finland, comprised three groups of patients-ICU-treated (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°72), ward-treated (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°49), and home-isolated (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°44)-with confirmed COVID-19 between March 13 and December 31, 2020, participating in a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation six months after the acute phase. Our study included a control group with no history of COVID-19 (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°48). Medical and demographic data were collected from electronic patient records and interviews carried out four months after the acute phase. Questionnaires filled six months after the acute phase provided information about change in cognitive functioning observed by a close informant, as well as the presence of self-reported depressive and post-traumatic symptoms. The groups differed (effect size ÃŽÂ·<sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.065, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.004) in the total cognitive score, calculated from neuropsychological measures in three domains (attention, executive functions, and memory). Both ICU-treated (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.011) and ward-treated patients (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.005) performed worse than home-isolated patients.

"Public health emergency and psychological distress among healthcare workers: a scoping review","Pandemics and natural disasters are immensely stressful events for frontline healthcare workers, as they provide patient care to a population undergoing the impacts of the disaster while experiencing such impacts to their personal lives themselves. With increased stressors to an already demanding job, frontline healthcare workers are at a higher risk of adverse effects to their mental health. The current COVID-19 pandemic has already shown to have had significant impact on the mental health of healthcare workers with increased rates of burnout, anxiety and depression. There is already literature showing the utility of individual programs at improving mental health, however, interventions at the organizational level are not well explored. This scoping review aims to provide an overview and determine the utility of a systematic review of the current body of literature assessing the effectiveness of mental health interventions at the organizational level for healthcare workers during or after a public health emergency. Electronic databases such as Medline on OVID, CENTRAL, PsycINFO on OVID and Embase on OVID were searched. A targeted search of the grey literature was conducted to identify any non-indexed studies. The population, concept and context approach was used to develop the eligibility criteria. Articles were included if (1) they assessed the impact of interventions to improve wellbeing or reduce the distress on healthcare personnel, first responders or military actively providing medical care; (2) provided quantitative or qualitative data with clearly defined outcomes that focused on established mental health indicators or qualitative descriptions on distress and wellbeing, validated scales and workplace indicators; (3) focused on organizational level interventions that occurred in a public health crisis. The literature search resulted in 4007 citations and 115 potentially relevant full-text papers. All except 5 were excluded. There were four review articles and one experimental study. There were no other unpublished reports that warranted inclusion. There is a distinct lack of research examining organizational interventions addressing mental resilience and well-being in healthcare workers in disaster settings. A systematic review in this area would be low yield. There is a clear need for further research in this area.","Palmer, Ku, Wang, Crosse, Bennett, Lee, Simmons, Duffy, Montanaro, Bazaid","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-13761-1","20220720","Healthcare workers; Mental health; Organizational research; Pandemics; Scoping review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-22","",34761,""
"Acute mania following COVID-19 in a woman with no past psychiatric history case report","The COVID-19 pandemic that began in late 2019 is caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. Since that time, many neuropsychiatric sequelae including psychosis, neurocognitive disorders, and mood disorders have been observed. The mechanism underlying these effects are currently unknown, however several mechanisms have been proposed. A 47-year-old woman with past medical history including hypertension and premenstrual syndrome but no psychiatric history presented to the psychiatric hospital with new onset mania. She had developed symptoms of COVID-19 and was later diagnosed with COVID pneumonia. During quarantine, she reported high levels of stress, grief, and anxiety. Seventeen days into her illness, she developed altered mental status, sleeplessness, elevated mood, talkativeness, and preoccupations. Her spouse was concerned for her safety and contacted emergency medical services who brought her to the psychiatric hospital. She had not slept for five days prior to her arrival and exhibited flight of ideas, talkativeness, and grandiose ideas. She reported a family history of bipolar disorder but no past manic or depressive episodes. She was diagnosed with acute mania and stabilized using antipsychotics, a mood stabilizer, and a short course of a benzodiazepine. Many of her symptoms improved, including her elevated mood, increased activity level, and flight of ideas though she continued to have decreased need for sleep as her benzodiazepine was tapered. She and her partner were agreeable to transitioning to outpatient care after her mood stabilized. This report emphasizes the link between COVID-19 and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Acute mania has no recognized association with COVID-19, but similar presentations have been reported. The patient's age and time to onset of psychiatric symptoms is consistent with previous reports. Given the growing body of evidence, this association warrants further investigation. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 causes systemic inflammation and has been shown to be neurotropic. In addition, patients undergoing quarantine experience anxiety related to the disease in addition to social isolation. Psychiatric practitioners should be aware of these effects and advocate for psychiatric evaluation following COVID-19 infection. Understanding the sequelae of infectious disease is crucial for responding to future pandemics.","Sprenger, Bare, Kashyap, Cardella","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-022-04110-y","20220720","COVID-19; Case report; Mania; Mental health; Psychiatric","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-22","",34762,""
"Virtual reality exercises at home for post COVID-19 condition: a feasibility study","Between 30-76% of COVID-19 patients have persistent physical and mental symptoms, sometimes up to 9 months after acute COVID-19. Current rehabilitation is mostly focused on the physical symptoms, while experts have agreed on the need for a biopsychosocial approach. A novel approach such as Virtual Reality (VR) rehabilitation at home might benefit patients and therapists, especially considering the expected rush of patients with post-COVID-19-condition needing rehabilitation. To investigate the feasibility of self-administered VR exercises at home for post COVID-19-condition. This is a single-arm feasibility study in an outpatient care setting. Patients who needed physiotherapy because of post COVID-19 condition were included as determined by the treating physiotherapist. Participants performed VR physical exercises at home for a period of 6 weeks and were allowed to perform VR mental exercise apps available at the VR platform to reduce stress and anxiety and promote cognitive functioning. Main outcomes were related to feasibility, i.e. duration and frequency of VR use, safety i.e. adverse events, patient satisfaction, and reasons to withdraw. Physical performance, daily activities, cognitive functioning, anxiety and depression, and quality of life were measured before and after. Forty-eight patients were included. One patient did not start VR and seven patients (15%) withdrew, mostly due to dizziness. Almost 70% of participants reported any adverse event during VR exercising. However, only 25% recalled these events at the end of the intervention period. The majority of patients described VR as having a positive influence on their recovery and the global satisfaction score was 67%. Average VR use was 30 minutes per session 3-4 times a week for 3-6 weeks. Overall use of VR applications was almost equally distributed over the three sets of VR exercises (physical, relaxing, cognitive). However, use frequency of physical exercises seemed to decrease over time, whereas use of cognitive and relaxation exercises remained stable. Physical performance and quality of life outcomes were significantly improved after six weeks. VR physical exercises at home is feasible and safe with good acceptance in a significant percentage of patients with post COVID-19 condition.

"Effects of a Metacognitive Smartphone Intervention With Weekly Mentoring Sessions for Individuals With Schizophrenia: A Quasi-Experimental Study","Application (app)-based interventions using smartphones could provide effective alternatives to traditional treatment programs during and beyond the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. The current quasi-experimental study with a non-equivalent comparison group tested the effects of a smartphone app-based metacognitive intervention program with weekly mentoring sessions on the meta-cognitive beliefs, psychotic symptoms, and social functioning of individuals with schizophrenia from community psychosocial rehabilitation centers. The study was conducted with 20 participants with severe psychotic symptoms and low social functioning and 24 participants with relatively light psychotic symptoms and good social functioning as a comparison group. For the experimental group, the app-based intervention was combined with weekly contact mentoring sessions over 10 weeks. The comparison group received only the app-based intervention over 10 weekly sessions. No differences were observed between groups' total scores; however, the experimental group showed a tendency toward improved psychotic symptoms and social functioning over time, unlike the comparison group. These findings provide an empirical basis for managing schizophrenia symptoms with smartphone apps.

"Mild-to-moderate COVID-19 impact on the cardiorespiratory fitness in young and middle-aged populations","The goal of the present study was to compare pulmonary function test (PFT) and cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) performance in COVID-19 survivors with a control group (CG). This was a cross-sectional study. Patients diagnosed with COVID-19, without severe signs and symptoms, were evaluated one month after the infection. Healthy volunteers matched for sex and age constituted the control group. All volunteers underwent the following assessments: i) clinical evaluation, ii) PTF; and iii) CPET on a cycle ergometer. Metabolic variables were measured by the CareFusion Oxycon Mobile device. In addition, heart rate responses, peak systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and perceived exertion were recorded. Twenty-nine patients with COVID-19 and 18 healthy control subjects were evaluated. Surviving patients of COVID-19 had a mean age of 40 years and had higher body mass index and persistent symptoms compared to the CG (P&lt;0.05), but patients with COVID-19 had more comorbidities, number of medications, and greater impairment of lung function (P&lt;0.05). Regarding CPET, patients surviving COVID-19 had reduced peak workload, oxygen uptake (VÃŒâ€¡O2), carbon dioxide output (VÃŒâ€¡CO2), circulatory power (CP), and end-tidal pressure for carbon dioxide (PETCO2) (P&lt;0.05). Additionally, survivors had depressed chronotropic and ventilatory responses, low peak oxygen saturation, and greater muscle fatigue (P&lt;0.05) compared to CG. Despite not showing signs and symptoms of severe disease during infection, adult survivors had losses of lung function and cardiorespiratory capacity one month after recovery from COVID-19.

"The public's attitude to and acceptance of periodic doses of the COVID-19 vaccine: A survey from Jordan","This study surveyed people regarding their acceptance of periodic doses (i.e., annual boosters) of the COVID-19 vaccine. Moreover, factors that correlate with attitudes toward periodic COVID-19 vaccines were assessed and identified. The study employed a cross-sectional methodology. The study questionnaire was distributed using Google Forms. Data were collected during the last quarter of 2021, and 1,416 adults (18 years old and over) from Jordan responded. Acceptance of COVID-19 periodic vaccine doses was calculated as a percentage of the total number of study participants, and their attitudes were scored. A multiple regression model was used to determine the predictors of public attitudes toward the annual dose of COVID-19 vaccines. The acceptance rate for receiving periodic doses of the COVID-19 vaccine was low (19.3%). Additionally, 26% of participants were unsure about receiving additional doses of the vaccine. However, 54.7% had a negative attitude toward getting periodic doses. The mean score for attitudes toward periodic doses was 47.9 (range: 29-66). Among the identified factors leading to decisions not to receive periodic doses were side effects (49.1%), waiting for further clinical studies (38.8%), and perceived no risk of contracting COVID-19 (17.7%). Regression analysis showed that income, educational attainment, and following the news about COVID-19 were predictors of participants' attitudes toward the periodic COVID-19 vaccine. Acceptance of periodic doses of the COVID-19 vaccine in Jordan is low, and the public's attitude is generally negative. Health programs and educational interventions are needed to promote vaccine acceptance and positive attitudes.","Abuhammad, Khabour, Alzoubi, Hamaideh, Alzoubi, Telfah, El-Zubi","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0271625","20220721","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-22","",34769,""
"Functional and psychosocial impact of COVID-19 pandemic on rheumatic patients' quality of life in Saudi Arabia","The COVID-19 pandemic might add to the stressors experienced by people living with rheumatic diseases. This study aimed to examine rheumatic patients' functional and psychosocial states during the pandemic and assess its impact on their quality of life. Our time-series study included a patient-centered electronic survey, sampling adult rheumatic patients living in Saudi Arabia at different time points from March to August 2020. Patient-reported outcomes included physical function, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, ability to participate in social roles, and pain interference domains were measured using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS-29 Profile v2.1). A total of 1278 respondents were enrolled. Results showed significant variation in patients' experiences. Our analyses revealed that the physical well-being of rheumatic patients was significantly impacted, and such effect was persistent over time irrespective of public health measures to control the COVID-19 outbreak. Our findings consistently demonstrated the need for psychological and social consideration to improve rheumatic patients' quality of life. Nevertheless, there is still a lot to be learned about the extent of COVID-19 impact on rheumatic patients and the implications it has on long-term disease outcomes.","Hassen, Albarrak, Albahlal, Alsaqabi, Hassen, Daghestani, Alqurtas, Alkhalaf, Bedaiwi, Omair, Almaghlouth","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11136-022-03184-1","20220720","COVID-19; Mental health; Patient-reported outcome; Quality of life; Rheumatic disease","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-22","",34770,""
"At-distance neurocognitive rehabilitation during COVID-19 pandemic: A first glance of patients' perspectives about the process and an online platform","Despite the use of digital communication technologies in neurocognitive rehabilitation has been widely used in face-to-face interventions, the difficulties of using ICT-based tools to provide rehabilitation services and the unfamiliarity of the neuropsychologists with internet interventions limited the use of these kinds of interventions in their clinical practices. The lockdown and mitigating measures associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, on the other hand, forced the use of at-distance and online interventions as a means to mitigate the impact of those measures on the mental health and rehabilitation processes of people with neurological disorders. Overall, little is known about the perspectives of patients with acquired neurological conditions about rehabilitation services delivered at distance. Therefore, the main goal of this study was to explore the perceptions that patients with neurological disorders have on at-distance online neurocognitive rehabilitation, namely during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sixteen patients with acquired neurological conditions attending an online neurocognitive rehabilitation program in a Portuguese rehabilitation center filled in an online questionnaire during the mandatory lockdown. The results of this study highlight the potential of delivering rehabilitation services at distance, presenting its advantages and limitations from patients' perspectives, as well as suggestions for improving both neurorehabilitation processes and the online rehabilitation platform used.","Geraldo, Dores, Carvalho, Guerreiro, Castro-Caldas, Barbosa","https://doi.org/10.1080/23279095.2022.2100993","20220720","COVID-19; Cognitive rehabilitation; digital communication technologies; eHealth; eMental health; neuropsychological rehabilitation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-22","",34771,""
"The Mental Health of Women with Gestational Diabetes During the COVID-19 Pandemic: An International Cross-Sectional Survey","<b><i>Introduction:</i></b> There is evidence that women with gestational diabetes are at increased risk of the common mental disorders of anxiety and depression. The COVID-19 pandemic may have exerted an additional burden on the mental health of this population. The aim of this analysis was to compare levels of symptoms of common mental disorders and experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic between pregnant and postnatal women exposed and unexposed to gestational diabetes. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Cross-sectional study utilizing quantitative data from an online survey administered across 10 countries to women who were pregnant or up to 6 months postpartum from 15 June to October 31, 2020. Women self-reported gestational diabetes and completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and GAD-7 (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 items) measures. The COPE-IS (Coronavirus Perinatal Experiences-Impact Survey) tool was also administered. Complete case analyses were conducted on a sample of 7,371 women. <b><i>Results:</i></b> There was evidence of an association between gestational diabetes and increased levels of depression symptoms, which was robust to adjustment for age, education, and employment status. There was only evidence of an association with anxiety in postnatal women. There was also evidence that women with gestational diabetes, particularly those in the postnatal period, experienced higher levels of pandemic-related distress, although they did not experience higher levels of COVID-19 infection in this sample. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> The increased risk of common mental disorders in women with gestational diabetes underscores the importance of integrated physical and mental health care for pregnant and postnatal women both during and beyond the pandemic.

"[Use of Information and Communication Technologies and health personnel from Argentine during COVID-19 pandemic]","Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the importance of mental health actions for health personnel was emphasized and the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) was recommended. Given this unprecedented panorama, the objective of this research was to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention with ICTs for health personnel from first-level care networks in Berazategui, Buenos Aires, Argentina. It was an exploratory qualitative research and evaluative design. The selection of subjects included intervened health personnel who agreed to participate. Satisfaction surveys were implemented, records of the intervening team and their meetings were analyzed. The intervention was effective: improvements in communication and interaction, self-care and a change to a proactive and creative attitude at work, decreased anxiety and stress were detected. As a protective factor, the fact of having a solid socio-affective network was highlighted. The effectiveness was characterized by influencing a repositioning of the health personnel with respect to the context, the task and the work ties. The use of ICTs was advantageous, enabled access to mental health care and generated the feeling of continuous support, strengthening the socio-affective network.","Martin, De Battista","https://doi.org/10.53680/vertex.v33i156.177","20220721","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-22","",34773,""
"Family Conflict, Physical Symptoms, and Post Traumatic Stress among Sexual Minorities during the COVID Pandemic: A Moderated Mediation Model","Sexual minorities experience health disparities compared to heterosexuals due to their stigmatized identies. The COVID- 19 pandemic has further exacerbated these disparities. Sexual minorities were surveyed about their experiences during the pandemic and asked about family conflict and minority stress as predictors of Post Traumatic Stress Symptoms (PTSS) and physical health symptoms, as well as psychological symptoms as a mediator of these relationships. We surveyed 435 sexual minorities who were recruited from Mechanical MTurk. Participants completed questionnaires that included demographics, PTSS in response to the pandemic, family conflict, minority stress, psychological symptoms, and physical health outcomes. Our findings support a moderated mediational model, explaining the relationships between family conflict, minority stress, PTSS and physical symptoms. Specifically, those participants who are high in minority stress are vulnerable to family conflict resulting in increased PTSS and physical symptoms. Psychological symptoms mediated these relationships.","Fallahi, DiPlacido, Daigle, Blau","https://doi.org/10.1080/00918369.2022.2095241","20220720","COVID-19 pandemic; Post Traumatic Stress Symptoms; family conflict; mental health; minority stress; physical symptoms; sexual minorities","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-22","",34774,""
"The Wither or Thrive Model of Resilience: an Integrative Framework of Dynamic Vulnerability and Resilience in the Face of Repeated Stressors During the COVID-19 Pandemic","During the first 2Ã‚Â years of the COVID-19 pandemic, empirical efforts in the psychological sciences have been unequivocally focused on understanding the psychosocial impact on resilience and vulnerability. While current empirical work is guided by different existing theoretical models of resilience and vulnerability, the emerging datasets have also pointed to a necessity for an update of these models. Due to the unique features and developments specific to the current pandemic such as the occurrence of repeated collective stressors of varying durations, in the current position paper, we introduce the Wither or Thrive model of Resilience (With:Resilience). It integrates key aspects of prevailing psychological resilience frameworks within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, and extends them by (1) moving away from single scale approaches towards a higher-order latent expression of resilience and vulnerability incorporating also non-clinical mental health markers, (2) proposing different trajectories of resilience-vulnerability emerging across repeated stressors over long periods of time, and (3) by incorporating multiple influencing factors including aspects of the socio-economic concept of social cohesion as well as separate mediating processing mechanisms. We propose that With:Resilience will enable a more nuanced approach and appropriate analytical investigation of the vast incoming data on mental health and resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic, and we suggest some concrete methodological approaches. This framework will assist in the development of actionable public health guidelines for society in the present and future pandemic contexts as well as aid policy making and the interventional sciences aimed at protecting the most vulnerable amongst us.","Godara, Silveira, MatthÃƒÂ¤us, Singer","https://doi.org/10.1007/s42844-022-00069-7","20220721","COVID-19; Mental health; Processing mechanisms; Psychological resilience; Risk; Social cohesion; Vulnerability","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-22","",34775,""
"Understanding Components of Therapeutic Alliance and Well-Being from Use of a Global Digital Mental Health Benefit During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Longitudinal Observational Study","Digital mental health services leverage technology to increase access to care, yet less is known about the quality of therapeutic relationships in a virtual setting. This study examined components of therapeutic alliance (a mechanism underlying successful treatment) and its association with beneficial treatment outcomes in a real-world, virtual setting. The objective is to examine (1) participant ratings of components of therapeutic alliance with providers in a virtual setting, (2) changes in subjective well-being and depressive symptoms among participants who began care with elevated depressive symptoms, and (3) the association between components of alliance and changes in participants' well-being. Adults (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3,087, <i>M</i> ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°36Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°9Ã‚Â years, 54% female) across the world with access to digital mental health benefits who engaged in videoconference sessions with a licensed therapist (18%, 555/3,087), certified coach (65%, 2,003/3,087), or both (17%, 529/3,087) between Sept. 29, 2020 and Oct. 12, 21. Participants completed 2 adapted items from the Working Alliance Inventory (goals and bonds subscales) after each session, and ratings were averaged across visits (Cronbach's <i>Ã‰â€˜</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.72). Participants' World Health Organization-Five (WHO-5) Well-Being Index scores at the start and end of the study period were used to measure changes in subjective well-being. Descriptive and inferential statistics were conducted to examine average alliance ratings across demographics and utilization types and the association between alliance and well-being. The median adapted therapeutic alliance score was 4.8 (range: 1-5) and did not differ by age, country, or baseline well-being (<i>P</i>sÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.07). Females reported higher components of alliance than males (4.88 vs. 4.67, <i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01). Participants utilizing telecoaching reported higher components of alliance than those utilizing teletherapy or both telecoaching and teletherapy (4.83 v. 4.75, <i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.004), though effect sizes were negligible. Among those with elevated baseline depressive symptoms (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°835), participants reported an average WHO-5 increase of 15.42 points (95% CI 14.19-16.65, <i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001, Cohen <i>d</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.06) with 58% (485/835) reporting clinical recovery and 57% (481/835) reporting clinical improvement in depressive symptoms. Higher components of therapeutic alliance scores predicted greater well-being at follow-up (<i>b</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.04, 95% CI 0.09-3.99, <i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.04) after controlling for age, sex, baseline WHO-5, and number of days in care (<i>R</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup> Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.06, <i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). Exploratory analyses indicated this association did not differ by utilization type, baseline well-being, or session utilization (<i>P</i>sÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.34). People with access to one-on-one videoconferencing care via a digital mental health benefit formed a strong bond and sense of alignment on goals with both coaches and therapists. Higher components of alliance scores were associated with improvements in subjective well-being among participants who began care with elevated depressive symptoms, providing evidence that a positive bond and goal alignment with a provider are two of many factors influencing virtual care outcomes. Continued focus on the quality of therapeutic relationships will ensure digital mental health services are patient-tailored as these platforms expand equitable access to evidence-based care.","Sagui-Henson, Welcome Chamberlain, Smith, Li, Castro Sweet, Altman","https://doi.org/10.1007/s41347-022-00263-5","20220721","COVID-19; Digital mental health; Telecoaching; Teletherapy; Therapeutic alliance; Videoconferencing; Well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-22","",34776,""
"Does Gratitude Promote Resilience During a Pandemic? An Examination of Mental Health and Positivity at the Onset of COVID-19","Researchers have emphasized the detrimental effects of COVID-19 on mental health, but less attention has been given to personal strengths promoting resilience during the pandemic. One strength might be gratitude, which supports wellbeing amidst adversity. A two-wave examination of 201 college students revealed anxiety symptom severity increased to a lesser extent from pre-COVID (January-March 2020) to onset-COVID (April 2020) among those who reported greater pre-COVID gratitude. A similar trend appeared for depression symptom severity. Gratitude was also correlated with less negative changes in outlook, greater positive changes in outlook, and endorsement of positive experiences resulting from COVID-19. Thematic analysis showed ""strengthened interpersonal connections"" and ""more time"" were the most commonly reported positive experiences. Overall findings suggest gratitude lessened mental health difficulties and fostered positivity at the onset of the pandemic, but more research is needed to determine whether gratitude and other strengths promote resilience as COVID-19 continues.","Kumar, Edwards, Grandgenett, Scherer, DiLillo, Jaffe","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10902-022-00554-x","20220721","Anxiety; Depression; Gratitude; Outlook; Resilience; Strengths","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-22","",34777,""

"COVID-19 countermeasures at the workplace, psychological well-being, and mental health - a nationally representative latent class analysis of Luxembourgish employees","The COVID-19 pandemic has massively changed people's working lives all over the world. While various studies investigated the effects from pandemic-induced unemployment and telecommuting, there is a lack of research regarding the impact of workplace COVID-19 countermeasures on well-being and mental health for employees who are still working on site. Thus, the aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of workplace COVID-19 countermeasures in organizations in Luxembourg. A person-centered approach was applied in order to explore how employees' psychological well-being and health (i.e., general psychological well-being, vigor, work satisfaction, work-related burnout, somatic complaints, fear of COVID-19 infection) are impacted by organizational countermeasures and whether there are certain employee groups that are less protected by these. Results of a latent class analysis revealed four different classes (<i>Low level of countermeasures</i>, <i>Medium level of countermeasures</i>, <i>High level of countermeasures</i>, <i>High level of countermeasures low distance</i>). Employees working in a healthcare setting were more likely than employees working in a non-healthcare setting to be members of the <i>High level of countermeasures low distance</i> class. Class membership was meaningfully associated with all well-being outcomes. Members of the <i>High level of countermeasures</i> class showed the highest level of well-being, whereas Members of the <i>Low level of countermeasures</i> class and the <i>High level of countermeasures low distance</i> class showed the lowest level of well-being. Policy makers and organizations are recommended to increase the level of COVID-19 countermeasures as an adjunctive strategy to prevent and mitigate adverse mental health and well-being outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"The mental health of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: a narrative review","Mental health (MH) problems among healthcare workers (HCWs) have the potential to impact negatively on the capacity of health systems to respond effectively to COVID-19. A thorough understanding of the factors that degrade or promote the MH of HCWs is needed to design and implement suitable intervention strategies to support the wellbeing of this population. MH problems among HCWs were elevated prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Accumulating evidence indicates that this public health crisis has had a disproportionately negative impact on the MH of specialised populations, including HCWs. Literature from prior health pandemics suggests that the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the MH of HCWs are likely to persist in the aftermath of the public health crisis. Primary and secondary risk factors for adverse MH outcomes have been identified and should be considered when implementing interventions to protect the MH of HCWs. The MH of HCWs has been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which is having a detrimental influence on the public health response to COVID-19. Protecting the MH of HCWs both during and beyond this public health crisis should remain a top priority, with particular emphasis on multifaceted interventions that aim to balance the psychological needs of individual HCWs with organisational-level strategies that could be targeted to promote their wellbeing.","De Kock, Latham, Cowden","https://doi.org/10.1097/YCO.0000000000000805","20220720","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-22","",34782,""
"Internet use and internet-based addictive behaviours during coronavirus pandemic","The COVID-19 outbreak profoundly influenced human lives on different levels. This narrative review aims to present recent data relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and internet use and internet-based addictive behaviours [problematic Internet use (PIU), Internet addiction, Internet gaming disorder, problem gambling or gambling disorder, social media addiction including smartphone use disorder, problematic pornography use, and compulsive buying]. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of Internet use and Internet-based addictive behaviours increased in all age groups. The COVID-19 pandemic and related containment measures were been associated with increased levels of stress, anxiety, and depression in the general population, especially among children and adolescents, which are the vulnerable groups for the development of mental disorders during the crisis. Furthermore, the fear resulting from the disease, the 'lockdown' measures, high levels of uncertainty regarding the future, and financial insecurity increased levels of loneliness, PIU, and Internet addiction. Longitudinal researches focused on the negative impacts of Internet use in prolonged stress situations on mental health, vulnerable groups, and quality of life (QoL) are needed to help clinicians and policymakers to reduce adverse consequences. Prevention programs for Internet use and Internet-based addictive behaviours must be customized to meet the needs of children, adolescents, and adults.

"Understanding the impact of COVID-19 on stress and Access to Services for Licensed and Kinship Caregivers and Youth in Foster Care","Children in foster care in the United States face unique challenges related to access to health and education services. With the COVID-19 pandemic, many of those services were temporarily disrupted, adding burden to an already strained system. This observational study describes the experiences of licensed and kinship caregivers (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°186) during the peak of COVID-19 stay-at-home orders and as restrictions to services were lifted, to understand the overall impact of COVID-19 on this already vulnerable population. Purposive sampling methods were used, where caregivers known to have received placement of children prior to, during, and following COVID-19 stay-at-home orders were identified and recruited to complete a 45-minute phone-administered survey assessing stress, risks for contracting COVID-19, strain resulting from COVID-19, and access to services for children in foster care in their care across five domains: healthcare, mental health, education, child welfare, and family visitation. Differences by caregiver type (licensed, kinship) and timing in the pandemic were examined. Licensed and kinship caregivers reported similar social and economic impacts of COVID-19, including similar rates of distress for themselves and the youth placed with them.

"Mental Health in the Time of COVID-19","Certain life experiences can have a profound effect on human emotions. During the COVID-19 pandemic, patients are reporting mood disturbances at much higher levels. Multiple encounters with real and imagined threat, prolonged isolation, and loss of control, have adversely impacted the country's behavioral health. However, most people will not pursue psychological care when needed and some who pursue it will be unable to access it. Nurse practitioners and other healthcare professionals are in an optimal position to help. Psychological research explains some of what is driving this phenomenon and offers suggestions of benefit to patients, families, and colleagues.","Covino","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nurpra.2022.07.004","20220721","Behavioral Health; COVID-19; Mental Health; Nurse Practitioner; Psychology Theory","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-22","",34785,""
"Evaluating the daily life of child and adolescent psychiatric outpatients during temporary school closure over COVID-19 pandemic: A single-center case-control study in Japan","This study evaluated the clinical characteristics of mental health of child and adolescent psychiatric patients during temporary school closure throughout the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Japan using the Questionnaire - Children with Difficulties (QCD) and other useful psychological rating scales. The participants were those who visited the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Kohnodai Hospital. From those 1,463 participants, case and control groups were selected: 92 patients who visited the hospital during the temporary school closure from March 2020 to May 2020 (case group) and randomly sampled sex- and age-matched 92 patients during the pre-COVID period from April 2017 to March 2020 (control group). QCD is a parent-assessed questionnaire designed to evaluate the difficulties of children along the course of a day, right from waking up in the morning to retiring to bed at night. Lower scores indicate stronger difficulties. QCD scores were compared between the two groups in each of the following age groups: elementary school (6-12 years of age) and junior high school (12-15 years of age). In elementary school students, scores ""during school"" of QCD indicating functioning or disabilities during school hours were 3.31 Ã‚Â± 2.52 and 4.52 Ã‚Â± 2.33 in case group and control group, respectively (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). In junior high school students, scores ""Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale (ADHD-RS)"" indicating ADHD symptoms were 16.78 Ã‚Â± 12.69 and 11.80 Ã‚Â± 10.40 in case group and control group, respectively (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The findings suggest that the closure of schools due to the pandemic might worsen difficulties among elementary school patients, and hyperactivity and impulsivity might increase among junior high school patients. The long-term impact of stress caused by school closure on child and adolescent psychiatric patients needs to be investigated in the future.","Sasaki, Sasaki, Sunakawa, Toguchi, Tanese, Saito, Shinohara, Kurokouchi, Sugimoto, Itagaki, Yoshida, Namekata, Takahashi, Harada, Hakosima, Inazaki, Yoshimura, Mizumoto, Okada, Usami","https://doi.org/10.35772/ghm.2022.01001","20220721","Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale (ADHD-RS); Questionnaire - Children with Difficulties (QCD); clinical characteristics; during school; hyperactivity and impulsivity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-22","",34786,""
"Green exercise, mental health symptoms, and state lockdown policies: A longitudinal study","Lockdown policies aimed at decreasing the transmission of COVID-19 showed unintended mental health consequences; however, natural settings may offer a respite for individuals suffering from depression or anxiety symptoms. Previous cross-sectional literature reports protective effects of outdoor exposure on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. We longitudinally assess whether green exercise corresponded with a decline in adverse mental health symptoms, controlling for state lockdown policies. We also examine whether the relation differed by state lockdown status. As our exposure variable, we specificized participation in an outdoor walk, jog, or hike (green exercise). We used, as the outcome variable, the 4-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4) to measure anxiety and depression symptoms. We utilized the Understanding America Study (UAS), a nationally representative sample of 8253 adults across 50 states in the US, surveyed biweekly between March 10, 2020-May 26, 2021. Linear fixed effect analyses controlled for time-invariant individual factors, as well as employment status, and household income. Regression results indicate a modest decline in PHQ-4 scores of approximately 0.10 (less mental health symptoms) as a function of green exercise, controlling for state lockdown status. We also find a slightly greater protective effect of green exercise on mental health symptoms during state lockdown policies (During Lockdown coeffÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯-0.103; No lockdown coeffÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯-0.088). Additionally, we find that green exercise, as opposed to indoor exercise, corresponds with a decrease in PHQ-4 scores during lockdown (Green exercise coeffÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯-0.085). Contact with nature may improve mood and decrease mental health symptoms, especially during stress-inducing periods such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Green exercise as a recommended behavioral intervention may hold relevance for greater public health.","Das, Gailey","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvp.2022.101848","20220721","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Exercise; Green exercise; Greenspace; Lockdown; Mental health; Outdoor exposure; Pandemic; Policies","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-22","",34787,""
"Problematic versus reflective use: Types of social media use as determinants of mental health among young Filipino undergraduates","<b>Background:</b> The link between problematic social media use (SMU) and mental health among youth has been established. However, there is insufficient information on how mental health is influenced by COVID-19 pandemic-related changes and positive aspects of SMU. This study aims to determine the relationship of pandemic-related changes in SMU, and two types of SMU (problematic and reflective use) with mental health among young Filipino undergraduates. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 1087 Filipino undergraduates aged 18 to 30 years old participated in this cross-sectional study. Data collection via online survey was conducted in August 2021. <b>Results:</b> Findings indicate the significant association between the perceived changes in SMU and mental health among respondents (<i>P</i> &lt;0.001). In terms of type of use, results suggest that students who demonstrate lower problematic SMU (B=-0.608, <i>P</i> &lt;0.001, 95% CI=-0.955 - -0.259) and higher reflective SMU (B=3.524, <i>P</i> &lt;0.001, 95% CI=2.051- 4.895) had higher mental wellbeing. Moreover, poorer mental wellbeing was observed among females and LGBTQ+ respondents with poorer internet quality (<i>P</i> &lt;0.05). <b>Conclusion:</b> Mental health among young Filipino undergraduates is influenced by pandemic-related changes and types of SMU. With the increasing necessity of social media amid the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health practitioners and advocates can increase their visibility online to promote reflective SMU as a protective factor against mental health decline.","Cleofas, Dayrit, Albao","https://doi.org/10.34172/hpp.2022.11","20220721","COVID-19; Cross-sectional studies; Mental health; Sexual and gender minorities; Social media; Young adult","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-22","",34788,""
"Tracking the COVID-19 outbreak in India through Twitter: Opportunities for social media based global pandemic surveillance","We investigated the utility of Twitter for conducting multi-faceted geolocation-centric pandemic surveillance, using India as an example. We collected over 4 million COVID19-related tweets related to the Indian outbreak between January and July 2021. We geolocated the tweets, applied natural language processing to characterize the tweets (eg., identifying symptoms and emotions), and compared tweet volumes with the numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Tweet numbers closely mirrored the outbreak, with the 7-day average strongly correlated with confirmed COVID-19 cases nationally (Spearman r=0.944; p=0.001), and also at the state level (Spearman r=0.84, p=0.0003). Fatigue, Dyspnea and Cough were the top symptoms detected, while there was a significant increase in the proportion of tweets expressing negative emotions (eg., fear and sadness). The surge in COVID-19 tweets was followed by increased number of posts expressing concern about black fungus and oxygen supply. Our study illustrates the potential of social media for multi-faceted pandemic surveillance.","Lakamana, Yang, Al-Garadi, Sarker","https://www.google.com/search?q=Tracking+the+COVID-19+outbreak+in+India+through+Twitter:+Opportunities+for+social+media+based+global+pandemic+surveillance.","20220721","COVID-19; Disease Outbreaks; Humans; Natural Language Processing; Pandemics; Social Media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-22","",34789,""
"Mental fatigue and negative emotion among nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic","COVID-19 is a major public health event affecting the people worldwide. Nurses are still under immense psychological pressure. This study aimed to explore the relationship between mental fatigue and negative emotions among frontline medical staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study was conducted in August 2020, which included 419 medical staff between 17 to 28Ã‚Â years. The Fatigue Scale, Multidimensional Mental Flexibility Questionnaire, Cognitive Fusion Scale, and Depression-Anxiety-Stress Brief Version Scale were used. During the data collection period, the pandemic was under control in China and continued worldwide. The results indicated that 27.7% of the medical staff experienced depression, and 32.3% of them feel stressed. Specifically, first, correlation analyses showed significant positive pairwise correlations between mental fatigue, psychological inflexibility, cognitive fusion, and negative emotions among nurses. Second, mediation model tests showed statistically significant mediating effects of psychological inflexibility and cognitive fusion between mental fatigue on nurses' negative emotions, and statistically, significant chain mediating effects of psychological inflexibility and cognitive fusion. Mental fatigue indirectly affects nurses' negative effects through the mediating effects of psychological inflexibility, cognitive fusion, and the chain mediating effects of psychological inflexibility and cognitive fusion, respectively. the negative effects of mental fatigue come from impairment of cognitive functioning, and interventions using acceptance and commitment therapy for mental fatigue and negative emotions are more effective since both psychological inflexibility and cognitive fusion are important components of the therapy.","Wang, Xie, Tian, Wu, Liu, Huang, Gong, Yu, Luo, Jiao, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-022-03468-2","20220721","Cognitive fusion; Mental fatigue; Negative emotions; Psychological inflexibility","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-22","",34790,""
"Physical and psychological reconditioning in long COVID syndrome: Results of an out-of-hospital exercise and psychological - based rehabilitation program","Long Covid Syndrome (LCS) is used to describe signs and symptoms that continue or develop after acute COVID-19 infection. Natural history and treatment of this syndrome are still poorly understood, even if evidences suggest the potential role of physical rehabilitation in improving symptoms in these patients. The aim of the present study was to evaluate effectiveness, safety and feasibility of an out-of-hospital multidisciplinary rehabilitation (MDR) program, based both on physical and psychological reconditioning, in reducing symptoms and improving physical fitness and psychological parameters in patients with LCS. Thirty consecutive patients with LCS (18 males, mean age 58Ã¢â‚¬Â¯years) underwent an accurate medical screening process including anthropometric and muscular strength evaluation, cardiopulmonary exercise test, quality of life (QoL) and psychological appraisal before and after a MDR program. At baseline, all LCS patients were strongly symptomatic and showed severe impairments in physical performance, QoL and psychological parameters. No adverse effects and dropouts were observed during the exercise training sessions. After the MDR program, COVID-19 residual symptoms significantly decreased, and significant improvements in upper and lower limb muscular strength, cardiopulmonary parameters, perceived physical and mental health, depression and anxiety were observed. The present study confirms the severe physical and psychological impairment of patients with LCS and suggests that a MDR program is effective, safe and feasible in these patients and could promote their physical and psychological recovery.","Compagno, Palermi, Pescatore, Brugin, Sarto, Marin, Calzavara, Nizzetto, Scevola, Aloi, Biffi, Zanella, Carretta, Gallo, Giada","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcha.2022.101080","20220721","Long covid syndrome; Multidisciplinary rehabilitation; Physical exercise training; Psychological management","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-22","",34791,""
"""Don't Just Study our Distress, Do Something"": Implementing and Evaluating a Modified Stepped-Care Model for Health Care Worker Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been concerns about the mental health of health care workers (HCW). Although numerous studies have investigated the level of distress among HCW, few studies have explored programs to improve their mental well-being. In this paper, we describe the implementation and evaluation of a program to support the mental health of HCW at University Health Network (UHN), Canada's largest healthcare network. Using a quality improvement approach, we conducted a needs assessment and then created and evaluated a modified stepped-care model to address HCW mental health during the pandemic. This included: online resources focused on psychoeducation and self-management, access to online support and psychotherapeutic groups, and self-referral for individual care from a psychologist or psychiatrist. We used ongoing mixed-methods evaluation, combining quantitative and qualitative analysis, to improve program quality. The program is ongoing, running continuously throughout the pandemic. We present data up to November 30, 2021. There were over 12,000 hits to the UHN's COVID mental health intranet web page, which included self-management resources and information on group support. One hundred and sixty-six people self-referred for individual psychological or psychiatric care. The mean wait time from referral to initial appointment was 5.4 days, with an average of seven appointments for each service user. The majority had moderate to severe symptoms of depression and anxiety at referral, with over 20% expressing thoughts of self-harm or suicide. Post-care user feedback, collected through self-report surveys and semistructured interviews, indicated that the program is effective and valued. Development of a high-quality internal mental health support for HCW program is feasible, effective, and highly valued. By using early and frequent feedback from multiple perspectives and stakeholders to address demand and implement changes responsively, the program was adjusted to meet HCW mental health needs as the pandemic evolved.","Sheehan, Schulz-Quach, Ruttan, MacGillivray, McKay, Seto, Li, Stewart, Abbey, Berkhout","https://doi.org/10.1177/07067437221111372","20220720","COVID-19; healthcare workers; mental health; mixed-methods","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-22","",34792,""
