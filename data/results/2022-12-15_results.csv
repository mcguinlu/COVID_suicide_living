"COVID-19 Vaccination in Pregnancy: The Impact of Multimorbidity and Smoking Status on Vaccine Hesitancy, a Cohort Study of 25,111 Women in Wales, UK","Abstract Background Multimorbidity and pregnancy are two risk factors for more severe outcomes after a SARS-CoV-2 infection, thus vaccination uptake is important for pregnant women living with multimorbidity. This study aimed to examine the impact of multimorbidity, smoking status, and demographics (age, ethnic group, area of deprivation) on vaccine hesitancy among pregnant women in Wales using electronic health records (EHR) linkage. Methods This cohort study utilised routinely collected, individual-level, anonymised population-scale linked data within the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank. Pregnant women were identified from 13th April 2021 to 31st December 2021. Survival analysis was utilised to examine and compare the length of time to vaccination uptake in pregnancy by multimorbidity and smoking status, as well as depression, diabetes, asthma, and cardiovascular conditions independently. Variation in uptake by; multimorbidity, smoking status, and demographics was examined jointly and separately for the independent conditions using hazard ratios (HR) from the Cox regression model. A bootstrapping internal validation was conducted to assess the performance of the models. Results Within the population cohort, 8,203 (32.7%) received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy, with 8,572 (34.1%) remaining unvaccinated throughout the follow-up period, and 8,336 (33.2%) receiving the vaccine postpartum. Women aged 30 years or older were more likely to have the vaccine in pregnancy. Those who had depression were slightly but significantly more likely to have the vaccine compared to those without depression (HR = 1.08, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.14, p = 0.02). Women living with multimorbidity (> 1 health condition) were 1.12 times more likely to have the vaccine compared to those living without multimorbidity (HR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.19, p = 0.001). Vaccine uptakes were significantly lower among both current smokers and former smokers compared to never smokers (HR = 0.87, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.94, p < 0.001 and HR = 0.92, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.98, p = 0.015 respectively). Uptake was also lower among those living in the most deprived areas compared to those living in the most affluent areas (HR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.96, p = 0.002). The validated model had similar performance and revealed that multimorbidity, smoking status, age, and deprivation level together have a significant impact on vaccine hesitancy (p < 0.05 for all). Conclusion Younger women, living without multimorbidity (zero or only one health condition), current and former smokers, and those living in the more deprived areas are less likely to have the vaccine, thus, a targeted approach to vaccinations may be required for these groups. Women living with multimorbidity are slightly but significantly less likely to be hesitant about COVID-19 vaccination when pregnant.","Mohamed Mhereeg; Hope Jones; Jonathan Kennedy; Mike Seaborne; Michael Parker; Natasha Kennedy; Ashley Akbari; Luisa Zuccolo; Amaya Azcoaga-Lorenzo; Alisha Davies; Krishnarajah Nirantharakumar; Sinead Brophy","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.12.12.22283200","20221214","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-15","",42302,""
"The Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Health: A Scoping Review","Background This scoping review assessed the COVID-19 impacts on mental health and associated risk factors. Methods A systematic literature search for relevant articles published in the period March 2020 to July 2022, was conducted in the APA PsychInfo, JBI Evidence Synthesis, Epistemonikos, PubMed, and Cochrane databases. Results A total of 72 studies met the inclusion criteria. Results showed that the commonly used mental health assessment tools were the Patient Health Questionnaire (41.7%), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (36%), 21-item Depression, Anxiety, and Stress (13.9%), Impact of Event Scale (12.5%), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (9.7%), Symptom Checklist and the General Health Questionnaire (6.9% each). The prevalence rate of depression ranged from 5-76.5%, 5.6-80.5% for anxiety, 9.1-65% for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, 8.3-61.7% for sleep disorders, 4.9-70.1% for stress, 7-71.5% for psychological distress, and 21.4-69.3% for general mental health conditions. The major risks included female gender, healthcare-related/frontline jobs, isolation/quarantine, poverty, lower education, COVID-19 risk, age, commodities, mental illness history, negative psychology, and higher social media exposure. The incidence of mental disorders increased along with the increasing cases of COVID-19 and the corresponding government restrictions. Conclusion Standard assessment tools were used for mental health assessment by the reviewed studies which were conducted during COVID-19. Mental health disorders like depression, anxiety, and stress increased during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns. Various factors impacted the prevalence of mental health disorders. Policymakers need to provide social protective measures to improve coping capacities during critical health events to avoid negative impacts on the population. Further studies should investigate the effectiveness of interventions for reducing the prevalence and risk factors for mental health conditions during a public health challenge.","Blessing  O.

"Stress, Genetics and Mood: Impact of COVID-19 on a College Freshman Sample","Objectives: Use a longitudinal approach to study the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the emergence of symptoms of depression and/or anxiety in college freshmen. Define the interplay between genetic risk and psychosocial factors in shaping vulnerability or resilience to pandemic stress. Methods: University of Michigan freshmen were characterized at baseline using multiple psychological instruments. They were genotyped and polygenic risk score for depression (MDD-PRS) was calculated. Daily physical activity was captured. They were sampled at multiple time points throughout the freshman year on clinical rating scales, including GAD-7 and PHQ-9 for anxiety and depression, respectively. The 2019-2020 cohort (N=122) was compared to an earlier cohort (N=106) to assess the impact of the pandemic. Results: Across cohorts, 25%-57% of freshmen developed significant symptoms of anxiety or depression. In the 2019-2020 cohort, measures of anxiety and depression increased significantly after the onset of COVID-19. Physical activity was dramatically reduced by the pandemic and was associated with the emergence of mood symptoms. Low MDD-PRS subjects exhibited lower relative risk for depression/anxiety during a typical freshman year, but they were more negatively impacted by the pandemic than High MDD-PRS subjects. Conversely, a cluster of psychological indices at baseline predicted resilience in High MDD-PRS subjects who did not develop a mood disorder post-stress. Conclusions: The pandemic had a profound impact on college freshmen triggering depression and anxiety symptoms. Pandemic stress overrode the advantage conferred by ""genetic resilience"". By contrast, ""psychosocial resilience"" was protective even in the face of high genetic risk and pandemic stress.","Cortney A Turner; Huzefa Khalil; Virginia Murphy-Weinberg; Megan H Hagenauer; Linda Gates; Yu Tang; Lauren Weinberg; Robert Grysko; Leonor Floran-Garduno; Thomas Dokas; Zhuo Zhao; Yu Fang; Srijan Sen; Juan F Lopez; Stanley J Watson; Huda Akil","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.12.13.22283409","20221213","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-15","",42304,""
"Mental Health in Ireland During the Covid Pandemic: Evidence from Two Longitudinal Surveys","Using data from the Growing Up in Ireland Covid survey, this study examines the evolution of mental health as measured in December 2020, nine months into the pandemic, compared to observations pre pandemic for two cohorts of people.  A deterioration in mental health was observed for both cohorts and particularly for younger women of the 1998 cohort.  The increase in the rate of depression predominantly occurred due to an overall decline in mental health rather than being concentrated amongst those already vulnerable (in the sense of being near the depression threshold).  There was little, if any, change in the socioeconomic gradient associated with mental health and virtually no gradient at all was observed pre or post pandemic for the 1998 cohort.  Mobility analysis revealed that not only did females from the 1998 cohort show greater transitions into depression, they also appeared to transition into more extreme levels of depression.","David Madden","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.12.12.22283343","20221213","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-15","",42305,""
"Machine learning identifies a COVID-19-specific phenotype in university students using a mental health app","Advances in smartphone technology have allowed people to access mental healthcare via digital apps from wherever and whenever they choose. University students experience a high burden of mental health concerns. Although these apps improve mental health symptoms, user engagement has remained low. Studies have shown that users can be subgrouped based on unique characteristics that just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) can use to improve engagement. To date, however, no studies have examined the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on these subgroups. Here, we use machine learning to examine user subgroup characteristics across three COVID-19-specific timepoints: during lockdown, immediately following lockdown, and three months after lockdown ended. We demonstrate that there are three unique subgroups of university students who access mental health apps. Two of these, with either higher or lower mental well-being, were defined by characteristics that were stable across COVID-19 timepoints. The third, situational well-being, had characteristics that were timepoint-dependent, suggesting that they are highly influenced by traumatic stressors and stressful situations. This subgroup also showed feelings and behaviours consistent with burnout. Overall, our findings clearly suggest that user subgroups are unique: they have different characteristics and therefore likely have different mental healthcare goals. Our findings also highlight the importance of including questions and additional interventions targeting traumatic stress(ors), reason(s) for use, and burnout in JITAI-style mental health apps to improve engagement.","Artur Shvetcov; Alexis Whitton; Suranga Kasturi; Wu-Yi Zheng; Joanne Beames; Omar Ibrahim; Jin Han; Leonard Hoon; Kon Mouzakis; Sunil Gupta; Svetha Venkatesh; Helen Christensen; Jill Newby","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.12.07.22283234","20221212","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-15","",42306,""
"COVID-19-related distress is associated with analogue PTSD symptoms after exposure to an analogue stressor Malestar psicológico relacionado con COVID-19 se asocia a síntomas de TEPT analógico tras la exposición a un estresor analógico COVID-19 相关精神痛苦与类似应激源暴露后的类似 PTSD 症状相关","Background: The COVID-19 outbreak in early 2020 was associated with an immediate increase in mental health problems in a significant percentage of the general population. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate how the COVID-19 pandemic – as a psychosocial stressor – affected the aetiological processes of mental disorders. Previous research has shown that stress potentiates associative (fear) learning and analogue symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and that analogue PTSD symptoms can emerge in response to associative learning. Objective: We investigated whether distress in response to the COVID-19 outbreak support the development of intrusions and rumination after exposure to a non-COVID-19-related analogue trauma. Moreover, we examined if these effects are mediated by the strength of associative learning during analogue trauma. Method: 122 undergraduate university students participated in an online experiment between March and July 2020. They completed questionnaires measuring distress and rumination related to the COVID-19 outbreak. On a subsequent day, they went through an associative learning task, in which neutral stimuli were paired with the appearance of a highly aversive film clip. Subjective ratings were assessed as indicators of associative learning. On the next day, participants documented film-related intrusions and rumination. Results: COVID-19-related distress but not rumination was associated with post-film intrusion and rumination load. These effects were mediated by associative learning. Conclusions: The current findings are in line with the assumptions that stress enhanced both associative learning and PTSD symptoms. Specifically, they indicate that prolonged psychosocial stress – like during the COVID-19 outbreak – is linked to individual differences in memory processing of aversive events. Further confirmatory research is needed to replicate these results. HIGHLIGHTS High distress related to the COVID-19 outbreak was associated with analogue PTSD symptom development. This effect was mediated by the strength of associative learning. Prolonged psychosocial stress like the COVID-19 outbreak might impact memory processing of aversive events.","Friesen, Edith, Michael, Tanja, Schäfer, Sarah K.; Sopp, M.

"Social anxiety and depression symptoms in Chinese left-behind children after the lifting of COVID-19 lockdown: A network analysis","Returning to social life after the lifting of COVID-19 lockdown may increase risk of social anxiety, which is highly co-morbid with depression. However, few studies have reported the association between them. To explore the complex relationship between social anxiety and depression symptoms in left-behind children after the lifting of the COVID-19 lockdown. A cross-sectional survey was conducted 6&#x2009;months after the lockdown removal. A total of 3,107 left-behind children completed the survey with a mean age of 13.33 and a response rate of 87.77%. Depression and social anxiety severity were assessed by the DSM-5 Patient Health Questionnaire for Adolescents and the DSM-5 Social Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire, respectively. The symptom-level association between the two disorders was examined using network analysis. After the lifting of COVID-19 lockdown, the prevalence of depression and social anxiety in left-behind children was 19.57% and 12.36%, respectively, with a co-morbidity rate of 8.98%. Network analysis showed that ""Social tension"" and ""Social avoidance"" had the greatest expected influence; ""Humiliation"" and ""Motor"" were bridge symptom nodes in the network. The directed acyclic graph indicated that ""Social fright"" was at the upstream of all symptoms. Attention should be paid to social anxiety symptoms in left-behind children after the lifting of COVID-19 lockdown. Prevention and intervention measures should be taken promptly to reduce the comorbidity of social anxiety and depression symptoms in the left-behind children after the lifting of lockdown.","Li, Ren, Zhang, Liu, Zhao, Zhan, Li, Luo, Feng","https://doi.org/10.1177/00207640221141784","20221213","Depression; adolescents; left-behind children; lockdown removal; network analysis; social anxiety","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-15","",42308,""
"An examination of the reciprocal associations between physical activity and anxiety, depressive symptoms, and sleep quality during the first 9&#x202f;Weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic in Belgium","During the initial outbreak of the global COVID-19 pandemic, many countries imposed a total lockdown (containment at home). Although it was still allowed in Belgium to be physically active or exercise with people from your household in the vicinity of your home, engaging in sports or physical activity in a group or club context was no longer permitted. To examine whether a lack of physical activity was potentially threatening to the mental well-being of citizens and vice versa, the present study examined concurrent and reciprocal relationships between physical activity and anxiety, depressive symptoms, and sleep quality during the COVID-19 lockdown in a 9-week longitudinal design. In a sample of 983 Belgian adults (75.1% female; <i>M</i> <sub>age</sub>&#x202f;=&#x202f;43.78, range&#x202f;=&#x202f;18-82 years), we explored these relationships at both the between- and within-person levels through random intercept cross-lagged panel models. The findings indicate that more physical activity was associated with lower symptoms of anxiety and depression and better sleep quality, a finding observed both at the between-person (across weeks; &#x3b2;<sub>anxiety</sub>&#x202f;=&#x202f;-.25, &#x3b2;<sub>depression</sub>&#x202f;=&#x202f;-0.30, &#x3b2;<sub>sleep quality</sub>&#x202f;=&#x202f;.24, <i>p</i>&#x202f;&lt;&#x202f;.001) and within-person level (within weeks; &#x3b2;<sub>anxiety</sub>&#x202f;=&#x202f;-0.10, &#x3b2;<sub>depression</sub>&#x202f;=&#x202f;-0.14, &#x3b2;<sub>sleep quality</sub>&#x202f;=&#x202f;.11, <i>p</i>&#x202f;&lt;&#x202f;.05). Moreover, at the within-person level, an increase in feelings of anxiety and depression at one moment predicted lower levels of physical activity one week later (&#x3b2;<sub>anxiety</sub>&#x202f;=&#x202f;-0.04, &#x3b2;<sub>depression</sub>&#x202f;=&#x202f;-0.06, <i>p</i>&#x202f;&lt;&#x202f;.05).

"Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on carer-employees' well-being: a twelve-country comparison","The aim of this analysis is to assess the potential ways that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted Canadian carer-employees (CEs) and identify the needs CEs feel is required for them to continue providing care. We assess the similarities and differences in the stresses CEs faced during COVID-19 globally across countries in the G7, Australia, Spain, Brazil, Taiwan, India, and China. We aim to compare Canada against global trends with respect to the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the supports in place for CEs. The study utilized 2020 Carer Well-Being Index at the country level. Descriptive data on Canadian CEs is first reviewed, followed by comparisons, by country, on responses relating to: (a) time spent caring; (b) sources of support; (c) impact on paid work and career, and; (d) emotional/mental, financial, and physical health. The relationship between government support and emotional/mental health is also explored. When compared to pre-pandemic times, CEs in Canada on average spent more time caregiving, with 34% reporting more difficulty balancing their paid job and caring responsibilities. Seventy-one percent of CEs feel their mental health has deteriorated. Thirty-four percent of Canadian CEs received support from the government, and only 30% received support from their employers. Globally, there was a similar trend, with CEs experiencing deteriorating mental health, work impacts, and unmet needs during the pandemic. Comparing the well-being of Canadian CEs with other countries provides an opportunity to evaluate areas where Canadian policies and programs have been effective, as well as areas needing improvement.","Wu, Williams, Wang, Henningsen, Kitchen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wss.2022.100123","20221213","COVID-19; Caregiving; Carer; Family; International; Well-being; Work","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-15","",42310,""

This study aimed to examine the differences in factors that influence depression among older adults based on gender. This study was a cross-sectional study employing the secondary data of 3581 older adults living alone at the early stage of COVID-19, collected from the 2020 Korea Community Health Survey, and used multiple linear regression analyses to identify factors associated with depression. We found that women had a higher level of depressive status than men. Low subjective health status was most significantly related to depression in both older men and older women. For women, body mass index and more changes in daily life due to COVID-19 were predictors of depression. Conversely, for men, a lower level of monthly income and smoking were significant predictors of depression. Depressive status caused by COVID-19 was likely to be frailer for older women who were living alone.

"Yoga Therapy in Cancer Care via Telehealth During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Yoga is an evidence-based mind-body practice known to improve physical and mental health in cancer patients. We report on the processes and patient-reported outcomes of one-on-one yoga therapy (YT) consultations delivered via telehealth. For patients completing a YT consultation between March 2020 and October 2021, we examined demographics, reasons for referral, and self-reported symptom burden before and after one YT session using the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS). Changes in ESAS symptom and subscale scores [physical distress (PHS), psychological distress (PSS), and global distress (GDS)] were evaluated by Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Descriptive statistics summarized the data. Ninety-seven initial YT consults were completed, with data evaluated for 95 patient encounters. The majority were women (83.2%) and white (75.8%), The mean age for females was 54.0 and for males was 53.4; the most common diagnosis was breast cancer (48%), 32.6% had metastatic disease, and nearly half (48.4%) were employed full-time. Mental health (43.0%) was the most common reason for referral, followed by fatigue (13.2%) and sleep disturbances (11.7%). The highest symptoms at baseline were sleep disturbance (4.3), followed by anxiety (3.7) and fatigue (3.5). YT lead to clinically and statistically significant reductions in PHS (mean change&#x2009;=&#x2009;-3.1, <i>P</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001) and GDS (mean change&#x2009;=&#x2009;-5.1, <i>P</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001) and significant reductions in PSS (mean change&#x2009;=&#x2009;-1.6, <i>P</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;.001).

"The change in pediatric subject symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic in China: an increase in cardiac consultation","It is reported that the adverse impact of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on the mental health of children and adolescents may lead to psychologically related disorders during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) period. Subject symptoms such as chest pain, chest tightness, and palpitation may be related to increased stress and anxiety in children and adolescents. The present research aimed to determine the number of pediatric consults and etiology of subject symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic period and compared it with the same timelines in 2019 and 2021 to discuss the impact of different periods on the organic disease onset of children with subject symptoms, especially in cardiac involvement. Children who visited Qingdao&#xa0;Women and Children's Hospital, Qingdao University between January 23 to April 30, 2019 (pre-COVID-19 period), January 23 to April 30, 2020 (COVID-19 period), and January 23 to April 30, 2021 (post-COVID-19 period) presenting chest pain, chest tightness, and palpitation were recruited. Information to determine gender, age, medical history, department for the initial visit, clinical manifestations, time from the latest onset to the visit, and diagnosis were recorded. A total of 891 patients were enrolled in the present study (514 males; median age: 7.72). One hundred twenty-three patients presented during the pre-COVID-19 period while 130 during the COVID-19 period, nevertheless, the number substantially increased during the post-COVID-19 period (n&#xa0;=&#x2009;638). Cardiac etiology accounted for 1.68% (n&#xa0;=&#x2009;15) of the patient population, including arrhythmias (n&#xa0;=&#x2009;10, 1.12%), myocarditis (n&#xa0;=&#x2009;4, 0.44%), and atrial septal defect (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;1, 0.11%). There was no significant difference among groups in the distribution of organic etiology. The median time from the latest onset to the visit during the pre-COVID-19 period was 7&#x2009;days compared to 10&#x2009;days during the COVID-19 period and 3&#x2009;days during the post-COVID period. During the post-COVID-19 period, the median time from the latest onset to the visit was significantly shorter than that in the pre-COVID-19 period or COVID-19 period. The pediatric consult of children with subject symptoms presented increased substantially during the post-COVID-19 period, while there was no significant difference in the number of patients involving the cardiac disease.

"The relationship between mental health and violence toward women during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has a number of psychological consequences for societies, especially women. This study was conducted to determine the relationship between mental health and violence toward women during the COVID-19 pandemic in Iran.This study was conducted on during late October to November 2020 (N&#x2009;=&#x2009;400). Demographic information questionnaire, General Health Questionnaire(GHQ-12) and violence toward women inventory(VTWI) were used.The results showed that violence was higher among employed women. Also, the results showed that VTW was higher in women with 3 children, high school degree, family income under 3&#xa0;million and women over 40 years old. Findings showed that the mean mental health of women at the COVID-19 pandemic was moderate (15.14&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;8.8). Also, with increasing psychological and economic violence, their mental health decreases. Therefore, it is suggested that policy makers and planners, apart from the physical effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, pay attention to its psychological dimension, especially for women, and try to allocate funds to maintain and promote mental health and family.","Shoaei, Asadi, Salmani","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-022-04448-3","20221212","Mental Health; The COVID-19 pandemic; Violence toward women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-15","",42314,""
"International recruitment of mental health nurses to the national health service: a challenge for the UK","The UK's National Health Service (NHS) has been dealing with a shortage in the nursing workforce for the past few decades. With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and post-Brexit effects, it is important now more than ever to concentrate on recruiting new staff and retaining current staff in the National Health Service. The increasing demand for mental health services stresses the importance of prioritising recruitment of mental health nurses. One of the main strategies being implemented to combat this shortage is the recruitment of internationally trained mental health nurses. Whilst this is a favourable solution, the multiple challenges this proposal brings makes it hard for the National Health Service to practically implement this to increase staff numbers. In this discursive position paper, we consider the difficulties the National Health Service is currently facing in terms of recruiting mental health nurses and then discuss the importance of and need for international recruitment including the strategies that are currently being implemented. The challenges and obstacles associated with this proposed resolution will also be addressed.","Phiri, Sajid, Baykoca, Shetty, Mudoni, Rathod, Delanerolle","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12912-022-01128-1","20221212","International nurses; International recruitment; Mental health nurses; Nursing shortages","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-15","",42315,""
"Impact of high prebiotic and probiotic dietary education in the SARS-CoV-2 era: improved cardio-metabolic profile in schizophrenia spectrum&#xa0;disorders","The development of new aetiological premises, such as the microbiota-gut-brain axis theory, evidences the influence of dietary and nutritional patterns on mental health, affecting the patient's quality of life in terms of physical and cardiovascular health. The aim was to determine the impact of a nutritional programme focused on increasing the intake of prebiotic and probiotic food on cardio-metabolic status in individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders in the contextual setting of the SARS-CoV-2 era. A randomised clinical trial (two-arm, double-blind, balanced-block, six-month intervention) was conducted in a group of 50 individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorder during the SARS-CoV-2 confinement period. The control group received conventional dietary counselling on an individual basis. In the intervention group, an individual nutritional education programme with a high content of prebiotics and probiotics (dairy and fermented foods, green leafy vegetables, high-fibre fruit, whole grains, etc.) was established. Data on cardiovascular status were collected at baseline, three and six months. In addition, anthropometric parameters were analysed monthly. Forty-four subjects completed follow-up and were analysed. Statistical differences (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05) were found in all anthropometric variables at baseline and six months of intervention. A 27.4% reduction in the prevalence of metabolic syndrome risk factors in all its components was evidenced, leading to a clinically significant improvement (decrease in cardiovascular risk) in the intervention group at six months. The development of a nutritional programme focused on increasing the dietary content of prebiotics and probiotics effectively improves the cardio-metabolic profile in schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Therefore, nursing assumes an essential role in the effectiveness of dietary interventions through nutritional education and the promotion of healthy lifestyles. Likewise, nursing acquires a relevant role in interdisciplinary coordination in confinement contexts. The study protocol complied with the Declaration of Helsinki for medical studies; the study received ethical approval from referral Research Ethics Committee in November 2019 (reg. no. 468) and retrospectively registered in clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04366401.

"Being a technician during COVID-19: a qualitative cross-sectional survey on the experiences of clinical neurophysiology technicians","During the Sars-CoV-2 virus pandemic, Italy faced an unrivaled health emergency. Its impact has been significant on the hospital system and personnel. Clinical neurophysiology technicians played a central role (but less visibly so compared to other healthcare workers) in managing the COVID-19 pandemic. This research aims to explore the experiences of clinical neurophysiology technicians during the pandemic and contribute to the debate on the well-being of healthcare workers on the front line. We implemented a cross-sectional survey across Italy. It contained questions that were open-ended for participants to develop their answers and acquire a fuller perspective. The responses were analyzed according to the framework method. One hundred and thirty-one responses were valid, and the following themes were generated: technicians' experiences in their relationship with patients, technicians' relationship with their workgroup and directors, and technicians' relationship with the context outside of their work. The first theme included sub-themes: fear of infection, empathy, difficulty, a sense of obligation and responsibility, anger, and sadness. The second theme contained selfishness/solidarity in the workgroup, lack of protection/collaboration from superiors, stress, and distrust. The last theme included fear, stress/tiredness, serenity, sadness, and anger. This study contributes to building a humanized perspective for personnel management, bringing attention to the technical work of healthcare professionals in an emergency and the emotional and relational dimensions. These are the starting points to define proper, contextually adequate support.","Sireci, Bellei, Torre, Ferrari, Minardi, Ghirotto, Valzania","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10072-022-06551-5","20221212","COVID-19; Clinical neurophysiology technician; Framework analysis; Italy; Survey","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-15","",42317,""

"Psychiatric Emergencies in Los Angeles County During, and After, Initial COVID-19 Societal Restrictions: An Interrupted Time-Series Analysis","Emergency department (ED) visits for psychiatric care in the US reportedly declined during the COVID-19 pandemic. This work, however, does not control for strong temporal patterning in visits before the pandemic and does not examine a potential ""rebound"" in demand for psychiatric care following the relaxation of initial societal restrictions. Here, we examine COVID-19-related perturbations in psychiatric care during and after the 1st stage of societal restrictions in the largest safety-net hospital in Los Angeles. We retrieved psychiatric ED visit data (98,888 total over 156&#xa0;weeks, Jan 2018 to Dec 2020) from Los Angeles County&#x2009;+&#x2009;USC Medical Center. We applied interrupted time series methods to identify and control for autocorrelation in psychiatric ED visits before examining their relation with the 1st stage of societal restrictions (i.e., March 13 to May 8, 2020), as well as the subsequent ""rebound"" period of relaxed restrictions (i.e., after May 8, 2020). Psychiatric ED visits fell by 78.13 per week (i.e., 12%) during the 1st stage of societal restrictions (SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;23.99, p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01). Reductions in ED visits for alcohol use, substance use, and (to a lesser extent) anxiety disorders accounted for the overall decline. After the 1st stage of societal restrictions, however, we observe no ""rebound"" above expected values in psychiatric ED visits overall (coef&#x2009;=&#x2009;-&#x2009;16.89, SD&#x2009;=&#x2009;20.58, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.41) or by diagnostic subtype.

"Lessons from billed telepsychiatry in Australia during the COVID-19 pandemic: rapid adaptation to increase specialist psychiatric care","To summarise and comment upon research regarding the service delivery impact of the introduction of COVID-19 pandemic Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) psychiatrist telehealth services in Australia in 2020-2021. Type of program or service: Privately-billed, MBS-reimbursed, face-to-face and telehealth consultations with a specialist psychiatrist during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper draws on analyses of previously published papers. MBS-item-consultation data were extracted for video, telephone and face-to-face consultations with a psychiatrist for April-September 2020 in Victoria, and compared to face-to-face consultations in the same period of 2019 and for all of Australia. We also extracted MBS-item-consultation data for all of Australia from April 2020-April 2021, and compared this to face-to-face consultations for April 2018-April 2019. Although face-to-face consultations with psychiatrists waned following nationwide lockdowns, the introduction of MBS billing items for video and telephone telehealth meant that overall consultations were 13% higher in April 2020-April 2021, compared to the pre-pandemic year prior. A lockdown restricted to Victoria was associated with a 19% increase in consultations from April-September 2020, compared to the corresponding period in 2019. Telehealth has been an integral component of Australia's relatively successful mental health response to COVID-19. The public availability of MBS data makes it possible to accurately assess change in psychiatric practice. The Australian Federal Government subsidises MBS telepsychiatry care by a patient rebate per consultation, illustrating that government-subsidised services can rapidly provide additional care. Rapid and substantial provision of telepsychiatry in Australia indicates that it may be a useful substitute or adjunct to face-to-face care during future pandemics and natural disasters.","Looi, Bastiampillai, Pring, Reay, Kisely, Allison","https://doi.org/10.17061/phrp3242238","20221212","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-15","",42320,""
"Long-term outcomes of COVID-19 convalescents: An 185-month longitudinal study in Wuhan","To describe the full scope of long-term outcomes and the ongoing pathophysiological alterations among the COVID-19 survivor.

Serial changes in multiple physical and psychological outcomes were comprehensively characterized. We additionally explored the potential risk factors of SARS-CoV-2 antibody response and sequelae symptoms. We observed continuous improvement of sequelae symptoms, lung function, chest CT, 6-minute walk test, and the Borg dyspnoea scale, whereas sequelae symptoms (at least one) and abnormal chest CT patterns still existed in 45.2% and about 30% of the patients at 18.5 months, respectively. Both anxiety and depression disorders were alleviated for the convalescents, although the depression status was sustained for a longer duration. Most COVID-19 convalescents had an overall improved physical and psychological health status, whereas sequelae symptoms, residual lesions on lung function, exercise impairment, and mental health disorders were still observed in a small proportion of the participants at 18.5 months after infection.

"Course and predictors of eating disorder symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and pandemic-related eating disorder concerns among adults with eating disorders during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic and public health mitigation measures have negatively impacted individuals with eating disorders (ED). We evaluated changes in and predictors of ED symptoms, pandemic-related ED concerns, and anxiety symptoms across the first 12&#x2009;months of the COVID-19 pandemic among individuals with self-reported EDs in the United States (US), Sweden (SE), and the Netherlands (NL). Participants in the US (N&#xa0;=&#xa0;510), SE (N&#x2009;=&#xa0;982), and NL (N&#x2009;=&#xa0;510) completed an online survey assessing ED symptoms (binge eating, restriction, compensatory behaviors, and anxiety about being unable to exercise), general anxiety symptoms, and pandemic-related ED concerns about accessing food, lack of structure and social support, being in a triggering environment, and food and treatment costs. In the US and NL, respondents completed surveys beginning April 2020 and continuing monthly for a year. In SE, respondents completed baseline surveys in May 2020, a six-month follow-up around December 2020, and a 12-month follow-up in May 2021. Three patterns emerged: (1) a curvilinear course with the highest level of symptoms at baseline, declining through November 2020, and increasing through the rest of the year; (2) a linear declining course over time; and (3) a stable course with no changes. Worries about COVID-19 infection, lockdown, concerns about lack of structure and social support, and concerns about accessing food consistent with one's recovery meal plan predicted increases in ED symptoms. ED symptoms tracked with pandemic-related concerns in people with EDs. Conceptualizing predictors of symptoms may inform therapy and public health resources that reduce the impact of pandemics on mental health. Our findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic had negative impacts on people with eating disorders, including amplification of mental health symptoms and stressors around peak periods of infection and COVID-19 restrictions. These findings inform medical providers, policy-makers, and community-based supports about the information and resource needs of this group to ensure efficient dissemination in future public health emergencies and during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Thompson, Hedlund, Sun, Peat, Goode, Termorshuizen, Thornton, Borg, van Furth, Birgeg&#xe5;rd, Bulik, Watson","https://doi.org/10.1002/eat.23870","20221212","COVID-19; anxiety; coronavirus; eating disorders; lockdown; pandemic; quarantine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-15","",42322,""

"Psychometric and factorial validity of the International Adjustment Disorder Questionnaire (IADQ) in an Italian sample: a validation and prevalence estimate study","Adjustment disorder (AjD) is a is a maladaptive emotional or behavioral reaction to a stressful event or change in a person's life. Compared to other previously validated tools, the International Adjustment Disorder Questionnaire (IADQ) stands out as one of the most reliable and handy one for AjD. Since no homologous instrument exists now, in this study we aimed to validate an Italian version of the IADQ. 21206 subjects (80.4% females) during the initial stages of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic were recruited. We conducted a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), testing two latent models, a monofactorial and a bifactorial one. Concurrent validity by correlating the total and the two factors' scores with measures of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress was then estimated. We finally estimated the rates of AjD among the population, and a a binary logistic regression was conducted to analyze the predictors of such disorder. CFA showed a bi-factorial validity, with both excellent incremental and comparative fit indices. The IADQ scores correlated strongly with symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. In the Italian sample, the prevalence of probable AjD was 8.23%. Female gender, being engaged, widowed, and having COVID-19-related stressors resulted as significant independent risk factors for AjD. IADQ is an easy-to-use, brief, and psychometrically sound self-report measure for AjD. Thus, it may be considered a reliable tool for both research and clinical settings.

Although many studies have analyzed the association between muscular fitness and psychological symptoms in children and adolescents, research during the COVID-19 pandemic is limited. Our study focused on analyzing the association between duration of muscle exercise and psychological symptoms among Chinese college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. A four-stage stratified whole-group sampling method was used to investigate basic demographic information, duration of muscle exercise and psychological symptoms in 5,559 college students aged 19-22 years in China. Chi-square test (categorical variables) and one-way ANOVA (continuous variables) were used to compare the psychological symptoms of college students with different durations of muscle exercise. Logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the association between duration of muscle exercise and psychological symptoms. The detection rate of psychological symptoms among Chinese college students was 9.0%; the detection rate was 10.7% for boys and 7.6% for girls. The proportions of duration of muscle exercise at &lt;30&#x2005;min/d, 30-60&#x2005;min/d, and &gt;60&#x2005;min/d were 75.0%, 20.4%, and 4.6%, respectively. After adjusting for relevant confounding variables, taking Chinese college students with duration of muscle exercise &gt;60&#x2005;min/d as the reference group, duration of muscle exercise &lt;30&#x2005;min/d was positively correlated with the occurrence of psychological symptoms (<i>OR</i>: 4.19, 95%CI: 1.82, 9.61) (<i>P&#x2009;</i>&lt;&#x2009;0.001).

Both treatments were administered once a week for 8 weeks. Evaluation was performed 4 weeks before intervention, pre-intervention, post-intervention, and 4 weeks after intervention. The primary outcome was diagnosis of a physical disability, and secondary outcomes included psychological inflexibility, pain intensity, anxiety, depression, physical function, and objectively measured physical activity. [Results] Physical therapist-delivered acceptance and commitment therapy had a limited effect on physical disability, although we observed a favorable tendency. With regard to secondary outcomes, physical therapist-delivered acceptance and commitment therapy did not show significant effects. Notably, 15 patients withdrew from this study and 6 were diagnosed with coronavirus disease.

"COVID-19 and mental health: A systematic review of international medical student surveys","The medical school curriculum has imposed psychological stressors on students worldwide, some of which may induce feelings of increased depression and anxiety. Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the feelings of stress, depression, and anxiety that a portion of medical students experience in their daily life. The aim of this systematic review is to gather concrete data from medical schools around the globe, and further evaluate how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted medical students' mental health. Systematic search of data from PubMed, EMBASE, psycINFO, MEDLINE Complete, and Global Health for studies conducted between December 2019 and July 2021 was conducted. Data from 47 different surveys of medical students from various medical institutions throughout the world were included in this review. These surveys, administered in the form of questionnaires that utilized rating scales, measured anxiety, depression, and stress levels in medical students amidst the COVID-19 outbreak. The COVID-19 outbreak was found to have negative effects on medical students, most notably causing emotional and behavioral changes and detrimental mental health impacts. Higher levels of stress, depression, and anxiety have been found in medical students since the outbreak. This systematic review highlights the sustained high prevalence of moderate depression, anxiety and stress among medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"The stress response of intensive care unit medical doctors facing repeated severe emergencies","This study assesses the psychopathological distress experienced by doctors working in an Intensive care unit (ICU) during the COVID-19 pandemic. These doctors were the same who faced the consequences of a previous natural disaster, a severe 6.3 magnitude earthquake. A second objective is to evaluate their current mental attitude, professional performances and coping strategies adopted in the pandemic in relation to the conditioning effect of that first emergency, the earthquake. Thirty-seven ICU medical doctors were recruited and assessed using Rapid Stress Assessment (RSA) rating scale, Symptom Checklist-90 Revised (SCL-90-R), Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Hopelessness Scale, Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory III. Comparison between exposure to the earthquake and COVID pandemic has been made in terms of professional role and psychological burden. Comparison between 2009 earthquake catastrophe and COVID pandemic conditions evidenced relevant changes in professional role, team, environment, shifts, and work organization. The doctors, who already experienced the 2009 earthquake reported a feeling of greater insecurity facing this latter catastrophe, the COVID pandemic, as well as perception of greater concern for their family and the global situation. However, having participated in the medical management of another emergency (the 2009 earthquake) appears to have contributed to limiting demoralization and psychological distress. The feeling of having greater decision-making possibilities and participation in the organization of work, strengthen coping skills in the face of the emergency.","Ciuffini, Marrelli, Leuter, Stratta, Paladini, Ciccozzi, Marsili, Marinangeli, Piroli","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.895954","20221212","COVID-19; intensive care unit (ICU) doctors; repeated trauma exposure; stress reactions; work functioning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-15","",42329,""
"The impact of experiencing severe physical abuse in childhood on adolescent refugees' emotional distress and integration during the COVID-19 pandemic","Accumulating evidence highlights the importance of pre- and post- migration stressors on refugees' mental health and integration. In addition to migration-associated stressors, experiences earlier in life such as physical abuse in childhood as well as current life stress as produced by the COVID-19-pandemic may impair mental health and successful integration - yet evidence on these further risks is still limited. The present study explicitly focused on the impact of severe physical abuse in childhood during the COVID-19 pandemic and evaluated the impact of these additional stressors on emotional distress and integration of refugees in Germany. The sample included 80 refugees, 88.8% male, mean age 19.7&#x2009;years. In a semi-structured interview, trained psychologists screened for emotional distress, using the Refugee Health Screener, and integration status, using the Integration Index. The experience of severe physical abuse in childhood was quantified as a yes/no response to the question: ""Have you been hit so badly before the age of 15 that you had to go to hospital or needed medical attention?"" Multiple hierarchical regression analyses further included gender, age, residence status, months since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and length of stay in Germany to predict emotional distress and integration. Two regression analyses determined significant predictors of (1) emotional distress (adjusted <i>R</i> <sup>2</sup>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.23): duration of being in the pandemic (<i>&#xdf;</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.38, <i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) and severe physical abuse in childhood (<i>&#xdf;</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.31, <i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.005), and significant predictors of (2) integration (adjusted <i>R</i> <sup>2</sup>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.53): length of stay in Germany (<i>&#xdf;</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.62, <i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001), severe physical abuse in childhood (<i>&#xdf;</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.21, <i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.019) and emotional distress (<i>&#xdf;</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.28, <i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.002).

"Positive identity predicts psychological wellbeing in Chilean youth: A double-mediation model","Positive youth development (PYD) allows the youth to be comprehended from their potential, strengths and assets, in contrast to the traditional deficit view that focuses on their weaknesses. The PYD model promotes constructive behaviours in youth by highlighting the positive attributes usually found during the transition from childhood to adulthood to achieve healthy and optimal development in later life. Overall, PYD comprises five key competence (5C), the flourishing models and forty developmental assets. In the present study, a structural equation model is tested with the Chilean dataset of the PYD project on the premise that Positive Identity is the core internal developmental asset explaining Psychological wellbeing and that Confidence and Character are mediators of the relationship between Positive Identity and Psychological Wellbeing.

"The mental health of China and Pakistan, mental health laws and COVID-19 mental health policies: a comparative review","Mental health is one of the major causes of disability worldwide, and mental health problems such as depression and anxiety are ranked among the top 25 leading causes of disease burden in the world. This burden is considerable over the lifetime of both men and women and in various settings and ages. This study aims to compare the mental health status of people in China and Pakistan and to highlight the mental health laws and policies during COVID-19 and afterwards. According to the literature on mental health, before the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health problems increased gradually, but during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, an abrupt surge occurred in mental health problems. To overcome mental health disorders, most (but not all) countries have mental health laws, but some countries ignore mental health disorders. China is one such country that has mental health laws and policies and, during the COVID-19 pandemic, China made beneficial and robust policies and laws, thereby succeeding in defeating the COVID-19 pandemic. The mortality rate and financial loss were also lower than in other countries. While Pakistan has mental health laws and general health policies, the law is only limited to paperwork and books. When it came to COVID-19, Pakistan did not make any specific laws to overcome the virus. Mental health problems are greater in Pakistan than in China, and China's mental health laws and policies are more robust and more widely implemented than those in Pakistan. We conclude that there are fewer mental health issues in China than in Pakistan both before and since the COVID-19 pandemic. China has strong mental health laws and these are robustly implemented, while the mental health law in Pakistan is not applied in practice.","Shah, Sun, Xu, Jiang, Yuan","https://doi.org/10.1136/gpsych-2022-100885","20221212","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-15","",42332,""
"People with passive sleep delay have more severe depression and sleep problems than those with active sleep delays-a cross-sectional study after the COVID-19 pandemic","This study was designed to investigate the effect of different types of sleep delay in depression and sleep characteristics after the pandemic. Meanwhile, risk factors for depression were also explored. The survey was conducted in Wuhan from March 1 to May 30, 2021, and participants were recruited through a snowball process. A total of 1,583 people with sleep delays responded to the invitation, of which 1,296 were enrolled. Participants filled out a questionnaire including social demographics, sleep characteristics, Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). There were no significant differences in sex, social support and level of education between the two types of sleep delay (<i>p</i> = 0.961, <i>p</i> = 0.110, <i>p</i> = 0.090), but the average age of the passive sleep delay group was higher (<i>p</i> = 0.015). And most people with active sleep delay were caused by the use of electronic devices (73.6%), while most people with passive sleep delay were caused by work or study tasks (73.2%), with a significant difference between the two groups (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). People who actively delayed sleep had more regular sleep (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), better sleep quality and longer sleep duration (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). In addition, although they delayed sleep more frequently (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), they had significantly lower depression degree than people who passively delayed sleep (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Passive sleep delays, usually caused by work or study, has higher levels of depression and more adverse sleep behaviors than active sleep delay. The findings help further understand the effects of delayed sleep and provide insight for people with delayed sleep to evaluate their own condition. Future studies are required to standardize and accurately classify sleep delay and further explore it.","Wan, Xiao, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e11805","20221212","Depression; Sleep delay; Sleep duration; Sleep quality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-15","",42333,""
"Piloting Group-Based Behavioral Activation Therapy for Families of Deceased COVID-19 Patients","Surrogate decision-making is a stressful process for many family members of critically ill patients. The COVID-19 pandemic may have amplified the risk for anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in ICU surrogates. This study piloted an online group-based behavioral intervention with family members of deceased COVID-19 patients. Participant engagement, perceptions, and responses related to the intervention were assessed. A single-arm pilot study was conducted with bereaved families. Quantitative analysis of measures of anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms was conducted with mixed models. Qualitative data were analyzed to identify themes in surrogates' experiences with the intervention. Participants were recruited from ICUs at a tertiary academic medical center. Participants completed the intervention, measures, and interviews online. Participants were family members of patients who died from COVID-19. The intervention involved six online group-based behavioral activation sessions. Sessions covered topics pertinent to grieving and engagement in personally meaningful activities. Semi-structured interviews explored participants' experiences with the intervention. Surrogates also completed measures of anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms before and after the intervention. Nineteen of 26 participants (73.1%) completed the study. Thematic analysis suggested that surrogates found the group helpful for overcoming perceived isolation, receiving validation, and developing coping skills. Significant pre-to-post reductions were observed in symptoms of Hospital and Anxiety Disorder Scale (HADS) anxiety (pre-mean = 9.27, sd = 5.30 vs post-mean = 6.80, sd = 4.16; <i>p</i> = 0.0271), HADS depression (pre-mean =6 .65, sd = 4.58 vs post- mean = 4.89, sd = 3.40; <i>p</i> = 0.0436), and Impact of Events Scale-Revised PTSD (pre-mean = 36.86, sd = 16.97 vs post-mean = 24.14, sd = 13.49; <i>p</i> = 0.0008). This was a preliminary study based on qualitative and self-report measures. Future studies should include a control group.

"Mental health status of infected children between 7 to 12 years old in Fangcang Shelter Hospital during the COVID-19 Shanghai lockdown in 2022: a cross-section study","There has been an increase in research on the potential adverse effects on children's mental health, especially depression and anxiety, during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic over the past few months. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate depression and anxiety symptoms among children in shelter hospitals during the 2022 Shanghai lockdown. A total of 98 infected children aged 7-12 years were enrolled in this study between April 19 and June 4, 2022. The Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), Anxiety Scale for Children-Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASC-ASD), and Anxiety Scale or Children-Autism Spectrum Disorder Parent Form (ASC-ADS-P) were used to assess children's depression and anxiety symptoms. Children's guardians completed the survey by verbally asking their child/children the questions. The guardians additionally completed the ASC-ASD-P. The prevalence of depression and anxiety was 12.2% and 13.3%, respectively. A total of 66 respondents reported no physical symptoms. Linear regression showed that myalgia [7.198, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.163-11.232], headache (7.189, 95% CI: 3.842-10.535) coryza (5.362, 95% CI: 2.654-8.070), and number of quarantine days (4.378, 95% CI: 3.409-5.348) were significantly correlated with higher levels of depression, whereas chills (14.337, 95% CI: 9.799-18.875), coryza (9.309, 95% CI: 6.467-12.152), headache (7.193, 95% CI: 3.182-11.204), myalgia (5.571, 95% CI: 0.684-10.459), number of quarantine days (3.190, 95% CI: 1.796-4.584), and gender (male) (-4.137, 95% CI: -6.609 to 1.665) were associated with anxiety scores. Persistent fever was correlated with depression (P=0.007), whereas physical discomfort, such as persistent fever, cough, sore throat, headache, myalgia, and coryza were correlated with anxiety (all P&lt;0.05). The findings of the present study indicated a moderate prevalence of depression and anxiety among infected children in a shelter hospital during the 2022 Shanghai lockdown. Therefore, the findings of this study could provide scientific basis for the development of targeted psychological intervention.

"Psychological first aid intervention: rescue from psychological distress and improving the pre-licensure nursing students' resilience amidst COVID-19 crisis and beyond","The public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in mental and psychological ramifications on the healthcare professionals. The pre-licensure nursing students found themselves not only fighting against the baneful virus but also weak ego resilience. At this point, enriching the pre-licensure nursing students with psychological first aid (PFA) could help them to recover from the feeling of psychological distress and improve their resilience capacity to encounter any upcoming outbreaks. A quasi-experimental two groups, a pre-post-test study was used in which sixty-four pre-licensure nursing students completed a baseline survey which revealed high levels of psychological distress and low resilience capacity due to the COVID-19 crisis. The study group engaged in the Psychological First- aid Intervention (PFA) at the end of the clinical practicum course period, while the comparison group received routine psychological support.

"Nudging digital physical activity breaks for home studying of university students-A randomized controlled trial during the COVID-19 pandemic with daily activity measures","University students are of particular public health interest because they are at high risk for physical inactivity and sedentary behaviors. In conjunction with the COVID-19 pandemic, sedentariness and physical inactivity were reinforced, as the pandemic led to an increase in home studying. Physical activity (PA) breaks have been identified as promoting factors for university students' physical and mental health. Therefore, the present study explored an approach to nudge students to take PA breaks at home while studying. The purpose was to test the effectiveness of digital nudging for PA breaks for 10 days using a randomized intervention design during the COVID-19 pandemic. It included an intervention group who received daily digital motivational prompts for PA break videos and a minimal intervention control group who got low-level access to PA break videos <i>via</i> a one-time link sent to the media library. Using a sample of university students in the southwest of Germany (<i>n</i> = 57), two-level binary logistic regression models were calculated to predict daily participation in PA breaks during the intervention period depending on the nudging intervention, as well as previous participation in PA breaks, the general PA level of the subjects before the intervention, the time spent on PA and on home studying in a day, the kind of day during the intervention (weekday vs. weekend), and the students' age. Results revealed that the digital nudging intervention did not show any significant effect on the likelihood to participate in PA breaks on a given day (0.69 &#x2264; &#x3b2; &#x2264; 0.75, <i>p</i> &gt; 0.3). Instead, an individual-level effect revealed that the longer a student studied at home over the course of a day, the more likely he or she was to take a PA break (1.07 &#x2264; &#x3b2; &#x2264; 1.11, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Current findings show that individual characteristics such as daily time spent on home studying, which can change over the course of the intervention phase, are relevant considerations within nudging intervention in university setting. This provides initial insights especially for digital PA breaks for students during home studying.","Teuber, Leyhr, Moll, Sudeck","https://doi.org/10.3389/fspor.2022.1024996","20221212","digital nudging; home studying; intervention; motivational prompts; physical activity breaks; university students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-15","",42337,""
"[Not Available]","According to the precautionary principle and facing the initial uncertainty of the potential seriousness of Covid-19, France has adopted collective measures understood as acceptable despite the deprivation of liberty and the known risks of long confinement on mental health. Such measures should be applied proportionately and cause the least possible harm. Among these, the closure of schools was decided by declination of those appearing in response plans to viral pandemics where children play a major role in the transmission of the disease (e.g. flu). In an unprecedented way, measures and constraints have been taken against the interests of children and to protect a vulnerable group other than the children themselves. From the perspective of children's health, the relationship between health gains from these measures and negative consequences has been unbalanced. The reduction in instruction time has reduced overall academic performance and has had adverse consequences for the socialization and development of children. Confinement has generated more serious domestic accidents, an increase in intra-family violence and marked collateral effects in terms of the mental health of adolescents. Very early on, the various Covid19-related publications showed that children were not the driving force behind this pandemic - If the initial application of collective measures was legitimate, the adaptation of measures at the individual level was out of step with the already known repercussions followed by those observed on the health of the child. Selon le principe de pr&#xe9;caution et face &#xe0; l&#x2019;incertitude initiale de la gravit&#xe9; potentielle de la Covid-19, la France a adopt&#xe9; des mesures collectives comprises comme acceptables malgr&#xe9; la privation de libert&#xe9; et les risques connus d&#x2019;un confinement long sur la sant&#xe9; mentale des individus.

"First access to mental health services during COVID-19 pandemic: a multicenter study","Background: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health is complex and affects a broad segment of the population. Several studies indicate that depressive, anxious and post-traumatic symptoms are common in people exposed to SARS-Cov2. Methods: 458 subjects were recruited during their first consultation in outpatient psychiatric services between June 2020 and October 2021. Post-traumatic, depressive and anxious symptoms were assessed using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), the Beck Depression Inventory Scale-second edition (BDI-II), and&#xa0; the Self Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS). A specific set of questions was developed, with the aim of evaluating socio-demographic variables and work, environmental and personal characteristics related to the pandemic. Results: Prevalence rates of clinically significant depressive, anxious and post-traumatic symptoms were 57.6%, 63.5% and 54.8%, respectively. Female gender, worsening of relationship status and financial consequences due to the pandemic were the conditions most strongly associated with the presence of psychopathology. Limitation: The cross-sectional design of the study doesn't allow an evaluation over time of the sample. No assumption of causality can be made due to the lack of pre-pandemic assessments for the investigated variables. Conclusions: The impact of the pandemic involves depressive, anxious and post-traumatic dimensions. The investigated psychopathology correlates with several variables expressing the personal and environmental changes that occurred in the population due to the COVID-19 emergency.

"A mixed methods exploration of a pilot photo-reflection intervention for enhancing coping and well-being during COVID-19","Restrictions enforced during the COVID-19 pandemic are associated with negative impacts on mental health and well-being. There is a need to support individuals to cope with these challenging circumstances. An embedded design mixed methods approach was employed to explore challenges experienced during the pandemic, the effectiveness of a photo-reflection intervention for enhancing coping, wellbeing, and resilience, and how this intervention functioned to impact on these outcomes. 108 participants were randomised to one of three photo-taking conditions; challenges experienced, coping strategies, or experiences and were assessed with measures of wellbeing, coping and resilience. In addition, open-ended survey questions were used to assess perceptions of experiences and of the effects of the intervention. There were no significant differences across the groups, however subjective psychological well-being, and emotional and functional well-being improved post-intervention regardless of intervention type. There was also an increase in planning and self-distraction coping for those whom the intervention elicited reflection. Qualitative data highlighted a range of challenges experienced and examples of both adaptive and maladaptive coping approaches. Photo-reflection intervention approaches may improve well-being and enhance coping during these challenging circumstances through providing opportunity to review and reflect on life experiences.","Burton, Elliott","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aip.2022.101990","20221212","COVID-19; Coping; Intervention; Mixed-methods; Photo-taking; Wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-15","",42340,""
"The longitudinal impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on health behaviors, psychosocial factors, and cognitive functioning in older adults","<b>Background:</b> Older adults are at a greater risk for contracting and experiencing severe illness from COVID-19 and may be further affected by pandemic-related precautions (e.g., social distancing and isolation in quarantine). However, the longitudinal impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on older adults is unclear. The current study examines changes in health behaviors, psychosocial factors, and cognitive functioning in a large sample of older adults using a pre-pandemic baseline and longitudinal follow-up throughout 9 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> One hundred and eighty-nine older adults (ages 65-89) were recruited from a multisite clinical trial to complete additional virtual assessments during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mixed effects models evaluated changes in health behaviors, psychosocial factors, and cognitive functioning during the pandemic compared to a pre-pandemic baseline and over the course of the pandemic (i.e., comparing the first and last COVID-19 timepoints). <b>Results:</b> Compared to their pre-pandemic baseline, during the pandemic, older adults reported worsened sleep quality, perceived physical health and functioning, mental health, slight increases in depression and apathy symptoms, reduced social engagement/perceived social support, but demonstrated better performance on objective cognitive tasks of attention and working memory. Throughout the course of the pandemic, these older adults reported continued worsening of perceived physical health and function, fewer depression symptoms, and they demonstrated improved cognitive performance. It is important to note that changes on self-report mood measures and cognitive performance were relatively small regarding clinical significance. Education largely served as a protective factor, such that greater years of education was generally associated with better outcomes across domains. <b>Conclusions:</b> The present study provides insights into the longitudinal impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on health behaviors, psychosocial factors, and cognitive functioning in a population disproportionately affected by the virus. Replicating this study design in a demographically representative older adult sample is warranted to further inform intervention strategies targeting older adults negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hausman, Dai, O'Shea, Dominguez, Fillingim, Calfee, Carballo, Hernandez, Perryman, Kraft, Evangelista, Van Etten, Smith, Bharadwaj, Song, Porges, DeKosky, Hishaw, Marsiske, Cohen, Alexander, Wu, Woods","https://doi.org/10.3389/fnagi.2022.999107","20221212","COVID-19; cognition; health behaviors; older adults; psychosocial","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-15","",42341,""
"Alterations in mental health and quality of life among healthcare workers in times of COVID-19: Four-stage cross-sectional study during first four pandemic waves in Poland","The COVID-19 pandemic has had many unexpected effects that have affected the mental health of healthcare workers. In response to the crisis, healthcare workers appear to be the most vulnerable to the psychological effects of the pandemic. The purpose of the study was to assess the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms and healthcare workers' quality of life during the different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The questionnaire was distributed in four stages corresponding to the different waves of the pandemic in Poland. The last stage of the study covered the period from November 1, 2021 to November 31, 2021 which coincided with the fourth wave of COVID-19 in Poland. The Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II), Generalized Anxiety Disorderd-7 (GAD-7), and Manchester Brief Assessment of Quality of Life (MANSA) scales were used. A total of 1,243 respondents participated. A gradual increase in moderate and severe anxiety was observed as the pandemic continued, comparing waves I and IV of the pandemic. No statistically significant differences were observed in comparing the mean values of the BDI-II, GAD-7, and MANSA scales across waves. A decrease in fear due to the disease and neighbor's quarantine was found. Women, single people and those with a psychiatric history are more likely to be affected by the destructive impact of the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic is significantly affecting the mental health and quality of life of healthcare workers, but trend is not uniform. It is necessary to continue monitoring the mental health of medical workers, who are the most important link in the fight against the pandemic.","Babicki, Kowalski, Bogudzi&#x144;ska, Mastalerz-Migas","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.1027734","20221212","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; mental health; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-15","",42342,""
"Mental health in the Austrian general population during COVID-19: Cross-sectional study on the association with sociodemographic factors","The impact of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and the associated governmental restrictions on mental health have been reported in different countries. This cross-sectional study evaluated mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in Austria and the association with sociodemographic factors (i.e., age, sex, education, income, employment status, partnership status, and migration background). A representative sample (<i>N</i> = 1,031) of the Austrian general population was surveyed online end of April 2022. Indicators of mental health were depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), insomnia (ISI), alcohol abuse (CAGE), eating disorders (SCOFF), and stress (PSS-10). 1,031 participants completed the online survey (50.3% women; mean age: 45.6 &#xb1; 17.23 years). Cut-offs for clinically relevant depression were exceeded by 28%. 16% scored above the cut-off for clinically relevant anxiety symptoms, 15% for clinical insomnia, 18% for alcohol abuse, 26% for eating disorders, and 65% for moderate to high stress. Comparisons with another cross-sectional representative Austrian sample recruited during the first weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic in Austria (April 2020) revealed increases in depression (from 21 to 28%) but no significant changes in anxiety, insomnia, and moderate to high stress. Multivariable logistic regression showed the strongest associations of mental health indicators with age, income, and sex. Increasing age and income were associated with lower odds of mental health symptoms. Being female compared to male increased the odds of depressive symptoms while decreasing the odds of alcohol abuse. The COVID-19 crisis seems particularly stressful for younger adults (&lt;35 years) and people with low income (&lt;&#x20ac;2,000 net household income per month).

"Relationship between negative coping style and fear of COVID-19 among Wuhan college students during the post-pandemic period: A moderated chain mediation model","After a long-term lockdown, particularly one in which human life is at risk, negative psychological consequences are expected. In this study, we aimed to explore the cause of stress and fear of coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) among Chinese college students in Wuhan during the latest strictest lockdown. During the COVID-19 outbreak, 1,070 college students from Wuhan, aged 18-29 years, took part in an online survey. We used correlations, bootstrap tests, and other statistical analysis methods to analyze the data. Negative coping style significantly positively predicted fear of COVID-19, and stress had a significant mediating effect on the relationship between negative coping style and fear of COVID-19. In addition, rumination and stress had a chain-mediating effect on the relationship between negative coping style and fear of COVID-19. Perceived social support moderated the three paths of this serial mediation model. Negative emotions, such as stress and fear of COVID-19, in college students are caused by both behavior (e.g., negative coping style) and cognition (e.g., rumination). Importantly, negative cognitive thinking (i.e., rumination) is often a malign consequence of a negative coping style. Thus, to improve students' mental health, students should be encouraged to engage in more positive behaviors and seek social support during periods of adherence to regular prevention and control measures.","Yang, Yang, Xia","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.994685","20221212","COVID-19; fear of COVID-19; negative coping style; rumination; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-15","",42344,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war on stress and anxiety in students: A systematic review","The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic at the end of 2019 and the Russian-Ukrainian war in February 2022 created restrictions and uncertainties that affected the general population's mental health. One of the affected groups was students. This systematic review summarizes the current literature on the prevalence, outcomes, and interventions for stress and anxiety among university, college, graduate, or postsecondary populations. A systematic literature search was performed on PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PsychInfo, and ProQuest, following PRISMA guidelines. Specific inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, and screening was performed to identify the definitive studies. The prevalence of anxiety was relatively high, ranging from 88.9 to 13.63%, and the prevalence of stress ranged from 56 to 28.14%. The predictors of stress and anxiety included young age, gender being female, STEM course, loneliness, low academic level in school, urban lockdown, confinement, having a preexisting disease, having relatives or friends infected with COVID-19, and proximity to a COVID-19 zone. The predictors of stress included gender being female, living with family, living in a household with many people, being confined rather than having the freedom to relocate, proximity to confirmed cases of COVID-19, lack of access to materials on COVID-19, preexisting mental disorders, and lack of knowledge on the preventable nature of COVID-19. The sources of anxiety among the university students identified in the study included academics, postponement of graduation, cancelation or disruption of planned events, inability to achieve goals, and finances. In addition, the students used trauma-focused, forward-focused, task-oriented, emotion-oriented, and avoidance-oriented coping strategies. The included studies showed that stress and anxiety increased during the pandemic and the war, with gender and uncertainty playing a critical role. The studies provide insights into the widespread use of problem-focused and task-focused coping strategies despite their impact on increasing stress and anxiety.","Limone, Toto, Messina","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.1081013","20221212","COVID-19; anxiety; pandemic; stress; war","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-15","",42345,""
"Genetics, shared environment, or individual experience? A cross-sectional study of the health status following SARS-CoV-2 infection in monozygotic and dizygotic twins","The clinical presentation of COVID-19 shows a remarkably broad spectrum of symptoms. Although studies with adult twins on SARS-CoV-2 infection are rare so far, the fact that there is a genetic component associated with the highly variable clinical outcomes of COVID-19 has already been highlighted in recent studies investigating potential candidate genes and polymorphisms. This is the first study of adult monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins concordantly affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection to estimate variances explained by genetic, shared, and individual environmental components of both somatic and psychological symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data were collected from 10 adult twin pairs (5 MZ, 5 DZ) in which both twins already had a SARS-CoV-2 infection. A self-designed questionnaire, the Barthel Index, and the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) were used to assess various symptoms and health status following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Intra-class correlations were calculated, and the Falconer formula was used to quantify and differentiate the percentages of genetic influences as well as common environment and personal experiences on the examined traits. In addition, potential factors influencing symptom burden were examined and discussed. We found high estimated heritability for mental impairment after SARS-CoV-2 infection (<i>h</i> <sup>2</sup> = 1.158) and for general fatigue (<i>h</i> <sup>2</sup> = 1.258). For symptom burden, reduced activity, and reduced motivation the individual environment appears to have the strongest influence. Other fatigue symptoms are influenced by genetic effects which range between 42.8 and 69.4%. Both genetics and individual environment play a role in health status after SARS-CoV-2 infection-mental status could be influenced primarily by genetic make-up, whereas for symptom burden and certain fatigue dimensions, non-shared environment could play a more critical role. Possible individual factors influencing the course of the disease were identified. However, gene-environment interactions may still be a source of differences between twins, and the search for candidate genes remains crucial on the road to personalized medicine.","Rupp, Weimer, Goebel-Stengel, Enck, Zipfel, Stengel","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.1048676","20221212","functional; general symptoms; mental health; psychosomatic; somatoform","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-15","",42346,""
"Monthly Trends in Drug Overdose Mortality among Youth Aged 15-34 Years in the United States, 2018-2021: Measuring the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic","Adolescents and young adults in the United States (US) have experienced a significant increase in drug overdose mortality rates in the last two decades. During the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, they experienced a lack of access to substance use disorder treatment, stay-home orders, school closure, social isolation, increased psychological distress, and financial strain. Few studies have examined the impact of the pandemic on monthly trends in drug-overdose mortality among youth by race/ethnicity. This study estimates differential changes in monthly drug overdose mortality among youth in the US by age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Monthly deaths from the final 2018-2020 national mortality data and the 2021 provisional mortality data were used, and monthly population estimates were obtained from the Census Bureau. We calculated age-specific monthly drug overdose deaths per one million population and used log-linear regression models to estimate monthly percent increases in mortality rates from January 2018 through October 2021. Drug-overdose deaths among individuals aged 15-34 increased by 36.5% from 2019 (21,152 deaths) to 2020 (28,879 deaths). From February 2020 to May 2020, the drug-overdose mortality rate increased by 62% for males, 53% for females, 79% for Blacks, 62% for American Indians/Alaska Natives (AIANs), 57% for Hispanics, 56% for non-Hispanic Whites, and 47% for Asians. From January 2018 to October 2021, the average monthly drug-overdose mortality rate increased by 2.69% per month for Blacks, 2.54% for AIANs, 2.27% for Hispanics, 1.37% for Asians, and 0.81% for non-Hispanic Whites. Increases in drug-overdose mortality were more rapid among males than females and among youth aged 15-24 than youth aged 25-34. During the peak months in 2020 and 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic had a disproportionate impact by race/ethnicity on trends in drug overdose mortality among the youth.

"The burdens of poverty during the COVID-19 pandemic","Individuals living at-risk-of-poverty have an increased risk of poor mental health. The pandemic and its societal impacts might have negative effects especially on this group widening the gap between rich and poor and also exacerbate gender gaps, which in turn might impact social cohesion. The objective of this longitudinal study was to determine if people living at-risk-of-poverty were more vulnerable to economic and psychosocial impacts of the pandemic and showed poorer mental health. Moreover, gender differences were analyzed. We drew data from a sample of <i>N</i> = 10,250 respondents of two time points (T1 starting from October 2020, T2 starting from March 2021) of the Gutenberg COVID-19 Study. We tested for differences between people living at-risk-of-poverty and more affluent respondents regarding economic impacts, psychosocial stressors, as well as depressiveness, anxiety and loneliness, by comparing mean and distributional differences. To test for significant discrepancy, we opted for chi-square- and <i>t</i>-tests. The analysis sample compromised <i>N</i> = 8,100 individuals of which 4,2% could be classified as living at-risk-of-poverty. 23% of respondents living at-risk-of-poverty had a decrease in income since the beginning of the pandemic-twice as many as those not living at-risk-of-poverty, who reported more often an increase in income. Less affluent individuals reported a decrease in working hours, while more affluent people reported an increase. Between our survey time points, we found a significant decrease in these economic impacts. Gender differences for economic changes were only found for more affluent women who worked more hours with no change in income. Less affluent respondents were more impacted by psychosocial stressors, depressiveness, anxiety, and loneliness. Gender differences were found particularly with regard to care responsibilities. Our results indicate a widening in the gap between the rich and the poor at the beginning of the pandemic. Gender differences concerning economic changes affect more affluent women, but women in both income groups are more burdened by care responsibilities, which might indicate a heightened resurgence of gender role in times of crisis. This increase in inequality might have impacted social cohesion.","Petersen, Hettich, Baumk&#xf6;tter, Wild, Pfeiffer, M&#xfc;nzel, K&#xf6;nig, Lackner, Beutel","https://doi.org/10.3389/fsoc.2022.995318","20221212","COVID-19 pandemic; SARS-CoV-2; economic burden; poverty; psychological stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-15","",42348,""
"Post COVID-19 clinical manifestations and its risk factors among patients in a Northern District in Kerala, India","The novel virus SARS-CoV-2 has caused a pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). There is emerging evidence of post-COVID-19 manifestations among patients who sustain acute COVID-19. Most studies report fatigue, dyspnea, and myalgia as the common symptoms; however, currently, there is limited knowledge of these post-COVID manifestations and their risk factors, especially in India. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among patients who had attended the district post-COVID clinic, Wayanad district, Kerala, from October 2020 to June 2021. Data were collected by direct/telephonic patient interviews and from their existing case records, using a pretested semi-structured proforma. The sample size was 667. The mean age of the study population was 45 years (standard deviation [SD]: 14.55). The majority of the population presented with dyspnea (48%), fatigue (32%), and cough (25.6%). Mental health problems were also reported in 6% of participants. The respiratory system was commonly involved (61.2%). Around one-third of the patients (36.4%) had dyspnea on exertion and 11.8% had dyspnea at rest. One-fifth of the population reported aggravation of pre-existing co-morbidity and half of the respondents had persistence of at least one symptom after 6 months. There exist statistically significant associations between identified risk factors, especially gender, increasing age, the severity of COVID-19 infection, history of tobacco/alcohol use, and co-morbidities with outcomes.

Depression and anxiety were measured using a 14-item Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS: 0-21). Stress was computed using Perceived Stress Scale. The data were analyzed statistically by Chi-square and simple proportions. A total of 80% were directly involved in treating/dealing COVID-19 patients. A total of 55.83% had an economic impact due to COVID-19. A total of 95% agreed to be anxious about spreading the disease to people at home. The increased stress was mostly attributed to change in social habits/lifestyles. Residents had a higher PSS score compared to temporary and permanent employees. Compared to other age groups, borderline or abnormal depression scale was seen in the age group of 31-40 years and 21-30 years.

"Protocol for developing telephone-based brief psychosocial intervention for COVID-19 patients in India","The ongoing Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a huge mental health impact on people, especially the infected population. They are at greater risk of developing psychological symptoms due to the fear of death and developing severe disability, lack of proper treatment and social restrictions, stigma, and discrimination. The early psychological symptoms, if ignored, may have long-term consequences on the health and well-being of COVID patients. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the mental health services have been impacted negatively, and the need for technology-based psychological interventions has been identified as an alternative treatment method. Hence, the Telephone-Based Brief Psycho-Social interventions (TBPSI) will be developed for COVID-19 patients. A five-session tele psychosocial intervention including rapport establishment and assessment, supportive counselling, activity scheduling, relaxation technique, and post-assessment will be developed based on the extensive review of the literature. Face and content validation of the intervention package will be done by the mental health experts. Further, the feasibility of the intervention program will be tested on COVID-19 patients in the Dharwad district, and later, the same will be implemented across the COVID hospitals of Karnataka state. The study results may bring new insights into the culturally sensitive technology-oriented interventions during this pandemic in the country. The paradigm may be shifted from routine treatment to cost-effective and time-based intervention in the public health system in India.

"Development of Content for a Virtual Reality Simulation to Understand and Mitigate Moral Distress in Healthcare Workers","Background In high-stakes situations, healthcare workers are prone to suffer moral injury, the psychological, social, and spiritual impact of events involving betrayal or transgression of one's own deeply held moral beliefs and values. As a result, this may negatively impact their capacity to provide adequate levels of care to patients. There is a lack of educational resources catered to help healthcare workers navigate ethical situations in clinical settings that may lead to or worsen moral distress. The aim of this report is to describe the methodology of development and resulting outcomes in the form of an educational resource that includes a virtual reality (VR) simulation to help healthcare workers understand and mitigate moral distress as a result of internal and external constraints at their workplaces. Methodology A study using a method outlining a set of constraint parameters, followed by ideation utilizing design thinking (DT), and concluding with a consensus-building exercise using Delphi methodology (DM) with a group of 13 experts in healthcare simulation, VR, psychiatry, psychology, and nursing. The constraints parameters included technology use (VR), use of experiential learning theory, and duration of the intervention (15 minutes). A DT process was performed to generate and expand on ideas on the scenario and intervention of a possible VR simulation which were funneled into a three-round DM to define the foundations of the VR simulation. Average, standard deviations, and free-text comments in the DM were used to assess the inclusion of the produced requirements. Finally, a focus group interview was conducted with the same experts to draft the VR simulation. Results Within the specified constraints, the DT process produced 33 ideas for the VR simulation scenario and intervention that served as a starting point to short-list the requirements in Round 1. In Rounds 1 to 2, 25 items were removed, needed revising, and/or were retained for the subsequent rounds, which resulted in eight items at the end of Round 2. Round 2 also required specialists to provide descriptions of potential scenarios and interventions, in which five were submitted. In Round 3, experts rated the descriptions as somewhat candidate to use in the final VR simulation, and the open feedback in this round proposed combining the elements from each of the descriptions. Using this data, a prototype of the VR simulation was developed by the project team together with VR designers. Conclusions This development demonstrated the feasibility of using the constraints-ideation-consensus approach to define the content of a possible VR simulation to serve as an educational resource for healthcare workers on how to understand and mitigate moral distress in the workplace. The methodology described in this development may be applied to the design of simulation training for other skills, thereby advancing healthcare training and the quality of care delivered to the greater society.","Sivanathan, Espinola, Uribe Quevedo, Kapralos, Krishnan, Bhat, Dubrowski","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.31240","20221212","covid-19; educational resource; healthcare simulation; mental health; mobile app; moral distress; moral injury; psychiatry; psychology; virtual reality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-15","",42353,""
"Effect of the COVID-19 Lockdown on Children's Behavior in Makkah, Saudi Arabia","Background Children's mental health is one of the major concerns during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.&#xa0;Multiple strategic policies are applied to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus, including boundaries closure, social distancing, lockdown, and quarantine. These measures affect the mental health of adults as well as children. In Saudi Arabia, many studies investigated the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on adults' mental health, but few were done on children. Children's behavior can be assessed through parents' observation, which can be an important indication of children's mental health. Objective This study aimed to assess the psychological impact of the COVID-19 quarantine on children's mental health and to evaluate the effect of familial and social-demographic characteristics on children's psychology during the COVID-19 crisis in the Makkah region&#xa0;of Saudi Arabia. Methods and materials A web-based, cross-sectional voluntary response survey including parents of 576 children aged 15 years and younger. The survey included familial and socio-demographic information as well as a questionnaire examining the behavioral, mental, and emotional changes in children during the COVID-19 quarantine. Results Twenty-four point seven percent (24.7%) of children were found to have negative psychological effects due to the COVID-19-associated quarantine in the Makkah region. This prevalence was related to the marital status of the parents, the children's age, and the presence of outdoor space in the house. Conclusion This study highlights the importance of psychological support needed for children and their parents during the COVID-19 pandemic. Studies are required to explore whether this psychological impact will subside&#xa0;after the COVID-19 pandemic is over.","Bawashkhah, Sulaiman, Alshareef","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.31234","20221212","children; covid-19; mental health; psychological impact; quarantine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-15","",42354,""
"Effects of COVID-19-related psychological distress and anxiety on quality of sleep and life in healthcare workers in Iran and three European countries","The COVID-19 pandemic has considerably affected human beings most of whom are healthcare workers (HCWs) combating the disease in the front line. This cross-sectional study aims to explore the effects of stress and anxiety caused by COVID-19 on the quality of sleep and life in HCWs, including physicians, nurses, and other healthcare staff. In this global study, we asked 1,210 HCWs (620 and 590 volunteers from Iran and European countries, including Germany, the Netherlands, and Italy, respectively), who age 21-70, to participate in the test. Several measures of COVID-related stress, anxiety, sleep, and life quality, including the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), Fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) are recorded. Volunteers reported high rates of stress and anxiety and poor sleep quality as well as lower quality of life. The correlation analysis between the measures is reported. According to the results, regardless of the location, HCWs, predominantly female nurses, developed anxiety and stress symptoms which consequently resulted in lower sleep and life quality. Both for Iranian and the European HCWs, significant differences existed between nurses and the other two groups, with the <i>p</i>-values equal to 0.0357 and 0.0429 for GHQ-12, 0.0368, and 0.714 for BAI measure. Even though nurses reported the most stress, anxiety, fear of COVID-19, lower quality of life and sleep in both countries, and also an increase in other measures as well, there existed no statistically significant difference in FCV-19S, PSQI, and WHOQOL-BREF. This study helps to expand our knowledge the effects of pandemics on HCWs and also for healthcare management to predict HCW's mental health conditions in similar situations.","Zangeneh Soroush, Tahvilian, Koohestani, Maghooli, Jafarnia Dabanloo, Sarhangi Kadijani, Jahantigh, Zangeneh Soroush, Saliani","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.997626","20221213","COVID-19 pandemic; anxiety; healthcare workers; quality of life; sleep quality; stress; Humans; Female; Young Adult; Adult; Middle Aged; Aged; Male; Sleep Quality; Quality of Life; Pandemics; Iran; Cross-Sectional Studies; COVID-19; Psychological Distress; Health Personnel; Sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-15","",42355,""
"Post-COVID-19 complications in home and hospital-based care: A study from Dhaka city, Bangladesh","A cross-sectional survey was undertaken to understand the management patterns and post-COVID-19 complications among hospital and home-treated participants. Retrospective information was collected from four COVID-19 dedicated hospitals and four selected community settings. Using probability proportional sampling, 925 participants were selected. Data were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis and the exact chi-square tests were utilized to analyze the association between the studied variables. A total of 659 participants responded (response rate 70.93%); 375 from hospitals and 284 from communities. About 80% of participants were mild cases, 75% were treated at home, and 65% of hospital-treated participants were referred after home treatment. Participants treated at home-to hospital and directly in the hospital had 1.64 and 3.38 times longer recovery time respectively than what home-based participants had. A significant increasing trend (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) of co-morbidities was found among referred and hospital treated participants. Age, level of education, physical exercise, practicing preventive measures, exposure to sunlight, and intake of carbohydrate, additional liquid, food supplements, and avoidance of junk foods were significantly associated with place of treatment. Post-COVID-19 difficulties of all factors were statistically significant for home treatment participants, whilst only depression (<i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.026), chest pain (<i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.017), and digestive disorders (<i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.047) were significant (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05) for hospital treated participants. The outcomes from this study provide insight into a range of post-COVID-19 difficulties relating to at home and in hospital treatment participants. There are clear differences in the complications experienced, many of which are statistically significant. The health care professionals, the community people and COVID-19 survivors will be benefitted from the study findings, and the policy level people may use the information for designing health education program on post COVID-19 complications.","Khandker, Akther, Syed, Shafiullah, Ahmed, Chowdhury, Khan","https://doi.org/10.3389/fresc.2022.1037649","20221212","Bangladesh; COVID-19 complications; home treatment; hospital","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-15","",42356,""
"Service delivery challenges in HIV care during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic: results from a site assessment survey across the global IeDEA consortium","Interruptions in treatment pose risks for people with HIV (PWH) and threaten progress in ending the HIV epidemic; however, the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on HIV service delivery across diverse settings is not broadly documented. From September 2020 to March 2021, the International epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA) research consortium surveyed 238 HIV care sites across seven geographic regions to document constraints in HIV service delivery during the first year of the pandemic and strategies for ensuring care continuity for PWH. Descriptive statistics were stratified by national HIV prevalence (&lt;1%, 1-4.9% and &#x2265;5%) and country income levels. Questions about pandemic-related consequences for HIV care were completed by 225 (95%) sites in 42 countries with low (n = 82), medium (n = 86) and high (n = 57) HIV prevalence, including low- (n = 57), lower-middle (n = 79), upper-middle (n = 39) and high- (n = 50) income countries. Most sites reported being subject to pandemic-related restrictions on travel, service provision or other operations (75%), and experiencing negative impacts (76%) on clinic operations, including decreased hours/days, reduced provider availability, clinic reconfiguration for COVID-19 services, record-keeping interruptions and suspension of partner support. Almost all sites in low-prevalence and high-income countries reported increased use of telemedicine (85% and 100%, respectively), compared with less than half of sites in high-prevalence and lower-income settings. Few sites in high-prevalence settings (2%) reported suspending antiretroviral therapy (ART) clinic services, and many reported adopting mitigation strategies to support adherence, including multi-month dispensing of ART (95%) and designating community ART pick-up points (44%). While few sites (5%) reported stockouts of first-line ART regimens, 10-11% reported stockouts of second- and third-line regimens, respectively, primarily in high-prevalence and lower-income settings. Interruptions in HIV viral load (VL) testing included suspension of testing (22%), longer turnaround times (41%) and supply/reagent stockouts (22%), but did not differ across settings. While many sites in high HIV prevalence settings and lower-income countries reported introducing or expanding measures to support treatment adherence and continuity of care, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in disruptions to VL testing and ART supply chains that may negatively affect the quality of HIV care in these settings.","Brazier, Ajeh, Maruri, Musick, Freeman, Wester, Lee, Shamu, Crabtree

"Louis Pasteur continues to shape the future of microbiology","Louis Pasteur made seminal discoveries in microbiology, immunology and vaccinology that transformed clinical science and saved millions of lives. Since the 19th century, our ability to study infectious disease has undergone radical changes due to newly emerging technologies and infection models. In this Editorial, I consider Pasteur's impact on our ability to understand and combat infectious disease in the context of two modern-day pandemics: coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and antimicrobial resistance (AMR). During the COVID-19 pandemic, we witnessed remarkable ambition to understand severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and to innovate effective vaccines to prevent disease. For the comparatively overlooked pandemic of AMR, we require the same level of urgency to develop alternative approaches to combat antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains that cause millions of deaths annually. Pasteur's statement ""chance only favours the mind which is prepared"" is a principle that captures 'l'esprit Pasteur'. This principle should continue to guide modern-day research on infectious disease, and for this we need to support the development of predictive disease models and cutting-edge mechanistic research that prepare us for discovery and therapeutic impact.","Mostowy","https://doi.org/10.1242/dmm.050011","20221213","Antimicrobial resistance; COVID-19; Microbiology; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; Pandemics; COVID-19; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Communicable Diseases","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-15","",42358,""
"Investigation of coronavirus anxiety, health anxiety, and anxiety symptom levels in vertigo patients during COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the mental health of vertigo patients. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the effects of coronavirus anxiety, health anxiety, anxiety symptom levels, and demographic variables on vertigo and its severity in vertigo patients during the pandemic. This cross-sectional study was conducted from May 15 to November 15, 2021. In total, 118 patients with vertigo and 82 healthy controls participated in the study. Besides demographic and clinical data, Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS), Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale-Anxiety Subscale (HAD-A), and Short Health Anxiety Inventory (SHAI) were applied to all participants. Additionally, Vertigo Symptom Scale-Short Form (VSS-SF) was administered to vertigo patients. According to the findings, vertigo patients experienced higher levels of coronavirus anxiety, health anxiety, and anxiety disorder compared to the healthy controls. In vertigo patients, the rate of coronavirus anxiety was 20.3%, and the rate of anxiety disorder was 32.2%. Majority of the patients (80.5%) were found to have severe-level vertigo. Additionally, most of the patients (82.1%) reported that the severity of vertigo during the pandemic was higher than before the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic causes serious mental health problems in vertigo patients, and pathological levels of these problems increase the discomfort of vertigo. Therefore, psychological assessment should be considered in these patients, and required psychological support and guidance services should be provided.","Alt&#x131;nta&#x15f;, Korkut","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bjorl.2022.11.003","20221212","Anxiety; COVID-19; Coronavirus anxiety; Health anxiety; Vertigo","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-15","",42359,""
"[Video calls between patients and relatives: a narrative review]",". Video calls between patients and families: a narrative review. Many services have introduced video calls between patients and family members during the pandemic. To synthesize the literature on the use of video calls between patients and family members when ""in presence"" visits are limited or banned. A narrative review of the literature was conducted by searching PubMed and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature databases using the keywords video call, covid, relative and similar terms. Articles on video calls between family members and patients referring to the 2020-2022 pandemic period have been included. Eighteen studies were included: six descriptive qualitative, four case reports, three cross-sectional, three observational, a quasi-experimental and a commentary; most of them were from Italy and based in intensive care and long-term facilities. The most used term was video call. Studies investigated how to properly plan and conduct the video call, prepare the patient and his/her family, accounting for the technical aspects and devices. Video calls may generate positive effects on satisfaction, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and distress of patients and families; however, negative effects have been also documented. The use of video calls in acute care and end-of-life settings implies a different complexity from nursing homes or long-term care facilities. The video call must be planned and evaluated as all other nursing interventions; it cannot be spontaneous and without a preliminary assessment of the potential benefits and risks; health care professionals should be properly trained.","Chiappinotto, Palese, Longhini","https://doi.org/10.1702/3920.39047","20221213","Humans; Female; Male; Cross-Sectional Studies; COVID-19; Patients; Health Personnel; Critical Care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-15","",42360,""
"A Mental Wealth perspective: crossing disciplines to understand the value of collective mental and social assets in the post-COVID-19 era","A reconceptualised global strategy is key as nations begin to shift from crisis management to medium- and long-term planning to rebuild and strengthen their economic, social and public health systems. Efforts towards measuring, modelling, and forecasting Mental Wealth could serve as the catalyst for this reconceptualization. The Mental Wealth approach builds systemic resilience through investments which promote collective cognitive and emotional wellbeing. This paper presents the theoretical foundations for Mental Wealth. It presents, for the first time, literature across the disciplines of health and social sciences, economics, business, and humanities to underpin the development of an operational metric of Mental Wealth. An approach which embeds social and psychological dimensions of prosperity, alongside the economic, is needed to inform the effective allocation of investments in the post-pandemic world. The authors advocate for a transdisciplinary framework of Mental Wealth to be applied in innovating population-level policy interventions to address the growing challenges brought on by COVID-19. Mental Wealth highlights the value generated by the deployment of collective mental assets and supporting social infrastructure. In order to inform this position, a review of the literature on the concepts underpinning Mental Wealth is presented, limitations of current measurement tools of mental and social resources are evaluated, and a framework for development of a Mental Wealth metric is proposed. There are challenges in developing an operational Mental Wealth metric. The breadth of conceptual foundations to be considered is extensive, and there may be a lack of agreement on the appropriate tools for its measurement. While variability across current measurement approaches in social resources, wellbeing and mental assets contributes to the difficulty creating a holistic and generic metric, these variations are now clearer. The operationalisation of the Mental Wealth metric will require comprehensive mapping of the elements to be included against the data available.","Tran, Buchanan, Song, Rosenberg, Occhipinti, Hickie","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13033-022-00568-1","20221212","Health policy; Mental assets; Mental capital; Mental health; Social capital; Wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-15","",42361,""
"Decline in older adults' daily mobility during the COVID-19 pandemic: the role of individual and built environment factors","Extensive research has shown that the COVID-19 pandemic dramatically impacted the daily mobility of older adults. However, very little attention has been paid to the role of individual and built environmental factors in decline in older adults' daily mobility during the pandemic. Based on a cohort survey of 741 older adults in Hong Kong, we conducted a one-way ANOVA to explore the differences in determinants (individual or environmental factors) of older adults' daily mobility between before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, multilevel linear regression was performed to examine how individual characteristics and built environment factors are associated with changes in older adults' daily mobility during the pandemic. Results show that the duration of active travel declined from 174.72 to 76.92&#xa0;min per week, and that the public transport use frequency decreased from an average of 6.14 to 3.96 trips per week during the COVID-19 pandemic&#xa0;(before the rollout of vaccination programme). We also found residential density (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05) and the number of bus stop was negatively associated with the decline in their active travel (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01), while a higher destination mix was associated with more significant decrease in active travel (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01). A higher availability of recreational facilities in neighbourhoods was associated with a greater decrease in public transport use (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). In addition, those who were older or having depressive symptoms, which are considered a vulnerable group, were negatively associated with decrease in their mobility (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001). Maintaining mobility and social interactions are crucial for older adults' health during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study found that individual and environmental factors differentially affected older adults' active travel and public transport use during the pandemic. Our findings contribute to understanding the COVID-19 impact on daily mobility in older adults and support more effective active travel promotion policies in the post-pandemic future.","Choe, Du, Sun","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-14780-8","20221213","Active travel; Hong Kong; Post-pandemic; Public transport use; Travel behaviour; Humans; Aged; Residence Characteristics; Pandemics; COVID-19; Built Environment; Transportation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-15","",42362,""
"""I Refuse to Wear a Mask!"" Examining the Relationship Between Grit and Preventative Behaviors and Well-Being: Mediating Role of Motivation","Despite government mandates to wear face masks in some public locations, why do some people still refuse to wear a face mask in public? This paper examines the relationship between grit, COVID-19 preventative health measure, and distress. Further, the mediating role of COVID-19 autonomous and controlled motivation is also investigated. The results suggest that grit is directly related to decreased distress and increased preventative behaviors. COVID-19 autonomous and controlled motivated mediated the relationship between grit, distress and preventive behaviors, such that COVID-19 autonomous motivation mediated the association between grit and preventive behaviors; while COVID-19 controlled motivation mediated the relationship between grit and psychological distress.

"Trends in Palliative Care Research During the COVID-19 Pandemic","To demonstrate the trends and variety of research on palliative care during the COVID-19 pandemic. A systematic search of the Web of Science database. Since the outbroke of the COVID-19 pandemic, the adjustment of palliative care systems is warranted to maintain a high quality of care. The COVID-19 -related palliative care studies account for approximately 4% of all publications on palliative care. However, there is a dearth of research investigating the nature of these studies. A total of 293 studies were included. Of the included studies, those related to system improvement were the most common (181/293, 61.8%), followed by those related to patient care (79/293, 27.0%), bereavement support for patients or family members (19/293, 6.5%), and the mental health of frontline practitioners (14/293, 4.8%). From these studies, 82, 137, and 74 studies were published in 2020, 2021, and 2022 (until August 1), respectively. The research trends of palliative care demonstrate the flexibility and rapid response of the global palliative care system to the COVID-19 pandemic and show how the palliative care system is evolving. While most studies are interested in system improvement, patient care, and bereavement support, the mental health of frontline practitioners has received less attention. Our findings provide palliative care practitioners with current valuable information and highlight possible future trends.","Wang, Chen, Tsao, Lee","https://doi.org/10.1177/10499091221145202","20221212","COVID-19 pandemic; hospice; palliative care; palliative medicine; terminal care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-15","",42364,""
"Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Psychological Status and Quality of Life Among Participants of the Malaysian Elders Longitudinal Research (MELoR) Study","This study aimed to identify differences in quality of life before and during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and determine the influence of psychological status on the observed changes in the quality of life among older adults. The Malaysian Elders Longitudinal Research study recruited Malaysians aged at least 55 years from 2013 to 2015. Follow-ups were conducted between September and December 2020. Quality of life was determined using the 12-item Control, Autonomy, Self-Realization, and Pleasure questionnaire. Psychological statuses were assessed using the 21-item Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale, 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale, and 4-item Perceived Stress Scale. This study included data from 706 individuals (mean age 73.3 [6.8] years). We observed reduced quality of life and increased anxiety among 402 (43.1%) and 144 (20.9%) participants, respectively. Participants felt ""out of control,"" ""left out,"" ""short of money,"" and ""life was full of opportunities"" less often and could ""please themselves with what they did"" more often. Multivariate analyses revealed increased depression, anxiety, and stress as independent risk factors for reduced quality of life. Individuals with increased depression, anxiety, and stress levels during the pandemic experienced a worsening quality of life. Thus, the development of effective strategies to address the mental health of older adults is needed to mitigate the effects of the pandemic on their quality of life.","Aravindhan, Morgan, Mat, Hamid, Ibrahim, Saedon, Hasmuk, Mahadzir, Tan","https://doi.org/10.4235/agmr.22.0134","20221212","Aged; Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Psychological stress; Quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-15","",42365,""
"Prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder and common mental disorders in health-care workers in England during the COVID-19 pandemic: a two-phase cross-sectional study","Previous studies on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of health-care workers have relied on self-reported screening measures to estimate the point prevalence of common mental disorders. Screening measures, which are designed to be sensitive, have low positive predictive value and often overestimate prevalence. We aimed to estimate prevalence of common mental disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among health-care workers in England using diagnostic interviews. We did a two-phase, cross-sectional study comprising diagnostic interviews within a larger multisite longitudinal cohort of health-care workers (National Health Service [NHS] CHECK; n=23&#x2009;462) during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the first phase, health-care workers across 18 NHS England Trusts were recruited. Baseline assessments were done using online surveys between April 24, 2020, and Jan 15, 2021. In the second phase, we selected a proportion of participants who had responded to the surveys and conducted diagnostic interviews to establish the prevalence of mental disorders. The recruitment period for the diagnostic interviews was between March 1, 2021 and Aug 27, 2021. Participants were screened with the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and assessed with the Clinical Interview Schedule-Revised (CIS-R) for common mental disorders or were screened with the 6-item Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL-6) and assessed with the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) for PTSD. The screening sample contained 23&#x2009;462 participants: 2079 participants were excluded due to missing values on the GHQ-12 and 11&#x2009;147 participants due to missing values on the PCL-6. 243 individuals participated in diagnostic interviews for common mental disorders (CIS-R; mean age 42 years [range 21-70]; 185 [76%] women and 58 [24%] men) and 94 individuals participated in diagnostic interviews for PTSD (CAPS-5; mean age 44 years [23-62]; 79 [84%] women and 15 [16%] men). 202 (83%) of 243 individuals in the common mental disorders sample and 83 (88%) of 94 individuals in the PTSD sample were White. GHQ-12 screening caseness for common mental disorders was 52&#xb7;8% (95% CI 51&#xb7;7-53&#xb7;8). Using CIS-R diagnostic interviews, the estimated population prevalence of generalised anxiety disorder was 14&#xb7;3% (10&#xb7;4-19&#xb7;2), population prevalence of depression was 13&#xb7;7% (10&#xb7;1-18&#xb7;3), and combined population prevalence of generalised anxiety disorder and depression was 21&#xb7;5% (16&#xb7;9-26&#xb7;8). PCL-6 screening caseness for PTSD was 25&#xb7;4% (24&#xb7;3-26&#xb7;5). Using CAPS-5 diagnostic interviews, the estimated population prevalence of PTSD was 7&#xb7;9% (4&#xb7;0-15&#xb7;1). The prevalence estimates of common mental disorders and PTSD in health-care workers were considerably lower when assessed using diagnostic interviews compared with screening tools. 21&#xb7;5% of health-care workers met the threshold for diagnosable mental disorders, and thus might benefit from clinical intervention.

"The youngest are hit hardest: The influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the hospitalization rate for children, adolescents, and young adults with anorexia nervosa in a large German representative sample","The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted the mental health of children and adolescents. Young people at risk for anorexia nervosa (AN) have been especially shown to be affected. There are no studies that have investigated the respective proportions of hospitalized children, adolescents, and young adults separately as well as of both sexes during the COVID-19 crisis. This study is based on the administrative data of the largest German statutory health insurance. All children (0-14 years) and adolescents (15-19 years) with a discharge diagnosis of typical and atypical AN according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 were included. Admission rates per 10,000 person-years were calculated separately by sex and age group, based on admission numbers from the 9-month interval from January to September of 2019, 2020, and 2021 and the number of insured persons per sex and age group of each year. The entire sample comprised approximately 4.7 million children and adolescents. There was a highly significant increase of 40% (relative risk (RR): 1.4; [1.27, 1.55]; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) in admission rates in the female children's and the adolescents' group (RR:1.32; [1.24, 1.41]; p&lt; 0.0001) between the pre-COVID-19 and peri-COVID-19 periods in 2019 and 2021, respectively. Among males, hospitalization rates significantly increased in the children (RR: 1.69; [1.09, 2.62]; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.02). Young people appear to be especially prone to develop AN during a crisis, such as with social isolation and school closures. Home-based or mobile pediatric services should be established to prevent this often chronic and disabling disorder in young patients.","Herpertz-Dahlmann, Dempfle, Eckardt","https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2022.2345","20221213","Admission rates; COVID-19; adolescence; anorexia nervosa; childhood; pandemic; Child; Adolescent; Young Adult; Male; Humans; Female; Pandemics; COVID-19; Anorexia Nervosa; Hospitalization","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-15","",42368,""

"Effects of members’ response styles in an online depression community based on text mining and empirical analysis","The online depression community (ODC) has become a popular resource for people with depression to manage their mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study proposed a novel perspective based on response style theory to investigate whether depression individuals’ distractive and ruminative behaviors in ODC were related to social support received and co-rumination. Furthermore, we explored the influences of social support and co-rumination on suicidal behaviors using panel data set. We collected text data from 22,286 depressed users of a large ODC in China from March 2020 to July 2021, and conducted text mining and econometrics analyses to test our research questions. The results showed that depression users’ online ruminative behaviors had a positive relationship with the co-rumination and had a negative relationship with social support received. Besides, constructive distractive behaviors (i.e., providing social support to others) increased the support users received from others but had a negative relationship with co-rumination. Depression users' future suicidal behaviors are influenced by past received social support and co-rumination. The received social supports and co-rumination have a negative and positive influence on depression users' future suicidal behaviors, respectively. Our results enrich the application of response style theory in online medicine. They provide meaningful insights into behaviors that influence the acquisition of online social support and the incidence of online co-rumination in ODCs. This study helps relevant institutions to conduct more targeted online suicide interventions for depression patients.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ipm.2022.103198","20230301","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-12-15","",42370,""

"Ayurvedic Management of Prurigo nodularis at scalp: A case report","Introduction Prurigo nodularis (PN) is a chronic skin disorder of unknown origin which has the features of small nodules and papules along with intolerable itch leading to ulcers, bleeding and sensory neural loss in affected area. PN has quite resemblance with Alasaka in Ayurveda, which is a vata-kapha pradhan kshudra kushtha. Case summary A 50 years old male patient suffering from PN was being treated on the line of Ayurveda just before the beginning of COVID pandemic. Due to sudden surge of first wave of corona virus pandemic and lockdown in India, the planed virechana (purgation) therapy was interrupted. We shifted our plan to mild type of virechana and conservative therapy after a short break of 10 days at patients’ home.
