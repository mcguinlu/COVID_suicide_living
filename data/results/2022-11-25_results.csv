"Assessment of Attitude and Hesitancy Towards Covid-19 Vaccine among Hepatitis B and C Patients in Pakistan","OBJECTIVE: The research aimed to evaluate the attitude and perceptions towards the covid-19 vaccine among Hepatitis B and C patients in Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Muzaffarabad, Azad Kashmir, Pakistan. METHODS: A survey-based study was adopted to evaluate the attitude of Hepatitis B and C patients towards immunization against covid-19 in Peshawar (KPK) and Muzaffarabad (AJK) cities of Pakistan. The study continued from January 2020 to February 2021. Participants were also assessed for their perception towards covid-19 vaccination. RESULTS: A total of 839 (33.6%) individuals participated in the study. About 52 % of Hepatitis B patients were immunized against Covid-19, whereas the number of Hepatitis C patients was recorded at around 48%. About 53.7 % of participants refused to get the vaccine without any reason. About 63.2% of patients showed concern about the insufficient data available on the vaccine safety and efficacy published by the Public Health Department. Individuals with higher education were observed to be more open towards vaccination then those without a formal education. More than half of the participants (61.5 %) were concerned about the interference of the vaccine with their hepatitis treatment whereas 54.7 % patients refused vaccine because of a poor liver condition. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicated that limited data availability regarding the vaccine efficacy in viral hepatitis patients and negative attitudes of people toward covid-19 vaccination is the main cause of Covid-19 vaccination refusal among hepatitis B and C patients.

"Effectiveness and accessibility of virtual Cognitive Behavioural Therapy Skills Group medical visits during COVID-19","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic amplified the need for community mental health supports--particularly for people with pre-existing health inequities--and social distancing mandates made in-person mental health groups inaccessible. The pandemic forced the Cognitive Behavioural Therapy Skills Group program to rapidly transition from in-person to virtual group delivery for the first time. Methods: From March to December 2020, patients with mild to moderate mental health conditions were referred to the virtual groups. Participants completed online self-report measures (Patient Health Questionnaire-8 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7) prior to the first session and after the final session and provided measures of satisfaction and confidence with the skills learned using a 5-point Likert scale. Before and after program results were compared using paired t tests and Cohen's d. A theme analysis of the qualitative data was conducted. Results: In 2020, the virtual program served 1773 participants through 170 groups. High levels of satisfaction with the virtual platform (4.6/5.0) and helpfulness of the program during the pandemic (4.7/5.0) were noted, and the no-attendance rate was 4.7%. Forty-three percent of participants who had previously completed in-person groups preferred the online modality. Conclusions: Virtual groups had equivalent effectiveness, safety, and attendance as prior in-person groups but improved accessibility, equity, and acceptability. Balancing competing values of accessibility, group cohesion, and confidentiality pose ongoing challenges. With the success of the online modality, there is increased accessibility to smaller communities and opportunities for collaboration with care providers across BC.

"How to handle occupational well-being of critical care workers A lesson from the pandemic : Nicola Magnavita","Background The PSIC study (Prospective Study of Intensivists and COVID-19) monitored the intensivists working in one of the two COVID-19 hub hospitals in Central Italy over 2 years from April 2020. This study showed how mental health varies in relation to the stressors posed by the different pandemic phases. Methods In 4 surveys corresponding to the 4 pandemic waves, the intensivists were invited to indicate changes in work activity and measure their state of mental health using standardized questionnaires administered via SurveyMonkey. Results During the pandemic there was a change in occupational stressors that led to insomnia, anxiety, depression, burnout, job dissatisfaction, unhappiness and intention to quit. The predominant stressors in the first wave were fear of unprotected exposure, distrust of safety measures, and compassion fatigue from having to inform relatives of the adverse outcome of treatment. In the second and third waves the workload, the monotony due to always following only one type of patient, the isolation, and the lack of time to meditate were the more relevant factors. The fourth wave added the stress deriving from interacting with anti-vax patients Conclusions Specific prevention strategies have been developed and applied for each of the stress factors identified. Excessive workload and lack of time for meditation originated from lack of staff were remedied with extraordinary temporary hires. The management of compassion fatigue and relations with anti-vax people were addressed with specific policies and training. The monotony and isolation in COVID-19 wards can only be resolved through employee turnover in ordinary departments. Organizational and financial efforts are necessary to protect the health of intensivists during a pandemic. Key messages â€¢ Monitoring of critical care workers during the pandemic waves indicated the preventive measures necessary to ensure their mental health and quality of care. â€¢ Protecting healthcare workers is a priority.","Magnavita, N.; Soave, P.

"Prevalence and Characterization of Food Insecurity in a Canadian Paediatric Emergency Department","Background Food insecurity (FI), defined as inadequate or insecure access to food, is a key determinant of child health. FI is associated with a number of adverse physical, psychological and developmental health outcomes and increased emergency department (ED) use. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated financial hardship faced by many families with an unprecedented rise in use of charitable food programs. Objectives We sought to determine the prevalence of FI among pediatric ED visits during the COVID-19 pandemic, compare this to pre-pandemic rates, and describe associated risk factors. Design/Methods From September to December 2021, families presenting to a tertiary Canadian paediatric ED were asked to complete a survey screening for FI with a validated two-item questionnaire, along with socio-demographic and child health information. Results were compared to data collected in 2012. Multivariable logistic regression was used to measure associations with FI. Results In 2021, 26% (n=173/665) of families identified as food insecure compared to 22.7% in 2012 (n=146/644), which was not statistically different (3.3%, 95% CI [-1.4%, 8.1%]). When the definition of FI is expanded to include use of charitable food assistance, the prevalence increased to 29.2%. In univariate analysis, FI was significantly associated with lack of primary care, caregivers born outside of Canada, status other than Canadian citizenship, having a child with a chronic medical condition, having financial strain related to medical expenses and reason for the ED visit being the childâ€™s chronic condition. In multivariable analysis, only having more children in the home (OR 1.19, 95% CI [1.01, 1.41]), financial strain from medical expenses (OR 5.31, 95% CI [3.45, 8.18]) and lack of primary care access (OR 1.27, 95% CI [1.08, 1.51]) remained independent predictors of FI. Approximately half (48.5%) of food insecure families reported use of food charity, most commonly food banks (31.7%), while one-quarter (26%) received help from family or friends. Food insecure families indicated their preferred means of support in hospital would be free/low cost meals and financial assistance with medical expenses. Conclusion Greater than one in four families attending a Canadian tertiary pediatric ED screened positive for FI. FI was independently associated with lack of access to primary care, financial strain related to medical expenses, and greater number of children in the household. Further research is necessary to examine the effect of support interventions for families admitted to medical care facilities and financial support for chronic conditions.","MacBain, Elspeth, Marjerrison, Stacey, Wahi, Gita, Eltorki, Mohamed, Pardhan, Alim, Ngo, Quang","https://www.google.com/search?q=Prevalence+and+Characterization+of+Food+Insecurity+in+a+Canadian+Paediatric+Emergency+Department","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Paediatrics & child health; JOUR(Suppl 3):e45-e45, 27.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41542,""
"Isostrain among tourism employees in Tunisia during COVID-19 pandemic : Sihem Ben Fredj","Background Psychological and social factors related to work activity can improve or deteriorate the physical and mental health of employees. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the psychological well-being of workers has been strongly affected. Particularly, jobs with isostrain characterized by high work demands and low work control, coupled with low social support, place employees at highest risk for poor mental health. We aimed to assess the factors associated with isostrain among employees in the tourism sector in Sousse. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted between September and November 2020 among tourism workers belonging to 12 hotels and restaurants in Sousse, Tunisia, using a self-administered questionnaire. â€˜Isostrainâ€™ was assessed using the Karasek questionnaire. â€˜Isostrainâ€™ is a situation where there is a combination of â€˜jobstrainâ€™ (â€˜tension at work') and low social support (score below the median of the group). SPSS 20 software was used to analyze the data. Results A total of 226 workers were included. The mean age was 38.2 Â± 9.6 years. The sex ratio was 2.7. The majority of employees (64.8%) were working at workplace during COVID-19 lockdown. The prevalence of isostrain was 5.4%. Isostrain was reported by 5.7% of women (p = 1). All workers older than 50 years did not have isostrain (p = 0.6). Moreover, isostrain was found among 6.6% of workers with less than 5 years of work experience (p = 0.4), 4.8% of married employees (p = 0.7), and 7.6% of employees with a university education (p = 0.53). Conclusions Isostrain can affect employees in the tourism sector. Social support should be promoted among workers to ensure good mental health. Key messages â€¢ Prevalence of isostrain in tourism sector of Sousse during COVID-19 pandemic is quite high. â€¢ Preventive strategies of mental health should be promoted at workplace in Tunisia.","Maatouk, A.; Ben Fredj, S.; Zammit, N.; Ghammem, R.; Maatoug, J.; Boujebha, S.; Guesmi, N.; Zendah, B.; Ghannem, H.; Hadj Mabrouk, K.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Isostrain+among+tourism+employees+in+Tunisia+during+COVID-19+pandemic+:+Sihem+Ben+Fredj","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; JOUR(Suppl 3), 32.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41543,""
"Building capacity for mental health resilience â€“ local impact of the UK Better Mental Health Fund : Mabel Lie","Background COVID-19 as a public mental health emergency has exacerbated existing mental health inequalities. The UK government invited local authorities with areas of high deprivation to apply for a year of funding, in order to address the mental health impacts of COVID-19 and incentivize investment in prevention and promotion interventions for better mental health. South Tyneside Council in North East England made a successful bid to the Better Mental Health Fund (BMHF), and distributed grants to 7 organisations delivering 13 programs. A qualitative evaluation of these programs aimed to answer the following questions: 1. How were the funded programs implemented? 2. What difference did they make to local beneficiaries? 3. How might these programs and their impacts be sustained into the future? 4. Has the BMHF led to any wider impacts on organisations and local communities? Methods In-depth interviews with individuals, pairs and groups were conducted online or in person with service providers and beneficiaries. Non-verbatim transcripts were made from recordings, checked with verbatim transcripts from Teams and Zoom, and analyzed thematically to generate a coding frame. Throughout the analysis, comparisons were made between organizations and programs. Results Fifteen interviews involving 22 participants lasting up to an hour each were conducted. The main themes identified as impactful were 1) community approaches based on supportive and good relationships between the local authority public health lead and participating organizations (mainly voluntary agencies), enabling 2) capacity-building for mental health resilience and 3) community empowerment. This was despite the short turnaround of the grant application process, limited time to deliver on targets, and anxieties about future sustainability. Conclusions Short-term funding can build capacity in mental health resilience in deprived areas if administered by public health leaders who relate well with provider organizations. Key messages â€¢ Public health leaders who relate well with provider organizations are key drivers of community health promotion strategies that include mental health capacity building. â€¢ Qualitative methods used in evaluations can inform public health commissioning by capturing the benefits and challenges of short-term funding for interventions promoting community mental health.","Lie, M.; Visram, S.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Building+capacity+for+mental+health+resilience+â€“+local+impact+of+the+UK+Better+Mental+Health+Fund+:+Mabel+Lie","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; JOUR(Suppl 3), 32.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41544,""
"The impact of COVID-19 on persons with concurrent mental health and substance use disorders : Marja Leonhardt","Background The COVID-19 pandemic with its restrictions touched the daily life of most people. While everyday social life becomes difficult for citizens with economic and cultural capital, it becomes even worse for persons with mental health (MHD) and substance use disorders (SUD), who are particularly vulnerable to social exclusion. In this project, we aim to explore the impact of the pandemic on persons MHD/SUD, nearer, how the lockdown effected their daily life and further, the utilization of health care services under the consecutive waves of the pandemic. Methods The project has two parts: First we conducted 17 individual interviews and one focus group with persons with MHD/SUD, using thematic analysis. Second, we merged the Norwegian Patient Register, the Register for Infectious Diseases and data from Statistics Norway. We matched data of 41500 individuals with MHD/SUD after gender, age and health region with a sample from the general population as a control group and study the health care service utilization under the consecutive waves of the pandemic in Norway in 2020-2021. Results Within the qualitative study, we identified four interrelated main themes: (1) The COVID-19 outbreak as a perceived challenge, (2) A decline in mental health and well-being, (3) Increased substance use challenges, and (4) Diverse experiences with health and social services. The results show further that people with MHD/SUD have challenges with digital tools and/or do not have the appropriate equipment. Persons with MHD/SUD face greater barriers in accessing the health care system compared to the general population as a control group. Results of the register study are still preliminary. Conclusions Persons with MHD/SUD face major challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic There is reason to believe that new pandemics will emerge in the future. In this context, it is essential to gain knowledge of how to care for vulnerable groups in society and how to reach them in emergencies. Key messages â€¢ Continuous maintenance of low-threshold services for persons with MHD/SUD during a pandemic is essential. â€¢ Improvement of digital skills of service users or alternatives to digital consultations should be considered.","Leonhardt, M.; Lien, L.","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+impact+of+COVID-19+on+persons+with+concurrent+mental+health+and+substance+use+disorders+:+Marja+Leonhardt","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; JOUR(Suppl 3), 32.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41545,""
"Impact of a Virtual Behavioural Support Intervention on improving behaviour, mental health, and Academic Engagement and Motivation for children with ADHD and their families: a Pilot Study","Background Children with ADHD struggle with their academic achievement, well-being, and social functioning. COVID-19 restrictions negatively impacted families of children with ADHD and limited their access to services. This led to the creation of the online ADHD-VIBES program (VIrtual BEhavioural Support Intervention for Children with ADHD). Objectives To determine the efficacy of the ADHD-VIBES program to support families of children with ADHD in behavioural, mental health, academic motivation, and engagement challenges. Design/Methods The ADHD-VIBES program was an online program created to support children with ADHD and their families. It consisted of separate parent and child sessions (1-hour each) for six weeks, targeting the development of self-regulation, positive thinking, communication, problem-solving and executive function skills. To our knowledge, there was no other online program offering the same program content during the pandemic. All children met the following criteria: confirmed ADHD based diagnosis of child on parent ratings on Conners-3 Rating Scale (T-score &gt; 65);IQ score &gt; 80 on the WASI-II abbreviated;and access to technology to join virtual groups. Parents completed the Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC-3) and the Parenting Stress Index (PSI-4-SF) questionnaires. Children completed the BASC-3, the Executive Skills Questionnaire (ESQ), and the Motivation and Engagement Scale (MES). All questionnaires were completed at three different time-points: pre-intervention, post-intervention, and two-months after intervention. A survey was completed at the end of the intervention to determine level of satisfaction of parents towards the ADHD-VIBES. Results A total of 12 boys between the ages of 8 to 11 years old (M = 9.62, SD = 0.94), and their caregivers, took part in this program (summer 2021). On the BASC-3, parents reported significantly lower levels of depression and anxiety (F:5.65, p=.016;F:6.21, p=.012) after completion of the ADHD-VIBES program. No significant difference was reported by the children on the BASC-3. On the PSI-4-SF, there was no statistical difference observed (parental distress p=0.244). Improvement associated with executive skills (ESQ) were noticed related to Planning/Preparation (F:4.86, p=.019), Time Management (F:7.08, p=.005) and Goal Directed Persistence (F:5.71, p=.011). On the MES, negative Motivation subscales scores demonstrated a decrease in raw scores (T1=40.78;T2=35.75;T3=30.98;p=.103). Finally, all parents (100%) were satisfied/very satisfied with the ADHD-VIBES intervention. Conclusion The ADHD-VIBES online intervention showed promising improvement on some behavioural issues, and executive function skills. However, future randomized controlled studies with a larger sample size are required to better understand the impact of the intervention for children with ADHD and their parents.","Lemay, Jean-Francois, Hai, Tasmia, Climie, Emma, Wicox, Gabrielle","https://www.google.com/search?q=Impact+of+a+Virtual+Behavioural+Support+Intervention+on+improving+behaviour,+mental+health,+and+Academic+Engagement+and+Motivation+for+children+with+ADHD+and+their+families:+a+Pilot+Study","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Paediatrics & child health; JOUR(Suppl 3):e21-e21, 27.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41546,""
"SDG5 Gender Equality during the COVID-19 pandemic: an international comparative policy assessment : Ellen Kuhlmann","Background The COVID-19 pandemic caused severe disruptions in healthcare systems and societies and exacerbated existing inequalities for women and girls across every sphere. Our study explores health systems responses to gender equality goals during the COVID-19 pandemic and which role these goals play in pandemic recovery policies. Methods We apply a qualitative comparative approach. Country case studies (expert information, secondary sources) were collected in March/April 2022. The sample comprised Australia, Brazil, Germany, United Kingdom and USA, reflecting conditions of high to upper-middle income countries with established public health systems, democratic political institutions and gender equality policies. Selected topics: maternity care/reproductive services, violence against women, and gender equality/female leadership. Results All countries tried to keep essential maternity and reproductive services open, but strong limitations applied especially for prevention and counselling services;at the same time, digitalisation/telemedicine supported service expansion. Violence against women and children strongly increased during the pandemic. Routine services were partly kept open and new helplines occasionally established, but no action was taken to scale-up mental health support and respond to new demand. A push-back of gender equality was observed across countries in all areas of health and social care, often coupled with strong increase in intersecting social inequalities;participation of women in decision-making bodies was generally weak and not monitored. Conclusions Across countries, gender equality policies cracked under the pressure of the COVID-19 pandemic;this is true for countries with male and female political leaders, and for different areas of SDG5 and health. There is an urgent need for more effective intersectional gender equality policies and improved participation of women in global health and in health system recovery plans. Key messages â€¢ Health systems failed to take action to protect SDG5 goals;gender and intersecting inequalities strongly increased during the pandemic. â€¢ Building back better after COVID-19 will only be possible with an intersectional gender equality programme and feminist policy approaches.","Kuhlmann, E.; Lotta, G.; Fernandez, M.; Herten-Crabb, A.; Maple, J.

"Health workforce needs of small medical specialties: findings from rheumatology in Germany : Ellen Kuhlmann","Background Small medical specialties may be more vulnerable to workforce shortage and the COVID-19 pandemic and this may directly impact in the provision of care for chronically-ill patients. This study aims to explore health workforce development and new needs, using rheumatology in Germany as a case study. Methods An explorative multi-methods approach was applied, combining health labour market assessment of rheumatology physicians (public statistics 2000-2019) and a questionnaire-based online survey conducted in early 2021 (n = 101 respondents;rheumatology physicians and residents). Main selected topics: work hours, workload, mental health issues, discrimination and sexual harassment experiences, impact of COVID-19. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed and qualitative content analysis for free-text information. Results Health labour market analysis showed that the numbers of rheumatologists increased markedly between 2000 and 2019 in the groups aged +50 years, but only 9% in younger groups under 50 years;since 2010 the group 40-50 years showed decreases. In 2019, the absolute number of rheumatologists working in healthcare after retirement-age exceeded those aged 40 and under. Survey data revealed a strong mismatch between actual and desired work hours for women and men. 81% rated their workload as high or very high;every sixth rheumatologist has suffered from stress or burnout syndromes at least once in the past. Experiences of gender discrimination and sexual harassment/violence were frequently reported, mostly by women. COVID-19 was an amplifier of stress with major stressors being digitalisation and increased demand for communication and patient education. Conclusions Decreasing health workforce capacities in German rheumatology combine with negative perceptions of work and workplace conditions, threatening both retention and service delivery. Key messages â€¢ Small medical specialties, like rheumatology, face severe shortage that threaten healthcare for chronically-ill patients and need greater attention. â€¢ COVID-19 has reinforced rheumatologistsâ€™ workload and stressors, thus worsing mental health and retention.","Kuhlmann, E.; Hoeper, K.; Witte, T.; Ernst, D.; Dopfer-Jablonka, A.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Health+workforce+needs+of+small+medical+specialties:+findings+from+rheumatology+in+Germany+:+Ellen+Kuhlmann","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; JOUR(Suppl 3), 32.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41548,""
"Health workforce needs and health policy responses to COVID-19: a European comparative assessment : Ellen Kuhlmann","Background The COVID-19 pandemic revealed the importance of the health workforce for health system resilience. This study aims to explore whether and how healthcare system in Europe have responded to new emergent needs and transformed their health workforce policies. Methods A qualitative comparative approach is applied, based on multi-level governance theory and a rapid assessment of three areas of health workforce policy: mental health, gender equality, and public health competencies. We consider two years of the pandemic with a focus on recent waves, October 2021-January 2022. Denmark, Germany, Portugal, Romania and Switzerland are selected for comparison, representing different health systems, health workforce conditions and COVID-19 indicators in the European Union and European Economic Area. Results Across countries the pandemic has highlighted mental health needs, persisting gender inequalities and demand for public health competencies. Our comparison reveals similar weaknesses and governance gaps. (1) Mental health needs of healthcare workers are increasingly recognised (more strongly in Denmark and less in Romania with the other countries clustering in-between);however, health workersâ€™ perceptions are not used as guidance and effective programmes are lacking. (2) The situation is worst in relation to gender equality goals that are largely ignored in pandemic policy and recovery plans. (3) Public health competences are more advanced and integrated in the NHS systems in Denmark and Portugal, but no country has taken action to innovate health workforce education and strengthen public health. Conclusions The comparative assessment highlights that health systems failed to adequately respond to health workforce needs and the COVID-19 challenges. Action has to be taken to implement participatory governance and step up efforts towards more responsive and resilient health workforce policy.","Kuhlmann, E.; BrÃ®nzac, M.

"Health workersâ€™ perception vs medically approved COVID-19 infection risk: the risk communication gap : Ellen Kuhlmann","Background This study analyses how healthcare workers (HCWs) perceived risks, protection and preventive measures during the COVID-19 pandemic in relation to medically approved risks and organisational measures. We aim to explore â€˜blind spotsâ€™ of pandemic protection and identify mental health needs. Methods A German multi-method hospital study at Hannover Medical School serves as an â€˜optimal-caseâ€™ scenario of a high-income country, well-resourced hospital sector and an organisation with low HCW infection rate serves to explore governance gaps in HCW protection. Document analysis, expert information and survey data (n = 1163) were collected as part of a clinical study into SARS-CoV-2 serology testing during the second wave of the pandemic (November 2020-February 2021). Selected survey items included perceptions of risks, protection and preventive measures. Descriptive statistical analysis and regression were undertaken for gender, profession and COVID-19 patient care. Results Our study reveals a low risk of 1% medically approved infections among participants, but a much higher mean personal risk estimate of 15%. The majority (68.4%) expressed â€˜someâ€™ to â€˜very strongâ€™ fear of acquiring infection at the workplace. Individual protective behaviour and compliance with protective workplace measures were estimated as very high. Yet only about half of the respondents felt strongly protected by the employer;12% even perceived â€˜noâ€™ or â€˜littleâ€™ protection. Gender and contact with COVID-19 patients had no significant effect on the estimations of infection risks and protective workplace behaviour, but nursing was correlated with higher levels of personal risk estimations and fear of infection. Conclusions A strong mismatch between low medically approved risk and personal risk perceptions of HCWs brings stressors and threats into view, that may be preventable through improved information, risk communication and inclusion of mental health support in pandemic preparedness. Key messages â€¢ Healthcare workersâ€™ perceptions of COVID-19 infection risks are much higher than medically approved infection risk. â€¢ Pandemic preparedness and protection plans must pay greater attention to information, risk communication and mental health needs.","Kuhlmann, E.; Behrens, G.

"The impact of depression on satisfaction with prenatal care in Kazakhstan during COVID-19 pandemic : Raushan Alibekova","Background Depression and anxiety are common during perinatal periods, representing a considerable public health concern during global pandemic. Only few studies have examined the influence of emotional disturbances on satisfaction with maternity care. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of satisfaction with prenatal care and to examine its association with depression and anxiety among pregnant women in Kazakhstan. Methods Participants were recruited to this online cross-sectional survey in the outpatient clinic in Novoshamalgan, Almaty region (n = 174) in December-January, 2022. A single-item measure of satisfaction was used by asking a question â€œHow satisfied are you with health services?â€, scored on a 5-point Likert scale. A simplified 2-item Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale and 2-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale were used to measure depressive and anxiety symptoms. Results Majority of women were very satisfied or satisfied (n = 128;74%), while less than a third of the sample (n = 46;26%) were dissatisfied with the received care. The prevalence of depression in the total sample was higher, compared to the prevalence of anxiety (34% versus 18%). Multivariable logistic regression showed that dissatisfaction with prenatal care was associated with older age, not attending check-ups regularly, and being employee of private company or student. Depression increased the odds of being dissatisfied by 2.6 times (95% CI 1.19~5.79);while obstetric issues and anxiety were not associated with satisfaction. Perception of women about inadequate solution of the problem of antenatal depression was a significant predictor of dissatisfaction (AOR 6.87;95% CI 1.81~26.12). Conclusions Depressed women in our study were less satisfied with prenatal care. Further investigation of the perception of women about specific aspects of perinatal health services is suggested. Providing a quality, patient-centered care is needed to support pregnant women during the current pandemic. Key messages To improve the quality of prenatal care, health providers should address not only physical concerns, but also psychosocial issues and symptoms of depression of pregnant women during current pandemic. Although prenatal care is accessible to all pregnant women in Kazakhstan, development of patient-centered perinatal care is needed, focusing on communication skills and quality of interaction.","Kossybakova, G.; Alibekova, R.; Crape, B.; Kuntuganova, A.","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+impact+of+depression+on+satisfaction+with+prenatal+care+in+Kazakhstan+during+COVID-19+pandemic+:+Raushan+Alibekova","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; JOUR(Suppl 3), 32.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41551,""
"Socio-demographic and socio-economic disparities in medical rehabilitation in Germany in 2019 : Silke Kniffert","Medical rehabilitation is a valuable component to restore physical and mental health, to prevent social isolation and to ensure a return to work. Due to the demographic change and the still increasing number of Post-Covid-19 patients, the demand for rehabilitation is still increasing. Latest, the COVID-19 pandemic elucidated that especially people from lower socio-economic backgrounds are disproportionally affected by health crisis. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of socio-demographic and socio-economic factors on quantitative exercise therapy in medical rehabilitation and to clarify the divergence of existing research findings. In our study we used data from 824.606 rehabilitation cases (German Federal Pension Insurance) and investigated the role of age and gender, marital status, social status and location towards inequalities in access to medical rehabilitation. Multiple linear regression and effect size calculation were used to show associations and to discuss the relation to clinical relevance. We were able to show a highly significant difference (P &lt; 0.001) in access to exercise therapy in our study group. Patients aged 65+, women, single or widowed people, rehabilitants of low socioeconomic status or people located in the new federal states in Germany received shorter and less frequent exercise therapy. There are differences of up to 3.5 hours of treatment duration and 4.25 treatments per week, when disadvantaged social factors accumulate. However, despite the presented differences, the received treatments for the disadvantaged groups are still in the range of suggested minimum therapeutic requirements by the German Federal Pension Insurance. We could show a significant difference in rehabilitative therapy, which is solely based on social factors. There is an urgent need to draw special attention to the here discussed inequalities in access to medical rehabilitation for socially disadvantaged population and the overarching impact on society. Key messages â€¢ The social inequality in medical rehabilitation to the detriment of the socially disadvantaged population that we have identified must give rise to clear changes in order to establish social justice. â€¢ Equal opportunities and health quality assurance that address the individual needs of each patient should be the focus of socio-medical, policy development.","Kniffert, S.; Stamm, O.; Heimann- Steinert, A.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Socio-demographic+and+socio-economic+disparities+in+medical+rehabilitation+in+Germany+in+2019+:+Silke+Kniffert","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; JOUR(Suppl 3), 32.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41552,""
"COVID-19 and Perinatal Stress Experience â€“ a Study Conducted as Part of the COVGEN Initiative COVID-19 und perinatales Stresserleben â€“ eine Studie im Rahmen der COVGEN-Initiative","Introduction During the COVID-19 pandemic, stress and anxiety in the population increased due to concerns about peopleâ€™s own health and that of their relatives, as well as changes in everyday life due to measures taken to reduce the infection rate. Pregnant women are particularly stressed. The present study examines how the COVID-19 pandemic affects the stress experience and mental health of pregnant women and mothers of newborns and how care could be optimized. Methods As part of the international COVGEN initiative ( https://www.covgen.org ) to investigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the peripartum period, pregnant and postpartum women were asked about their experience with stress using the COPE-IS (Coronavirus Perinatal Experiences â€“ Impact Survey) questionnaire developed for this purpose and translated from the English. In addition, demographic data, pre-existing diseases, pregnancy complications and the care situation were recorded. The questionnaire was either administered as hardcopy to inpatients at the Department of Womenâ€™s Health, University Hospital TÃ¼bingen, Germany, or online. All pregnant women and mothers who were pregnant or had given birth after the official start of the COVID-19 pandemic (11 March 2020) were eligible to participate. Results Complete data sets of nÂ =Â 156 pregnant women and nÂ =Â 221 postpartum women were available for evaluation. The general stress level assessed with the COPE-IS was significantly increased by the COVID-19 pandemic in both, pregnant and postpartum women, with pre-existing conditions such as respiratory diseases and pregnancy-related diseases like gestational diabetes adding to the stress. The subjectively perceived quality of care/support during pregnancy also influenced the stress level. Conclusions Fears of a COVID-19 infection and changes in preventive and aftercare services were a burden for the women surveyed. Intensified care during pregnancy and puerperium could help to stabilize the mental situation and reduce stress.","Kentschke, Dominik, Bauer, Ilena, Moser, Julia, Schleger, Franziska, Hahn, Marlene, Pauluschke-FrÃ¶hlich, Jan, Jakubowski, Peter, Abele, Harald, Preissl, Hubert, Hartkopf, Julia","https://www.google.com/search?q=COVID-19+and+Perinatal+Stress+Experience+â€“+a+Study+Conducted+as+Part+of+the+COVGEN+Initiative+COVID-19+und+perinatales+Stresserleben+â€“+eine+Studie+im+Rahmen+der+COVGEN-Initiative","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Geburtshilfe und Frauenheilkunde; JOUR(11):1265-1273, 82.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41553,""
"For the Parent, by the Parent: Creating a Program to Empower Parents of Refugee Background Using Novel Participatory Approaches","Background With more than 28 million individuals of refugee or asylum-seeking background globally, the current situation has been described as one of the largest humanitarian crises of all time. Families of refugee background have complex, multigenerational mental health and developmental needs that are not accounted for in current programming frameworks. Difficulties in resettlement have been further compounded by COVID-19-related lockdowns, straining parental mental health and placing children at an increased risk for developmental or behavioural problems. Providing appropriate support services and educational resources that address the multigenerational concerns of families of refugee background will address these challenges, allowing for improved parental mental health, family cohesion, and developmental outcomes for children. Objectives To gather data about the experiences, resources, referral pathways and barriers that impact the experience of parents of refugee background in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) and to develop a novel, multi-dimensional parenting program model using Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) principles. Design/Methods This was a qualitative community-based participatory study using a formative research framework, in accordance with COREQ guidelines. In-depth interviews (IDIs) were conducted with parents of refugee background and care providers that work closely with this population. Data were recorded, transcribed, and coded using deductive and inductive coding methods by two independent coders. Results A total of 20 IDIs were conducted (7 parents and 13 care providers). The main topics that were identified to be incorporated into the program include features of child development, how to address resettlement issues, child advocacy, and parenting in the Canadian context. Participants felt that tackling the language barriers, addressing the overlapping responsibilities of the mothers attending the sessions, providing incentives, increasing awareness of the program, and using an anti-racist and anti-oppressive approach is key to the programâ€™s success. Participants emphasized the need for trauma-informed mental health support within the program model. Conclusion This study describes the key considerations for a novel parenting program for families of refugee background, by engaging them as key stakeholders in the program design process. Future iteration of this project would involve a pilot and evaluation of the program.","Kaur, Pardeep, Ho, Bernice, Kaukab, Tanvir, Rashid, Meb, Bowry, Ashna, Yousafzai, Aisha, Minhas, Ripudaman","https://www.google.com/search?q=For+the+Parent,+by+the+Parent:+Creating+a+Program+to+Empower+Parents+of+Refugee+Background+Using+Novel+Participatory+Approaches","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Paediatrics & child health; JOUR(Suppl 3):e20-e21, 27.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41554,""
"Longitudinal rate of change in depression symptoms from pre- to post-COVID-19 onset among US mothers : Julie Kapp","Background The extent of the psychological impact of the pandemic is still unfolding. Despite existing literature, most studies lack rigor. We assessed the longitudinal rate of intra-individual change in maternal depression symptoms from before to after COVID-19 onset among US mothers enrolled in a home visiting program with robust adjustment for family contextual factors. We hypothesize that the rate of change in maternal depression symptoms increased after the pandemic onset. Methods Eligibility included mothers with =1 depression assessment both prior to and after March 16, 2020;thresholds of = 13 on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and =10 on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 identified probable depression. We used a generalized linear mixed effects longitudinal model with a random intercept and random slope for time (years) to analyze probable depression (event=â€˜Yes') pre- and post-COVID. Covariates for model estimation were based on the literature and theory. Results Our cohort of 3,431 mothers included 43% non-Hispanic White, 21% non-Hispanic Black, and 31% Hispanic races/ethnicities;58% from rural/small towns, 18% Spanish-speaking, 63% with one child, median age of 29 and median 2 years follow-up. Households included: 82% low income, 24% low education, 10% insecure housing, 29% single parents, 21% mental illness, 10% substance abuse, and 8% domestic violence. Fourteen percent screened positive for depression pre-COVID, and 10% post-COVID. Depression was significantly higher pre- versus post-COVID, with no significant difference in the rate of change over time. Significant variables (p &lt; 0.05) associated with depression included race/ethnicity, region of the country, number of home visits, mental illness, substance abuse, and domestic violence. Conclusions After controlling for family contextual factors, we did not find a significant increase in maternal depression post-COVID-19.

"Umunthu, Covid-19 and mental health in Malawi","This paper investigates the centrality of Umunthu in mental health conception and treatment in Malawi. Umunthu is an African philosophical worldview which stresses that an individual is human as they relate to others, as in the saying I am because we are. Its communitarian approach contrasts with a predominantly western individualistic worldview;I think therefore I am. There are spelling variations of the word across Bantu languages, including bomoto (Congo), gimuntu (Angola);umunthu (Malawi);vumutu (Mozambique);vumuntu, vhutu (South Africa);humhunu/ubuthosi (Zimbabwe);bumuntu (Tanzania);and umuntu (Uganda). Literature shows that if embraced and advocated for, Umunthu plays a positive and influential role in mainstreaming and dealing with mental health issues in communitarian societies where the Umunthu ideals are part of the social fabric. However, in the case of Covid-19 and mental health in Malawi, the paper argues that Covid-19 preventive measures, particularly self-isolation when Covid-19 positive;maintaining social distance at all times;and reducing the number of people gathered at funerals, challenge Umunthu ideals, which have in the past been crucial in reducing stress, trauma and anxiety. This original paper bases its arguments on empirical data collected in a study conducted in Mangochi, Blantyre, Karonga and Lilongwe. Based on the study's findings, the paper highlights that although Covid-19 preventative measures have been globally embraced, it is also a limiting factor in the quest for mental health in societies with communitarian value systems.

"Suicide prevention in France put to the test by COVID-19 : Fabrice Jollant","Introduction Each year, nearly 9,000 people die from suicide in France, and more than 150,000 attempt suicide. In spite of a decrease for the last 30 years, rates of suicide in France remain higher than the European mean. Since 2018, a national suicide prevention strategy of the Ministry of Health has been in place. In 2020, this new strategy has been exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods First, the different actions of the national suicide prevention strategy will be presented, followed by the results of the available data regarding the impact of COVID-19 on suicidal gestures. These data are 1) hospitalizations for self-harm (ICD-10 codes X60 to X-84) from the national health database;2) calls to poison control centers and 3) visits to the emergency room for a suicide attempt. The latest figures available will be presented. Results The analysis of these data compared to 2019 highlights two main periods. Between March and December 2020, a significant decrease in suicide attempts was observed (8.5%), with a rapid drop during the first week of the first confinement in mid-March 2020, in women and men, and in all age groups except old-aged people. Since January 2021, a significant increase in suicide attempts has been observed among teenage girls, including high-lethality acts. Moreover, among the young and the elderly, the figures are now similar to 2019. Only numbers for middle-aged adults continue to decline. Conclusions The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicide attempts appears to be variable over time, according to age and gender. The old-aged people and young people, especially adolescent girls seem to have suffered the most from this situation. It is still too early to know whether the new national suicide strategy has had any positive impact. However, the pandemic has highlighted certain weaknesses in the French system, in particular the lack of recent data on mortality by suicide, and the heavy dependence on a fragile mental health medical system.","Jollant, F.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Suicide+prevention+in+France+put+to+the+test+by+COVID-19+:+Fabrice+Jollant","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; JOUR(Suppl 3), 32.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41557,""
"Suicide Trends during the COVID-19 pandemic and the International COVID-19 Suicide Prevention Research Collaboration : Ann John","Introduction There was and still is much speculation about the COVID-19 pandemic impact on suicide rates. We aimed to assess the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicide rates around the world. Methods We sourced real-time suicide data from countries or countries areas through a systematic internet search (official websites of Ministries of health, police agencies, and government-run statistics agencies or equivalents), recourse to our networks (e.g. ICSPRC) and the published literature (a living systematic review). We used an interrupted time-series analysis to model the trend in monthly suicides before COVID-19 in each country or country area, comparing the expected number of suicides derived from the model with the observed number of suicides in the early months of the pandemic (from April 1 to July 31, 2020, in the primary analysis). We have now updated this work to cover the first 15 months of the pandemic and stratified analyses by age and sex and method. We will present findings from the new updated data (35 countries) at the conference. Results Initially we sourced data from 21 countries (16 high-income and five upper-middle-income countries). Rate ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs based on the observed versus expected numbers of suicides showed no evidence of a significant increase in risk of suicide since the pandemic began in any country or area. There was statistical evidence of a decrease in suicide compared with the expected number in 12 countries or areas. Conclusions This was the first study to examine suicides occurring in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in multiple countries. Early on high-income and upper-middle-income countries, suicide numbers remained largely unchanged or declined compared with the expected levels based on the pre-pandemic period. We need to remain vigilant and be poised to respond as the longer-term mental health and economic effects of the pandemic unfold. We will present updated findings with more recent data.","John, A.; Pirkis, J.; Gunnell, D.; Spittal, M.; Del Pozo Banos, M.; Arya, V.; Shin, S.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Suicide+Trends+during+the+COVID-19+pandemic+and+the+International+COVID-19+Suicide+Prevention+Research+Collaboration+:+Ann+John","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; JOUR(Suppl 3), 32.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41558,""
"Urban places and Mental Health challenges (lessons learned from Covid-19 crisis) : Marija Jevtic","Nature deprivation under COVID-19 lead to reduced well-being. Urban design interventions were also identified as an important contributor to the restoration of community confidence, choice, and safety. Factors related to sociodemographic, housing and lockdown were linked to changes in exposure to nature during the pandemic lockdown. Changes in exposure to nature and mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 lockdown were strongly linked. Especially young people had an increased number of mental health problems. Children and youth were more bored and worried in comparison with the pre-pandemic period. The educational institutions worldwide were closed or changed to online education during the pandemic, leading to great disturbance in studentsâ€™ education and outdoor events. All â€œgreen infrastructureâ€ (GI) resources (including parks, gardens etc.) received great attention as â€œessential infrastructureâ€ supporting well-being. But, the quality, functionality and position of GI in urban areas showed inequality in distribution. Frequently, societies with greater ethnic diversity, lower income and larger health inequality suffered from unsatisfactory or lack of access. GI is important in decision-making to address inequality. This work will also present an open-air activity for all generations: A reflective walk through the oldest part of Novi Sad (EU Capital of Culture 2022), as a part of Project Reflective citizens in Novi Sad. This walking tour was led by pupils from primary school - where all generations spend useful time in open space and a safe atmosphere walking tour, learning and listening about the cultural history of the oldest part of the city. It is vital to enhance urban planning and design practices in making healthier and more resilient communities.

"Major mental health referral quality improvement project for castle high school staff","Background: Many high school students struggle with mental illness, especially since the isolation of the COVID-19 pandemic. Educating high school faculty/staff with basic information to recognize and refer students for mental health concerns may improve faculty/staff knowledge, confidence, and trust in the mental health referral process, which may then increase referrals and subsequent treatment of at-risk youth. Methods: A Quality Improvement Project was conducted by a Hawaiece[yen]i Keiki Nurse Practitioner at a Hawaiece[yen]i public high school to determine if educating high school faculty and staff on identification and referral of high school students displaying signs of mental health distress improves staff knowledge, confidence, and trust in the overall process. The project was conducted by delivering an asynchronous webinar intervention to the faculty and staff. Data was collected via a pre-test, post-test, and a one-month follow-up test by means of a questionnaire. Results: Of the 47 total participants, 37 completed the post-survey, and 25 completed the one-month follow-up survey. Results from the one-month follow-up indicate participant level of confidence (measured on a 5-point Likert scale) in identification of students improved from mean score m = 2.96 (pre-test) to m = 4.12 (1-month follow-up), level of confidence in knowledge of the process improved from m = 2.65 (pre-test) to m = 4.11 (1-month follow-up), and level of trust in the process improved from m = 2.21 (pre-test) to m = 3.20 (1-month follow-up). Conclusion: The intervention was successful in increasing faculty/staff level of confidence in identification of students who may need mental health referrals, level of confidence in the process for referral, and level of trust in the referral process. Participants' scores between the immediate post-test and the one-month follow-up remained relatively consistent over time, indicating effective retention of the material. Recommended future research includes studying the number of referrals made after the intervention, and studying actual outcomes of those referrals among students in order to determine if the intervention improves student mental health outcomes.

"Parenting Experiences of Families of Refugee Background in the Greater Toronto Area: A Formative Study","Background As of date, the world is experiencing its highest levels of human displacement, with many families resettling in Canada. While there is an understanding that families of refugee background have complex, multigenerational mental health, and developmental needs, little is known about whether their parenting needs are met adequately in Canada after resettlement nor how COVID-19 related restrictions have further complicated their resettlement experience. Objectives To gather data about the facilitators and barriers that impact the parenting experience of families of refugee background in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) in the context of their childrenâ€™s unique developmental and resettlement needs. Design/Methods This was a qualitative, community-based participatory research study. All data was collected from August 2019 to July 2020. In-depth interviews (IDIs) were conducted with caregivers of refugee background and healthcare providers that work closely with this population. Data were recorded, transcribed, and coded by two independent coders and a peer-debriefing strategy was used to verify the coding approach. Results In total, 20 IDIs were conducted (7 caregivers, 13 care providers). Six key themes were identified: (1) Mental Health and Healthcare Access, (2) Language, (3) Navigating Canadian Systems, (4) Finances, (5) Cultural Dimensions of Caregiving, and (6) Advocacy and Agency. The caregivers and healthcare providers agreed that language is a migration barrier, housing and financial stability are challenging to obtain, and that families struggle to self-advocate. There was disagreement as to how families and healthcare providers viewed healthcare access: caregivers reported that they have good access, but the providers cited that there are still barriers, including health literacy and cultural differences. While caregivers believe they are well supported by the government, healthcare providers believe more funding and education on the familiesâ€™ rights are necessary. Finally, although most caregivers describe Canada as welcoming, healthcare providers highlighted more incidences of misunderstandings and gaps within the system that may allow families to fall through the cracks.

"Anxiety among students during the pandemic - Results from the C-19 German Student Well-being Study : Eileen Heumann","Background Anxiety is widespread among university students. The COVID-19 pandemic af-fected studentsâ€™ mental health negatively. Given the long duration of the pandemic monitoring mental health remains important. This study aims to determine to which extent anxiety is preva-lent among students (1), what factors are associated with it (2) and which student groups are mostly affected (3). Methods The cross-sectional COVID-19 German Student Well-being Study (C19 GSWS) sur-veyed mental health and well-being of students at five universities in Germany from 27.10.-14.11.21. Anxiety was assessed using the GAD-2. Associations between anxiety and sociodem-ographic, socioeconomic/social support factors as well as health- and COVID-19-related factors were determined using multiple binary logistic regression models. Results The mean age of students was 24.1 years (SD = 4.9), 67% were women and 31% men. The prevalence of anxiety was 32% and diverse gender (OR = 3.98, 95% CI: 1.71-9.23), a com-plicated relationship status (OR = 1.66, 95% CI: 1.06-2.60), the lack of a confidant (OR = 2.50, 95% CI: 1.80-3.46), and financial difficulties (e.g., being able to cover monthly expenses;OR = 1.76, 95% CI: 1.36-2.29) were associated with anxiety. Participants who were worried about (re)infection with COVID-19 had a 1.28-times higher chance (OR, 95% CI: 1.03-1.59) for anxie-ty. Students who were (rather) not worried that a relative would become severely ill with COVID-19 had a lower chance to experience anxiety (OR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.53-0.98) as well as those who were confident receiving medical care in case of an infection with COVID-19 (OR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.65-0.98). Conclusions Concepts for prevention and counselling in terms of mental health problems in students should be developed considering specific stressors due to the pandemic. Key messages â€¢ This study shows that anxiety is widespread among university students and associated with a variety of stressors. â€¢ The findings can help to develop specific concepts for prevention and counselling.","Heumann, E.; Helmer, S.

"Relationship among grit, social support, optimism, illness-related distress and psychosocial outcomes in COVID-19 long haulers","The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., COVID-19) led to the death of more than 6 million individuals globally. This viral infection manifests differently in individuals, with some experiencing mild symptoms and others experiencing severe symptoms that result in hospitalization or even death. Survivors of COVID-19 may recover in days, while others experience prolonged symptoms for weeks or months after initial illness manifestation (Navabi, 2020). These prolonged symptoms, termed ""long-covid,"" can be continuous or relapsing and remitting and may be new or the same symptoms of acute COVID-19 (Raveendran et al., 2021). Research on chronic illness indicates that individuals with chronic health conditions experience higher rates of depression and anxiety, which are associated with reduced quality of life (QoL;Gerontoukou, 2015;National Institute of Mental Health, 2021;Obo et al., 2014). Long-covid patients also experience increased rates of depression and anxiety and decreased QoL (Frontera et al., 2021;Ismael et al., 2021;Ma et al., 2020;Mendez et al., 2021;Talman et al., 2021;Temperoni et al., 2021). However, resilience (i.e., successfully adapting to adversity;VandenBos, 2007), can protect against the harmful psychological effects of chronic illness (Manning et al., 2016). Specifically, grit, social support, and optimism are associated with better mental health outcomes in chronic illness populations (Ratajska et al., 2020;Sharkey et al., 2018;Zenger et al., 2010). Another important component of adjustment to chronic illness is cognitive appraisal of illness, which can facilitate or impede mental health outcomes in patients. Illness intrusiveness (II;i.e., disruption of lifestyles, activities, and interests) and illness uncertainty (IU;i.e., cognitive experience where illness outcomes are unpredictable and ambiguous) are both associated with poorer adjustment to chronic illness and poor mental health and QoL outcomes (Devins, 1994;Gromisch et al., 2019;Pai et al., 2006;Schiele et al., 2019;Szulczewski et al., 2017). However, research suggests that resilience variables can decrease II and IU (Carroll & Arthur, 2010;Neri et al., 2011;Sajjadi et al., 2015). The current study examined the resilience variables of grit, optimism, and social support and their effect on anxiety, depression, and QoL. Mediators of II and IU were assessed. A total of 217 long-covid patients recruited through snowball sampling were asked to complete questionnaires measuring the related constructs. It was hypothesized that resiliency would be negatively associated with poor mental health outcomes and positively associated with QoL. It was also hypothesized that II and IU would mediate these relationships. The data was analyzed using Model 4 of the PROCESS macro for SPSS by Andrew Hayes. Results indicated that social support and optimism were negatively associated with anxiety and depression and positively associated with QoL. Grit was negatively associated with anxiety and depression but did not influence QoL outcomes. IU and II were negatively associated with grit, social support, and optimism. There was partial support for IU mediating the relationships between grit and anxiety and depression, social support and anxiety and depression, and optimism and anxiety. IU did not mediate the relationship between optimism and depression. II did not mediate the relationships between grit and anxiety and depression, social support and anxiety and depression, and optimism and anxiety and depression. II and IU fully mediated the relationship between grit and QoL and social support and QoL. There was partial mediation for II and IU between optimism and QoL. These results were discussed in terms of effective interventions for reducing negative outcomes in long-covid patients.

"Mental Health in Children during the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Experience of a North American Tertiary Care Pediatric Emergency Department","Background The COVID-19 pandemic is a unique distressing period of experience to the public with strict physical, social and economic restrictions. Moreover, the impact of this experience on children with school closures, online education and social isolation may have a profound psychosocial impact. Objectives The objective was to evaluate and characterize the changes in mental health issues in children presenting to a large tertiary pediatric emergency department (ED) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design/Methods We performed a retrospective chart review of all children who presented with any mental health related diagnosis according to the ICD-10 classification from March 1, 2019 to February 28, 2020, and during pandemic periods (March 1, 2020 to February 28, 2021). Data on presentation, diagnosis and outcome were extracted and compared using Chi square test and z tests as appropriate. Results Our centre experienced a 39% reduction (57,522 visits vs. 35,485 visits) in all ED visits but a significant increase (p=0.002) in mental health issues during the pandemic period of 5.22% compared to 4.88% during the previous year (2811/57522 visits vs. 1959/35485). Among 1,959 children presenting to ED during the pandemic, the majority (53%) were female children compared to a male predominance of 55% before the pandemic. The highest peak of visits was observed in the 14 to 16 years age group, irrespective of gender and pre/pandemic periods. The category that included â€œeating disordersâ€ showed a distinct rise of 46% (p&lt;0.001) during the pandemic period. Two categories â€œIntentional Self-Harmâ€ and â€œExternal Causes of Morbidity with Undetermined Intentionâ€ did not show any difference, while â€œDisorders of psychological developmentâ€ had a significantly low 46.5% (P&lt;0.001) presentation during pandemic period. There wasnâ€™t an increase in presentation of depression and anxiety to ED during COVID-19. However, admissions were significantly high (p&lt;0.001) during the pandemic 46.5% compared to the pre-pandemic (41.6%) period. Conclusion During the pandemic, the percentage of visits related to mental health diagnoses in children increased significantly although the overall ED visits for all patients declined. As COVID-19 is expected to stay with us for the foreseeable future, we hope that this research will provide health care workers with the knowledge and understanding to optimize their approach to children at the ED.","Harel, Dana Singer, Perera, Niranjala, Ratnapalan, Savithiri","https://www.google.com/search?q=Mental+Health+in+Children+during+the+COVID-19+Pandemic:+The+Experience+of+a+North+American+Tertiary+Care+Pediatric+Emergency+Department","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Paediatrics & child health; JOUR(Suppl 3):e33-e34, 27.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41565,""
"Health services gaps experienced by non-standard workers in Ontario, Canada: Policy implications : Virginia Gunn","Background While the Canadian universal health system provides access to basic services, key health benefits are employer dependent. Given that non-standard workers (NSWs) only rarely have access to such benefits they have increased vulnerability to the many insecurities derived from their precarious employment, as clearly seen during the pandemic. The growing problem of non-standard work and workersâ€™ heightened risk for health status deterioration, followed by a possible accentuation of health inequities, is a population health concern. This study summarizes several health services gaps experienced by NSWs and discusses policy implications and possible solutions. Methods From January to July 2021, we conducted semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of 40 NSWs in Ontario, Canada, part of a larger mixed-methods six-country study, including three European countries. The target population consisted of workers aged 25 to 55 who, at the time of the survey, were in non-standard employment or lost their job due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Results Our findings highlight complex physical and mental health problems and an overall high burden of disease facing NSWs during the pandemic as linked to a combination of constant stress and worry arising from their employment insecurity, the limited and inconsistent income available to cover their basic needs, and the inadequate and unsafe working conditions they are afraid to challenge. Despite their increased health needs, given that specialized health services are not available to them for free they face financial barriers in accessing much needed health services that could help improve their health status and as a result, delay seeking care or avoid it altogether. Conclusions Sustainable multi sectorial policy solutions are needed including the adoption of relevant labour market legislation and increases in social and health expenditures along with re-adjustments in the ways in which health services are delivered. Key messages â€¢ During the pandemic non-standard workers in Ontario, Canada experienced complex health problems and, despite increased health needs, encountered barriers in accessing specialized health services. â€¢ The growing problem of non-standard work and workersâ€™ heightened risk for health status deterioration, followed by a possible accentuation of health inequities, is a population health concern.","Gunn, V.; O'Campo, P.; Buhariwala, P.; Muntaner, C.; Lewchuk, W.; Baron, S.; Bodin, T.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Health+services+gaps+experienced+by+non-standard+workers+in+Ontario,+Canada:+Policy+implications+:+Virginia+Gunn","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; JOUR(Suppl 3), 32.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41566,""
"Digital Health Literacy during COVID-19: gender differences from a Florentine University experience : Veronica Gallinoro","Gender appears to be a strong predictor of online health information-seeking behaviour (OHISB). Gender differences in OHISB have been studied in different countries with different results, but no studies investigated gender-specific behaviour among University students during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has brought with it a consequential infodemic. We sought to investigate any gender differences in OHISB in the period between the first and the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. A questionnaire promoted by the COVID-HL network was administered to 2996 students of all the courses at the University of Florence. It included existing validated scales adapted to the COVID-19 pandemic and newly developed scales. Gender differences were tested using the <U+03C7>2 test or the Mann-Whitney U test, where appropriate. Male students reported a higher score in DHL than females (p &lt; 0.001). However, female students reported using more often different sources for online information seeking (p &lt; 0.05, except for YouTube), searching more corona-related topics (p &lt; 0.05, except for economic and social consequences) and considering â€˜â€˜very important'â€™ each item in the â€˜â€˜Importance of internet information search'â€™ section (p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, female students are more likely to be â€˜â€˜often dissatisfied'â€™ or â€˜â€˜partly satisfied'â€™ with information about COVID-19 (p &lt; 0.001) and to search more often for information for themselves and other people. Our study confirmed that gender could affect the way students search for health information on the Internet. Since students, in particular females, have been affected by stress and anxiety during the pandemic, these findings could help institutions to promote gender-specific education programmes to improve studentsâ€™ DHL and their mental health outcomes, as well as to provide health information that fit specific gender needs. Key messages â€¢ Gender influences how university students search on the Internet for health information. â€¢ This should guide institutions to better address educational programmes to improve their Digital Health Literacy.","Guida, A.; Morittu, C.; Gallinoro, V.; Ferro Allodola, V.; Okan, O.; Dadaczynski, K.; Lorini, C.; Lastrucci, V.; Bonaccorsi, G.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Digital+Health+Literacy+during+COVID-19:+gender+differences+from+a+Florentine+University+experience+:+Veronica+Gallinoro","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; JOUR(Suppl 3), 32.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41567,""

"Health impact Assessment practice in Wales: factors conditioning its success : Liz Green","Historically, Public Health Institutes (PHIs) were formed to address emergency public health and environmental health related challenges for example, infectious disease outbreaks and sanitary conditions which will affect health. The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the importance and value of PHIs and the specific knowledge and expertise sat within them in the 21st century in relation to critical health issues. However, PHIs have also the potential expertise to look at the wider determinants of health and how they might affect population health and inequalities. In doing so, they play a critical role to advocate for Health in All Policies (HiAP) and Health Impact Assessment (HIA) by engaging with decision makers from health and non-health sectors and providing evidence and health intelligence. Public Health Wales (PHW) has conducted very complex studies as the HIA of the impact of Brexit on the population of Wales, which was praised as very useful by the Welsh Government and local decision makers at a time when, otherwise, little robust evidence-based information was available. Other positive HIA experiences are the recently published HIA about impacts of climate change or COVID-19 pandemic. Those achievements were possible thanks to the establishment of a specific unit dedicated to HIA within PHW, and to the political support and resources. This has built awareness raising and trust in HIA as a tool to support decision making from all sectors in Wales, enabled also by much training and stakeholder participation.","Green, L.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Health+impact+Assessment+practice+in+Wales:+factors+conditioning+its+success+:+Liz+Green","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; JOUR(Suppl 3), 32.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41569,""
"How breaks in nature can affect the usersâ€™ wellbeing: an experience based survey during the lockdown : Marco Gola","Background In the occasion of COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, the life of citizens was greatly disrupted - from healthcare professionals to the smart workers - and consequently also the state of mood. On the basis of the scientific evidences in relation to the relationship between the built environment and health, a research group has promoted an investigation on the benefits that greenery can have on the psychophysical state of the users, especially healthcare staff and users at home. Objectives The methodology adopted is the Profile of Mood States, which provides experiential activity in nature - without any technological distraction- to evaluate the benefits on mood. The methodology adopted refer to the shorter version (34 items) designed by prof. Grove at the University of Western Australia. In relation to the COVID-19 pandemic, the experience based questionnaire is differentiated for healthcare staff and general users. The questionnaire is composed of a few questions, to be completed before and after an experience in nature of 20/30 minutes. The investigation requires to be carried out in private gardens, balcony and/or terrace with greenery, public green areas, etc. Results 300 participants (subdivided into 225 general users and 75 healthcare professionals) took part in the investigations. Data analysis highlighted the higher performances in anxiety, depression, anger, force, fatigue and confusion, in particular for users who had the experience in garden (-50/70%), and among the healthcare staff the best outcomes are related to who did the investigation during or after the workshift (-60/-90%). Conclusions Although it is well-known the benefits that nature affects positively on well-being and stress level of users, the investigation underlines that brief breaks in the nature - especially in period of great stress such as pandemic - can influence the well-being and mental health of users.","Gola, M.; Botta, M.; Dâ€™Aniello, A.

"Mental health and well-being of students at TU Dresden : Maria Girbig","Background University life can be a particularly challenging phase in the development of young adults. Current research shows that mental disorders occur more frequently in students compared to workers of the same age. The coronavirus pandemic has exacerbated the problem. The TUDo! Study, done in cooperation with the FU Berlin, aimed to assess the health status of students at TU Dresden, with a focus on mental health. Methods In 2020/2021 students at TU Dresden (excluding students in the medical school) completed an online-based questionnaire. Validated questionnaires, e.g. the PHQ 4 (depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder) and the ERI student (student gratification crisis) were used. We evaluated descriptively and analytically, according to the questionnaire-specific specifications. Results A total of 2,683 students (12.3%) at the TU Dresden took part in the survey. The majority of study participants were female (n = 1,507;56.7%) and had an average age of 22.9 years (SD = 4.3). 32.8% (n = 856/2,611) of the participating students reported a depressive syndrome and 32.5% (n = 848/2,612) a generalized anxiety disorder. Almost half of participating students (40,0%;n = 515/1,310) indicated an imbalance between effort (E) and reward (R) (ER ratio&gt;1). 51.23% (n = 693/1,50) of respondents reported a decline of mental well-being because of the coronavirus pandemic. Discussion Unlike similar studies, this study shows that TU Dresden students were particularly affected with regards to perceived psychological stress and complaints. The existing differences seem to be partly due to the coronavirus pandemic. These results indicate that universities should regularly check their studying conditions and provide appropriate preventive measures.

"Anxiety and depression symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic in European countries and Australia : Katalin Gemes","Background Studies on mental health changes during the COVID-19 pandemic report no change or increasing prevalence of mental health problems in general, but less is known on changes in potentially disadvantaged groups over time. We investigated changes in anxiety and depression symptoms during the first year of the pandemic in France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and Australia by prior mental disorders and migration status. Methods Overall, 4,674 adults answered a web-based survey in May-June 2020 and were followed by three repeated surveys up to February 2021 in these countries. Information on socio-demographic, living conditions, psychosocial factors, diagnosis of mental disorders before, depression and anxiety symptoms during the pandemic and migration status (being a resident or not) was collected. Weighted general estimation equations modelling was used to investigate the association between prior mental disorders, migration status, and symptoms over time. Results Most participants were &lt;40 years old (48%), women (78%), and highly educated (62%) with some variations across countries. The baseline prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms ranged between 19%-45% and 13%-35% respectively. In most countries, prevalence remained unchanged throughout the pandemic and was higher among people with prior mental disorder than without even after adjustment for socioeconomic, psychosocial, living and health factors. We observed interactions between previous mental disorders and symptoms of anxiety or depression over time in Germany (p = 0.01) and in Spain (p = 0.04). No prevalence difference was noted by migration status. Conclusions Depression and anxiety symptoms were worse among individuals with prior mental disorders than without, but there was no clear trend of mental health worsening in the observed groups during the first year of the pandemic. Still, monitoring mental health should be continued in the long-term, with special focus on vulnerable groups. Key messages â€¢ Depression and anxiety symptoms were higher in individuals with prior mental disorders during the first year of the pandemic in an international sample of six European countries and Australia. â€¢ There were no clear trends of mental health worsening in any of the observed groups in neither of the countries between May-June 2020 and February 2021.","Gemes, K.; BergstrÃ¶m, J.; Sijbrandij, M.; Pinucci, I.; Quero, S.; van der Waerden, J.; Burchert, S.; Bryant, R.

"The role of public health services in implementing heat health action plans in Germany : Karin Geffert","Background The rise in extreme heat periods is a major public health challenge of climate change and the World Health Organization therefore recommends the implementation of heat health action plans (HHAPs). In Germany, HHAPs are not implemented in a comprehensive manner nor nationwide. Public health authorities have been identified as key actors with regards to heat and health. This study aims at assessing the role of public health services in the implementation of HHAPs in Germany. Methods First, a review of the scientific and grey literature on the role of public health services in heat adaptation in Europe was conducted. Second, a policy document analysis of the legislation of Germany's federal states for public health services and their potential role in the implementation of HHAPs was carried out. Finally, semi-structured interviews with selected experts from multiple sectors at the local, federal and national level on their perception of the role of public health services in the implementation of HHAPs in Germany were undertaken. Results Preliminary findings show that the legal framework for public health services in the different federal states addresses environmental health and civil protection to varying extents, but that climate change-specific health risks are barely mentioned. The expert interviews revealed perceived barriers for the public health services to implement HHAPs, notably with regards to personnel (e.g. competencies, time), organizational structures (e.g. financial resources, administrative structures, legal mandates) and competing other tasks (e.g. COVID-19 response). Facilitators included motivated individuals, funding opportunities for cross-sectoral collaboration and political support. Conclusions The role of public health services in HHAP implementation in Germany varies widely between the different geographic settings and is influenced by several factors at the individual, organizational and political level. Key messages Public health services can play an important role in heat adaptation, for example through coordinating the implementation of heat health action plans. Strong legal frameworks, sufficient organizational structures and well-trained personnel are important preconditions for an effective response by public health services to climate change challenges.","Geffert, K.; Rehfuess, E.; Rechel, B.","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+role+of+public+health+services+in+implementing+heat+health+action+plans+in+Germany+:+Karin+Geffert","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; JOUR(Suppl 3), 32.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41573,""
"Implementation of telemedicine consultations for people with mental health conditions in the community: a protocol for a systematic review [version 3;peer review: 2 approved]","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic response has led to an exponential increase in the use and spread of telemedicine internationally. In community mental health care settings, telemedicine services were implemented within a few weeks, with little time for rigorous planning. Despite the reported acceptability of telemedicine by patients and clinicians, barriers to its implementation have come to light. There is now a need to investigate these barriers, and facilitators, as telemedicine begins to show potential promise beyond the pandemic. We propose a review that aims to identify the factors affecting the implementation of telemedicine consultations for patients with mental health conditions in the community. Methods: A systematic review will be conducted and reported according to the PRISMA guidelines. Five electronic databases will be searched using a pre-defined search strategy from 2016 to 2021. Only studies of synchronous, interactive telemedicine consultations conducted via video, phone or live messaging between patients and providers will be included. Quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods studies will be eligible for inclusion. Only studies published in the English language will be included. Titles and s will be screened by two reviewers. Full text articles will be screened by two reviewers. The methodological quality of studies will be assessed using the Mixed Method Appraisal Tool (MMAT) by two reviewers. Data will be extracted and tabulated to address the aims of the review. A narrative synthesis will be conducted and reported factors will be mapped to the domains of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). Conclusion: By identifying the factors that influence the implementation of telemedicine consultations for patients with mental conditions in the community, consideration can be given to both barriers and facilitators that could be addressed in future mental health services planning.

"Reactive surveillance of suicides during the COVID-19 epidemic in France, 2020- March 2022 : Anne Fouillet","Background Mitigation actions during the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular lockdowns and curfews, may impact mental health and suicide in general populations. We aimed to analyse the evolution in suicide deaths from January 2020 to March 2022 in France. Methods Using free-text medical causes in death certificates, we built an algorithm, which aimed to identify suicide deaths. We measured its retrospective performances by comparing suicide deaths identified using the algorithm with deaths which had either an ICD10 code for â€˜intentional self-harmâ€™ or for â€˜external cause of undetermined intentâ€™ as underlying cause. The number of suicide deaths from January 2020 to November 2021 was then compared with the expected number estimated using a generalized additive model. The analysis was stratified by age group and gender. Analysis from December 2021 to March 2022 was conducted using electronic death certificates only. Results The free-text algorithm demonstrated high performances. From January 2020 to November 2021, suicide mortality declined during France's three lockdowns, particularly in men, and remained quite comparable with expected values between and after both of the country's lockdowns. Provisional results based on electronic death certificates suggest that suicide mortality remained stable until March 2022. Conclusions Monitoring suicide mortality is possible in France with a 4-month delay;this will be reduced to two days when electronic death certification is fully deployed. This study highlighted the absence of an increase in suicide mortality during France's COVID-19 pandemic, and a substantial decline during lockdowns periods, something already observed in other countries. Further studies are required to explain the factors for this decline. Key messages â€¢ In the absence of reactive coding of medical causes of deaths, the study proposed an approach to reactively identify suicide based on free-text medical causes from death certificates. â€¢ Our findings provide reassurance that the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a negative impact on the general population in terms of suicide in France from March 2020 to September 2021.","Fouillet, A.; Martin, D.; Pontais, I.; Caserio-SchÃ¶nemann, C.; Rey, G.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Reactive+surveillance+of+suicides+during+the+COVID-19+epidemic+in+France,+2020-+March+2022+:+Anne+Fouillet","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; JOUR(Suppl 3), 32.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41576,""
"Non-COVID activity in French emergency department during COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020 to March 2022) : Anne Fouillet","Background The COVID-19 epidemic and mitigation actions had major impacts on health and healthcare use by the French population. Since 2004, the French public health agency daily collects individual data of visits in the emergency departments (ED) OSCOURÂ® network (94% of national visits in 2022). We aimed to analyse the evolution of non-Covid ED visits from 2020 to March 2022, in order to identify potential indirect impact of the epidemic. Methods The main medical diagnosis (MD) coded in ICD-10 from each ED visit from 2017 to March 2022 was classified into 17 ICD-10 chapters and in 95 disjoint subgroups of pathologies. The observed numbers of ED visits by age group and by chapters/subgroups were compared to expected numbers, estimated using an overdispersed Poisson regression model based on 2017-2019 data. Results The observed numbers of ED visits for all chapters and for a large part of subgroups were significantly lower than the expected numbers during the three lockdowns in all age groups and progressively returned to the expected level in 2021. A change in the pattern of a limited list of subgroups was observed: ED visits for purpura, chronic blood diseases and neurologic disorders in children decreased during the first lockdown and remained under the expected level until March 2022. Inversely the number of ED visits for mental health and wheezing in children, for pulmonary embolism in adults and for neoplams in the elderly increased and remained over the expected values until 2022. Conclusions Syndromic ED system was a pillar of the French reactive surveillance of direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19 epidemic. The changes observed for different subgroups of pathologies may reflect a negative impact of the epidemic, a positive effect of protective measures on the spread of other infectious diseases, a modification in the organization or in the use of health care in specific domains. Further studies using hospitalization data could explore these hypotheses. Key messages â€¢ Existing syndromic surveillance system implemented before the emergence of SARS-COV2 enabled to monitor non-Covid-19 visits to emergency departments and assess changes in patterns of pathologies. â€¢ An increase in the number of emergency department visits during the COVID-19 epidemic was observed for mental health in children, for pulmonary embolism in adults and for neoplams in the elderly.","Fouillet, A.; Forgeot, C.; Pontais, I.; Pedrono, G.; Caserio-SchÃ¶nemann, C.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Non-COVID+activity+in+French+emergency+department+during+COVID-19+pandemic+(March+2020+to+March+2022)+:+Anne+Fouillet","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; JOUR(Suppl 3), 32.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41577,""
"The effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the stress and depression levels of new mothers : Cristina Florea","Background New mothers are a particularly vulnerable group during the COVID-19 pandemic, due both to the higher depression and stress levels associated with early child care and to the risk of a COVID-19 infection. We investigated the effects of the pandemic on the childbirth experience, stress and depression levels in this population. Methods This cross-sectional, explorative study included 1964 Austrian and German mothers who gave birth between 16.03.2020 and 01.07.2021 and completed an online survey between 18.05.2021 and 01.07.2021. This contained the Childbirth Experience Questionnaire (CEQ2), the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), as well as three custom-made scales: a birth risk score (risk factors for a poor birth outcome), a pandemic repercussions score (perceived effects on different aspects of personal life), and a social support score (how emotionally supported they feel). We computed post-hoc multilinear regression models to evaluate which factors can predict the CEQ2, PSS and EPDS scores. Results Mothers had a worse birth experience, perceived less stress and had more depressive symptoms during the pandemic than previously reported cohorts. The CEQ2 was predicted by the birth risk (negatively), the access to a midwife (positively) and the perception of sufficient access of the visitors in the hospital (positively) (adjusted R2 = 0.26, F(4, 1738) = 155.64, p &lt; 0.001). The PSS was predicted by the pandemic repercussions (positively), the social support (negatively), and the presence of a coping mechanism (negatively) (adjusted R2 = 0.28, F(4, 1959) = 195.1, p &lt; 0.001). The EPDS was similarly predicted by the same factors as the PSS (adjusted R2 = 0.28, F(4, 1959) = 189.59, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions Social support and strong coping mechanisms can lower the stress and depression scores. Instructing the population about how to improve these factors might be a target for future social policies. Key messages â€¢ Compared to historical cohorts, mothers who gave birth during the pandemic had a worse birth experience, and, postnatally, perceived less stress but had more depressive symptoms. â€¢ The visitorsâ€™ access to the hospital and the motherâ€™s access to a midwife impacted the birth experience, while the social support and the coping mechanisms affected the stress and depression scores.","Florea, C.; PreiÃŸ, J.; Angerer, M.; Schabus, M.","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+effects+of+the+Covid-19+pandemic+on+the+stress+and+depression+levels+of+new+mothers+:+Cristina+Florea","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; JOUR(Suppl 3), 32.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41578,""
"Perspectives of School Leaders on Supporting Learners With Special Education Needs During the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Ethic of Care Analysis","The ethic of care is a moral philosophy that has been used to describe and guide the work of educators, especially those working with students with special education needs (SEN). In this study, 36 principals and vice principals from four provinces in Canada were interviewed about their work with students with SEN during the pandemic. Responses were analyzed using the ethic of care framework. Accordingly, responses indicated that principals were particularly aware of, and responsive towards, the wide range of need experienced by students, their families, and school staff. Principals appeared especially concerned about the social needs of their students with SEN, the emotional support needs of the studentsâ€™ families, and the teachersâ€™ distress at not being able to meet all the educational needs of their students. Although most principals described the emotional toll of their work during the pandemic, none identified efforts directed towards self-care. This paper considers these findings in regard to motivational displacement as it relates to an ethic of care and calls for a broader consideration of need within education, such that support is extended to students, school staff and school leaders as the most effective means to foster healthy, future-ready schools. Key words: pandemic, principal, inclusive education, ethic of care, mental health.","FitzGerald, Carolyn, MacCormack, Jeffrey, Sider, Steve","https://www.google.com/search?q=Perspectives+of+School+Leaders+on+Supporting+Learners+With+Special+Education+Needs+During+the+COVID-19+Pandemic:+An+Ethic+of+Care+Analysis","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of school leadership;JOUR","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41579,""
"COVID Check-In: Optimizing Cleft & Craniofacial Team Care during COVID-19 using an on-line social paediatrics screening instrument","Background Public health mandates associated with COVID-19 added unprecedented stress on families, providers and the health care systems;including our ambulatory multidisciplinary cleft team care. In order to continue to provide responsive, multidisciplinary team (MDT) cleft and craniofacial care, it was essential to identify direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19 on our patients and families, whilst planning ahead for ongoing coordinated surgical, pediatric, and psychosocial interventions. Our team developed a short on-line psychosocial screening questionnaire that was administered prior to our MDT clinics, using a â€œWhat Matters to Youâ€ quality improvement (QI) format. Objectives 1.To establish and test the utility of a â€œWhat Matters to Youâ€ quality improvement (QI) questionnaire. 2.To use this questionnaire in order to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients and family access to health services. Design/Methods Our team developed a 5-question online smartphone-accessible survey and distributed this to families prior to their MDT clinic visit during the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyzed survey results from May 2020-October 2021 in order to understand the impact of COVID-19 on families as well as the utility of our survey system. Results Out of 110 sequential MDT visits, families reported that COVID impacted timely access to health services (20%);employment (32%);basic needs like food and shelter (13%);and social capital. Almost half (47%) reported less than 5 people to turn to for extra support. The most common concerns caregivers have about their children were development, learning, and/or school progress (38%);mental health (36%) and social emotional well-being (31%). Conclusion Our study shows that 5 key psychosocial screening questions can be utilized to facilitate care coordination, responsiveness, and triage for in-person and virtual care settings, and respond to family centred care priorities in the midst of evolving COVID-19 landscapes.","Fisher, Emily, Szostek, Lisa, Ponton, Ethan, Lau, William, Loock, Christine","https://www.google.com/search?q=COVID+Check-In:+Optimizing+Cleft+&+Craniofacial+Team+Care+during+COVID-19+using+an+on-line+social+paediatrics+screening+instrument","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Paediatrics & child health; JOUR(Suppl 3):e46-e46, 27.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41580,""
"Predictors of physical activity and smoking among German teachers during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic : Viktoria Eggert","Background The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has influenced the social and health-related behavior due to significant changes and constraints in the professional and private life. Especially in the school context, there were considerable changes, which may have promoted positive and negative health behaviors. Therefore, the aim of our study was to identify the predictors of physical activity and smoking of teachers during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Methods In March 2021, a nation-wide online survey was conducted among teachers in Germany. A total number of 31,089 participants entered analysis. Data on smoking and physical activity as well as sociodemographic, workplace-related, psychological, SARS-CoV-2-related, and health-related items were collected using established instruments and if necessary self-developed items. Two binary logistic regressions with block wise inclusion of the different variable groups were performed to predict physical activity and smoking. Results Among all surveyed teachers, 70.1% did not comply with the WHO recommendation of being physically active for at least 150 minutes per week and 13.9% reported to smoke. The regression analyses revealed significant predictors for physical activity (e.g., time requirement) and smoking (e.g., work schedule). Conclusions Recommendations to improve teachersâ€™ health can be derived from the predictors for physical activity and smoking that were identified in our study. Given the alarming result that more than two thirds of the teachers did not comply with the WHO recommendations, a special focus should be placed on improving physical activity, as this is a crucial factor for somatic and mental health. Key messages Teachers in Germany showed alarmingly low compliance regarding the WHO recommendations on physical activity during the pandemic. To improve teachersâ€™ health, it is important to take into account significant predictors of health behavior when planning interventions.","Eggert, V.; Koestner, C.; Beutel, T.; Kalo, K.; Dicks, T.; Zaehme, C.; Letzel, S.; Dietz, P.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Predictors+of+physical+activity+and+smoking+among+German+teachers+during+the+SARS-CoV-2+pandemic+:+Viktoria+Eggert","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; JOUR(Suppl 3), 32.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41581,""
"Predictors of job satisfaction among German teachers during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic : Theresa Dicks","Background To contribute the containment of the infections during the SARS-COV-2 pandemic, changes in working conditions occurred worldwide. In the school context, teaching was changed several times to distance learning and teachers were forced to work from home. This increasing spatial separation between work and private life increased the potential for conflicts. Based on the theoretical assumption that stressors worsen job satisfaction and resources increase satisfaction, the aim of our study was to identify the predictors of teachersâ€™ job satisfaction during the pandemic. The focus on job satisfaction is interesting because the concept is often related to health-related aspects from a public health perspective. Methods A nationwide cross-sectional survey was conducted among German teachers in March 2021. After data cleaning, 31,089 participants were included in the analyses. The survey consisted of established instruments (e.g., COPSOQ) and self-developed items if necessary. A multiple linear regression was performed to predict teachersâ€™ job satisfaction by stepwise inclusion of sociodemographic, work-related and covid-specific variables. Results Overall, the regression revealed that especially work-related variables were strong predictors of job satisfaction. The analyses showed that higher levels of meaning of work, autonomy and predictability of work increased job satisfaction. In contrast, increased emotional stress, feelings of unfair treatment, and work-privacy conflicts deteriorated job satisfaction. Conclusions The present study identified important predictors of job satisfaction which may be used to derive specific recommendations for improving teachersâ€™ job satisfaction during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The relevance of job satisfaction for the scientific and public discourse becomes apparent because it was closely related to teachersâ€™ somatic and mental health. Key messages â€¢ Teachersâ€™ job satisfaction during the pandemic can be further improved by making appropriate adjustments, particularly in work-specific requirements. â€¢ Improving job satisfaction significantly contributes to promoting teachersâ€™ health.","Dicks, T.; Eggert, V.; KÃ¶stner, C.; Beutel, T.; Kalo, K.; ZÃ¤hme, C.; Letzel, S.; Dietz, P.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Predictors+of+job+satisfaction+among+German+teachers+during+the+SARS-CoV-2+pandemic+:+Theresa+Dicks","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; JOUR(Suppl 3), 32.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41582,""
"The integrated GOR-COVID-19 health monitor: quarterly reporting (â€œshort-cycle monitoringâ€) : Mare Derks","Introduction/objective Given the capricious nature of COVID-19, infections and accompanying restrictive measures to reduce spread of the virus are known to strongly vary over time. The impact of the corona crisis on the mental and physical health of the general population may fluctuate accordingly. The quarterly monitoring research line is aimed to monitor the health impact of the corona crisis over time on a high frequency basis. Methods This is achieved through a multi-method approach, combining: a) survey data on perceived impact of corona measures and several health outcomes from two representative panels (~ 5.000 adolescents/young adults aged 12 and 25 years;~ 5.000 adults aged 26+ years), and b) surveillance data of acute health problems from the Nivel Primary Care Database (~1,6 million patients from 380 general practitioners). Data collection started in September 2021 and continues during the five-year monitoring program. Panel data is collected every quarter;Nivel surveillance data is collected weekly. Our contribution to the EUPHA conference will include data up and until September 2022 (i.e. five rounds of survey and surveillance data). Results Preliminary results from September 2021 through March 2022 indicate that adolescents/young adults reported worse mental and physical health outcomes compared to adults. Moreover, they experienced a more negative impact of corona measures. Accordingly, their mental health related problems, including suicide ideation, spiked between December 2021 and February 2022, a period characterized by highly restrictive COVID-19-measures. Discussion The quarterly monitoring research line showcase the relevance and feasibility of integrating multiple data sources in understanding the short- and long-term effect of the corona crisis.

"Pandemic-related determinants of depression in Czech older persons: Evidence from the HAPIEE cohort : Andrea DaleckÃ¡","Background A number of studies reported higher levels of mental health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic but only minority of studies focused to assess changes in mental health against measurements taken before the pandemics. We investigated a change in depressive symptoms using repeated measurements and the impact of the pre-existing and COVID-19-related stressors in an ageing cohort in the Czech Republic. Methods We used data on 2853 subjects (mean age 73 years) from the Czech part of the prospective HAPIEE cohort that participated on postal questionnaire surveys before (2017) and during the pandemic (autumn 2020 to early 2021). Participants reported their depressive symptoms using validated CESD-10 report tool. The impact of pre-existing stressors (age, sex, education, living alone, self-rated health, employment status, depression before pandemic), as well as pandemic-related stressors on change in depressive symptoms were tested using multivariable linear regression, after adjustment for age and potential confounders. Results Compared with pre-pandemic period, there was a significant increase in depression score during the COVID-19 pandemic. The mean CESD-10 score increased from 4.92 to 5.37 (p &lt; 0.001). Significantly larger increases in depressive score reported older persons (ÃŸ = 0.073;p &lt; 0.001) and those with poor self-rated health (ÃŸ = 0.170;p &lt; 0.001) in the fully adjusted model. Moreover, those who experienced social deprivation (ÃŸ = 0.057;p &lt; 0.001), death or hospitalization of a close person (ÃŸ = 0.064;p &lt; 0.001), delays in healthcare (ÃŸ = 0.048;p = 0.005) and those who suffered from COVID-19 (ÃŸ = 0.045;p = 0.008) also reported worsened depressive symptoms. Conclusions This longitudinal study confirms important increase in depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic and contributes to identify pandemic-related risk factors.

"Digital health literacy and well-being in university students in Germany : Kevin Dadaczynski","Background Digital communication technologies had a crucial role during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the internet and Social Media as highly frequented sources for retrieving health information. University student's health and well-being were highly affected and most interaction with peers and professionals migrated to the digital realm, which made digital health literacy (DHL) a key competence to navigate digital health environments. The main goal of the study was to explore DHL of students in Germany. Methods A cross-sectional online survey among students (N = 14916) from 130 universities in Germany was implemented as part of the global Covid-HL Network, collecting data on DHL, physical and mental health, SoC and sociodemographics. Data was analyzed using univariate, bivariate and regression analyses. Results Assessing the reliability of information (5964/14,103, 42.3%) and determining commercial interest of information posed the most difficult tasks (5489/14,097, 38.9%). Difficulties were revealed for finding information (4282/14,098, 30.4%). Female students reported lower DHL and social media use was associated with lower judgment skills. 38% of all students reported low and very low well-being and 29% reported at least two health complaints weekly, while health outcomes follow a social gradient (lower SES and gender). Regression analysis showed significant association between SoC and well-being (OR: 1.2-2.03) and health complaints (OR: 1.58-1.71). Higher future worries were with low well-being (OR: 2.83) and multiple health complaints (OR: 2.84). Conclusions There is an urgent need to enhance DHL and SoC of students and implement health promotion strategies, using target group specific intervention. Gender and socioeconomic differences must be taken into account and interventions could be delivered within the university. Measures should also address student mental health.","Dadaczynski, K.; Messer, M.; Rathmann, K.; Okan, O.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Digital+health+literacy+and+well-being+in+university+students+in+Germany+:+Kevin+Dadaczynski","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; JOUR(Suppl 3), 32.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41585,""
"Do religious people in Western Balkans have faith in COVID-19 vaccines? : Smiljana Cvjetkovic","Background Recently, it was established that more religious people tend to have less favorable views of vaccination. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between the religiousness and attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination and disease, in five Western Balkans countries. Methods Using online questionnaire and convenience sampling procedure, data were obtained from 1605 respondents aged 18-75 years. Perceived COVID-19 vaccine safety and efficacy, and observed danger and susceptibility to disease were assessed by short five-point Likert scales. Religiousness was estimated using single item scale. Multivariate regression analysis was employed. Results In Serbia, respondents who assessed themselves as more religious considered vaccine against COVID-19 as less safe (ÃŸ=-.10, p&lt;.01) and effective (ÃŸ=-.12, p&lt;.01), were more prone to the attitude that dangers of COVID-19 are not that serious (ÃŸ=-.09, p&lt;.01), and believed to a greater extent that they are less susceptible to the virus (ÃŸ=-.07, p&lt;.01). Similarly, in Bosnia and Herzegovina more religious individuals were less convinced that vaccine is effective (ÃŸ=-.07, p&lt;.05), less inclined to believe that danger of the virus is serious (ÃŸ=-.07, p&lt;.05), and assessed their susceptibility as lower (ÃŸ=-.06, p&lt;.05). More religious people in Montenegro (ÃŸ=-.06, p&lt;.05) regarded the vaccine as less safe, while in North Macedonia (ÃŸ=.06, p&lt;.05) and Albania (ÃŸ=.08, p&lt;.01) stronger religiosity was associated with more favorable attitudes towards vaccine safety. Conclusions The relationship between religiosity and attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination and disease is culturally conditioned. While in some Western Balkans societies religious beliefs render individual with a sense of lack of control triggering worry and anxiety, in some others they work as psychological shield against existential threats. Key messages â€¢ Religiosity should be considered as a relevant factor in vaccination campaigns implementation. â€¢ In the societies where negative attitudes towards vaccination prevail among the believers, religious leaders should be peculiarly educated and encouraged to participate in vaccination campaigns.","Cvjetkovic, S.; Jeremic Stojkovic, V.; Jankovic, J.; Mandic-Rajcevic, S.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Do+religious+people+in+Western+Balkans+have+faith+in+COVID-19+vaccines?+:+Smiljana+Cvjetkovic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; JOUR(Suppl 3), 32.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41586,""
"The effect of financial support on depression among young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic : Pierre-Julien Coulaud","Background To mitigate the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on financial resources, governments provided financial support (e.g., emergency aid funds) as well as family via personal assistance. This study aims to assess the moderating effect of financial support from the government or from family on the association between income loss and depression among young adults. Methods Two online cross-sectional surveys among young adults (18-29) living in Canada and France were conducted in October-December 2020 (n = 4511) and July-December 2021 (n = 3329). Depressive symptoms were measured using PHQ-9 score+10. Two logistic regression models were performed for each survey with an interaction term between income loss and financial support (government or family modeled separately), controlling for demographics (e.g., country, age, gender, income, living conditions). Results In the total sample, half reported depressive symptoms (2020/2021: 53%/46%), and over a third lost income (2020/2021: 10%/12% all income, 38%/22% some income). In 2020, 41% received government financial support (2021: 18%) while family/friends support was constant (12%). In both surveys, among those who received government support, income loss was associated with depression, whether participants lost all income (2020: AOR 1.75 [1.29-2.44];2021: AOR 2.17 [1.36-3.44]), or some income (2020: AOR 1.31 [1.17-1.81];2021: AOR 1.46 [0.99-2.16]). However, among those who received family support, income loss was no longer significantly associated with depression, whether participants lost all income (2020: AOR 1.37 [0.78-2.40];2021: AOR 1.51 [0.88-2.56]), or some income (2020: AOR 1.31 [0.86-1.99];2021: AOR 1.10 [0.67-1.81]). Conclusions Association between income loss and depression was moderated by receipt of family financial support but not by receipt of government support. Financial support may help to mitigate the negative effects of income loss on young adults mental health during public health crisis. Key messages â€¢ Financial support may help to minimize risk of depressive symptoms among youth who lost income related to the COVID-19 pandemic. â€¢ Financial support through personal assistance (e.g., family, friends) appears to have a greater impact on youth mental health than COVID-specific government assistance funds.","Coulaud, P.; Salway, T.; Jesson, J.; Bolduc, N.; Ferlatte, O.; Bertrand, K.; DesgrÃ©es du LoÃ», A.; Jenkins, E.; Jauffret-Roustide, M.; Knight, R.","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+effect+of+financial+support+on+depression+among+young+adults+during+the+COVID-19+pandemic+:+Pierre-Julien+Coulaud","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; JOUR(Suppl 3), 32.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41587,""
"Low resilience as risk factor of mental disorders during COVID-19 pandemic: A cohort study : Pere Castellvi","Background To analyze whether people with low resilience are at higher risk of mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic in Spanish adults. Methods A longitudinal cohort study was carried out. Resilience was measured pre/post-pandemic with the CD-RISC. Mental health problems assessed were: Major Depressive Episode (MDE), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors (STB), and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Results We found statistically significant differences between groups and resilience scores in MDE [F (3;48.40)=19.55], GAD [F(3;19.63)=6.45] and STB [F(3;111.74)=31.94]. Multivariable analyses showed individuals with very low resilience were at a 5-fold risk of Incidence of MDE and a 4-fold risk of STB. Persistent group presented a 21-fold risk of MDE and 54-fold risk of STB, respectively. No evidence of higher risk was found for GAD. Individuals with low resilience and exposed to COVID-19 did not have a significantly higher risk. Individuals with low resilience were at higher risk of PTSD in general population [ÃŸ(95%CI)= -3.25(-3.969 to -2.54)], but not for individuals with COVID-19. Conclusions In the general population, having low or very low resilience increases the risk of suffering MDE, STB, and PTSD, but not GAD during the COVID-19 pandemic, but not in the population with COVID-19.

"Impact of occupational SARS-CoV-2 risk on the mental distress of non-healthcare employees in Germany : Swaantje Casjens","Background The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic posed major challenges to employees and companies. Differences between industries and professions in occupational SARS-CoV-2 infection risk (OSIR) became apparent early on. This study examines the mental distress in terms of depression and anxiety symptoms of non-healthcare workers during the first and second Corona waves in Germany. Methods We conducted an online survey from December 2020 to June 2021 among employees from industrial enterprises, local public transport, the public and the financial sector. High and potential OSIR was defined based on job information. Depression and anxiety symptoms were rated with the 4-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4). Categorized PHQ-4 scores were modeled with ordinal random-intercept logistic multinomial regression models and presented with odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Results Overall, 516 of 1,545 participants (33.4%) were determined to be at increased OSIR. Anxiety and depression symptoms worsened during the pandemic in all OSIR groups. Risks for more severe depressive and anxiety symptoms were higher among employees with high (OR 2.35;95% CI 1.33-4.16) and potential OSIR (OR 1.70;95% CI 1.19-2.43) compared to employees without OSIR. Severity of mental distress differed also by the extent of perceived job protection, interactions with colleagues, work-privacy conflicts, and overcommitment. Conclusions OSIR had a negative impact on employeeâ€™s depressive symptoms and anxiety. Reducing SARS-CoV-2 exposure through workplace protective measures, strengthening interactions among colleagues, and supporting employees with work-privacy conflicts could help better protect employeesâ€™ mental health. Key messages â€¢ The risk for more severe depressive and anxiety symptoms increases with higher occupational SARS-CoV-2 infection risk. â€¢ Improvements in SARS-CoV-2 exposure at work, colleague interactions, and work-privacy conflicts could help better protect mental health.","Casjens, S.; Taeger, D.; BrÃ¼ning, T.; Behrens, T.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Impact+of+occupational+SARS-CoV-2+risk+on+the+mental+distress+of+non-healthcare+employees+in+Germany+:+Swaantje+Casjens","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; JOUR(Suppl 3), 32.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41589,""
"""Thinking outside the box"": A snapshot of child and adolescent therapists' early experiences adapting services to the COVID-19 context","COVID-19 has had numerous impacts on the general population, including increased physical health risks, social isolation, and prolonged uncertainty (Gruber et al., 2020). Some have argued these impacts disproportionately affect younger populations (Powell et al., 2020). Within Canada, there has been a sharp uprise in children/youth accessing the Kids Help Phone over the past 18 months (Watson, 2020), underscoring the importance of continued access to mental health supports for this population. Child/youth practitioners have faced the arduous task of transitioning their services online, which may be uniquely challenging to accomplish with younger clients. This study employed a mixed-methods concurrent embedded design to explore the experiences of 36 child/youth therapists in Ontario as they have navigated this new professional landscape. An interpretative phenomenological analysis revealed both negative and positive impacts of COVID-19. Therapists reported feelings of reduced self-efficacy, difficulties engaging with and interpreting nonverbal communication using virtual mediums, technological challenges, and personal challenges relative to balancing work/home commitments as primary challenges. Younger clients appeared most significantly impacted due to developmental challenges inherent in online engagement. In response, therapists described creatively adapting their services, relying on team members or others for support and/or consultation, and various self-care strategies. Positively, many therapists felt youth were benefitting from the increased accessibility of virtual services. Despite the challenges identified, a repeated-measures MANOVA revealed no significant changes to therapist self-reported state empathy levels when reflecting on challenging clinical interactions prior to and since the onset of COVID-19. Implications for future research and clinical practice are discussed.

"A needs assessment of Latinx immigrant mothers with a child currently receiving mental health services experiencing the COVID-19 health crisis","Currently, there is minimal research regarding the impact of the current Covid-19 health crisis on Latinx immigrant families. This study explores overall parenting stress and parenting stress directly related to the current Covid-19 health crisis in Latinx immigrant mothers with children currently receiving mental health services. Additionally, it examines how Immigrant Latinx families are being impacted and their needs during the Covid-19 health crisis. Semi-structured interviews were conducted on twenty Latinx immigrant mothers currently experiencing parenting stress and have children currently receiving mental health services. Participant responses were considered using the Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis method. An analysis showed themes such as overall negative impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic, negative impact on mental/emotional health, and overall need during the Covid-19 Pandemic. The findings showed that Latinx immigrant families currently receiving mental health services experienced an overall negative impact on their lives. The principal findings also demonstrated that Latinx immigrant families' mental/ emotional health was negatively impacted and had significantly experienced higher levels of parenting stress. Findings further revealed a need for basic needs, more mental health support/ professional help, and school support to help address areas of impact in the lives of Latinx immigrant families. Clinical implications include providing culturally sensitive care to Latinx immigrant families and a better sense of how the Covid-19 health crisis affected Latinx families, including their overall experiences and needs related to the pandemic that mental health clinicians are serving. Further research is needed to study the experiences of all immigrant Latinx family members, Latinx immigrant families who only have one parent, Latinx immigrant mothers from various Latin American countries, and Latinx immigrant families with diverse acculturation levels and coping practices.

"The consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health and wellbeing of the youth: a systematic review : Mark Bosmans","Introduction The coronavirus outbreak and resulting restrictive measures have a major impact on population health. Research results suggest that the impact on the youth is especially great. In this review of international literature we investigated the impact of the COVID pandemic on the health and wellbeing of the youth, with a special emphasis on identifying vulnerable groups. Methods This review looked at the impact on five domains;physical health, (health)care needs, mental health, social effects and other effects. We also identified protective and risk factors. We searched the databases of Pubmed, PsychInfo and Embase for longitudinal empirical studies in May 2021. Results For all topics together, 145 papers were included. Results show that the corona crisis had a negative impact on the physical and mental health of the youth. Many young people exercised less, ate less healthy and suffered more from depression, anxiety and loneliness. Young people who already had mental or physical health problems were more vulnerable and experienced more negative results of the corona crisis. The crisis worsened existing problems. Other factors that exacerbate problems are poverty and poor family functioning. The impact is the largest for youths with multiple problems. At the same time, young people seem resilient. Many had no or few health problems during the studied period (roughly the first year of the pandemic), or their health problems decreased when restrictions were lifted. Discussion More attention is needed for preventive interventions that prevent health problems, promote health and that support the youth to maintain and build their resilience. Special attention should be paid to vulnerable groups when targeting these interventions.","Bosmans, M.; Marra, E.; Baliatsas, C.; de Vetten-Mc Mahon, M.; DÃ¼ckers, M.","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+consequences+of+the+COVID-19+pandemic+on+the+health+and+wellbeing+of+the+youth:+a+systematic+review+:+Mark+Bosmans","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; JOUR(Suppl 3), 32.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41592,""
"School health promotion during the COVID-19 pandemic: Associations with school leadersâ€™ health literacy : Simona Betschart","Background School leaders are credited with an important role when it comes to school health promotion. During the COVID-19 pandemic, much health-related information was available and had to be interpreted and acted upon by school leaders. Therefore, it is crucial that they have sufficient health literacy as the ability to gain access to, understand and use health-related information. A study in Germany showed that limited health literacy among school principals was associated with low levels of health promotion activities. This paper explores the association between school leadersâ€™ health literacy and school health promotion in Switzerland, addressing the following questions: 1. What is the relationship between health literacy of school leaders and the implementation of school health promotion? 2. Does health literacy explain variance above and beyond other antecedents, such as principals individual mental health and attitudes? Methods The quantitative analysis is based on an online survey conducted among school leaders in the German- and French speaking parts of Switzerland in June 2021 as part of the project â€œCOVID-19 health literacy school principals surveyâ€. The final sample comprised N = 339 school leaders. The data were analyzed using stepwise regression with health literacy, stress, wellbeing and attitudes toward school health promotion as antecedents and COVID-19 related school health promotion as the outcome. Results The results show that health literacy of school principals has played an important role in the implementation of school health promotion during the COVID-19 pandemic. It explains additional variance beyond other antecedents. Conclusions One way to promote implementation of school health promotion is to strengthen the health literacy of school leaders.","Betschart, S.; Sandmeier, A.; Skedsmo, G.","https://www.google.com/search?q=School+health+promotion+during+the+COVID-19+pandemic:+Associations+with+school+leadersâ€™+health+literacy+:+Simona+Betschart","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; JOUR(Suppl 3), 32.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41593,""
"Healthcare services access during the COVID-19 pandemic among older people : Paola Bertuccio","The COVID-19 pandemic strongly impacted older people, not only in terms of clinical outcome but also in care provision. Investigating trends of changes in healthcare services access among older subjects during the pandemic, along with studying potential determinants, is of utmost interest to identify the most at-risk individuals. We used data from LOST in Lombardia, a cross-sectional study conducted on a representative sample of 4,400 older adults (aged 65 or more) in autumn 2020. Data were collected about lifestyles, mental health, and access to healthcare services before and during the pandemic. To investigate potential determinants of changes in healthcare access, we presented prevalence ratios (PRs) estimated through multivariable log-binomial regression models. Twenty-one per cent of the participants increased telephone contacts with general practitioner (GP), 9.6% specialist visits for a fee, while 22.4% decreased GP visits, 7.5% ED access, 6% hospitalisations, 12.3% outpatient visits, 9.1% diagnostic exams. The prevalence of the cancellation or delay of medical appointments by the patient's decision was 23.8%, with higher proportions among men, among individuals aged 75 or over as compared to those aged 65-74, and among individuals with a higher self-reported economic status (p-value&lt;0.05). People with comorbidities more frequently cancelled or postponed visits, reduced ED access or hospitalisations. Moreover, individuals with worsened mental health status showed a higher prevalence to cancel or delay visits and to reduce ED access. The decrease in healthcare provision and consultations could result in mortality and morbidity excess. Our results should inform targeted intervention to bridge the gaps and overcome the health inequalities that the pandemic has deepened. Exploring the underlying reasons and determinants for healthcare avoiding or delaying among the most vulnerable groups is crucial for epidemic preparedness and planning future interventions.","Bertuccio, P.; Vigezzi, G.

"Suicidality among children and adolescents â€œin the COVID-19 eraâ€: a worldwide metanalytic picture : Michela Bersia","Background The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescent suicidality is still controversial. The present systematic review and meta analysis aim to summarise findings from emerging literature about prevalences of the main suicidal outcomes among children and adolescents under 19 years old, and to compare them with the pre-pandemic period. Methods Five databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL and Web of Science) were systematically searched for studies published in English from January 1st, 2020 until November 3rd, 2021, reporting prevalence for suicidal ideation (SI), suicidal behaviors (SB) and suicide (S) in the general population aged &lt;19 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Single-study prevalence data were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. If studies reported prevalence estimates for both pre- and during-pandemic periods, prevalence ratio (PR) comparing the two periods has been computed and pooled. Results Sixteen observational studies were selected: 10 about SI, 9 about SB and 3 about S. During the pandemic, prevalence of SI among adolescents was 21% (95% CI 12-34%) while prevalence of SB was 3% (95% CI 1-10%). Comparing pre- and during- pandemic prevalences, a significant overall increase in SB was observed (PR 1.35;95% CI 1.06-1.72) while the prevalence rates of SI remained substantially steady (PR 0.95;95% CI 0.64-1.39). A narrative review on the population-based data on suicide rates suggested an escalating trend since Summer 2020, after an initial stability of the phenomenon. Conclusions During the COVID-19 pandemic SB showed a 35% increase and suicides rates escalated after a initial stability. School closures might be involved, representing an initial protective factor for suicidality, while after the reopenings we could have assisted to a suicide rebound, especially among the most vulnerable young people. Key messages â€¢ The topic of suicidality among young people is still affected by a cultural stigma that hampers the development of both academic research, early detection and preventive policies. â€¢ The increase in suicidal behaviors among youths after the COVID-19 outbreak highlights a major public health issue that requires adequate supporting policies to control and prevent this phenomenon.","Bersia, M.; Koumantakis, E.; Berchialla, P.; Charrier, L.; Dalmasso, P.; Comoretto, R.

"Temporal trends of suicidality among adolescents in the last decade in Piedmont, Northwestern Italy : Michela Bersia","Background Over the last decade, trends of suicidality among adolescents remain unclear. We conducted a cross-sectional study using surveillance data collected over the past 10 years in the Piedmont region, Italy, to explore temporal trends in suicidality among hospitalized adolescents. Methods This was a retrospective study over an 11-year period of time. The target cohort was adolescents aged 13-19 discharged from inpatient/day-hospital care with at least one suicidality-related ICD9-CM code (i.e., suicidal ideation-SI, suicidal risk-SR and suspected suicide-SS) between 2011 and 2021 in Piedmont (Northwestern Italy). Social-economic related data is available from Census 2011. Yearly incidence rates (IR) were calculated based on the overall hospitalsâ€™ catchment population and by sex. Poisson regression model was estimated to evaluate the trend over time and the association with sex, and a potential effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. A non-linear trend was allowed by modelling natural splines. Results We included 490 adolescents (median age: 15 years, IQR: 13-16), 380 girls and 110 boys, with ICD9-CM codes for SI (264;53.9%), SR (142;29%), SS (90;18.4%) at first discharge. Girls showed a higher risk of repeated inpatient care than boys (19.2% vs 7.3%, p &lt; 0.01). Since 2013, yearly suicidality IRs started increasing linearly in boys (+1.7/100,000 per year, 95%CI: 0.7-2.8). Apparently, suicidality IRs increasing in girls were observed since 2011 (+5.8/100,000 per year, 95%CI 2.8-8.9) and were significantly higher than in boys (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions Suicidality among young inpatients increased in Piedmont during the last decade. Females seemed to be more affected than males. Further research is needed to better understand gender-related risk factors for suicidality. Key messages â€¢ There has been an increase in the number of adolescents reporting suicidal ideation in the last decade, especially in girls. â€¢ Intervention strategies are urgently needed to reverse a potentially alarming trend in suicidality among young people.","Berchialla, P.; Bersia, M.; Koumantakis, E.; Ferracin, E.; Comoretto, R.

"Analyzing protective factors for adolescentsâ€™ mental health during COVID-19 pandemic in Spain: A longitudinal study Analyse des facteurs de protection de la santÃ© mentale des adolescents pendant la pandÃ©mie de COVID-19 en Espagne: Une Ã©tude longitudinale","Objective: This study examined the protective role of self-esteem and perceived emotional intelligence on mental health problems in Spanish adolescents during COVID-19 pandemic. Design: Participants (N = 139;Mage = 13.83 years, SD = 0.96;63.8% female) completed measures before the outbreak of COVID-19 (T1) and during the first wave of the pandemic in Spain (T2). Main outcome measures: Participants self-reported emotional intelligence, self-esteem, mental health problems and suicidal behavior. Results: Adolescent mental health problems were equally affected by COVID-19 pandemic according to gender, age and lockdown conditions. Adolescents with low levels of emotional intelligence and self-esteem at T1 showed a significant decrease in self-reported anxiety, depression, stress and suicidal behavior at T2. However, adolescents with average or high levels of emotional intelligence and self-esteem at T1 showed no significant changes in mental health problems at T2. Self-esteem at T1 meditated the relationships between emotional intelligence at T1 (clarity and repair) and emotional symptoms at T2 (depression, anxiety and stress). Furthermore, the relationship between self-esteem and anxiety symptoms was moderated by the number of people living together during COVID-19 lockdown.

"The integrated GOR-COVID-19 health monitor: annual reporting (â€œlong-cycle monitoringâ€) : Christos Baliatsas","Introduction Because of foreseeable COVID-19- related mental and physical health risks for the general population, a longitudinal health monitor was launched in the Netherlands. The monitoring program includes multiple methods. The current contribution places an emphasis on the so-called â€œlong-cycleâ€ monitoring activities at the national and regional level. The aim is to produce (bi-)annual reports on developments in health status of the general population and several potentially vulnerable subgroups (e.g. psychological and somatic comorbidities, lower socio-economic status). Methods Primary care registrations and questionnaire data were used. Both depend on existing methods of data collection, cover a broad spectrum of health aspects and offer the possibility of pre-COVID-19-comparison. Primary care data were obtained from electronic health records of general practices in the Nivel Primary Care Database. Large-scale survey research with questionnaires was conducted in all the 25 health regions of the Netherlands among 2nd and 4th graders in high schools, adults, elderly and young adults (16-25 years old). Where possible, data were combined with data on socio-economic status and additional health aspects from Statistics Netherlands (CBS). Results The first results from both data sources show that the COVID-19 pandemic undeniably had an effect on the mental health of youth. Compared to 2019, there was a general decrease in overall health and happiness in 2020 and a perceivable increase in social problems as well as health symptoms such as lack of smell and taste. Furthermore, a smaller groups of people experienced more psychological symptoms, serious problems like suicidal thoughts and PTSD symptomatology.

This data contains the distribution of suicidal deaths based on age groups, causes, professions, gender, and residence zones. Results The analysis suggests that individuals aged â€˜15-29 yearsâ€™ were most affected (35.05%) by suicides, followed by those aged â€˜30-44 yearsâ€™ (32.61%). Family problems contribute to the highest burden of suicides among both these age groups. Such deaths can be attributed to personal reasons. Suicides due to dowry disputes are exclusive to women. Also, women report the highest instances of suicides due to marriage-related issues. While suicides due to drug abuse, bankruptcy, unemployment, poverty, and property disputes were mainly reported among males. In 2020, the rise in annual suicide rate was found to be highest among business persons (29.43%), especially tradesmen (49.9%) and vendors (26.11%) against other businesses (12.13%). Other professions which witnessed a steep rise in annual suicide rates in 2020 were agricultural laborers (17.90%) and daily wage earners (15.76%). This increase in suicide rates may be linked to economic reasons post lockdown imposition during the Covid-19 outbreak in 2020. Conclusions Women commit suicide mainly due to marriage-related causes, while men are more vulnerable to suicide due to economic factors. Not all suicides can be traced back to diagnosed mental illnesses. A significant proportion of suicides are attributed to personal, economic, and social problems. The insights generated from this analysis can help identify the vulnerable groups and target the much-needed interventions. Key messages â€¢ Suicide is a multifaceted problem involving various personal, economic, cultural, and social factors, besides medical reasons. â€¢ Multidimensional strategies targeted at vulnerable groups could be potentially effective in curbing suicide rate.","Arif, A.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Distribution+of+Suicides+in+India:+A+Decadal+Data+Analysis+(2011-2020)+:+Areiba+Arif","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; JOUR(Suppl 3), 32.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41599,""
"Stress, anxiety, and depression among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Kosovo : Fatime Arenliu Qosaj","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has created a very large workload burden on health systems worldwide, Kosovo is no exception to this trend. A pandemic may have a negative impact on health care workersâ€™ (HCWs) mental health. In this cross-sectional study, we assessed the self-reported prevalence of stress, anxiety, and depression and identified their predictive factors among HCWs in Kosovo. Methods Data were collected on sociodemographics (sex, age, occupation, education, workplace) and the presence and severity of depression, anxiety, and stress through the 21-item Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) online questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, t-tests, and linear logistic regression were used to analyze the data. Results Of the 545 respondents, the majority were male (53.0%), under 60 years of age (94.7%), and married (81.7%). Most of them were physicians (78.2%), while the remaining respondents were nurses, midwives, and other health professionals (22%). The prevalence rates for moderate to extremely high levels of stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms were 21.9%, 13.0%, and 13.9%, respectively. Nurses reported significantly higher mean scores for depression and anxiety than physicians (P &lt; 0.05). Being married, having poor health, not exercising, and reporting â€˜burnoutâ€™ from work significantly predicted higher levels of depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms among health workers (P &lt; 0.05). Conclusions HCWs require specific national mental health intervention programs that will, among other effects, help raise awareness of the early recognition of symptoms related to stress, anxiety, depression, and burnout due to workload as well as the importance of regular physical exercise. These programs should be part of the national emergency preparedness, emergency response, and health sector strategy, aiming to build and sustain a resilient health system. Key messages â€¢ During COVID-19 pandemic, certain factors predicted higher levels of mental health burden among HCWs. â€¢ Addressing these factors require policy recommendations with concrete systemic interventions.","Arenliu Qosaj, F.; Merrill Weine, S.; Sejdiu, P.; Hasani, F.; Statovci, S.; Behluli, V.; Arenliu, A.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Stress,+anxiety,+and+depression+among+healthcare+workers+during+the+COVID-19+pandemic+in+Kosovo+:+Fatime+Arenliu+Qosaj","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; JOUR(Suppl 3), 32.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41600,""
"Are we socially equally at risk of smoking during the COVID-19 pandemic? French data from 2009-2021 : Astrid Juhl Andersen","Background Since 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has greatly affected people including a significant increase in mental health difficulties. Cigarette smoking is found to be strongly associated with mental health conditions, which is why the pandemic might have influenced the secular decline in smoking rates observed over recent years. Persons belonging to socioeconomically disadvantaged groups may be particularly affected, both because the pandemic is found to exacerbate existing social inequalities and because this group was more likely to smoke before the pandemic. We examined the prevalence of smoking in a French cohort study, focusing on differences between educational attainment. In addition, we examined the association between educational level and interpersonal changes in tobacco consumption from 2018 to 2021. Methods The TEMPO cohort study included 1785 French adults followed between 1991 and 2021. With four assessments of smoking status available before and two after the onset of COVID-19, we estimated the smoking prevalence over time stratified by highest obtained diploma. We studied interpersonal change in smoking status between 2018 and 2021 among 148 smokers, using multinomial logistic regression. Results The prevalence of smokers was higher among those with low educational attainment compared with those with higher diploma at all timepoints. The difference between the two groups increased from 2020 to 2021 (4.8% to 9.4%). Smokers with high educational level were more likely to decrease their tobacco consumption from 2018-2021 compared to low educated smokers (aOR=2.72 [1.26;5.89]). Conclusions Current findings showed a widening of the socioeconomic gap over time in smoking rates, which emphasizes the vulnerability of persons with low educational attainment to smoking, also during the pandemic. Key messages â€¢ The existing gap in smoking prevalence between lower and higher diploma groups has increased from 2020 to 2021, which may be a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. â€¢ From 2018 to 2021, people with high school as highest qualification were less likely to decrease their tobacco use compared to higher educated people.","Andersen, A.

"It never rains but it pours: COVID-19 pandemic impact on mental health in older adults : Andrea Amerio","Italy was the first country to be hit by the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Europe holding one of the highest clinical burdens. Older adults are those paying the highest price for the COVID-19 emergency. Within the Lost in Lombardy project, a web-based cross-sectional study assessing the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms, hopelessness and insomnia before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, was conducted on a representative sample of 4,400 older adults aged 65 years or more from the Lombardy region recruited between November 17th and 30th 2020. The prevalence of depressive symptoms increased by + 112% during the pandemic, anxiety symptoms by + 136%, insufficient sleep by + 12%, unsatisfactory sleep by + 15%. Feelings of hopelessness were more frequent among women compared to men (15.1% vs. 10.4%) and increased with increasing age. A worsening in each of the four specific mental health outcomes was more frequently observed in women (OR = 1.50, depression;OR = 1.31, anxiety;OR = 1.57, sleep quality;OR = 1.38, sleep quantity), in subjects who decreased their physical activity during the pandemic (OR = 1.64, depression;OR = 1.48, anxiety;OR = 2.05, sleep quality;OR = 1.28, sleep quantity), and with increasing number of pre-existing chronic diseases (p for trend&lt;0.001 for depression and anxiety;p for trend=0.010 for sleep quality;p for trend=0.012 for sleep quantity). A worsening in depressive symptoms was more frequently observed in more educated subjects (p for trend=0.008), while a worsening in anxiety symptoms in subjects living in main towns compared to outskirt with an economic status below the mean. The use of at least one psychotropic drug - mostly antidepressants/anxiolytics - increased by + 26% compared to pre-pandemic.

"Integrating mental health into emergency preparedness and response: lessons learned from Covid-19 : Muhammad Alkasaby","Introduction The COVID-19 crisis has disrupted health systems all over the world. In a survey by the WHO, 93% of the countries reported disruption in their mental health services. This research assessed the extent to which mental health was included in the national response to the COVID-19 pandemic in African countries. It also explored barriers and enablers to mental health integration into the COVID-19 response. Lessons learned from COVID-19 can help improve the response to future public health emergencies. Methods A web-based survey was sent to mental health focal points in 55 African countries. The survey assessed the perceived degree of implementation of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) â€œ14 Globally Recommended Activitiesâ€ for mental health response to COVID-19. This was followed by in-depth interviews to explore barriers and enablers to mental health integration into the COVID-19 response. Results Responses were received from 28 countries. Lack of political will, poor funding, limited human resources, and weak pre-existing mental health systems were the key challenges in addressing mental health needs during COVID-19. Participants highlighted the need to capitalize on the increased attention to mental health during COVID-19 to support its integration into the emergency preparedness and response plans and strengthen health systems in the longer term. They have also stressed the importance of sustaining and strengthening the new partnerships and service delivery models that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions The number of recommended mental health activities implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic varied considerably across African countries. Several factors limit mental health integration into emergency response. However, there are signs of optimism, as mental health gained some attention during COVID-19, which can be built on to integrate mental health into emergency response and strengthen health systems in the long term. Key messages â€¢ Capitalize on the increased attention to mental health during COVID-19 to support its integration into the emergency preparedness and response plans and strengthen health systems in the long term. â€¢ Sustain and strengthen the new partnerships and service delivery models that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Alkasaby, M.

"Maternal respectful care and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder among postpartum mothers in Israel : Sirat Abu-Hamad","Background Maternal Respectful Care (MRC) approach was recommended by the WHO for improving maternal birth experience and mental health. We examined the association between MRC and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) among postpartum women. Methods A cross-sectional study took place between November 2020 and October 2021. 817 postpartum women (Jewish- 444 Arab-373) were interviewed via Zoom due to Covid-19 limitations. MRC was measured by 26 statements from disrespectful/ abusive care during childbirth in facilities (DACF);4 statements from the Mother on Respect questionnaire (MOR-feeling mistreatment based on ethno-national background, level of command of the Hebrew language and disagreement with the staff);and 4 statements regarding abuse of the NorVold Abuse Questionnaire (NorAQ). PTSD was measured by Solomon et al.'s tool, and dichotomized into 12 score cutoff. (Yes /No PTSD). Results PTSD prevalence was 14.3%, significantly higher among Palestinian-Arab compared to Jewish women (22.0%,7.9%, respectively), and it was higher in women who had lower MRC scores: did not receive postpartum education (19.9%,11.9 % respectively) received;received midwife support 11.7%,18.4% didn't receive;reported racism 26.1%,11.4% not;Felt humiliated at healthcare services vs. not (16.8% , 10.6%, respectively);women who reported mistreatment based on national/cultural background, compared to others (MOR) (36.6%,13.1%, respectively). In the multivariate analysis after adjusting to different independent variables, Palestinian-Arab women were 6.04 times at risk for PTSD (OR = 6.04,95% CI = 3.38-10.78),Women who reported racism are 2.14 times more likely to PTSD (OR = 2.14, 95% CI = 1.30-3.54). Women who reported feeling humiliated visiting the health care system are 2.08 times more likely to PTSD (OR = 2.08,95% CI = 1.23-3.52). Conclusions MRC is an important factor for maternal PTSD among postpartum women and it should be considered specifically among minority women. Key messages MRC can contribute to quality care, improving birthing mothers experience and reducing negative health outcomes such as PTSD, and it should be improved for women. The health care services need to run a program to overcome racism and reduce unrespectful care for postpartum women.","Abu-Hamad, S.; Daoud, N.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Maternal+respectful+care+and+Post-Traumatic+Stress+Disorder+among+postpartum+mothers+in+Israel+:+Sirat+Abu-Hamad","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; JOUR(Suppl 3), 32.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41604,""
"Social inequality and change in psychological distress during the Covid-19 pandemic in Norway : Bodil Elisabeth Valstad Aasan","Background Emerging research findings suggest that the Covid-19 pandemic may have affected various social groups differently. Using follow-up health data from Norway, the aim of this study was to investigate whether change in psychological distress in adolescents during the Covid-19 pandemic differed across socioeconomic position (SEP). Methods Data consisted of 1254 Norwegian adolescents who participated in Young-HUNT4 (2017-19) and Young-HUNT COVID (spring 2021). Psychological distress (PD) was assessed by the Symptom Checklist-10, using a cut-off point of = 1.85 to identify adolescents with high PD. Based on the adolescents PD score prior to and during the Covid-19 pandemic, four groups were identified: persistent low PD, improved PD, worsened PD, and persistent high PD. Adolescents reported their parentsâ€™ education level which was used as an indicator for SEP. SEP was dichotomized separating low and high SEP, where having at least one parent with a higher education was defined as high SEP. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to investigate if the likelihood of the outcome groups varied across SEP, adjusted for age and sex. Results Compared to the persistent low PD group, no statistically significant difference was found between low and high SEP in the improved PD and worsened PD group (RR 1.33 95% CI 0.77 - 2.31, RR 1.22 95% CI 0.82 - 1.81, respectively). However, adolescents of low SEP had a higher likelihood to be in the persistent high PD group compared with the high SEP group (RR 1.93 95% CI 1.30 - 2.87). Conclusions These preliminary findings suggest that the pandemic may not have led to greater social inequality in mental health among Norwegian adolescents. However, the results showed that social inequality that existed prior to the pandemic has persisted, as adolescents of lower SEP had a higher likelihood of reporting high PD that persisted from prior to and throughout the Covid-19 pandemic. Key messages â€¢ Social inequality in psychological distress among Norwegian adolescents has persisted prior to and during the Covid-19 pandemic. â€¢ The Covid-19 pandemic does not seem to have increased existing social inequalities in psychological distress among Norwegian adolescents.","Aasan, B.

"Mental health promotion is key to making a change for children and adolescents","The Covid-19 pandemic highlighted the already high burden in children and adolescents and has caused an increasing mental health burden in this age group. While provision of treatment is highly relevant, this alone is unlikely to make a significant difference in reducing the burden of poor mental health and mental illness. It is elemental to promote and strengthen mental health, also knowing this will not be the last crisis to tackle. Alongside of low threshold support and prevention, health promotion can strengthen individualsâ€™ resilience or coping mechanisms. Next to individual and target group interventions, health promotion interventions also follow a setting approach, according to which people are understood as part of the social systems in which they live and spend their time. This workshop is about mental health promotion in youth. We wish to point to the importance of health promotion in the overall aim to improve mental health. The first presentation will provide an overview of mental health promotion concepts and mechanisms, providing evidence-based arguments and examples. The second presentation focusses on the ABC-framework to develop and implement MHP initiatives developed by the WHO. The last two presentations address the setting-approach, school and family and their potential in mental health promotion. In the concluding discussion with workshop participants, we will address questions, experiences, and best practices in mental health. The aim of this workshop is three-fold: 1. Provide the back-drop and a theoretical & practical basis on mental health promotion. 2. Present both individual and setting-specific examples of mental health promotion. 3. Provide room for discussion on experience and best practice in mental health promotion in youth. Key messages â€¢ Mental health promotion is an important element in reducing mental health burden in children and adolescents. â€¢ Health promotion can effectively be implemented on an individual and structural level.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Mental+health+promotion+is+key+to+making+a+change+for+children+and+adolescents","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; JOUR(Suppl 3), 32.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41606,""
"A motivated, healthy and high-performing workforce: Innovation in health workforce research in Europe","Background Hospitals and their health care staff were severely impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. Many health professionals faced high levels of stress and burn-out due to unfavorable work environments, limited staffing and highly pressured workloads. Yet, even prior to the pandemic, health professionals in many countries faced challenging work environments with often limited resources and support. At the same time, the roles of health professionals are changing across Europe, with new roles, task-shifting and sharing happening in teams, also driven by the Covid-19 pandemic. From a health system and management perspective, recruitment and retention is critical to ensure that there is a sufficient and well-educated health workforce capable to perform high-quality care. Multiple innovations have been implemented across Europe, these will be presented and discussed with a view towards evaluating complex interventions, sustaining innovations, ensuring the scalability and transferability of proven interventions for the benefit of health professionals and wider society. Objectives This workshop will address innovative strategies at the micro (team level), meso (healthcare setting) and macro level (policy) to ensure that health professionals are motivated, perform high-quality care in teams and are sufficiently supported by enabling work environments and recruitment and retention policies. Innovations to improve work environments, task-shifting as well as recruitment and retention will be discussed, based on the findings from four EU-funded research projects: Magnet4Europe, H-Work, TASHI and METEOR. The format is a â€˜round tableâ€™ with 5 panel discussants. The Magnet4Europe project focuses on the reorganization of hospital work environments for nurses and physicians in hospitals in five European countries. Innovative elements include a system-, inter-professional, organization-wide change management, structural empowerment of clinical staff and one-on-one twinning of European hospitals with U.S. twinning partners. Innovations in the EU projects The H- WORK project aims to design, implement and validate psychosocial interventions to promote mental health and well-being in SMEs and the public sector. Innovative elements are the evaluation of interventions at multiple levels (individual, team, manager and organisational level) and the development of the H-Work innovation platform with toolkits, policy briefs and novel digital solutions. The TaSHI project provides a novel and up-to-date knowledge on task shifting and transferability of good practices in implementation. Through a cross-national and -sectoral perspective, the focus is on task shifting as an innovation towards more effective organisation of care and workforce, to improve efficient and sustainable systems. METEOR aims to enhance scientific knowledge on the predictors of job retention for healthcare workers and develops evidence-based policy recommendations through stakeholder engagement and co-creation workshops. Key messages â€¢ Innovations to improve work environments include system-wide, integrated approaches spanning individual, team, management and organisational levels. â€¢ Elements of effective implementation of innovations are effective leadership at highest level, empowerment, evidence-informed action and tailored strategies on recruitment and retention of staff.

"New challenges for suicide prevention in the context of Covid-19","The recent COVID-19 pandemic confronted many societies with profound public health challenges. Although primarily a â€˜somaticâ€™ health concern, it becomes clear that Covid-19 and its aftermath also proved to have a substantial impact on mental health and wellbeing of the population in general and on vulnerable subgroups, such as young people and the elderly, in particular. An important public mental health concern in this context is the possible adverse influence of this pandemic on suicidality. Recent studies show that during the outbreak of the coronavirus disease the suicide mortality did not rise, rather on the contrary. However, the impact of the increased number of people with mental distress related to Covid-19 on suicidal ideation as well as the long-term impact on suicide rates is unclear. Also the long-term impact of the Covid-19 restriction measures greatly hindering adequate mental healthcare services and suicide prevention initiatives is uncertain. This workshop will focus on suicidality trends since the pandemic onset in different countries, suicide figures, experiences in the field of suicide prevention and on attitudes towards seeking help. Ann John from UK will talk about suicide trends during Covid-19 pandemic and will present suicide data of 35 countries collected by the international Covid-19 Suicide Prevention Research Collaboration. Fabrice Jollant will present data about the impact of Covid-19 pandemic on suicide attempts in France, and will discuss in this context the new national suicide prevention strategy. John Cachia will show the importance of a broad mental public health approach to suicide prevention in Malta. And finally, Saska Roskar from Slovenia will show how prevention of suicidality in individuals working themselves in the field of mental health can be hindered by self-stigma. Key messages â€¢ We must remain vigilant about the possible long-term mental health impact (including suicidal behavior) of the Covid-19 pandemic. â€¢ Pandemics like Covid-19 highlight certain weaknesses in suicide prevention strategies.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=New+challenges+for+suicide+prevention+in+the+context+of+Covid-19","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; JOUR(Suppl 3), 32.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41608,""
"Older adultsâ€™ resilience and vulnerability to COVID-19: 2-years results of multicentric LOST project","COVID-19 pandemic and consequent mitigation and containment measures greatly impacted people's daily life. Older adults, especially those with chronic conditions, have paid the highest price for the emergency. Indeed, they are the most at-risk of severe and deadly forms of COVID-19;they deal with unmet healthcare needs because of considerable pressure on healthcare systems;they are at higher risk of worsening lifestyles, mental and socioeconomic status. In this context, we designed and are currently conducting the multi-partner project LOckdown and lifeSTyles in Lombardia (LOST in Lombardia), funded by AXA and Lombardy region. We will present the design and outputs of a telephone-based cross-sectional study conducted in the fall of 2020 on a representative sample of adults aged more than 65 years living in Lombardy. Researchers from the University of Pavia, Mario Negri Institute of Pharmacological Research, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Insubria University, University of Genoa, Bocconi University, Health Protection Agency of Bergamo and Brianza are involved. This project aims to evaluate the COVID-19 pandemic impact and nationwide stay-at-home order on a wide range of behavioural and health-related outcomes among the older population and provide useful evidence to plan, implement, and evaluate targeted prevention programmes and welfare policies facing pandemic consequences. The workshop will be structured as follows: We will first set the scene by focusing on the determinants of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the older adult population. The second panellist will discuss changes in healthcare services use and delivery during the pandemic. Sociodemographic, physical and mental health-related determinantsâ€™ roles will be thoroughly analysed. Data on the access to hospital in older adults with chronic conditions from two local health Units from the Lombardy region, Italy during the first wave of the pandemic wee also presented. We will then provide two original contributions about lifestyle changes. In the first one, we will present data exploring how Mediterranean diet adherence has changed. A Mediterranean COVID-19 Pandemic Score was computing by scoring modifications in the consumption of nine food groups and five diet-related behaviours, and predictors of favourable changes will be debated. The fifth panellist will open up about the mental health burden. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, insomnia and hopelessness before and during the COVID-19 lockdown will be assessed, identifying subgroups at higher risk of mental distress due to pandemic-associated restrictions. In the end, we will engage in a fruitful discussion with the audience on the data presented and practical public health implications, exploring how they can inform critical policy debates addressing health system resilience and health inequalities at the European and global levels. Key messages â€¢ Public health management of older people and chronic patients represents a major challenge within and beyond pandemic times, as they have been disproportionally impacted by COVID-19. â€¢ Evidence-based recommendations are needed for the post-pandemic phase, and the results on successes and failures from one of the worst-affected regions provide guidance for the rest of Europe.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Older+adultsâ€™+resilience+and+vulnerability+to+COVID-19:+2-years+results+of+multicentric+LOST+project","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; JOUR(Suppl 3), 32.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41609,""
"An innovative model for chronic pain management at the Evelina","Introduction/Background Chronic pain is persistent pain lasting more than three months, impacting many aspects of a personâ€™s life. 20-30% of UK adolescents experience chronic pain (although studies vary greatly). The previous pathway through our service was unclear, which meant young people were not accessing all available resources or being seen promptly. We aimed to create a model that optimised available resources, including local networks and ensured equitable access to our service across the region. We wanted to target critical barriers such as mental health, school attendance and sleep, and delivering asset-based care. Description/Method We followed the â€œplan, do, study, actâ€ PDSA cycle for this quality improvement project (QIP). The initial evaluation involved multidisciplinary team (MDT) meetings, site visits, and the MDT experience using other models of care. Patient cases were reviewed for weaknesses in existing models. Discussions highlighted the need to match resources to needs instead of a â€œone-size-fits-allâ€ approach. Changes include creating our own â€œmodelâ€ for Chronic Pain, introducing a specialist physiotherapy Triage Clinic to the pathway, converting our Pain Education Workshop (PEW) to virtual and utilising local resources by expanding our network. PEW seeks to empower patients and families to understand their pain. It is also offered to local healthcare professionals to increase confidence in supporting patients. We adapted the Thrive Mental Health Model to create a Triaged Model for Chronic Pain. We needed to streamline the service, as some patients became lost within the original pathway, not attending PEW and being on long waiting lists. We needed to manage difficulties faced with an increased patient cohort and case complexity, including mental health. Feedback demonstrated some patients found it difficult coming to MDT appointments without knowing who would be present. Triage Clinic helped to mitigate this. Young people with a lower level of need can be assessed virtually, have symptoms validated, receive advice and be discharged to appropriate care. Those with pain not managed by this reassurance are assessed within our service including, One-Stop-Shop, Adolescent Clinic for Rheumatology patients and Biomechanical clinic. Those requiring more support are referred to the MDT for intervention and education for serial day-case rehabilitation or more intensive intervention (PRIME). Ongoing challenges, such as severe mental health difficulties, mean some may not be ready to access support. We liaise with local services such as CAMHS, and patients may be reintroduced to the team later if appropriate. Discussion/Results Our model showed improved outcomes compared to our previous service. We looked at data from 2018-2019 and 2021, removing the years involving the initial waves of the pandemic as the service adapted to the changes this brought. The physiotherapy Triage Clinic utilised our new Triage Model for the service. Following this we can discharge a portion of our patients to other services, some remain under the physiotherapy team, and the majority are seen in the Chronic Pain MDT clinic. It has been an opportunity, on initial consultation, to engage YP and their families and validate their pain. 22% of our patients had full school attendance on their initial review by our team. The average was a 59% attendance. There was an increase in 83% of those with initially reduced attendance following intervention with the chronic pain team. On average, attendance went from 44% to 71%. We saw a rise in the number of local services involved with young people under our care. Other services involved safeguarding teams, allied healthcare professionals and CAMHS teams. In 2018 on average, 1.4 services were involved;this increased to 1.8 in 2019 and 2.4 in 2021. This may be due to increased complexity of the cases we see or due to more local support requirements. Our plans following the MDT clinic increasingly show more specific goals and activities of dai y living targets year on year, from 53% in 2018 to 80% having this as part of their plan in 2021. There have been regional development over the past three years of the service. We now have over 100 staff, including 43 local physiotherapists working collaboratively with our team in supporting the young people and their parents in our care. The Evelina team aims to lead regional meetings and communities of practice. Key learning points/Conclusion With the limited available resources, our team is continuing to work towards managing a complex cohort of patients successfully. We were shortlisted for a British Society of Rheumatology Award for Best Practice following the changes made within our department. This QIP and our new model can be adapted to many other specialities and teams. Changes we have made are especially relevant following the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic and continued pressure with reduced resources and increased demand. The virtual PEW allows for increased access for young people that previously struggled to attend face-to-face workshops in a timely fashion. The young people and their families benefit from improving their understanding of their pain and learning new strategies to manage it. Some patients find the virtual setting more practical as they miss less school and do not have to pay for costly transport to attend. Others miss the face-to-face interaction with peers who have similar difficulties. Both individual peer support and expert patients are areas we would like to explore as a service allowing the ripple effect of our model to continue. While improving the efficiency of some aspects of our service, we know that a further challenge is managing other â€˜bottle necksâ€™ created. From this conference, we hope our new model will be critically appraised and answer questions from our peers in other services. We look forward to learning from the experience of our colleagues who also work with this often complex cohort of patients.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=An+innovative+model+for+chronic+pain+management+at+the+Evelina","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Rheumatology advances in practice; JOUR(Suppl 1), 6.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41610,""
"Lessons from the response to COVID-19 to inform strengthening of Essential Public Health Functions","Internationally, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased disease burden and mortality, impacted mental health and wellbeing and delayed diagnosis and treatment of non-COVID care. It has been argued that, had sufficient funding of Public Health, including pandemic preparedness, been in place historically, many shortcomings of the pandemic response could have been mitigated. Thus, strengthening Public Health systems is on the agenda of governments internationally. Areas of specific interest are, emergency preparedness, international cooperation and solidarity, promoting vaccination uptake, health equity and community engagement, health literacy and misinformation (particularly online), planning for future workforce requirements and harnessing digitalization in health to address communicable and non-communicable disease threats. The Essential Public Health Functions (EPHFs) provide a comprehensive, cost effective and operational approach to strengthening Public Health and are recognized by the WHO as key to building health system resilience. In a recent report, the WHO has proposed an approach to operationalizing the EPHFs, identifying key enablers that can be applied within specific country contexts. This workshop will describe the national and international research undertaken by the Irish Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) and the WHO at the request of the Department of Health to inform reform of the delivery model of Public Health in Ireland. HIQA and WHO will present the evidence base in terms of the value of EPHFs for health system strengthening, the findings of research to describe changes in Public Health structures and lessons learned in Ireland and across 12 countries during the COVID-19 pandemic, a description of the current state of delivery of the EPHFs within Ireland, and the results of a consultation survey distributed by the Department of Health in Ireland, investigating the experiences of organisations involved in the delivery of Public Health in light of the pandemic. The presenters will allow ample time for audience engagement and discussion with the expert panel to enable shared learning and to discuss the applicability of these findings to the reform and strengthening of the delivery of the EPHFs. The workshop objectives are to: â€¢ Describe the current evidence base in terms of the value of EPHFs for health system strengthening and the key enablers to support their application at country level. â€¢ Describe the recent changes and lessons learned regarding the delivery of the EPHFs during the COVID-19 pandemic in 12 countries. â€¢ Describe the delivery of the EPHFs in the Irish system in light of experience with COVID-19 and with awareness of current and future health system stressors. â€¢ Describe Public Health organisationsâ€™ experiences of delivering the EPHFs in Ireland in light of the pandemic. â€¢ Provide insights into how the delivery of the EPHFs could be reformed and strengthened for the future. Key messages â€¢ Lessons from the Public Health response to COVID-19, internationally and in Ireland will be discussed. â€¢ The workshop will provide a space to share ideas on reform and strengthening EPHF delivery.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Lessons+from+the+response+to+COVID-19+to+inform+strengthening+of+Essential+Public+Health+Functions","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; JOUR(Suppl 3), 32.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41611,""
"LONELINESS AMONGST OLDER INPATIENTS IN THE CONTEXT OF COVID-RELATED VISITING RESTRICTIONS","Background Loneliness can affect people at all stages of life, but appears to be more closely linked to adverse health outcomes such as quality of life and healthcare use amongst older people. There are concerns that restrictions on hospital visits due to infection control policies related to the COVID-19 pandemic may exacerbate loneliness amongst older inpatients. The aim of this study is to quantify the burden of loneliness amongst older inpatients on a specialist geriatric medicine unit. Methods The study site is a large urban university teaching hospital with a 150-bed specialist geriatric medicine unit, comprising acute medical, rehabilitation and long-stay wards. The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Scale was used to measure symptoms of loneliness with scores=43 indicating high levels of loneliness. Results Over 84% of patients were lonely at some time while in hospital, with over one-third (24/76) reporting high levels of loneliness. The mean number of days since last visit from a relative or friend for patients reporting high degrees of loneliness was 11.4 (1.2 â€“ 21.6) days, compared to 5.2 (3.2 â€“ 7.1) days for those with reporting lower levels or no loneliness, though confidence intervals overlapped (p = 0.108). Similarly, patients with higher levels of loneliness had a longer length of stay (68.2 (49.4 â€“ 87.1) compared to 47.9 (33.1 â€“ 62.6) but again findings did not reach significance (p = 0.098). Linear regression models, controlling for competing covariates, found that depressive symptoms, were independently associated with burden of loneliness with a ÃŸ-Coefficient = 10.69 (5.00 â€“ 16.39). Conclusion Loneliness is particularly prevalent amongst older inpatients, with a trend towards higher levels of loneliness in those with less frequent visits. Interventions to help older people stay in touch with family and friends, and maintain social connectedness while in hospital, allowing for COVID-related restrictions, would be welcome, particularly for those with longer lengths of stay.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=LONELINESS+AMONGST+OLDER+INPATIENTS+IN+THE+CONTEXT+OF+COVID-RELATED+VISITING+RESTRICTIONS","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Age and ageing; JOUR(Suppl 3), 51.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41612,""
"Showcasing PHIRI use case results measuring the impact of COVID-19 on population health","The COVID-19 pandemic has clearly demonstrated the urgent need for a cross-border and structured European mechanism to exchange, organise and access reliable health information between countries, especially in the area of population health. Population health information, defined by data on health status, health determinants and healthcare systems performance, allows for oriented research to increase the knowledge base in Europe and underpin political decision-making. Its exchange requires timely and topical provision of high-quality health information. There are many indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic that affect health through various pathways including secondary consequences on health and wellbeing due to delayed prevention, diagnosis and medical treatment. Within the Population Health Information Research Infrastructure (PHIRI) we look at four use cases measuring the impact of COVID-19 on population health and demonstrating how a broad variety of routine data can be pooled and/or used for secondary analysis in a distributed way across Europe aiming to facilitate research by making scalable, reproducible methods available. These use cases represent pilot activities for the benefits and added value of an infrastructure supporting federated analysis by bringing together data from different European countries and feeding the results into the federated research infrastructure. In over 20 data hubs, data is mobilised and ready to be analysed in a distributed manner. The use case outputs will be processed in an interoperable way by formalising data models, data management processes and analytical pipelines, all of which are part of the client-server PHIRI federated infrastructure implemented as here 10.5281/zenodo.6483177. The workshop aims to ensure a better understanding of COVID-19 impacts in specific subgroups and risk settings by conducting research through real-life use cases of immediate relevance. The FAIRified use cases analysis results focusing on comparisons between countries are presented and provide actionable outcomes to guide policy makers in preparedness and response scenarios. Knowledge and expertise developed across Europe is shared in this workshop. The four presentations will focus on selected aspects of COVID-19 impacts on population health. The first presentation will be on direct and indirect determinants of COVID-19 infection and outcomes in vulnerable population groups with reference to inequalities. This will be followed by a contribution of COVID-19 related delayed care in breast cancer patients. The third presentation looks at the impacts of COVID-19 on perinatal health inequalities followed by the fourth on insights in COVID-19 related changes in population mental health. Exchange with the audience will facilitate knowledge and opinion exchange through an interactive Mentimeter poll during the session. Key messages â€¢ The results will support the exchange of knowledge and expertise by facilitating insights in the impacts of COVID-19 in specific subgroups and risk settings compared across European countries. â€¢ Actionable outcomes to guide political decision-making in preparedness and response scenarios will be provided.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Showcasing+PHIRI+use+case+results+measuring+the+impact+of+COVID-19+on+population+health","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; JOUR(Suppl 3), 32.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41613,""
"Urban design interventions for fostering mental health and mental health literacy","With roughly half of the global population living in cities and an expected rise up to 85 % by 2050, urban environments are central to public health. Yet, they are often perceived as health risk factors due to e.g., noise, pollution, crowding, and anonymity. Indeed, mental disorders show higher incidence in urban contexts compared to rural areas, generally increasing, e.g., due to the Covid19-pandemic as well as to climate change. However, we argue that there is also a rich potential of urban environments to act as resource for mental health and to address mental health issues in the public space. Design interventions such as urban furniture, art and information elements can act as perceived affordances, signifiers and situative stimuli to influence health behaviour, social discourse and individual mindsets regarding mental health. Furthermore, by considering their unique potentials and resources during the design process, the specific surroundings of these interventions can become an integral part of the actual design. As a result, this might change citizensâ€™ perspective on the urban setting as such. While there exists a large body of literature as well as case studies focusing on physical health promotion by urban design interventions, evidence regarding its mental correlate is still scarce. This workshop aims at collecting and elaborating on features in the urban space as potential resources to foster mental health as well as mental health literacy. To that aim, first, three seven-minutes-presentations introduce different disciplinary perspectives on the topic: Starting from a psychological point of view, the relationship between urban environments and mental health will be outlined. Based on insights from human geography, social determinants of urban settings will be elaborated and participatory approaches will be presented as a crucial method for designing effective intervention. Synthesizing these insights, the role of design to influence health behaviour will be discussed and afterwards illustrated using the example of a trail-based design concept as the backdrop for the interactive part. In the second part of this session, first, co-creation methods (such as mindmapping and brainwriting) will be applied together with participants to brainstorm relevant categories, features and potentials of the urban space to foster mental health and mental health literacy. Participants will then be asked to contribute their expertise from their specific field of work particularly with regards to increasing mental health literacy in citizens. This exercise will be highly valuable for participants to acquire interdisciplinary knowledge regarding the influence of urban design interventions and mental health and broaden their perspective and knowledge regarding urban mental health and the built environment. Learnings and variations of this exercise could be also applicable in other settings such as rural communities or semi-public spaces. Key messages â€¢ This workshop aims at understanding how features of the urban space can be utilised to foster mental health and mental health literacy. â€¢ By co-creatively sharing and elaborating on insights from various disciplines, participants broaden their horizons regarding the interrelations between the urban built environment and mental health.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Urban+design+interventions+for+fostering+mental+health+and+mental+health+literacy","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; JOUR(Suppl 3), 32.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41614,""
"Urban Green Spaces, Built Environment and Urban - Mental - Environmental Health outcomes","Environmental sustainability, especially in an era of growth health inequality, is one of the most important challenges facing Public Health systems around the World. Environmental sustainability is responsibly interacting with the planet to maintain natural resources and not jeopardize the ability for future generations to meet their needs. The SDGs put environmental sustainability at the center of sustainable development. Environmental Health is the branch of Public Health concerning all aspects of the natural and built environment affecting human health. It is targeted towards preventing disease and creating health-supportive environments. It encompasses the assessment and control of those environmental factors that can potentially affect health, such as pollution, poverty and inadequate energy solutions. Urban Health is an intersectoral arena that links both the public health and the urban planning sectors, mainly captured by SDG3 (including Mental health) and SDG11. Both during the first waves of the Covid-19 pandemic period and in contemporary cities, urban environments were stressed;the resilience of our cities were tested, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of the urban contexts, not always capable to pro-mote and protect the population health status. Urban Green Spaces (UGS) have proved essential role as â€œtoolsâ€ to improve Urban Public and Mental Health. Unfortunately, the heterogeneous distribution of UGS inside the contemporary cities, together with the disparity in quality of such spaces, led to some exclusion phenomena. Evidence/experience-based research strongly demonstrated the positive effects on Public Health of the UGS, and for this reason, they are now becoming the strategic and challenging issue of many urban regeneration programs. The importance of UGS as a key infrastructure has generated the necessity of developing new health-centered design criteria able to conform to their new role in urban environments. The augmentation of UGS surface alone, does not necessarily make cities more livable. An increase in area and surfaces does not translate in ease of accessibility from all social groups or from all the citiesâ€™ neighborhoods, or not does it give data on the qualities of such areas, like potential for social engagement or Physical Activity. Aim of the Workshop - organized by the three EUPHA Section URB+MEN+ENV - it would like to be to build the capacity and knowledge between participants about the main topics and urban features capable to have relevant Urban Public, Mental and Environmental Health outcomes. Additional scope is to collected case studies and research experiences considered virtuous at the international level, analyzed in detail to highlight the main urban and architectural features of those healthy experiences and the related health outcomes, such as sedentary lifestyle reduction, increase of the attractiveness of places, reduction of air and noise pollution. Key messages â€¢ Promotion of healthy places - with particular reference to the green spaces - that enhance the experience and Mental Health needs to be part of green and inclusive recovery at all levels. â€¢ Policy Makers, Public Health experts, civil societies & citizens are driving forces to implement the development equation, allowing cities to become greener, inclusive, safer, resilient & sustainable.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Urban+Green+Spaces,+Built+Environment+and+Urban+-+Mental+-+Environmental+Health+outcomes","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; JOUR(Suppl 3), 32.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41615,""
"School health during the COVID-19 Pandemic Perspectives from the COVID-HL school principal study","The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with far-reaching challenges for the educational system, which impact the health of all involved in the school context, making it a critical public health topic. Consequences include school-closures, a switch from face-to-face classroom learning to homeschooling via online learning, resulting in uncertainty, stress and an increased risk of reinforcing already existing inequalities. Since the pandemic started, some research has been conducted in child and adolescent populations. However, there is very limited research available exploring the effects of the pandemic on school principals, who are responsible for all aspects of the school life and therefore have to cope with particularly high demands as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Pre-pandemic research shows that school principals report high work-related stress and more frequently psychological and physical burden compared to other professional groups (Dadaczynski et al., 2020;Phillips et al., 2008). Moreover, little attention has been paid to what health promotion activities are implemented by schools during pandemic times and what the schoolsâ€™ needs are in this area. To provide empirical evidence on that matter, a school principal survey was conducted within the international COVID-Health Literacy Research Network (www.covid-hl.org), that aimed to assess (1) work-related stress and strain, (2) corona-specific health literacy among school principals and (3) the implementation status of activities in school health promotion during the COVID-19 pandemic. This workshop aims to present and discuss findings of the COVID-HL school principal study from Germany, Italy, Poland, Switzerland and Wales, which have used the same instrument and study design. The first presentation will focus on the pandemic as a potential disruptive event impeding the implementation of holistic activities on school health promotion and prevention. In their presentation, Chiara et al. analyse beliefs about vaccines among principals and its associations with COVID-19 information satisfaction. The third presentation originates from Poland and will introduce findings regarding work-related coping behavior and its association with mental health of school principals. While the fourth presentation from Switzerland focus on the relationship between health literacy and health promoting activities implemented by schools, Marchant et al. explores the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on senior leaders experiencing high job demands. Each project will be given ten minutes to present their findings, including questions, which will be followed by Q&A and an open discussion with the audiences. This workshop offers a forum for researchers, practitioners and policy-makers interested in school health promotion and school staff health. By dialogue and two-way communication, vivid interaction will be ensured, allow building synergies, and facilitate networking and capacity building. Key messages â€¢ School leaders should be systematically supported as â€˜gate-keepersâ€™ of school health promotion. â€¢ School principals represent a largely neglected target group for school health promotion.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=School+health+during+the+COVID-19+Pandemic.+Perspectives+from+the+COVID-HL+school+principal+study","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; JOUR(Suppl 3), 32.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41616,""
"Building capacity for a resilient and healthy post-COVID health workforce","Background The COVID-19 pandemic added new challenges to health workforce resilience. High workload, increased risk of COVID infection and continuing stress threaten the health and wellbeing of healthcare workers (HCWs) and increase existing (gendered) inequalities, thus reinforcing health labour market problems. Investment in the health workforce and prioritisation of the health and wellbeing needs of healthcare workers in health policy and pandemic recovery plans is therefore called for by the WHO, the European Union and others. However, health systems and policymakers across countries have not sufficiently understood the importance of HCWs. Objectives This workshop brings health workforce needs onto the health policy agenda. It seeks to build capacity for a resilient and healthy health workforce, setting the focus on protection and preparedness of HCWs and their individual wellbeing, and reduction of gendered inequalities. The following major questions will be addressed: What do we know about COVID-19 and the health and wellbeing of HCWs? What skills are needed to respond to new demands? What policy approaches are available to improve protection, preparedness and mental health support of HCWs? How to integrate gender equality and the situation of migrant/refugee HCWs in these approaches, and finally build capacity for effective health workforce governance and its implementation. The workshop introduces novel results drawn from European comparative research and country case studies. It connects policy and practice, as well as health system and individual HCW needs. A number of important policy recommendations are emerging from the research. (1) The health and wellbeing of the health workforce must be addressed systematically across all levels of health policy and governance, including the organisation settings. (2) Health systems must take responsibility and leadership in responding to health workforce needs. (3) Important lessons to be learned from HCWsâ€™ experiences should guide future health workforce policy and pandemic recovery plans. (4) Participatory governance and inclusion of HCWs must be strengthened, including gender equality and diversity. The workshop will stimulate critical debate and improve knowledge exchange across countries and between researchers. It will contribute to strengthen resilience of the health workforce and health systems, and to build back better after COVID-19 in a fair and equitable manner. Key messages â€¢ Health workforce needs and mental health support must become policy priorities and addressed as part of health system resilience. â€¢ Action has to be taken to strengthen participatory health workforce governance sensitive to new needs.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Building+capacity+for+a+resilient+and+healthy+post-COVID+health+workforce","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; JOUR(Suppl 3), 32.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41617,""
"Can digital health literacy act as a protective factor for students in times of crisis?","As mental health related issues become more and more prevalent across all ages and social groups around the globe, the identification of protective factors related to well-being is of high importance. In times of the COVID-19-pandemic, this proves to be even more crucial. Young adults and especially students were particularly burdened by social isolation and missing opportunities for personal exchange and supporting relationships during the pandemic. Within this workshop we will discuss the significance of a possible protective factor for the promotion and strengthening of well-being: digital health literacy (DHL). It involves the ability to search for health-related information, to add self-generated content, to evaluate the reliability of health information, to determine the relevance of health information and to protect one's privacy. Findings suggest that it plays a vital part as a protective resource when it comes to maintaining or promoting well-being. This might be particularly the case when the possibility of accessing health-related information is restricted due to reduced social contact. Since important sources for health information are available within the digital space, digital competencies are becoming important to access such information and to conduct a successful and healthy life. The competence of adequately dealing with digital health information, in particular, became more relevant during the COVID-19-pandemic. DHL can be seen as a two-dimensional construct. On the one hand, it refers to the ability to use digital resources to gather health information and, on the other hand, it refers to critical information literacy. Critical information literacy is the ability to collect, understand, evaluate and apply information. Within the proposed workshop, findings of a university survey, conducted within the global COVID-HL network, will be presented. Presentation 1 seeks to address the role of individual factors for the interaction between well-being and DHL. It will further examine the importance of being able to properly assess the relevance of health information. Presentation 2 sheds light on actions, such as adding self-generated health content, when it comes to mental health promotion. It will also take up the relevant individual factors that mediate the relationship between DHL and well-being. Presentation 3 highlights the ability of students to search for health-related information and to use it as a factor to improve their well-being. Presentation 4 provides insight into the importance of DHL for future health professionals in a health sector that is under digital transformation. Lastly, presentation 5 argues for the necessary enhancement of DHL and sense of coherence of students and stresses the need for health promoting and target group specific interventions. In a second step, the audience will be encouraged to ask questions and to engage in a discussion about the suggested conclusions and implications. Key messages â€¢ It has been shown internationally that there is a strong relationship between digital health literacy and studentsâ€™ well-being. â€¢ Individual factors are relevant mediators in the relationship between well-being and digital health literacy.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Can+digital+health+literacy+act+as+a+protective+factor+for+students+in+times+of+crisis?","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; JOUR(Suppl 3), 32.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41618,""
"Children first: do health systems pay enough attention to their youngest constituents?","This workshop aims to bring together a range of insights on how health systems have dealt with child health and health care, highlighting both successes and challenges. For children, access to health care is vital. It impacts their physical and emotional health and wellbeing and largely determines whether they can reach their full potential as adults, which is also important to their families and society at large. Consequently, it comes as no surprise that he 1989 UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which was ratified by all European countries, guarantees a fundamental right to healthcare for all children. However, various national governments do not fully comply with the Convention, and evidence exists that children may not always enjoy the necessary access to meet their needs. In 2021, Doctors of the World (DoW) concluded that there are urgent questions about the welfare and health of vulnerable children across Europe, based on the increase in children seeking healthcare from DoW clinics instead of the national health system. This concerning trend is not captured well enough in available statistics. What is more, the COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukrainian refugee crisis raise additional concerns as to how health systems will deal with the observed increases in related paediatric sequelae and mental health needs. The aims of this workshop are therefore to stimulate discussion around better understanding children's access to health care and how it relates to health system performance, and provide impetus for new initiatives that can improve health care for children. The workshop will take a hybrid format, kicking off with three short presentations followed by a round table discussion and engagement with the audience. The presentations will cover the regulatory framework for children's access to health care in European countries;identified bottlenecks of health system performance specific to child services from a range of countries around the world;and the impact of COVID-19 on hospital care for children based on the example of one European country. Key messages â€¢ Ensuring childrenâ€™s access to health care is now more important than ever;a lot more can and should be done at all levels. â€¢ More and better data about childrenâ€™s health and health care access is necessary to enable effective policies;collecting it should become a health system priority.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Children+first:+do+health+systems+pay+enough+attention+to+their+youngest+constituents?","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; JOUR(Suppl 3), 32.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41619,""
"THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 PUBLIC HEALTH MEASURES ON THE SOCIAL RELATIONS OF MEN AND WOMEN IN LATER LIFE","Background Despite the burgeoning literature on the impact of Covid-19 on the lives of older populations, gaps remain in our knowledge around the lived experience of social relationship change during the pandemic, and the implications for longer-term relational well-being. Even with the clear significance of Covid-19 for older populations across Europe, research involving cross-national comparisons of these experiences is largely absent. Addressing these gaps is critical given concerns for some older peopleâ€™s social connectedness, their future relational embeddedness, and our societal preparedness for pandemic and other public health crises. The aim of this paper is to chart the impact of the pandemic on older peopleâ€™s subjective lived experience of social connectedness across seven countries, and to contrast the differential impact of public health measures, if any, in these jurisdictions. Methods The analysis draws on 210 semi-structured interviews with men and women aged sixty-five and over across Austria, Czech Republic, Ireland, Israel, Norway, Spain, Sweden (as part of a wider study into exclusion from social relations), with a focus on direct social distancing measures and peopleâ€™s response to these measures. Results Four themes emerged from the data: reduced informal social contact, depleted social opportunities, fear and lack of social confidence, and relational life course and impacts in context. Given the largely common approach to preventing the spread of the virus, more cross-national similarities than differences, although there were clear exceptions to this in relation to approach, and cultural nuances are evident. Cross-cutting these themes, structural and self-ageism emerged as intensifying formal constraints for some participants, in some settings. Conclusion For most participants, public health measures had a negative impact on their subjective well-being, while others experienced disruption to their relational life course trajectories. The data points to a clear need to consider the social infrastructure of older people, particularly in times of crises.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=THE+IMPACT+OF+COVID-19+PUBLIC+HEALTH+MEASURES+ON+THE+SOCIAL+RELATIONS+OF+MEN+AND+WOMEN+IN+LATER+LIFE","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Age and ageing; JOUR(Suppl 3), 51.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41620,""
"Adaptations in a time of crisis â€“ public health practice in Sweden during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background The Public Health Agency of Sweden has assessed the consequences of the COVID-19-pandemic in relation to the Swedish public health goals, aiming at good and equitable health. This assessment indicated 1) that preconditions for good and equitable health have changed during the pandemic, 2) that groups with higher risk of ill-health before the pandemic were more severely affected, 3) that the general health of the population remains good although some groups appear to have suffered from increased minor mental health problems, 4) that physical activity has decreased and sedentary behaviour has increased, and 5) that many activities of relevance for public health, such as prevention of alcohol, drugs, and tobacco (ADT) at the local and regional levels were paused or were replaced with other, often digital, alternatives. Objectives The objective of this workshop is to present and discuss the results of four projects studying the consequences of the COVID-19-pandemic for public health practice in Sweden. Special attention is paid to ADT-prevention at the local and regional levels, focusing on how such work has developed digitally during the pandemic. Potential implications will be discussed with the audience. The added value of organizing this workshop: This workshop will contribute to an improved understanding of how public health practice, particularly ADT prevention, has navigated through a time of a crisis (i.e. a pandemic) in order to provide important lessons for the future. The presentations in this workshop will lay the foundation for discussing with the audience what might happen within the arena of health promotion and disease prevention as a result of a pandemic as well as ways to cope with the consequences of such a pandemic at the local and regional levels. The coherence between the presentations and the topic of the workshop: There is an obvious logic between the main topic of the workshop and the four presentations. In different ways, they all discuss consequences of the COVID-19-pandemic on public health practice in Sweden. The format of the workshop The workshop will start with a brief introduction, aiming to give a short background and set the scene. Four presentations will then follow, with time allocated for questions after each presentation. The presentations will contain descriptions of each subproject, including the background, methods, results, and conclusions. Finally, the moderator will lead a discussion with the audience and the presenters. Key messages â€¢ The pandemic forced public health practice to adapt its ways of working. â€¢ When challenged, public health practice can operate in new ways, although with some regional differences.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=Adaptations+in+a+time+of+crisis+â€“+public+health+practice+in+Sweden+during+the+COVID-19+pandemic","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; JOUR(Suppl 3), 32.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41621,""
"Anxiety and depression among ambulatory and hospitalized patients with cardiovascular long-COVID-19 presentation referred to cardiology consultation after COVID-19 infection","Introduction COVID-19 is connected with varying degrees of emotional stress. Patients (pts) who are hospitalized with severe COVID-19 (C19) are located in single rooms without a permanent attendant to prevent contamination. All personnel serving these pts come into contact with patients with personal full-body protective garment. Ambulatory C19 pts, usually with less severe presentation, are treated in more comfortable conditions. Purpose To evaluate the impact of the psychosocial changing conditions on individuals' psyche and to analyse the differences in terms of experienced anxiety and depression among the ambulatory and hospital patients referred to post-C19 cardiology consultation. Methods The study involved 388 pts with persistent cardiovascular symptoms, including 198 ambulatory patients (130 females and 68 males) and 190 hospital patients (128 females and 62 males) referred to the cardiology consultation (mean age 4.9Â±12.9 and 50.5Â±14.4 years, respectively). The data were collected using the specially designed questionnaire related to descriptive characteristics of the patients and to standardized questionnaires: the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI). Results Abnormal psychological metrics was common in the study pts. Indicators of anxiety were lower in the ambulatory than in hospitalized pts (p&lt;0.001). Depression level was also lower in the ambulatory pts (p&lt;0.001). The same differences were statistically significant in both female and male pts subsets. However, anxiety and depression were more pronounced among female than male pts. Very strong positive correlation was observed between anxiety - state and depression among ambulatory patients, both females and males (p&lt;0.05). Conclusions C19 convalescents with persistent symptoms of presumed cardiovascular origin present with abnormal psychological traits including increased anxiety and depression especially in individuals requiring hospital treatment. For this reason, it is necessary to plan the interventions particularly in hospitalized pts to reduce their anxiety and depression levels and to create psychological support programs.

"The German National Cohort (NAKO): Design, current state, and first results","This workshop aims to give an overview of design, methods and first results of the largest cohort study in Germany: the German National Cohort (NAKO).This organized session will consist of one overview presentation and three presentations on selected topics: mental disorders, COVID-19, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in the NAKO. NAKO is a multidisciplinary, population-based cohort study that provides a central resource for population-based epidemiologic research. NAKO aims to investigate the development and aetiology of diseases, identify risk factors and enhance early detection and prevention of diseases with a focus on diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular, pulmonary, neurological, psychiatric, and infectious diseases. Between 2014 and 2019, overall 205,415 persons aged 20-74 years were recruited and examined at 18 study centres across Germany. During their visit to the study centre, they participated in a face-to-face interview, completed self-administered, computer-based questionnaires, underwent a battery of biomedical examinations, and provided various biosamples. In addition, whole-body Magnet Resonance Imaging (MRI) was performed on 30,861 participants using dedicated 3 Tesla MRI scanners at 5 study centres. The whole-body MRI protocol focuses on brain and cardiac structures, musculoskeletal system and body fat distribution. In 4-5 year intervals, all study participants are re-invited for examinations at the study centres. The programme for the first re-examination (including MRI scanning) was similar to the baseline programme. Thereby, longitudinal information on changes in risk factor profiles and in vascular, cardiac, metabolic, neurocognitive, pulmonary and sensory function is collected. Since October 2018, 77,896 participants have been re-examined, including 11,382 with additional MRI examination. A supplemental COVID-19 questionnaire collected data on 161,849 participants of NAKO during the first COVID-19-related lockdown in Spring 2020. This survey started on 30 April 2020 and ended on 30 June 2020. The questionnaire included questions on general state of health, Sars-CoV-2 symptoms and test results, and on changes in behavioural, psychosocial and socioeconomic factors as well as social contacts and occupational situation during the pandemic. Thus, psychological and socioeconomic effects of the pandemic situation can be addressed. Moreover, questions on pandemic-related aspects including the history of infection, severity and long-term health impacts of COVID-19 were added to the regular study programme in the study centres as of July 2021. The longitudinal design of NAKO provides the unique opportunity to compare the participantsâ€™ situation before and during the pandemic. The presentations describe the main design of the NAKO and exemplary results of main research questions, e. g., on mental health, association of occupational factors with COVID-19, and MRI findings. Key messages â€¢ The workshop introduces the design and collected data of the NAKO to foster collaboration between scientists, enabling further harmonization of data collection between large cohort studies. â€¢ The workshop aims to facilitate (future) joint scientific exploitation of this unique epidemiological resource of population-based data.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+German+National+Cohort+(NAKO):+Design,+current+state,+and+first+results","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; JOUR(Suppl 3), 32.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41623,""
"HOLISTIC PERSON-CENTRED CARE FOR PEOPLE LIVING WITH DEMENTIA AND CO EXISTING MENTAL HEALTH ILLNESSES:Â A CASE FOR INTEGRATION","Background 65,000 people live with dementia in Ireland, many have co-existing or emerging mental health illnesses and non-cognitive symptoms. During the COVID-19 pandemic there was a need to provide innovative solutions to service provision. As Medicine for the Elderly (MEDEL) and Psychiatry of Later Life (PLL) were established stand-alone services, there was no formalised working relationship, resulting in an overlap of cases and disparity in service provision. Methods A description of three cases to illustrate the joint working interface with MEDEL and PLL. These cases highlight their complex care needs and the speciality input required by both services within a shared catchment area.Â The age range was 78-88 years. All presented with at least two medical co-morbidities, including vascular risk factors and delirium. Each had at least one mental health illness including new onset psychotic and mood disorders. Sharing of resources including diagnostic services, nursing, medical, occupational therapy, physiotherapy and social work facilitated cost effective holistic care. Results Given the existing structures of MEDEL and PLL, it was possible to link with community partners attached to each service, allowing domiciliary visits for crisis intervention and best use of expertise from both disciplines. This resulted in the provision of timely patient centred care, reduced polypharmacy through a unified pharmacological approach, enhanced communication, shared learning and cost effectiveness. Care that is in the right place at the right time, in line with SlÃ¡inte Care, allowed timely access to diagnostics, improved care outcomes and a cohesive response. Conclusion This cohort present with complex care needs. An integrated approach enables patients to receive holistic care without duplication of resources or disparity of treatment and care options. Going forward this should involve a fully integrated memory service, with shared governance.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=HOLISTIC+PERSON-CENTRED+CARE+FOR+PEOPLE+LIVING+WITH+DEMENTIA+AND+CO+EXISTING+MENTAL+HEALTH+ILLNESSES:Â A+CASE+FOR+INTEGRATION","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Age and ageing; JOUR(Suppl 3), 51.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41624,""
"The Dutch GOR-Covid-19 health monitor: a five-year research program to inform public health policy","Societies can be confronted with disasters and major incidents that form a serious threat to population well-being, safety and health. The Covid-19 pandemic challenged governments at different levels in many countries across the world for over two years to address a variety of public health risks. This also applies to the Netherlands, a densely populated high income country in Europe with approximately 17 million citizens. Experience with previous crises - such as the Bijlmermeer Airplane Disaster in Amsterdam (1992), the Q fever outbreak (2007-2011), the MH17 airplane disaster in Ukraine (2014) and gas-mining induced earthquake problems in the north of the Netherlands (ongoing) - shaped the current Dutch public health response structure and knowledge base, designed to assist local and national authorities to anticipate disaster-related population health risks. During the Covid-19 pandemic this structure was used as a starting point to develop and implement a five-year monitoring program: the integrated GOR-Covid-19 health monitor;GOR stands for â€œGezondheidsonderzoek bij rampenâ€ (disaster health research). The main objective of the GOR-Covid-19 monitor is to collect and promote the uptake of reliable and timely monitoring information for the benefit of regional and national public health decision-making in the Netherlands, focusing on the public health impact of the Covid-19 crisis (virus infections and mitigation measures) among children and adolescents, adults and public mental health care, a potentially vulnerable group including homeless and former drug addicts. The monitor is carried out under coordination of the â€œNetwork GORâ€, comprised of the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment, GGD GHOR Netherlands (on behalf of the 25 municipal health regions), Nivel, and ARQ National Psychotrauma Centre. The current workshop consists of five presentations by members of Network GOR. The first contribution gives an overview of the research objectives and the outline of the study protocol of the monitoring program. The other contributions focus on particular study components, that are shaped and aligned during the timeline of the monitor. One presenter will share the findings from the first series of systematic literature reviews. Two contributions are based on a combination of surveys in representative samples and an analysis of primary care registry data: one with an emphasis on quarterly results (short-cycle monitoring), the other on (bi-)annual reports, which zoom in on long-term developments and differences between subgroups based on vulnerability factors and geography (long-cycle monitoring). The fifth contribution details the participatory stakeholder-engagement process designed and implemented to promote that monitor findings are used for local and national public health sense-making and decision-making. Key messages â€¢ The workshop describes the background and design of a national longitudinal monitoring program to track the public health impact of the Covid-19 pandemic in the Netherlands. â€¢ An overview is given of the first findings on the health impact of the pandemic for different populations and related vulnerability factors as well as the stakeholder engagement process.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Dutch+GOR-Covid-19+health+monitor:+a+five-year+research+program+to+inform+public+health+policy","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; JOUR(Suppl 3), 32.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41625,""
"Effects of mask-wearing on treadmill exercise test","Background Concerning about the spread of COVID-19, World Health Organization recommends wearing facemasks to minimize viral transmission. Patients are required to wear facemasks while conducting treadmill exercise tests in hospitals. The effects of mask-wearing on the results of stress exercise testing remain uncertain. Purpose This study aims to assess the impact of mask-wearing on the physiological parameters during treadmill exercise testing. Methods Patients who underwent treadmill exercise test using the Bruce protocol for the diagnosis of ischemic heart disease were retrospectively examined between 2020 and 2021. A propensity score matching was performed to adjust the baseline characteristics of patients with and without mask. Blood pressure, heart rate, exercise duration, and the interpretation of stress test were compared. The ischemic ST-segment response was defined as flat or downsloping depression of the ST seg-ment &gt;0.1 mV below baseline and lasting longer than 0.08 second. Nondiagnostic result of treadmill exercise test was defined as absence of ischemic ST-segment response in which the 90% of maximal predicted heart rate for age and sex was not achieved. Results Following 1:1 propensity score matching, a total of 3,996 patients were enrolled for analysis, including 1,998 patients who performed treadmill exercise testing with masks, and 1,998 without masks. Baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups (mean age, 56.1Â±12.1 years;38.7% female;mean body mass index, 25.5Â±3.9 kg/m2). At baseline, patients with masks had significantly higher heart rate (84.8Â±14.7 bpm vs. 82.5Â±14.0 bpm;p&lt;0.001) and lower systolic blood pressure (130.4Â±19.0 mmHg vs. 132.4Â±18.7 mmHg;p=0.001) than those without masks. Patients with masks conducted significantly shorter duration of exercise (435Â±128 seconds vs. 481Â±133 seconds;p&lt;0.001), achieved significantly lower measurement of peak heart rate (149.5Â±17.1 bpm vs. 152.7Â±17.0 bpm;p&lt;0.001), and had significantly lower rate-pressure products (26,366Â±5,207 mmHgÂ·bpm vs. 27,629Â±5,242 mmHg*bpm;p&lt;0.001) than those without masks. The proportion of patients who were unable to complete stage II of the Bruce protocol was significantly higher among patients with masks (15.1% vs. 9.0%;p&lt;0.001). The proportion of nondiagnostic result was significantly higher among patients with mask (12.2% vs. 8.8%;p&lt;0.001), whereas the proportion of positive ischemic ST-segment response rate was significantly higher among patients without mask (28.1% vs. 23.3%;p=0.001). Conclusions Our study demonstrated that performing treadmill exercise test with mask could significantly decrease the duration of exercise, reduce the maximal achieved heart rate, decease the rate-pressure product, and thus reduce the diagnostic power of treadmill exercise testing.

"WHOâ€™s activities to strengthen the evidence of public health and social measures","Public health and social measures (PHSM) are key to reducing the spread of infectious diseases like COVID-19, especially in the early stages of an outbreak. PHSM include non-pharmaceutical actions that individuals, communities, and governments take to reduce person-to-person contact and/or make them safer. PHSM reduce the pressure on the health care system to allow for the continuation of essential services and buy time for the development and dissemination of treatments and vaccines. While a combination of PHSM has proven to be effective in reducing transmission during the COVID-19 pandemic, the evidence on the relative effectiveness and broader health, social and economic impact of individual interventions is still scarce. However, PHSM packages such as lockdowns can have severe unintended consequences for individuals and societies including economic hardship, decreased mental health and wellbeing and exacerbated social and health inequity;therefore, precision in PHSM decisions and implementation is needed. This requires a strengthened evidence base as well as tools that support countries in making balanced decisions about PHSM with the best possible cost-benefit ratio. WHO works with multisectoral partners to achieve effective and context- specific PHSM implementation while maximizing the benefits of PHSM and keeping their health, social and economic burden to a minimum and justifiable. In the WHO Regional Office for Europe, PHSM are a key pillar in the COVID-19 response. The office provides, amongst others, a PHSM monitoring dashboard to track the severity of implementation across all 53 Member States as well as a calibration tool and related capacity building to guide countries in their implementation decisions as the pandemic situation evolves. The WHO has further launched a global initiative in 2021 to measure the effectiveness and impact of PHSM and improve precision in future PHSM decisions and policies. The initiative aims at providing robust data and research evidence on PHSM through a global conceptual model and research agenda, a central research monitoring system and harmonized data collection mechanisms during health emergencies. It further seeks to integrate PHSM into emergency preparedness and response assessments and yield a decision-making tool to facilitate evidence-informed and context-specific PHSM implementation. This workshop will provide an overview of WHO's activities in advancing PHSM research and implementation for better decision-making during future emergencies. Three presentations by the WHO Secretariat at the regional and global levels will focus on the strategic approach and the main deliverables of the respective initiatives so far. The presentation by the University of Munich will provide in-depth insights into the conceptual model on PHSM. The workshop will actively solicit feedback from participants on planned activities and results gathered to-date. Key messages â€¢ The lack of evidence on PHSM effectiveness and impact hampered an evidence-driven implementation approach during the COVID-19 pandemic. â€¢ WHO works to achieve effective and context- specific PHSM implementation to maximize the benefits of PHSM while keeping their health, social and economic burden to a minimum and justifiable.","","https://www.google.com/search?q=WHOâ€™s+activities+to+strengthen+the+evidence+of+public+health+and+social+measures","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: European journal of public health; JOUR(Suppl 3), 32.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41627,""

"Persistent symptoms among post-COVID-19 survivors: A&#xa0;systematic review and meta-analysis","Single studies support the presence of several post-COVID-19 symptoms; however, there is no evidence for the synthesis of symptoms. We attempt to provide an overview of the persistent symptoms that post-COVID-19 patients encounter, as well as the duration of these symptoms to help them plan their rehabilitation. Systematic review and meta-analysis. A total of 16 studies involving 8756 patients post-COVID-19 were included. The CINAHL, PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched from 2019 to August 2021. Observational studies that reported data on post-COVID-19 symptoms were included. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal for Observational Studies. We included medium- to high-quality studies. We used a random-effects model for the meta-analytical pooled prevalence of each post-COVID-19 symptom, and I<sup>2</sup> statistics for heterogeneity. From the 2481 studies identified, 16 met the inclusion criteria. The sample included 7623 hospitalised and 1133 non-hospitalised patients. We found the most prevalent symptoms were fatigue and dyspnea with a pooled prevalence ranging from 42% (27%-58%). Other post-COVID-19 symptoms included sleep disturbance 28% (14%-45%), cough 25% (10%-44%), anosmia/ageusia 24% (7%-47%), fever 21% (4%-47%), myalgia 17% (2%-41%), chest pain 11% (5%-20%), and headache 9% (2%-20%). In addition to physical symptoms, anxiety/depression was also prevalent 27% (8%-53%). Fatigue and dyspnea were the most prevalent post-COVID-19 symptoms and experienced up to 12&#x2009;months. Multiple persistent symptoms are still experienced until 12&#x2009;months of post-Covid 19. This meta-analysis should provide some awareness to nurses to highlights the unmet healthcare needs of post-COVID-19 patients.

"A partnership approach to supporting the health and wellbeing of the Charedi (Orthodox Jewish) community in London","There is a need for a specific programme of engagement around COVID-19 vaccination with the Charedi Orthodox Jewish community in Stamford Hill, London, UK. We co-produced a live event for women on COVID-19 safety and vaccination and wider health topics to support vaccine uptake and improve awareness of health and wellbeing issues. For this qualitative analysis, we organised an event that was designed and delivered by a local community organisation in partnership with regional and local health partners and community groups. The event was for Charedi women aged 16 years and older, and provided information on COVID-19, childhood immunisations, oral health and dental hygiene, childhood respiratory infections, and mental health. The event included health stalls, a panel session, co-designed culturally competent physical information, and the opportunity to speak with health professionals. We evaluated the event using attendees' feedback forms, collected in person at the end of the event, and a thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with organisers from community and statutory organisations. The evaluation was informed by a co-produced logic model and outcomes framework. More than 100 women attended the event on March 28, 2022. Feedback suggested the focus on wider health issues was valued, and a greater number of more targeted events (eg on health for women older than 40) would be beneficial. Dental health, COVID-19 vaccination, and childhood immunisations were identified as the most important topics by participants. 16 (55%) of 29 respondents stated they would attend a similar event again, 12 (41%) stated they were unsure, and one (3%) said they would not attend again. Informal feedback from the community highlighted that the event was useful and acted as a basis for further engagement and collaboration with the community. Our findings emphasised the need to work in partnership with a lead community organisation to identify and address principal health challenges within communities, to share community-specific insights, and to promote community events through community communication channels. Statutory institutions should engage with local community organisations to support and facilitate public health interventions to increase relevant vaccine uptake and to improve awareness around wider health and wellbeing issues and services.

The Everyone In initiative during 2020 was initially transformative in providing short-term accommodation for this group but was accompanied by major disruptions to treatment and support services. Understanding how these changes have affected health needs of people experiencing homelessness in the inner-city London Borough of Tower Hamlets can inform future service commissioning. We conducted a focussed health needs assessment of people experiencing homelessness in Tower Hamlets. Quantitative data were gathered from the Combined Homelessness and Information Network (CHAIN), local authority housing services, primary care datasets, and substance dependency services. These data were combined with qualitative data from stakeholder meetings, facility visits, and lived experience insight from service users through interviews and focus groups. Analysis was targeted towards identifying gaps in existing commissioning. We gathered data from 80 service users experiencing homelessness in Tower Hamlets between Sept 1 to Dec 31, 2021. Participants reported the largest impact of the pandemic being on their mental health. For people registered with specific homeless primary care services, 26&#xb7;3% were experiencing depression and 12&#xb7;8% other severe mental health issues. Service users with lived experience of homelessness described feeling let down by mental health support systems, describing that, despite positive experiences of individual staff, they felt the system as a whole was not well integrated. Specific issues were identified in hostel-based accommodation, where poor psychological and physical safety during lockdowns contributed to declines in mental health. Using a health needs assessment, a necessity was identified to support the mental health of people experiencing homelessness in Tower Hamlets emerging from pandemic restrictions. People with lived experience of homelessness attributed deteriorations in mental health to extended time in inadequate accommodation, and reported that environments that take account of emotional and psychological needs were required. Provision of psychologically-informed accommodation environments and improved support service integration must be priorities for future local authority commissioning.

"Perspectives of education and mental health professionals on adolescent school-based mental health promotion: a qualitative exploration","Interdisciplinary interventions for school-based mental health promotion (SBMHP) for adolescents (10-19 years old) provide a unique opportunity to address the urgent mental health needs across this population. EspaiJove.net, a SBMHP programme, has delivered mental health workshops to over 24118 adolescents in Barcelona, Spain, since 2012. This study aimed to explore the perspectives from professionals involved in EspaiJove.net regarding the needs, challenges, and opportunities for adolescent SBMHP, to guide future interventions. Following an interpretivist approach rooted in social constructionism, semi-structured online interviews were conducted with six mental health professionals and five education professionals recruited through purposeful sampling from four schools participating in EspaiJove.net in Barcelona, Spain. Data collection was done between November and December, 2021. An interview guide and ongoing researcher reflexivity contributed to attaining data saturation. Bracketing, member checking, and debriefing were used to ensure rigour. Data were analysed through thematic content analysis. The University of Liverpool's Ethics Committee approved this study. Data showed that: (1) there is a shared understanding among education and mental health professionals towards mental health and its promotion; (2) there is an urgent need for adolescent mental health promotion; and (3) participants' perceived roles and responsibilities in SBMHP varied, but favourable views towards the implementation of SBMHP were unanimous. There was perceived urgency towards adolescent mental health promotion, partly attributed to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The link established between schools and mental health centres through EspaiJove.net fostered an interdisciplinary collaboration that spanned well beyond the intervention. The major challenge affecting the feasibility of SBMHP unanimously described was the scarcity of resources and political will to invest in mental health promotion. Perspectives arising from EspaiJove.net reveal favourable views towards SBMHP among participants. Although limited by size, the consistency of the findings add strength to the study. Given the similarities between the UK and Spain's Education and Health Systems, these findings could contribute to the advancement of SBMHP in the UK. Despite current challenges, such as the scarcity of resources and political will identified in this study, capitalising on schools as health-promoting assets and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration through SBMHP could be a cost-effective way to address the current global mental health crisis.

"How did living in temporary accommodation during the COVID-19 pandemic affect children younger than 5 years' access to health care and health outcomes? A qualitative study of key professionals in a socially and ethnically diverse and deprived area of London","Children younger than 5 years living in temporary accommodation due to homelessness (U5TA) are extremely vulnerable to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Few qualitative studies have examined provider perspectives in family homelessness, but none focused on U5TA specifically. We aimed to qualitatively explore professionals' perspectives of pandemic-related challenges and barriers experienced by U5TA in accessing health care and optimising health outcomes, and their experiences of delivering U5TA services. 16 semi-structured interviews were done online. Professionals working in the London Borough of Newham with U5TA families were purposively sampled and recruited from non-profit organisations, the health sector, and local authority. A thematic codebook approach was used to analyse the data combining inductive and deductive codes using an adapted socioecological model as a guiding theoretical framework. Two non-profit organisation professionals, seven health visitors, one GP, therapist, dietician, nurse, public health consultant, and two social workers from the local authority's No Recourse to Public Funds team described adverse pandemic effects on U5TA health: delay and regression in developmental milestones and behaviours-eg, toileting, feeding skills, emotional regulation, and social-communication skills. Pre-existing systemic barriers were exacerbated during the pandemic when the reduction of in-person services with professionals necessitated remote delivery of health and social care services. Differential effects of digital poverty, language discordance, and inability to register and track U5TA rendered this population invisible to services. Professionals highly agreed that barriers to optimal health outcomes and service access included poor mental health, unsuitable housing, no social support, mistrust of mainstream services, immigration administration, financial insecurity, and loss of informal jobs among U5TA families. Professionals sometimes mitigated these barriers with good communication skills, developing trusting relations, and through community facilitators. COVID-19 widened health inequalities and inequities, substantially affecting the lives of U5TA and ability of professionals to deliver quality care to U5TA. Innovative and tailored cross-sector strategies, including co-production of public health services, are required. Policies and services urgently need to focus on early development, mental health support, employment training, and opportunities for parents and carers, plus unambiguous definitions of what is deemed suitable accommodation and actionable planned steps to ensure enforcement.

"Effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on incidence of long-term conditions in Welsh residents: a population linkage study","The COVID-19 pandemic had direct and indirect effects on health. Indirect effects on long term medical conditions (LTCs) are unclear. We examined trends in recorded incidences of LTCs and quantified differences between expected rates and observed rates from 2020 onwards. This is a population data linkage study using primary and secondary care data within the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage Databank. We included data of Welsh residents diagnosed with any of 17 identified LTCs for the first time between Jan 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2021. LTC's include mental health conditions, respiratory diseases, and heart conditions among others, generally chosen in line with the Quality and Outcomes Framework. The primary outcome was incidence rates (monthly number of new cases per 100&#x2008;000 population). For each LTC, we did interrupted time series analysis of incidence rates from 2015 to 2021. Expected rates from between Jan 1, 2020, to Dec 31, 2021, were predicted using overall trends and seasonal patterns from the preceding 5 years and compared with observed rates. We included 5&#x2008;476&#x2008;012 diagnoses from 2&#x2008;257&#x2008;992 individuals diagnosed with at least one LTC between Jan 1, 2000, to Dec 31, 2021. Across multiple long-term conditions, there was an abrupt reduction in observed incidence of new diagnoses from March to April 2020, followed by a general increase in incidence towards prepandemic rates. The conditions with the largest percentage difference between the observed and expected incidence rates in 2020 and 2021 were chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (38&#xb7;4% lower than expected), depression (28&#xb7;3% lower), hypertension (25&#xb7;5% lower), and anxiety disorders (24&#xb7;9% lower). The condition with the largest absolute difference between observed and expected incidence rates was anxiety disorders, with 830 per 100&#x2008;000 less in 2020 and 2021 compared with observed rates. The reduction in incidence rates of LTCs suggests an underreporting of LTCs, especially during 2020 and early 2021. The emergence of these yet undiagnosed cases could result in a surge of new patients in the near future.

"How did female survivors of abuse use the arts to support their mental health and wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic? A qualitative exploration of their views","Gender-based violence is an important public health issue that has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Survivors often face barriers when seeking support for mental health and wellbeing and some find therapeutic value in creative arts. We aimed to explore how women with experiences of abuse used art during the pandemic to support mental health and wellbeing. In two small, exploratory, qualitative studies, we conducted semi-structured online interviews with women aged 18 years or older, who had experienced gender-based violence, were currently safe from abuse, and were not living with someone who had been abusive. Women who were unable to speak, read, and understand study documentation in English were excluded. We recruited participants through our networks, third-sector services, and via social media. Interview questions asked participants about interest in the arts as a support tool for mental health after abuse and strategies used during the pandemic to support mental health or wellbeing. ARM analysed the dataset using reflexive thematic analysis using Nvivo. We enrolled 20 women aged 24-61 years; 17 participants (85%) identified as White British. Interviews were conducted between April 16, 2021, and March 1, 2022. Participants reported using drawing, writing, singing, music, painting, and online art or craft groups to support their mental health and wellbeing during the pandemic. Participants said they were motivated at the start of the first UK lockdown to engage with creative arts as a way of practising mindfulness and self-reflection; providing calmness, escapism, and distraction; reducing boredom; and combating loneliness and social isolation. Although self-isolating, the social element of online art groups provided valuable opportunities for chat with others who shared similar lived experiences. Creative arts provided a valuable resource for participants to self-manage their mental health and wellbeing during the pandemic. Connecting with others who had similar experiences of abuse supported coping and feelings of certainty. We conclude with a working example of how online platforms could provide avenues of support and community.

"Exploring young people's perceptions of health and inequality through art: a co-produced qualitative study","Despite increased focus on adolescence, young people's voices are often undervalued and underrepresented in inequalities research. Through exploring young people's perceptions of health and inequality, we might understand how public health interventions can be more effective and equitable. Engaging with youth through art enables self-expression on these complex and sensitive topics. This qualitative project aimed to explore young people's perceptions of their health, inequality, and their aspirations within the Bristol context to inform local policy and everyday practice for adolescent health. Creative focus groups, co-produced with a young artist, were done at three community centres in deprived areas of Bristol, outlined by the Index of Multiple Deprivation. Participants engaged in art and were guided through discussion by a semi-structured topic guide. A thematic approach to analysis was adopted. Written informed consent was obtained for participants aged 16 years and older and parental consent or participant assent obtained from participants younger than 16 years. The study was reviewed by the University of Bristol Health Sciences Faculty Research Ethics Committees. 30 children aged 11-18 years took part. Five themes represented how participants understood health and inequality in Bristol. Adolescents felt forgotten, which they exemplified through a scarcity of age-appropriate activities and public spaces. Participants saw mental health and health risk behaviours such as alcohol and unhealthy diet as major problems for their generation, and highlighted inequalities across these factors. They described how inequalities are experienced in their everyday lives, such as through differential Wi-Fi access, gentrification visible in architecture, experiences of crime, and feeling safe. All felt uncertain about their future and thought they could be better supported around education and employment decisions. Participants thought all issues were exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic. There is strong awareness of negative health factors and socioeconomic inequalities across youth in Bristol. Young people's perceptions and experiences signal the need for city-wide structural and age-specific policies for adolescents, particularly in deprived areas, to support them in living a healthy life.

"Social return on investment of face-to-face versus online lifestyle coaching to improve mental wellbeing","The percentage of people in Wales experiencing severe mental health issues more than doubled during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, hundreds of people in Wales wait more than a year for help with their mental health. The EmotionMind Dynamic (EMD) programme is a six-session programme over 3 months involving self-reflective introspection, self-analysis, problem solving, goal setting, and action taking. Furthermore, this programme challenges negative self-perception and increases self-awareness, self-confidence, and self-esteem. We aimed to estimate the social return on investment of EMD lifestyle coaching, both face-to-face and online formats, by comparing the costs of running the programme with the social value generated from clients as measured by improvement in self-confidence and mental wellbeing. We included 15 clients from previous face-to-face EMD coaching and 17 clients from a new online version of EMD. For face-to-face clients, quantitative data were collected retrospectively with a one-time only questionnaire. For new online clients, quantitative data were collected from baseline and follow-up questionnaires. Qualitative data were collected after intervention from interviews with both groups. Outcomes from questionnaires for both groups included changes in mental wellbeing measured with the Short Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (SWEMWBS) and self-efficacy assessed with the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES). For every &#xa3;1 invested, lifestyle coaching generated social values ranging from &#xa3;4&#xb7;12 to &#xa3;7&#xb7;08 for face-to-face clients compared with &#xa3;2&#xb7;37 to &#xa3;3&#xb7;35 for online participants. Quantitative and qualitative data from questionnaires and interviews indicated that many clients had improved mental wellbeing and self-efficacy. All 15 face-to-face clients and 11 (65%) of 17 online clients reported an increase of 5 points or more on the SWEMWBS questionnaire. Similarly, all 15 face-to-face clients and ten (59%) of 17 online clients reported an increase of 5 points or more on the GSES questionnaire. The results showed that both face-to-face and online formats of the EMD lifestyle coaching generated a positive social return on investment ratios. With continued long waiting lists for people with mental health challenges, face-to-face and online lifestyle coaching might become more essential across statutory, private, and third sectors to meet the growing demand for mental health support.

"Mental health of the nursing and midwifery workforce in Wales during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional analysis","The mental health of the nursing and midwifery workforce in the UK became a public health concern before the COVID-19 pandemic. Poor mental health is a known factor for those considering leaving the profession, and workforce retention of younger members is crucial for the future of the sector. The aim of this study was to provide up-to-date estimates of mental wellbeing in this workforce in Wales during the COVID-19 pandemic. We did a cross-sectional analysis of demographics, work-related information, and health data from respondents to a national online survey of registered and student nurses and midwives and health-care support workers in Wales. The survey was open between June 23 and Aug 9, 2021, and 2910 people responded (approximately 7% of the workforce). Mental wellbeing was calculated using the Short Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Score (SWEMWBS). We measured probable clinical depression (SWEMWBS &lt;18) and possible mild depression (SWEMWBS 18-20). We used &#x3c7;<sup>2</sup> analysis and multinomial logistic regression (adjusted for sex and staff grouping) to examine associations between age groups and mental wellbeing. We analysed data from 2781 (95&#xb7;6%) of 2910 respondents (129 respondents did not answer all seven SWEMWBS questions). Overall, 1622 (58&#xb7;3%) of 2781 respondents had SWEMWBSs indicative of either probable clinical depression (863 [31&#xb7;0%] of 2781) or possible mild depression (759 [27&#xb7;3%] of 2781). Probable clinical depression was highest among those aged 18-29 years (180 [33&#xb7;8%] of 532), 30-39 years (250 [35&#xb7;6%] of 703), and 40-49 years (233 [33&#xb7;5%] of 696). Respondents in these age groups were twice as likely to report SWEMWBSs indicative of probable clinical depression than respondents aged 60 years and older (18-29 years adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2&#xb7;38 [95% CI 1&#xb7;43-3&#xb7;97], p=0&#xb7;0009; 30-39 years aOR 2&#xb7;86 [1&#xb7;77-4&#xb7;64], p&lt;0&#xb7;0001; 40-49 years aOR 2&#xb7;49 [1&#xb7;54-4&#xb7;02], p=0&#xb7;0002). This study highlights the substantial burden of poor mental wellbeing among the nursing and midwifery workforce in Wales, especially in those aged 49 years and younger. These figures, higher than previous estimates, could reflect the mental health effect of responding to the pandemic and could have long-term implications on workforce retention.

"The Peer Education Project to improve mental health literacy in secondary school students in England: a qualitative realist evaluation","Worsening of adolescent mental health and exacerbated health inequalities after the COVID-19 pandemic calls for universal preventative strategies. The Mental Health Foundation's school-based Peer Education Project seeks to improve students' mental health literacy through peer educators (aged 14-18 years) teaching peer learners (aged 11-13 years) to recognise good and bad mental health, identify risk and protective factors, and seek help accordingly. Although previous before and after quantitative assessments have found the intervention to be effective, this realist evaluation aimed to qualitatively develop the theory of change, exploring how the mechanisms played out in different contexts to achieve the desired outcomes. Our initial programme theory was developed following expert stakeholder consultation and reviewing the literature. We divided mechanisms into resources and reasoning to explain how the intervention components (ie, resources), experienced within specific contexts, engendered responses in the participants (ie, reasoning), to produce observable outcomes. Data collected from six purposively recruited schools in England comprised staff interviews (n=11), student focus groups (n=15), and observations (n=5). Deductive and inductive analysis was undertaken, using NVivo-informed multiple causal statements represented as context-mechanism-outcome configurations (CMOcs), to test and refine the programme theory. We created several distinct CMOcs. For example, in learners accustomed to didactic teaching methods (context), conversing with educators having similar life experience (mechanism resource) endorsed and destigmatised help-seeking behaviour (mechanism reasoning) and facilitated a realisation that seeking help was appropriate and acceptable (outcome). Other mechanisms included the following: learners perceiving the information as tailored and relevant, educators feeling empowered, and a cultural shift percolating across the school. Our findings show how peer education can work to improve mental health literacy, which will inform changes to the intervention to maximise its effectiveness in different operational contexts. Future research could test our theory of change in a randomised controlled trial, and examine impacts on inequalities in a more diverse sample.

"Engagement of individuals aged 14-25 years with a digital mental health service during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK: a cohort study of service usage data","Public use of digital mental health technologies has informed several studies focusing on patterns of engagement within user-led digital support systems. General engagement with these services has increased since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore how user engagement patterns with these platforms changed during the pandemic. In this cohort study, we included individuals aged 14-25 years who signed up to the online mental health platform Kooth in the UK before the pandemic (May 1, 2019 to March 10, 2020) and during the pandemic (March 11, 2020 to Oct 31, 2021). Routinely collected usage data were assessed for consenting users who returned to Kooth at least once after sign-up. We used logistic regression to compare service component usage and overall engagement across cohorts. 5048 individuals (mean sign-ups per day 9&#xb7;0 [12&#xb7;0]) were included in the pre-pandemic cohort and 13&#x2008;841 (mean sign-ups per day 11&#xb7;5 [13&#xb7;9]) in the pandemic cohort, representing a significant increase in sign-ups per day during the pandemic compared with the pre-pandemic period (Welch's t-test p=0&#xb7;0001). Compared with users pre-pandemic, users during the pandemic were less likely to have a drop-in chat with a practitioner (odds ratio [OR] 0&#xb7;50 [95% CI 0&#xb7;47-0&#xb7;54], p&lt;0&#xb7;0001) but were more likely to journal (1&#xb7;92 [1&#xb7;77-2&#xb7;07], p&lt;0&#xb7;0001) and comment on existing content (1&#xb7;10 [1&#xb7;03-1&#xb7;18], p=0&#xb7;008). Users who signed up to Kooth during the pandemic and requested a chat with a practitioner (7816 [56&#xb7;5%] of 13 841 users) were also less likely to receive a chat than users who requested a chat pre-pandemic (3791 [75&#xb7;1%] of 5048 users; OR 0&#xb7;68 [0&#xb7;63-0&#xb7;74], p&lt;0&#xb7;0001). During the COVID-19 pandemic, people with the ability and resources to access digital mental health support were diverted from face-to-face services to digital mental health services. This change might have resulted in an unmet need for drop-in practitioner chats, with users probably resorting to asynchronous support through community interaction or journaling.

"Food insecurity among pregnant women living in high-income countries: a systematic review","Food insecurity is an increasingly important public health concern in high-income countries following the 2008 global financial crash, and recently with the COVID-19 pandemic. Food insecurity has been understood as a highly gendered issue, affecting more women than men. As women have more complex nutritional needs because of their menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and breastfeeding, the nutritional impact of food insecurity is also greater for women than for men. This systematic review aims to explore pregnant women's experiences of food insecurity in high-income countries and to understand how food insecurity affects their health, wellbeing, diet, and nutrition. We did a systematic review following PRISMA reporting guidelines. A comprehensive search strategy was developed using search terms such as ""food insecurity"" and ""pregnancy outcomes"". We searched seven databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, PsychInfo, ASSIA, and CINAHL), grey literature, reference lists, and citations, as well as contacted authors. No language restrictions were used, and only studies primarily containing data collected from Jan 1, 2008, onwards were included. Database searches were completed in April 2022; supplementary searches are ongoing. Inclusion criteria is based on PECOS. Screening, data extraction, and quality assessment were done by two authors independently. This systematic review is registered on PROSPERO, number CRD42022311669. 27 studies met the inclusion criteria, with all studies published between 2015 and 2022. 24 (89%) of 27 studies were done in the USA, two (7%) in Canada, and one (4%) in the UK. Outcomes reported include dietary intake or dietary quality during pregnancy (seven [26%] of 27), gestational weight gain (seven [26%]), mental health (five [19%]), pregnancy outcomes including pregnancy complications, preterm birth, or birthweight (five [19%]), and other health outcomes or combination of nutrition, health, and wellbeing (three [11%]). Evidence synthesis is ongoing and will be complete by August, 2022. This systematic review suggests that food insecurity experienced during pregnancy was associated with negative health and nutrition outcomes. The rigorous searches are strengths of this study. A limitation is the restricted focus on studies done from 2008 onward. More research to guide efficient interventions that address food insecurity among pregnant women is needed.

"The Global Impact of COVID-19 on Mental Health of General Population: A Narrative Review","Mental wellness is a crucial component of happiness. A person is happy with better relationships, financial stability, good mental health, and longevity. Disinformation, stigma, ongoing isolation, and disruption of daily activities are all quite prevalent. Any of these elements may impact one's mental health. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has taken several steps to address COVID's mental health concerns. In addition to frontline healthcare personnel, who engage in dealing with COVID-19, the general population's mental health was also at stake due to the unprecedented and catastrophic emergency of COVID. Various keywords, including MeSH terms, were used in PubMed&#xa0;and Google Scholar searches. This paper was based on previously available data and article searches on how COVID-19 affected the mental health of the general population and the elements that may influence it. Quarantine and self-isolation have been found to have affected people's daily livelihoods and&#xa0;behaviors, leading to&#xa0;increased feelings of loneliness, anxiety, dejection, insomnia, risky alcohol and drug use, self-harm, and suicidal thoughts. Many of the victims of COVID-19 who were critical survivors exhibited lasting psychological harm a year after being discharged, including high anxiety levels, melancholy, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Healthcare employees too experienced significant psychological consequences due to factors such as an excessive workload or the number of hours worked, inadequate personal safety equipment, overly enthusiastic media coverage, and a sense of being under-supported. As a result of this major disaster, mental health concerns have surfaced, perhaps leading to long-term health problems, loneliness, and guilt. To reduce this deportment, global health solutions should be used, particularly while executing the isolation/quarantine and dealing with the people with fear&#xa0;and vulnerability. The mental health of&#xa0;the general population should be at the forefront of any worldwide response.","Vishwakarma, Gaidhane, Choudhari","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.30627","20221125","covid-19; mental health; pandemic; psychological wellbeing; sars-cov-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41644,""
"A Review of Effects of Pandemic on the Patients of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder","In today's world, physical as well as mental health&#xa0;both play a crucial role. However, various pandemics have had adverse effects not only on the physical but mental and social health too. With the various preventive measures introduced to handle various pandemics, it becomes more critical to understand how the preventive measures affect the lives of patients suffering from Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). The fear of getting contaminated and the fear of being affected by the disease are the characteristics that are already present in the patients with OCD. The various preventive measures introduced during pandemics may exacerbate the symptoms causing major discomfort to the patients. Due to the stigma present around the various mental health issues, it becomes difficult for early detection and prompt treatment. The failure to receive the treatment may adversely affect the patient's life, and it may also decrease their social interactions. In case of OCD, the already existing symptoms of OCD may even deteriorate, so effective management becomes a requisite. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), along with Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP), has shown effective improvement in those with OCD&#xa0;who are exposed to various risks. The compulsions performed are lessened or even prevented. But in the time of pandemics, where preventive measures are essential not only to prevent being affected by the disease, but also to prevent its outbreak, Exposure and Response Prevention therapy should also be analyzed.","Gokhale, Chakole","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.30628","20221125","covid-19; exposure and response prevention; obsessive compulsive disorder; pandemic; swine flu","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41645,""
"Convalescing: Reflections in a Post-pandemic World","The COVID-19 pandemic brought with it many hardships to the world as a whole.

"Efficacy and mechanisms of mobile application-delivered Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder in China: Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial","As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its far-reaching impact, the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms is increasing significantly in China. Yet access to reliable and effective psychological treatment is still limited during the pandemic. The widespread adoption of mobile technologies may provide a new way to address this gap. In this research we will develop an Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) based intervention delivered by mobile application and will test its usability, efficacy, and mechanism of its effects in relieving PTSD symptoms. A total of 147 Chinese participants with a diagnosis of PTSD according to the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5) will be randomly assigned to an intervention group (app-delivered ACT), an active comparison group (app-delivered mindfulness), or a waitlist group. Participants in the intervention group or comparison group will use their respective apps for one month. Online self-report questionnaires will be used to assess the primary outcome of PTSD symptoms and the secondary outcomes symptoms of depression, symptoms of anxiety, and posttraumatic growth. The potential mediating variable to be tested is psychological flexibility and its components. These assessments will be conducted at baseline, at five times during treatment, at the end of treatment, and at 1- and 3-month follow-ups. As far as we know, this study is the first randomized controlled trial to investigate the usability, efficacy, and mechanism of an app-delivered ACT intervention for PTSD. Furthermore, the research will assess the effect of treatment in reducing dropout rates, explore effective therapeutic components, and investigate mechanisms of symptom change, which will be valuable in improving the efficacy and usability of PTSD interventions.Trial registration: ChiCTR2200058408.","Zhao, Zhao, Ren, Shi, Lai","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2022.100585","20221125","ACT; ACT, Acceptance Commitment Therapy; COVID-19; COVID-19, Corona Virus Disease 2019; China; Mobile app-delivered intervention; Posttraumatic stress disorder; Randomized controlled trial","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41647,""
"Epilepsy and COVID 2021","Coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) has infected over 400 million people worldwide. Although COVID-19 causes predominantly respiratory symptoms, it can affect other organs including the brain, producing neurological symptoms. People with epilepsy (PWE) have been particularly impacted during the pandemic with decreased access to care, increased stress, and worsening seizures in up to 22% of them probably due to multiple factors. COVID-19 vaccines were produced in a record short time and have yielded outstanding protection with very rare serious side effects. Studies have found that COVID-19 vaccination does not increase seizures in the majority of PWE. COVID-19 does not produce a pathognomonic EEG or seizure phenotype, but rather 1 that can be seen in other types of encephalopathy. COVID-19 infection and its complications can lead to seizures, status epilepticus and post-COVID inflammatory syndrome with potential multi-organ damage in people without pre-existing epilepsy. The lack of access to care during the pandemic has forced patients and doctors to rapidly implement telemedicine. The use of phone videos and smart telemedicine are helping to treat patients during this pandemic and are becoming standard of care. Investment in infrastructure is important to make sure patients can have access to care even during a pandemic.","Valencia, Berg, Hirsch, Lopez, Melmed, Rosengard, Tatum, Jobst","https://doi.org/10.1177/15357597221101268","20221125","COVID; epilepsy; seizures; telemedicine; vaccine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41648,""
"COVID-digital health literacy and subjective well-being of students in Ghana: Mediation-moderation analyses","Previous research has established a strong association between COVID-19 digital health literacy (DHL) and subjective well-being among several populations, including students. With the growing misinformation and heightened fear of COVID-19 among persons with an underlying medical condition, several scholars have questioned the direct relationship between DHL and well-being. This study assessed the moderating roles of information accuracy concerns and the existence of an underlying medical condition among students. Using a cross-sectional design, a multi-stage sampling approach was used to select 1392 students from senior high schools in Northern Ghana who completed a questionnaire containing information on DHL, information accuracy, subjective well-being, and underlying health condition, with reported internal consistency coefficients above 0.70. The data which was processed with SPSS version 25, was analyzed using correlation (Pearson and biserial), and Hayes' PROCESS for the moderation and mediation analyses. A significant positive relationship was found between (a) DHL and subjective well-being, (b) DHL and information accuracy concerns, and (c) information accuracy concerns and subjective well-being. However, the prevalence of underlying health condition was negatively associated with information accuracy, DHL, and subjective well-being. Information accuracy concerns and the existence of an underlying medical condition significantly regulated the relationship between DHL and subjective well-being. Demonstrating satisfactory levels of DHL does not necessarily result in improved subjective well-being. However, emphasis should be placed on whether individuals attach much importance to the accuracy of information retrieved as well as having or not an underlying health condition.","Quansah, Ankomah, Agormedah, Abieraba, Srem-Sai, Hagan, Okan, Dadaczynski, Schack","https://doi.org/10.1002/hsr2.916","20221125","COVID&#x2010;19; computer literacy; health literacy; health status; infodemic; information seeking behaviour; mental health; students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41649,""

This is evidenced through the slow progress of previous vaccination campaigns and programs against MMR, BCG, and especially polio. This issue continues to persist and is therefore becoming the cause of low COVID-19 vaccination rates in Pakistan. To provide insights about COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among Pakistanis, and its potential harm on public health. Moreover, we aim provide recommendations to counter the factors limiting the COVID-19 vaccination in Pakistan.

Only free full-text original studies in English language were used to compare and contrast. As proven by various studies, COVID-19 vaccination rates are influenced by multiple factors, including inaccurate beliefs about COVID-19, hesitancy amongst healthcare workers, uncertainty regarding vaccine's efficacy and fear of side effects. Various conspiracy theories and lower testing rates among others also add up to impose a negative impact on the vaccination rates and public health of Pakistan. This may lead to newer strains of potentially harmful COVID-19, mental health deterioration, and prolonged lockdowns. Vaccine hesitancy is a global public health threat, and its impacts are pronounced in Pakistan. This is reflected in the COVID-19 pandemic; low vaccination rates in Pakistan may lead to future outbreaks of new, potentially harmful, strains of COVID-19 which can prolong lockdowns in the country and affect mental health of the population. To improve the current situations, it is imperative for the government, educational institutes, and healthcare systems to develop trust and continually use dialogue, communication, and education to address misconceptions to improve COVID-19 vaccination in Pakistan.","Tharwani, Kumar, Marfani, Shaeen, Adnan, Mohanan, Islam, Essar","https://doi.org/10.1002/hsr2.940","20221125","COVID&#x2010;19; Pakistan; vaccine hesitancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41650,""

"Disparities in the unmet mental health needs between LGBTQ+ and non-LGBTQ+ populations during COVID-19 in the United States from 21 July 2021 to 9 May 2022","Evidence highlighted the likelihood of unmet mental health needs (UMHNs) among LGBTQ+ than non-LGBTQ+ populations during COVID-19. However, there lacks evidence to accurately answer to what extent the gap was in UMHN between LGBTQ+ and non-LGBTQ+ populations. We aim to evaluate the difference in UMHN between LGBTQ+ and non-LGBTQ+ during COVID-19. Cross-sectional data from Household Pulse Survey between 21 July 2021 and 9 May 2022 were analyzed. LGBTQ+ was defined based on self-reported sex at birth, gender, and sexual orientation identity. UMHN was assessed by a self-reported question. Multivariable logistic regressions generated adjusted odds ratios (AODs) of UMHN, both on overall and subgroups, controlling for a variety of socio-demographic and economic-affordability confounders. 81267 LGBTQ+ and 722638 non-LGBTQ+ were studied. The difference in UMHN between LGBTQ+ and non-LGBTQ+ (as reference) varied from 4.9% (95% CI 1.2-8.7%) in Hawaii to 16.0% (95% CI 12.2-19.7%) in Utah. In multivariable models, compared with non-LGBTQ+ populations, LGBTQ+ had a higher likelihood to report UMHN (AOR = 2.27, 95% CI 2.18-2.39), with the highest likelihood identified in transgender (AOR = 3.63, 95% CI 2.97-4.39); compared with LGBTQ+ aged 65+, LGBTQ+ aged 18-25 had a higher likelihood to report UMHN (AOR = 1.34, 95% CI 1.03-1.75); compared with White LGBTQ+ populations, Black and Hispanic LGBTQ+ had a lower likelihood to report UMHN (AOR = 0.72, 95% CI 0.63-0.82; AOR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.75-0.97, respectively).

"Time trends in emotional well-being and self-esteem in children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic","Given their unique COVID-19 pandemic experience, it is necessary to evaluate the mental health of youth beyond the initial stages of the pandemic, in relation to the stringency of the social distancing measures. We aimed to describe long-term trends in emotional well-being and self-esteem among youth in Japan during the pandemic. Using serial cross-sectional data from April 2020 to December 2021, we evaluated the trends in emotional well-being and self-esteem of youth aged 6-17&#xa0;years using the self-report KINDL questionnaire, weighted to represent the age and gender distributions in the Japanese population. We then tested the associations between emotional well-being and self-esteem and stringency of social distancing policies, measured using the Oxford COVID-19 Stringency Index. Analyses were also stratified by gender and age group. The emotional well-being and self-esteem of youth improved transiently in 2020, followed by a slight worsening trend into 2021. While emotional well-being stayed lower compared to initial levels nearly 2&#xa0;years into the pandemic, self-esteem began to improve by late 2021. 12-17&#xa0;year-olds had lower emotional well-being and self-esteem compared to 6-11&#xa0;year-olds throughout the study period. Females had lower emotional well-being than males in May 2020 and lower self-esteem than males in May and September/October 2020. More stringent social distancing measures were associated with lower emotional well-being and self-esteem, especially 6-11&#xa0;year-olds' self-esteem and females' emotional well-being. During the COVID-19 pandemic, older youth tended to have lower emotional well-being and self-esteem than younger youth.

Studies also highlighted changes to sleep quality and duration in many individuals throughout this period. Although these two phenomena have been examined separately, here we highlight the need to investigate&#xa0;the potential link between these outcomes. Sleep dysregulation and EDs have&#xa0;previously been hypothesized to interact via a positive feedback loop, wherein poor sleep exacerbates ED symptomatology which, in turn, further worsens sleep. Thus, we speculate that the aggravation of sleep&#xa0;disturbances and EDs during COVID-19 lockdowns may have been somewhat interdependent. We further hypothesize that the worsening of depression and anxiety symptomology&#xa0;during the acute phase of the pandemic may have&#xa0;served as an additional mediating variable. Altogether, in our view, these observations highlight a need for future work to examine the possible causal&#xa0;relationship between sleep and ED pathology, which may ultimately lead to improved clinical management of disordered eating.","Mehr, James","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40337-022-00704-9","20221124","Anorexia nervosa; Anxiety; Binge eating disorder; Bulimia nervosa; Depression; Insomnia; Other specified feeding and eating disorders; SARS-CoV-2; Sleeplessness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41656,""
"""I'm putting a Band-Aid on a bullet hole the only way I know how:"" a qualitative study of barriers and facilitators to opioid misuse and recovery in Nevada","Nevada, like the rest of the United States, is undergoing substantial challenges with opioid misuse and overdose deaths, further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. While much of the attention around opioid overdose prevention is centered on treatment and recovery, it is important to understand the factors that influence initiation of use, and the function opioids play in people's everyday lives. We conducted qualitative semi-structured individual interviews using purposive and snowball sampling among 35 people across Nevada with a current or prior history of illegal opioid or nonmedical opioid use. Our study aimed to understand why people start to use drugs, why they continue to use, what motivates them to continue to use or to seek treatment, and why individuals maintain recovery or return to use. We found five significant themes as perceived by the participants: that trauma is a risk factor for drug misuse; that the function of opioids in everyday life is a source of temporary relief but highly disruptive in the longer term; that recovery is most often a complicated and nonlinear process; that there are many barriers to accessing services that are both logistical and psychosocial; and that compassion, hope, and having a sense of purpose are crucial to the recovery process. The experiences of the study participants portray opioid use as a rational choice to escape the emotional ramifications of trauma. However, due to the physiological dependence and physical risk of opioids, drug policies that criminalize addiction, societal stigma, and the barriers to timely access of harm reduction, treatment, and recovery services, opioid users often become trapped in a distressing and dangerous cycle. Lastly, respondents indicated that hope, value, belonging, and purpose are powerful factors in cultivating intrinsic motivation for making positive changes and fostering resilience in the recovery process. Opioid misuse services should help meet basic needs and incorporate holistic approaches to recovery that acknowledge past trauma and the complexity of the recovery process.","Swigart, Lee","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13011-022-00503-0","20221124","Drug overdose; Nonmedical opioid use; Opioid; Opioid misuse; People who use drugs; Recovery; Substance use; Trauma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41657,""
"Fear of contagion, emotional stress and coping strategies used by adults during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria","The COVID-19 pandemic has induced high levels of stress. The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between emotional stress (COVID-19 related fear, anger, frustration, and loneliness) and the use of coping strategies among adults in Nigeria during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data from adults aged 18&#xa0;years and above were collected through an online survey from July to December 2020. The dependent variables were COVID-19 related fear (fear of infection and infecting others with COVID-19), anger, frustration, and loneliness. The independent variables were coping strategies (use of phones to communicate with family and others, video conferencing, indoor exercises, outdoor exercises, meditation/mindfulness practices, engaging in creative activities, learning a new skill, following media coverage related to COVID-19) and alcohol consumption. Five logistic regression models were developed to identify the factors associated with each dependent variables. All models were adjusted for sociodemographic variables (age, sex at birth, and the highest level of education). Respondents who consumed alcohol, followed media coverage for COVID-19 related information, and who spoke with friends or family on the phone had higher odds of having fear of contracting COVID-19 or transmitting infection to others, and of feeling angry, frustrated, or lonely (p&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05). Respondents who exercised outdoors (AOR: 0.69) or learned a new skill (AOR: 0.79) had significantly lower odds of having fear of contracting COVID-19. Respondents who practiced meditation or mindfulness (AOR: 1.47) had significantly higher odds of feeling angry. Those who spoke with friends and family on the phone (AOR: 1.32) and exercised indoors (AOR: 1.23) had significantly higher odds of feeling frustrated. Those who did video conferencing (AOR: 1.41), exercised outdoors (AOR: 1.32) and engaged with creative activities (AOR: 1.25) had higher odds of feeling lonely. Despite the significant association between emotional stress and use of coping strategies among adults in Nigeria during the COVID-19 pandemic, it appears that coping strategies were used to ameliorate rather than prevent emotional stress.

The groups were balanced by inverse propensity score weighting and compared using analysis of variance models and ordinal regression models. 17&#x2009;421 participants were included (Spring20=13&#x2009;002; Spring21=4419; 16.2&#xb1;1.2 years; 53% female). Anxiety was significantly lower (better) in Spring21 (Spring20=7.0, 95% CI 6.9 to 7.1; Spring21=4.9, 95% CI 4.8 to 5.0, p&lt;0.001), as was the prevalence of moderate to severe anxiety (Spring20=29.4%, Spring21=17.1%, p&lt;0.001). Depression was significantly improved in Spring21 (Spring20=7.6, 95% CI 7.5 to 7.7; Spring21=4.6, 95% CI 4.5 to 4.8, p&lt;0.001), as was the prevalence of moderate to severe depression (Spring20=32.2%, Spring21=15.4%, p&lt;0.001). Athletes in Spring21 reported higher QOL (Spring20=79.6, 95% CI 79.3 to 79.9; Spring21=84.7, 95% CI 84.4 to 85.0, p&lt;0.001) and increased levels of PA (Spring20=13.8, 95% CI 13.6 to 13.9; Spring21=22.7, 95% CI 22.6 to 22.9, p&lt;0.001). Early COVID-19 sports restrictions were associated with worsening mental health in adolescents. In 2021, after returning to sports, athletes reported significant improvements in mental health, QOL and PA, although mental health adversities remain an important priority.","Watson, Haraldsdottir, Biese, Schwarz, Hetzel, Reardon, Brooks, Bell, McGuine","https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2022-105812","20221124","Covid-19; adolescent; anxiety; depression; quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41659,""
"Burnout and its associated factors among healthcare workers and the general working population in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic: a nationwide cross-sectional internet-based study","To examine the prevalence and the associated factors of burnout among both healthcare workers (HCWs) and the general working population, which has not yet been unknown, using large-scale, nationwide data. Cross-sectional internet-based study. Nationwide internet survey conducted between 8 and 26 February 2021 in Japan. Workers aged 20-64 years. We classified the workers as HCWs and the general working population. Demographic characteristics (age, sex and marital status), socioeconomic status (education, employment and income), health-related, work-related and industry-related factors (smoking, alcohol use, physical and psychiatric comorbidities, working hours, types of healthcare professionals, experience on the COVID-19 frontline and working industries). Burnout defined as a score of &#x2265;3 points on the Mini-Z Single-Item Burnout Scale. Of the included 12 650 workers, 1087 were HCWs. After inverse probability weighting on data from the 2016 Comprehensive Survey of Living Conditions, burnout in HCWs and the general working population was 33.5% (95% CI 29.2% to 38.0%) and 31.0% (95% CI 29.7% to 32.4%), respectively. In the weighted multivariable modified Poisson regression models, working 60 hours or more was associated with burnout in all workers (HCWs: prevalence ratio (PR) 2.52, 95% CI 1.68 to 3.76; general population: PR 1.26, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.48). Widowed/separated compared with married was associated with burnout only among HCWs (PR 1.69, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.47), whereas presence of physical or psychiatric comorbidities was associated with burnout among the general working population (PR 1.14, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.28; and PR 1.65, 95% CI 1.45 to 1.87, respectively). Burnout was prevalent in both HCWs and the general working population in Japan. Both common and specific risk factors were observed. Our findings highlight the need for the general workplace policy and targeted interventions for burnout prevention.","Matsuo, Yoshioka, Okubo, Nagasaki, Tabuchi","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2022-064716","20221124","mental health; occupational &amp; industrial medicine; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41660,""
"Information Technology and the Quality and Efficiency of Mental Healthcare in a time of COVID-19: A Case Study of Mental Health providers in England","In England, as elsewhere, COVID-19 has significantly affected mental health care and tested the resilience of providers. In many areas, the increased use of information technology has enabled traditional modes of service delivery to be supported or even replaced by remote forms of provision. We assessed the use and impact of information technology (IT), in remote service provision, on the quality and efficiency of mental health care during the pandemic. We drew on socio-technical systems (STS) theory as a conceptual framework to help structure data gathering, analysis and interpretation. We undertook a national scoping survey which involved documentary analysis and semi-structured interviews with six national stakeholders and case studies of four purposefully selected mental health providers in England involving interviews with 53 staff. Following the outbreak of COVID-19 mental health providers rapidly adjusted their traditional forms of service delivery, switching to digital and telephone consultations for most services. Informants provided nuanced perspectives on the impact on quality and efficiency of remote service delivery during the pandemic. Notably, it has allowed providers to attend to as many patients as possible in the face of COVID-19 restrictions, to the convenience of both patients and staff. Chief among its negative effects are concerns around the unsuitability of remote consultation for some people with mental health conditions and the potential for widening a digital divide and exacerbating existing inequalities. STS theory was found to be a suitable framework for understanding the range of systemic and sociotechnical factors which influence the use of technology in mental health care delivery in times of crisis and normalcy. While the use of IT has boosted mental health care delivery during the pandemic, it has had mixed effects on quality and efficiency. In general, patients have benefited from the convenience of remote consultation when face-to-face contact was impossible. On the other hand, patient choice was often compromised, and patient experience and outcomes might have been affected for some people with mental health conditions for which remote consultation is less suitable. Yet, the full impact of IT on the quality and efficiency of mental health care provision along with the systemic and sociotechnical determinants requires more sustained and longitudinal research.","Konteh, Mannion, Jacobs","https://doi.org/10.2196/37533","20221124","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41661,""
"The Implementation of Measurement-Based Care in the Context of Telemedicine: Qualitative Study","The Measurement Based Care in Mental Health Initiative launched by the Department of Veterans Affairs in 2016 is an example of an evidence-based practice that uses patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) to improve patient outcomes. The acceptance of measurement-based care (MBC) among Veterans Affairs providers is relatively high. However, there are barriers to MBC for telehealth providers. Health information technologies might afford opportunities to address some of the barriers related to the uptake of MBC. This paper reports on an implementation effort to integrate MBC into mental health care telehealth practice using eHealth solutions. Qualitative data were generated from 22 semistructured interviews with psychiatrists (n=4), psychologists (n=3), social workers (n=3), nurses (n=6), a pharmacist (n=1), and administrative staff (n=5) who provide telemental health care through a community-based outpatient clinic in the rural Midwestern United States. The interviews were conducted during the pilot phase of an implementation initiative to increase the adoption of MBC by revising clinic workflows to integrate the use of eHealth technologies. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Time burden and workflow issues were the most common barrier to provider adoption of MBC; sharing and reviewing pencil-and-paper measures and results in the same room was no longer possible in novel telehealth workflows necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Providers voiced concerns about how long it would take to collect, adequately score, interpret, share, and document the PROMs during the telehealth visit. Concerns about time might also correspond to a gap in providers' familiarity with these assessments, greater comfort in assessing symptoms through clinical interviews, and being accustomed to using the assessments as screening tools more so than longitudinal outcome measures. Capacities associated with eHealth technologies may address workflow concerns and promote providers' understanding and use of the measures as tracking tools. The need to use limited appointment time well was a top priority for telemental health providers. eHealth technologies provided operative supports that protect time in appointments by shifting when and how PROMs are collected. Bolstering providers' familiarity with how to use PROMs in the course of treatment may impact providers' buy-in by encouraging them to reconsider how sharing and acting on PROMs could be time well spent.","Van Tiem, Wirtz, Suiter, Heeren, Fuhrmeister, Fortney, Reisinger, Turvey","https://doi.org/10.2196/41601","20221124","data visualization; health information technology; measurement-based care; patient-reported outcome measures; telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41662,""
"Sleep Disorders and Quality of Life in Patients With Cancer: Prospective Observational Study of the Rafael Institute","Sleep disorders are a common occurrence in the general population. Yet today, it is clearly agreed that sleep disorders represent both a cancer risk factor and a biological consequence of the of the activation of the immuno-inflammatory system induced by cancer itself. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of sleep disorders on quality of life and identify the type of disorder and its causes in order to offer an adapted and personalized care plan. In a survey completed during the COVID-19 lockdown, 2000 hours of interviews were collected by remote consultations. During these calls, we administered a sleep questionnaire. This questionnaire was inspired by the STOP-BANG questionnaire and enquired about 6 items. The demographic details of each patient (eg, age and sex), the nature of the pathology, their past treatments, the ongoing cancer treatment, the mood, whether or not the patient is anxious or depressed, and the use of sleeping drug pills were analyzed. A univariate analysis was performed according to the presence or absence of fatigue. Chi-square test was applied to assess possible differences of variables' link to sleep disturbance between patients complaining of fatigue and those without fatigue. The same test was then used to analyze patients on hormone therapy and those with no hormone therapy for 2 types of cancer-breast cancer and prostate cancer. A total of 905 patients were prospectively included in this study. The average age was 66.7 (5 SD) years, and 606 (67%) patients were women; 142 patients declared being overweight. Breast cancer was the most frequently reported cancer. Nocturnal awakening was reported by 70% (n=633), fatigue by 50% (n=452), difficulty falling asleep by 38% (n=343), snoring reported by an independent observer in 38% (n=343), and apnea reported by an independent observer in 9% (n=81) of the patients. The univariate analysis showed that the feeling of tiredness was significantly greater in patients reporting difficulty falling asleep (P&#x2265;.99), pain (P&lt;.001), and frequent awakening (P&lt;.001), as well as in patients who were not receiving cancer treatment (P&lt;.001). The univariate analysis showed that patients who were receiving breast cancer treatment and were under hormone therapy reported difficulty falling asleep (P=.04) and pain (P=.05). In a univariate analysis of patients treated for prostate cancer, being overweight was the only factor reported that had a statistically significant value. Our preliminary data support and are consistent with data in the literature regarding the importance of sleep disorders in oncology. This justifies the usefulness of a diagnosis and early treatment of sleep disorders in patients with cancer. The Rafael Institute sleep observatory will enable patients to be identified and treated.","Scher, Guetta, Draghi, Yahiaoui, Terzioglu, Butaye, Henriques, Alavoine, Elharar, Guetta, Toledano","https://doi.org/10.2196/37371","20221124","breast; cancer; cancer care; cancer treatment; care plan; customization; customized; fatigue; hormone therapy; mood; nocturnal; obese; oncology; overweight; pain; patient-centered; patient-centred approach; personalization; personalized; prostate; quality of life; sleep; sleep disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41663,""
"Multidomain cognitive impairment in non-hospitalized patients with the post-COVID-19 syndrome: results from a prospective monocentric cohort","A fraction of patients with asymptomatic to mild/moderate acute COVID-19 disease report cognitive deficits as part of the post-COVID-19 syndrome. This study aimed to assess the neuropsychological profile of these patients. Assessment at baseline (three months or more following acute COVID-19) of a monocentric prospective cohort of patients with post-COVID-19 syndrome. Multidomain neuropsychological tests were performed, and questionnaires on depression, anxiety, fatigue, sleep, and general health status were administered. Of the 58 patients screened, six were excluded due to possible alternative causes of cognitive impairment (major depression, neurodegenerative disease). Of the remaining 52 individuals, only one had a below-threshold screening result on Mini-Mental State Examination, and 13 scored below the cut-off on Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Extended neuropsychological testing revealed a neurocognitive disorder (NCD) in 31 (59.6%) participants with minor NCD in the majority of cases (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;26). In patients with NCD, the cognitive domains learning/memory and executive functions were impaired in 60.7%, complex attention in 51.6%, language in 35.5%, and perceptual-motor function in 29.0%. Cognitive profiles were associated with daytime sleepiness but not with depression, anxiety, sleep quality, total general health status, or fatigue. Neurocognitive impairment can be confirmed in around 60% of individuals with self-reported deficits as part of post-COVID-19 syndrome following a mild acute COVID-19 disease course. Notably, screening tests cannot reliably detect this dysfunction. Standard psychiatric assessments showed no association with cognitive profiles. Longitudinal studies are needed to further evaluate the course of neurocognitive deficits and clarify pathophysiology.","Schild, Goereci, Scharfenberg, Klein, L&#xfc;lling, Meiberth, Schweitzer, St&#xfc;rmer, Zeyen, Sahin, Fink, Jessen, Franke, Onur, Kessler, Warnke, Maier","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00415-022-11444-w","20221124","Cognitive deficits; Neurocognitive disorder; Neuropsychology; Post-COVID-19 syndrome; SARS-CoV-2; Subjective deficits","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41664,""
"Data-Driven Path Analytic Modeling to Understand Underlying Mechanisms in COVID-19 Survivors Suffering from Long-Term Post-COVID Pain: A Spanish Cohort Study","Pain can be present in up to 50% of people with post-COVID-19 condition. Understanding the complexity of post-COVID pain can help with better phenotyping of this post-COVID symptom. The aim of this study is to describe the complex associations between sensory-related, psychological, and cognitive variables in previously hospitalized COVID-19 survivors with post-COVID pain, recruited from three hospitals in Madrid (Spain) by using data-driven path analytic modeling. Demographic (i.e., age, height, and weight), sensory-related (intensity or duration of pain, central sensitization-associated symptoms, and neuropathic pain features), psychological (anxiety and depressive levels, and sleep quality), and cognitive (catastrophizing and kinesiophobia) variables were collected in a sample of 149 subjects with post-COVID pain. A Bayesian network was used for structural learning, and the structural model was fitted using structural equation modeling (SEM). The SEM model fit was excellent: RMSEA &amp;lt; 0.001, CFI = 1.000, SRMR = 0.063, and NNFI = 1.008. The only significant predictor of post-COVID pain was the level of depressive symptoms (&#x3b2;=0.241, <i>p</i> = 0.001). Higher levels of anxiety were associated with greater central sensitization-associated symptoms by a magnitude of &#x3b2;=0.406 (<i>p</i> = 0.008). Males reported less severe neuropathic pain symptoms (-1.50 SD S-LANSS score, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001) than females. A higher level of depressive symptoms was associated with worse sleep quality (&#x3b2;=0.406, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001), and greater levels of catastrophizing (&#x3b2;=0.345, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001). This study presents a model for post-COVID pain where psychological factors were related to central sensitization-associated symptoms and sleep quality. Further, maladaptive cognitions, such as catastrophizing, were also associated with depression. Finally, females reported more neuropathic pain features than males. Our data-driven model could be leveraged in clinical trials investigating treatment approaches in COVID-19 survivors with post-COVID pain and can represent a first step for the development of a theoretical/conceptual framework for post-COVID pain.","Fern&#xe1;ndez-de-Las-Pe&#xf1;as, Liew, Herrero-Montes, Del-Valle-Loarte, Rodr&#xed;guez-Rosado, Ferrer-Pargada, Neblett, Paras-Bravo","https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens11111336","20221124","COVID-19; bayesian network; pain; post-COVID; structural equation modeling","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41665,""
"Meditation and Yoga for Irritable Bowel Syndrome: A Randomized Clinical Trial","Delivered in person, yoga is effective in managing irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms. The evidence for efficacy, feasibility, and safety of virtually delivered yoga for patients with IBS is unknown. Adults diagnosed with IBS were randomized to either Hatha yoga intervention of 8 weekly online classes delivered virtually or an advice-only control group and assessed at baseline and postintervention. We used an unadjusted ANOVA to determine differences between and within groups on the primary outcome (decrease of &#x2265;50 points in IBS Symptom Severity Scale [IBS-SSS]) and secondary outcomes (quality of life, anxiety and depression, fatigue, somatic symptoms, perceived stress, COVID-19 stress, and self-compassion). We assessed feasibility through recruitment and attrition rates, adherence, participant satisfaction, and safety (i.e., adverse events). Seventy-nine people participated (mean age 45.4 years [SD = 14.0], 92% women, 20% attrition rate). IBS-SSS decreased significantly in the treatment group (&#x394;change = 54.7, P = 0.028), but not in the control group (&#x394;change = 22.6, P = 0.277). Fourteen patients (37%) in the yoga group reached a clinically relevant decrease of &#x2265;50 points on the IBS-SSS postintervention compared with 8 patients (20%) in the control group (P = 0.242). No significant difference was found between groups in IBS-SSS score postintervention (P = 0.149), but significant differences in favor of the treatment group for quality of life (P = 0.030), fatigue (P = 0.035), and perceived stress (P = 0.040) were identified. The yoga program demonstrated feasibility. Intention to practice yoga decreased significantly in both groups from baseline to postintervention (P &lt; 0.001). However, the decline in intention did not correlate with practice minutes. Virtually delivered yoga is safe and feasible, and effective in reducing IBS symptoms.

"Behavioral and Dietary Habits That Could Influence Both COVID-19 and Non-Communicable Civilization Disease Prevention-What Have We Learned Up to Now?","The massive expansion of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has urged countries to introduce lockdowns and set restrictive actions worldwide. The focus of the studies was to determine how COVID-19 induces damage to the lungs in order to find an alternative or adjuvant therapy that could lead to preventing COVID-19 or at least ameliorating it. This paper aims to survey the literature and provide new insights into behavioral and dietary habits that could influence the prevention of COVID-19. Maintaining an adequate mental health status, sleep, and taking moderate exercise are often disrupted in the conditions of lockdown and are followed by weakened immunity. Mediterranean and vegetarian diets are superior to other eating patterns in terms of immunity boosting and fighting COVID-19. Our study showed how adequate hydration, green tea intake, and supplementation with vitamins D, C, and E can increase our chances of avoiding the infection and even help us sleep better. Another focus of the research was on determining what level of hygiene really increases one's chances of not contracting SARS-CoV-2, but this seems a little counter-intuitive at first. Since an immunocompromised state is a familiar predisposing factor for all contagious diseases, maintaining healthy behavioral and dietary habits could be a crucial step in boosting immunity and preventing COVID-19.","Veljkovi&#x107;, Pavlovi&#x107;, Stojanovi&#x107;, D&#x17e;opali&#x107;, Popovi&#x107; Dragonji&#x107;","https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina58111686","20221124","COVID-19; anti-inflammatory; antioxidant; immunity; prevention; supplementation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41667,""

A large sample of the Greek general population (N = 583) completed the validated versions of the Fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19s) and the 12-item Short Form (SF-12), and provided data on socio-demographic status, health history and COVID-19 protective behaviors. Variables were compared with Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests and associations with Spearman's correlations. Gamma regression models investigated the influence of sociodemographic and COVID-related variables on HRQoL. The mean FCV-19s score for the sample was 18.3 &#xb1; 5.6, and physical and mental component summary scores were 50.2 &#xb1; 7.9 and 46.7 &#xb1; 10.1, respectively.

Contrastingly, less fear was expressed by unvaccinated individuals and those with less frequent intake of information about the pandemic. Item level and overall FCV-19s scores were negatively associated with SF-12 summary scores, and fear of COVID-19 was the most important predictor of both physical and mental HRQoL.

"Anxiety, Depression, and PTSD among College Students in the Post-COVID-19 Era: A Cross-Sectional Study","In the post-COVID-19 era, significant changes have taken place regarding the epidemic, the economy, family and social life. However, it remains unclear how these changes encompass the psychological symptoms of college students. We carried out a cross-sectional study to investigate anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms among college students from 10 November 2020, to 16 November 2020. The questionnaire included a self-designed canvas, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), and Impact of Event Scale (IES-R). Factors associated with psychological symptoms were estimated by ordered and non-conditional logistic regression analysis. Of 4754 participants, 25.0%, 29.7%, 3.4%, 15.3%, 17.1%, and 2.9% reported anxiety, depression, PTSD symptoms, one, any two, and all three, respectively. In cases with anxiety or depression symptoms, there was a 9.11% comorbidity with PTSD. Factors associated with fears of being infected, social, family, and economic changes increased the risk of psychological symptoms in college students caused by COVID-19. Female college students, identified with anxiety or depression symptoms, were at a lower risk of developing PTSD symptoms (OR, 0.61, 95% CI: 0.43-0.86). Non-medical majors at university, rural residence, higher educational background, fear of taking public transport, and deterioration of family relationships increased the risk for PTSD symptoms among male respondents with anxiety or depression symptoms due to COVID-19. Factors correlated with psychological symptoms had expanded from the fear of being infected to extensive social, family, and economic changes caused by COVID-19. Therefore, screening and interventions for psychological symptoms should be consistently strengthened and more targeted to college students in the post-COVID-19 era.","Wang, Zhang, Pu, Li, Chen, Li","https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci12111553","20221124","COVID-19; PTSD; anxiety; college students; depression; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41669,""

"The Influence of COVID-19 Pandemic on the Frequent Use of E-Cigarettes and Its Association with Substance Use and Mental Health Symptoms","Although several studies examined the association between e-cigarettes, substance use, and mental health conditions, there is limited research on whether COVID-19-related stress and health outcomes, mental health symptoms, and substance use differ by the frequency of e-cigarette use during the COVID-19 pandemic. We assessed the association of past 30-day frequent use of e-cigarettes with alcohol, cannabis, anxiety/depression, and COVID-19 impact. We conducted a national online cross-sectional survey among a random sample of US adults aged 18 years or older (N = 5065) between 13 May 2021, and 9 January 2022. A multinomial logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the study aims. Of the participants, 7.17% reported once to several times per month (OSTPM), 6.95% reported once to several times per week (OSTPW), and 6.57% reported every day to several times per day (ESTPD) use of e-cigarettes in the past month. Alcohol and cannabis use ESTPD and once to several times per week/month (OSTPW/M) were associated with a higher likelihood of e-cigarette use ESTPD and OSTPW/M, respectively. Anxiety/depression was associated with e-cigarette use ESTPD and OSTPW.

"Examining Nurses' Vengeful Behaviors: The Effects of Toxic Leadership and Psychological Well-Being","Toxic leadership is becoming increasingly common in healthcare organizations and there is strong need for studies focusing on organizational factors that can trigger revenge. Additionally, how psychological well-being functions in shielding against toxicity has not been adequately studied. Hence, this study aims to examine the relationship between toxic leadership and vengeful behaviors of nurses, along with the contingency of psychological well-being on the relationship during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this exploratory cross-sectional study, we attempt to examine the antecedent effect of toxic leadership on vengeful behaviors based on self-reports from 311 nurses. Using partial least squares and moderation analyses, the results show that toxic leadership is an important antecedent of vengeful behaviors among nurses. However, the results provide no statistical evidence to support a moderating role of psychological well-being in the relationship between toxic leadership and vengeful behaviors. This study reveals that nurses exposed to toxic behaviors by their superiors are more likely to engage in vengeance and highlights the fact that nurses are suffering psychologically during the pandemic.","Ko&#xe7;, &#x15e;ahin, &#xd6;ngel, G&#xfc;nsel, Schermer","https://doi.org/10.3390/bs12110452","20221124","administrative nursing research; leadership; mental health; personal satisfaction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41672,""
"Non-Pathological Psychological Distress among Mainland Chinese in Canada and Its Sociodemographic Risk Factors amidst the Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated health inequalities, with a potentially heightened mental health risk for Mainland Chinese in Canada, given the rising anti-Chinese discrimination, and barriers in assessing health services. In this context, this study aimed to assess non-pathological psychological distress towards COVID-19 and identify its sociodemographic risk factors among Mainland Chinese in Canada at the early stages of the pandemic. A sample of 731 Mainland Chinese aged 16 or older completed an on-line survey to examine their attitudes, behavioural, and psychological responses towards COVID-19. Non-pathological psychological distress was assessed with a 7-item self-report scale to capture common emotional reactions towards COVID-19. A factor analysis revealed a single-factor structure of the 7-item COVID-19 psychological distress scale (Eigen &#x3bb; = 3.79). A composite psychological distress index (PDI) score was calculated from these items and used as the outcome variable. Multivariate regression models identified age, financial satisfaction, health status, and perceived/experienced discrimination as significant predictors of psychological distress (<i>p</i>s &#x2264; 0.05). Mainland Chinese in Canada who were over 25, in poor financial/health status, or with perceived/experienced discrimination were at a higher risk for COVID-19-related psychological distress. The health inequity across these factors would inform the services to mitigate mental health risk in minority groups.","Yang, Yu, Kandasamy, Wang, Shi, Zhang, Wang","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10112326","20221124","COVID-19; Mainland Chinese in Canada; health disparity; psychological distress; sociodemographic predictors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41673,""
"Gender-Specific Effect of Couple-Based Intervention on Behavioral and Psychological Outcomes of Older Adults with Type 2 Diabetes during the COVID-19 Partial Lockdown in Guangzhou, China","This study aimed to evaluate the gender-specific effect of a couple-based intervention on the management behaviors and mental well-being of community-dwelling older adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus during the COVID-19 partial lockdown in Guangzhou. Out of 207 participants involved in a prior randomized controlled trial (Trial no. ChiCTR1900027137), 156 (75%) completed the COVID-19 survey. Gendered differences in management behaviors and depressive symptoms between the couple-based intervention group and the patient-only control group were compared by distance to the high-risk areas cross-sectionally and longitudinally using random intercept models. Cross-sectionally, female patients of the intervention group had more positive behavior change scores (<i>&#x3b2;</i> = 1.53, <i>p</i> = 0.002) and fewer depressive symptoms (<i>&#x3b2;</i> = -1.34, <i>p</i> = 0.02) than the control group. Over time, female patients lived closer to the high-risk areas (&amp;lt;5 km) and showed decreasing depressive symptoms (<i>&#x3b2;</i> = -4.48, <i>p</i> = 0.008) in the intervention group vs. the control group. No statistically significant between-group difference was found for males. Females tended to benefit more from the coupled-based intervention than males did, particularly among these closer to the high-risk areas.

"Deriving Meaning from Chaos: The Mediating Role of the Sense of Coherence in the Serial Relationships among Fear of COVID-19, Indices of Psychological Distress, and Life Satisfaction","The current study focused on the role of the sense of coherence (SOC) in the serial relationships among the fear of COVID-19, indices of psychological distress, and life satisfaction. It examined the hypothesis that an SOC would mitigate the impact of the fear of COVID-19 on psychological distress, which in turn would positively impact life satisfaction. Participants were school teachers (N = 355) who completed the Fear of COVID-19 Scale, the trait scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Beck Hopelessness Scale, the short form of the Sense of Coherence Scale, and the Satisfaction with Life Scale. A path analysis confirmed the mediating role of the dimensions of the SOC in the relationships among the fear of COVID-19, indices of psychological distress, and life satisfaction. Specifically, comprehensibility, meaningfulness, and manageability were found to mediate the associations between the fear of COVID-19 and anxiety, and the fear of COVID-19 and hopelessness, which in turn were associated with higher levels of life satisfaction. The findings confirmed that an SOC is an important source of resilience. Interventions that facilitate the re-appraisal of stressors as challenges and enhance the awareness of practical coping strategies can build an SOC and promote mental health.","Pretorius, Padmanabhanunni","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10112276","20221124","anxiety; fear of COVID-19; hopelessness; life satisfaction; sense of coherence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41675,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Health and Lifestyle in Thai Occupational Therapy Students: A Mixed Method Study","The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have led to global reports of hazards to mental health. However, reports regarding lifestyle changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic are lacking. Using a convergent mixed methods design, we conducted individual interviews with twelve occupational therapy students and interpreted the results by content analysis. We completed a survey of Thai Sensory Patterns Assessment (TSPA) concerning perspectives from occupational therapy students (<i>n</i> = 99). They identified two major themes: (i) adaptive responses were consistent with areas of occupation during the COVID-19 pandemic; (ii) multidimensional challenges were related to sensory patterns of purposeful and meaningful activities. The participants reported both positive and negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on their lives. It had both positive and negative effects on the lifestyle of students affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The positive effect was that most students learned better ways to protect and care for themselves. During the COVID-19 pandemic, occupational therapy students were most concerned about their online learning activities, economic problems, isolation from society, and lifestyle. The negative effects of this include stress, anxiety, loneliness, frustration, boredom, and exhaustion for occupational therapy students. As an impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, occupational therapy students adapted to new lifestyles and experienced mental health issues related to their studies, families, friends, economics, social climate, and future job opportunities. Educators may use the findings of this study to prevent negative impacts on mental health and promote academic achievement in the future, as well as general well-being, efficacy, and empowerment of students in the new normal post-COVID-19 pandemic era.","Srikhamjak, Yanawuth, Sucharittham, Larprabang, Wangsattabongkot, Hauwadhanasuk, Thawisuk, Thichanpiang, Kaunnil","https://doi.org/10.3390/ejihpe12110118","20221124","COVID-19; lifestyle; occupational therapy students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41676,""
"Annual Research Review: The impact of Covid-19 on psychopathology in children and young people worldwide: systematic review of studies with pre- and within-pandemic data","The high volume and pace of research has posed challenges to researchers, policymakers and practitioners wanting to understand the overall impact of the pandemic on children and young people's mental health. We aimed to search for and review the evidence from epidemiological studies to answer the question: how has mental health changed in the general population of children and young people? Four databases (Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE and PsychINFO) were searched in October 2021, with searches updated in February 2022. We aimed to identify studies of children or adolescents with a mean age of 18&#x2009;years or younger at baseline, that reported change on a validated mental health measure from prepandemic to during the pandemic. Abstracts and full texts were double-screened against inclusion criteria and quality assessed using a risk of bias tool. Studies were narratively synthesised, and meta-analyses were performed where studies were sufficiently similar. 6917 records were identified, and 51 studies included in the review. Only four studies had a rating of high quality. Studies were highly diverse in terms of design, setting, timing in relation to the pandemic, population, length of follow-up and choice of measure. Methodological heterogeneity limited the potential to conduct meta-analyses across studies. Whilst the evidence suggested a slight deterioration on some measures, overall, the findings were mixed, with no clear pattern emerging. Our findings highlight the need for a more harmonised approach to research in this field. Despite the sometimes-inconsistent results of our included studies, the evidence supports existing concerns about the impact of Covid-19 on children's mental health and on services for this group, given that even small changes can have a significant impact on provision at population level. Children and young people must be prioritised in pandemic recovery, and explicitly considered in planning for any future pandemic response.","Newlove-Delgado, Russell, Mathews, Cross, Bryant, Gudka, Ukoumunne, Ford","https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpp.13716","20221124","Covid-19; children; mental health; pandemic; young people","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41677,""

This study investigated the effect of changes in family life due to COVID-19 on depressive mood and stress perception. We used data from the ""Survey on changes in family life due to COVID-19"" in Korea. The final study population comprised 1500 adults with children aged &#x2264;19 years. Of the total respondents, 59.3% responded that depressive mood and stress had increased due to COVID-19. However, among them, 46.6% did not attempt to resolve or could not find a way to resolve their depressive mood and stress. In multiple logistic regression analyses, a decrease in household income and increased household expenditure due to COVID-19 were significantly associated with an increased risk of depressive mood and stress perception. Depressive mood and stress were significantly higher in respondents who answered that they had experienced family conflicts. These results could be used to assess changes in family life and manage mental health when a new infectious disease occurs. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the long-term effects of changes in family life due to COVID-19 on mental health.","Kim, Han, Park, Ryu","https://doi.org/10.1177/10105395221139346","20221124","COVID-19; child care; depression; family relations; psychological stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41678,""
"Effect of text message communication on patient presentation for an influenza vaccination in a community-based pharmacy setting","Community pharmacies use text message communications for information regarding approaching refills and fill status. Patients can also be notified regarding annual influenza vaccine availability and schedule an appointment for the vaccine. This study aimed to evaluate whether text message communications affected patient presentation and resulted in a percent increase of patients receiving an influenza vaccine compared with previous vaccine season and to determine whether additional vaccines are administered upon presentation. Ambidirectional study retrospectively analyzed the impact, nationally, of a new text message communication on influenza vaccinations at a large community pharmacy chain and prospectively surveyed patients receiving an influenza vaccine at 2 geographically similar pharmacies of the chain in Southwest Virginia. Text message communications regarding vaccine and appointment availability were sent to patients at the age of 18 years and older who opted in to text message communications and received an influenza vaccine with the chain during the 2019-2020 influenza season. Vaccine data from consecutive seasons were compared. Eligible patients in Southwest Virginia were surveyed about how they were informed about availability, previous intent to receive an influenza vaccine, applicability to other vaccines, and effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on vaccination. Results were analyzed using bivariate and multivariate analyses. Nationally, influenza vaccines administered increased by 17.45% in patients who permitted text message communication and overall by 13.22% after implementation. Decreases in co-administered pneumococcal vaccines and tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccines and an increase in co-administered zoster vaccines were observed. A total of 111 patients were surveyed; 4% presented owing to text message communication. A majority were intent on receiving the vaccine before being notified and reported that the pandemic did not affect presentation. Notably, 45.05% of patients were likely to receive routine vaccines if notified by text message. Text message communications are another viable way to increase vaccinations, but further studies should be conducted outside of a pandemic setting.","Cabatit, Grant, Nadpara, Goode","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.japh.2022.07.005","20221107","Humans; Adolescent; Influenza Vaccines; Pharmacies; Text Messaging; Influenza, Human; Retrospective Studies; COVID-19; Vaccination; Communication; Pharmacy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41679,""
"Adaptive R&amp;D contract for urgently needed drugs: Lessons from COVID-19 vaccine development","This paper analyzes an incentive contract for new vaccine research and development (R&amp;D) under pandemic situations such as COVID-19, considering the R&amp;D contract's adaptability to the pandemic. We study how the public sector (government) designs the adaptive R&amp;D contract and offers it to pharmaceutical enterprises. An agency-theoretic model is employed to explore the contract whose terms are an upfront grant as a fixed fee and a sales tax credit as an incentive tool, examining how the values of related parameters affect contract term determinations. We found that the adaptability factor derived from urgent policies such as emergency use authorization (EUA) as well as tax credits, can be utilized as practical incentive tools that lead vaccine developers to increase their effort levels for R&amp;D success. We also found that public-private state-emergency contracts may not follow the conventional wisdom. Counterintuitively, dependency on tax credits (incentive part) decrease as the client's degree of risk averseness increases in the emergency contract.","Ryan Choi, Yoon, Song","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.omega.2022.102727","20220922","Adaptive R&amp;D contract; Agency theory; COVID-19; Incentive tools; Tax credit","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41680,""
"Semen parameters after SARS-CoV-2 infection: A literature review","The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2&#xa0;(SARS-CoV-2) is known to affect multiple organs by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors and might therefore affect male fertility. This review aims to collect all original articles on the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on male fertility, including the duration of time after infection required for these effects to begin to manifest and recommend how clinicians should approach cases with a recent illness. This review was developed according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines. The search string was applied to four online databases-namely Pubmed, Embase, Medline, and the Cochrane COVID-19&#xa0;Register-and screened using the online tool Covidence.org. Articles were eligible for inclusion if they were cohort studies involving a healthy male population diagnosed with COVID-19, each of whom had semen samples collected before and after the infection or two different semen samples collected after the diagnosis. Nine cohort studies were eventually included. Five articles had pre- and post-COVID-19 data while four had two sets of post-COVID-19 data. The three largest studies found a statistically significant decrease in all semen parameters when waiting less than 3 months from diagnosis before sample collection, and no significant differences in results when the ejaculate was analyzed more than 3 months after recovery. One study compared the COVID-19 patients with a control group and found a significant decrease in semen parameters in the COVID-19 group. Spermatogenesis seems to be affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the impact tends to reverse within 3-4 months. It is still unclear why male fertility is affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection, and it might be the result of several different components. Clinicians should consider recent SARS-CoV-2 infection as a possible reason for the low semen quality of patients' semen samples, and might therefore need to collect new samples after 4 months before further treatment.","Tufvesson, Catalini, Fedder","https://doi.org/10.1002/hsr2.745","20220813","COVID&#x2010;19; SARS&#x2010;CoV&#x2010;2; male infertility; semen parameters; spermatogenesis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41681,""
"Impact and Value of Hospital Antibiotic Stewardship: Retrospective Pre-COVID-19-Pandemic Analysis","""Antimicrobial stewardship"" (AMS) is defined as a healthcare-system-wide approach to promoting and monitoring the judicious use of antimicrobials to preserve their future effectiveness.

The research covered the antibiotic prescriptions at the University Hospital (U.H.) ""San Giovanni di Dio e Ruggi d'Aragona"", Salerno, Italy, comparing data on the therapies prescribed from 1 January to 31 December 2017 (27,384 patients) with those collected during the same period in 2019 (27,047 patients). Unlike national data, our results highlighted a decreasing trend in the consumption of antibiotics that did not concern only carbapenems and fluoroquinolones, but also the third-generation cephalosporins. Noteworthily, there was also a reduction in 2019 compared with 2017 in the consumption of colistin, an antibiotic towards which an increase in bacterial resistance in animals has been found nationally. In agreement with the national data, our research confirms a trend of an increase (+3.7%) in the total antibiotic consumption corresponding to more than 26% and 29% reductions in the total and therapy per-day costs, respectively.

"Curcumin partly prevents ISG15 activation via ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1-like protein and decreases ISGylation","The expression of the ubiquitin-like molecule interferon-stimulated gene 15&#xa0;kDa (ISG15) and post-translational protein modification by ISG15 (ISGylation) are strongly activated by interferons or pathogen infection, suggesting that ISG15 and ISGylation play an important role in innate immune responses. More than 400 proteins have been found to be ISGylated. ISG15 is removed from substrates by interferon-induced ubiquitin-specific peptidase 18 or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2&#x2012;derived papain-like protease. Therefore, maintaining strong ISGylation may help prevent the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, it is unknown whether nutrients or chemicals affect ISGylation level. Curcumin is the major constituent of turmeric and functions as an immunomodulator. Here, we investigated the effect of curcumin on ISGylation. MCF10A and A549&#xa0;cells were treated with interferon &#x3b1; and curcumin after which the expression levels of various proteins were determined. The effect of curcumin on ubiquitylation was also determined. Curcumin treatment was found to reduce ISGylation in a dose-dependent manner. The findings suggested that curcumin partly prevents disulfide bond-mediated ISG15 dimerization directly or indirectly, thereby increasing monomer ISG15 levels. Reduced ISGylation may also occur via the prevention of ISG15 activation by ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1-like protein. In conclusion, curcumin treatment was found to reduce ISGylation, suggesting that it may contribute to severe COVID-19. This is the first study to report a relationship between ISGylation and a food component.","Oki, Yamada, Tanaka, Fukui, Hatakeyama, Okumura","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2022.08.003","20220902","Curcumin; ISGylation; Interferon; Interferon-stimulated gene 15&#xa0;kDa; and SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease; Antiviral Agents; Autophagy-Related Protein 7; COVID-19; Curcumin; Cytokines; Humans; Interferon-alpha; Ubiquitin-Activating Enzymes; Ubiquitins","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41683,""
"Impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on the livelihoods of rural households in the community forestry landscape in the Middle Hills of Nepal","The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has severely affected all sectors of the economy, and the impacts are expected to last-long. One major impact is that migrants return to their original households in rural communities due to loss of jobs. Since rural communities are highly dependent on forest and agriculture for livelihoods, an influx of return migrants likely increases the consumption of forest products and intensifies the agriculture practices, increasing the pressure on forest resources. Based on in-person interview of 215 in 2018 before the pandemic and a phone interview of the same 215 rural households in 2021 at the peak of the pandemic in Kavrepalanchowk district in Nepal, this study addresses the following research questions: (1) Does COVID-19 exert differential impacts among the socio-economic groups? (2) How do return migrants affect the rural land use? (3) Do return migrants put additional pressure on forests resources? The rare before-and-after dataset provide a precious opportunity to assess the COVID-19 impacts on the livelihoods of rural households in the community forestry landscape in the Middle Hills of Nepal. We found that the impacts of COVID-19 were severe on the households with larger family size, those belonging to the marginalized caste groups, having lower number of livestock, low wellbeing index, those who rely on daily wage-based occupation, with low level of education, and the households with return migrants. A significant number of migrants were found to return to their village of origin. As a result, there was a decrease in abandoned land and an increase in the livestock number and forest product use. These findings provide timely insights for the post-pandemic recovery efforts in better targeting needy household with limited resource in the community forestry landscape in the Middle Hills of Nepal.","Bista, Parajuli, Giri, Karki, Song","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tfp.2022.100312","20220906","COVID-19; Community forest; Forest pressure; Livelihood; Migrant returnees; Rural household","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41684,""
"Resign or carry-on? District and principal leadership as drivers of change in teacher turnover intentions during the COVID-19 crisis: A latent growth model examination","During the COVID-19 pandemic, teachers in the United States, an already at-risk occupation group, experienced new work-related stressors, safety concerns, and work-life challenges, magnifying on-going retention concerns. Integrating the crisis management literature with the unfolding model of turnover, we theorize that leader actions trigger initial employee responses but also set the stage for on-going crisis response that influence changes in teachers' turnover intentions. We apply latent growth curve modelling to test our hypotheses based on a sample of 617 K-12 teachers using nine waves of data, including a baseline survey at the start of the 2020-2021 school year and eight follow-up surveys (2-week lags) through the Fall 2020 semester. In terms of overall adaptation, teachers on average, experienced an increase in work-life balance and a decrease in turnover intentions over the course of the semester. Results also suggest that district and school leadership provide unique and complementary resources, but leader behaviours that shape <i>initial</i> crisis responses do not similarly affect employee responses <i>during</i> crisis, contrary to theory. Instead, teachers' adaptive crisis response trajectories were triggered by continued resource provision over the semester; increasing provision of valued resources (i.e., continued refinement of safety practices) and improvements in work-life balance prevented turnover intentions from spiralling throughout the crisis. Crisis management theory and research should continue to incorporate temporal dynamics and identify factors that contribute to crisis response trajectories, using designs and analyses that allow for examination as crises unfold in real time.","Matthews, Wayne, Smith, Casper, Wang, Streit","https://doi.org/10.1111/joop.12397","20220810","Turnover intentions; crisis management; education; safety; work&#x2010;life balance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41685,""

Two patients had a medical history of living-donor kidney transplantation, and 1 patient was a kidney donor. We present symptoms, diagnostic processes, laboratory and imaging results, and treatment approach. Patient 1 was 29-year-old woman with new-onset diabetes mellitus due to SARS-CoV-2, which required temporary insulin treatment. Patient 2 was a 34-year-old man with fever, chronic fatigue, back pain, and abdominal pain. Imagining showed acalculous cholecystitis, epiploic appendagitis of the right colic flexure, and inflammation of pericardial fat pad in the left cardiophrenic angle. Coagulopathy due to COVID-19 was the most probable cause of the described processes. Therapeutic doses of low-molecular-weight heparin were administered. Patient 3 was a 68-year-old male kidney donor who had painless, nodular, reddening lesions on both shins, accompanied by itching on both shins and recurrent fever. The diagnosis of erythema nodosum during COVID-19 was made. After treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin, significant decreases of symptoms were observed. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that SARS-CoV-2 infection can have a varied course and can involve other systems and organs. Physicians should be aware of possible extrapulmonary symptoms associated with infection with this virus. Correct diagnosis is a prerequisite for proper treatment and prevention of unexpected complications.","Barbachowska, Gozdowska, Piotrowska-Kownacka, Sawicka, D&#x119;borska-Materkowska, Skolimowska, Durlik","https://doi.org/10.12659/AOT.935874","20220810","Adult; Aged; COVID-19; Female; Heparin, Low-Molecular-Weight; Humans; Male; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41687,""
"Characteristics of pediatric COVID-19 patients admitted to the emergency department and factors associated with pneumonia","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that causes a respiratory illness, continues to be a global pandemic. In this study, we purpose to identify the features of children with COVID-19 and the factors affecting disease severity. This is a retrospective, observational study was conducted on patients who presented with suspicion of COVID-19 from April 1, 2020, to March 31, 2021, at a tertiary care medical center in Turkey. The characteristics of 640 children who were confirmed to have COVID-19 by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were retrieved from medical records. The mean age of the cases was 10 &#xb1; 6 years, and 56% of them were male. Seasonal difference did not affect the number of cases. The majority of the cases (<i>n</i> = 501, 78%) were infected by family members. Fever (67%) and cough (38%) were common complaints. The mean duration of fever was 1.9 &#xb1; 1.1 days. One-fourth of the cases were asymptomatic, 462 (72%) had mild upper respiratory tract infections, and 18 (3%) had pneumonia. Patients with pneumonia were more likely to have comorbidities and had a longer fever duration (both <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). Fever, cough, and respiratory distress were more common in patients with pneumonia (<i>P</i> = 0.010, <i>P</i> = 0.023, and <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001, respectively). The mean C-reactive protein (CRP) value of the patients with pneumonia was significantly higher than that of the others (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). A total of 70 (11%) complicated patients were hospitalized, 5 of them requiring intensive care admission. All hospitalized patients were discharged with recovery. Although pediatric COVID-19 patients tended to have a mild disease, some children with comorbidities can still develop a severe illness. CRP value is a useful indicator in the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. Furthermore, the prevalence rate of COVID-19 did not decrease with hot seasons.","Yurtseven, Turan, &#xd6;zenen, I&#x15f;ik, Bal, Sert&#xf6;z, Saz","https://doi.org/10.4103/2452-2473.348434","20220809","Children; clinical characteristics; coronavirus disease 2019; emergency department; pneumonia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41688,""
"Efficacy of mRNA anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and dynamics of humoral immune response in patients with solid tumors: results from the institutional registry of an Italian tertiary cancer center","Systemic immunosuppression characterizing cancer patients represents a concern regarding the efficacy of anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination, and real-world evidence is needed to define the efficacy and the dynamics of humoral immune response to mRNA-based anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. We conducted an observational study that included patients with solid tumors who were candidates for mRNA anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination at the Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milan, Italy. The primary objective was to monitor the immunologic response to the mRNA anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in terms of anti-spike antibody levels. All the patients received two doses of the mRNA-1273 vaccine or the BNT162b2 vaccine. Healthcare workers served as a control group of healthy subjects. Among the 243 patients included in the present analysis, 208 (85.60%) and 238 (97.94%) resulted seroconverted after the first and the second dose of vaccine, respectively. Only five patients (2.06%) had a negative titer after the second dose. No significant differences in the rate of seroconversion after two vaccine doses were observed in patients as compared with the control group of healthy subjects. Age and anticancer treatment class had an independent impact on the antibody titer after the second dose of vaccination. In a subgroup of 171 patients with available data about the third timepoint, patients receiving immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors seem to have a higher peak of antibodies soon after the second dose (3&#x2009;weeks after), but a more pronounced decrease at a late timepoint (3&#x2009;months after). The systemic immunosuppression characterizing cancer patients did not seem to dramatically affect the humoral response to anti-SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in our population of patients with solid tumors. Further investigation is needed to dissect the interplay between immunotherapy and longitudinal dynamics of humoral response to mRNA vaccines, as well as to analyze the cellular response to mRNA vaccines in cancer patients.","Fuc&#xe0;, Lecchi, Ciniselli, Ottini, Spagnoletti, Mazzeo, Morelli, Frati, Stroscia, Ebrahem, Sottotetti, Galli, D'Elia, Lobefaro, Ducceschi, Di Guardo, Bhoori, Provenzano, Platania, Niger, Colombo, Nichetti, Duca, Rivoltini, Mortarini, Baili, Apolone, de Braud, Verderio, Damian","https://doi.org/10.1177/17588359221108687","20220805","COVID19; SARS-CoV-2; cancer patients; mRNA vaccine; solid tumors; vaccination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41689,""
"Internal factors affecting the mother's psychological capital in exclusive breastfeeding during the COVID-19 pandemic","During the pandemic, in terms of breastfeeding, most mothers experience anxiety and discomfort. The impact of this condition will decrease the production of breast milk. The purpose of this study was to determine the internal factors that affect the psychological capital of mothers when breastfeeding during the COVID-19 pandemic in Petiken Village, Gresik. This study was an analytical study with a cross-sectional approach. The population of this study was all breastfeeding mothers who had babies aged 6-12&#x2009;months. The sampling technique used was simple random sampling involving 102 respondents. The independent variables were motivation, perception, and attitude. The dependent variable was psychological capital. Data were collected from June to July 2021. The data analysis was conducted using the logistic regression test to determine the variable with a significance level of <i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.05. The results of the multivariate analysis showed that the motivation variable was <i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.036. Motivation had effect on psychological capital. While the perception variable was <i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.056 (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05), the perception had no effect on psychological capital. The attitude variable <i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.055 (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;0.05), the attitude had no effect on psychological capital. The factor that affects the mother's psychological capital in relation to exclusive breastfeeding during the COVID-19 pandemic was motivation. It is expected that mothers have a high motivation which can affect the mother's psychological capital. It is needed to increase and succeed at providing exclusive breastfeeding.","Nisa', Damayanti, Suhariadi, Herisanty, Afiyah","https://doi.org/10.1177/22799036221106619","20220802","Motivation; exclusive breastfeeding; psychological capital","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41690,""
"Minimising the use of costly control measures in an epidemic elimination strategy: A simple mathematical model","Countries such as New Zealand, Australia and Taiwan responded to the Covid-19 pandemic with an elimination strategy. This involves a combination of strict border controls with a rapid and effective response to eliminate border-related re-introductions. An important question for decision makers is, when there is a new re-introduction, what is the right threshold at which to implement strict control measures designed to reduce the effective reproduction number below 1. Since it is likely that there will be multiple re-introductions, responding at too low a threshold may mean repeatedly implementing controls unnecessarily for outbreaks that would self-eliminate even without control measures. On the other hand, waiting for too high a threshold to be reached creates a risk that controls will be needed for a longer period of time, or may completely fail to contain the outbreak. Here, we use a highly idealised branching process model of small border-related outbreaks to address this question. We identify important factors that affect the choice of threshold in order to minimise the expect time period for which control measures are in force. We find that the optimal threshold for introducing controls decreases with the effective reproduction number, and increases with overdispersion of the offspring distribution and with the effectiveness of control measures. Our results are not intended as a quantitative decision-making algorithm. However, they may help decision makers understand when a wait-and-see approach is likely to be preferable over an immediate response.","Plank","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mbs.2022.108885","20220914","Branching process; Epidemiological modelling; Infectious disease modelling; Public health; Basic Reproduction Number; COVID-19; Disease Outbreaks; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Pandemics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41691,""
"Aging and Microbiome in the Modulation of Vaccine Efficacy","From infancy through to old age, the microbiome plays an important role in modulating the host-immune system. As we age, our immune system and our gut microbiota change significantly in composition and function, which is linked to an increased vulnerability to infectious diseases and a decrease in vaccine responses. Our microbiome remains largely stable throughout adulthood; however, aging causes a major shift in the composition and function of the gut microbiome, as well as a decrease in diversity. Considering the critical role of the gut microbiome in the host-immune system, it is important to address, prevent, and ameliorate age-related dysbiosis, which could be an effective strategy for preventing/restoring functional deficits in immune responses as we grow older. Several factors, such as the host's genetics and nutritional state, along with the gut microbiome, can influence vaccine efficacy or reaction. Emerging evidence suggests that the microbiome could be a significant determinant of vaccine immunity. Physiological mechanisms such as senescence, or the steady loss of cellular functions, which affect the aging process and vaccination responses, have yet to be comprehended. Recent studies on several COVID-19 vaccines worldwide have provided a considerable amount of data to support the hypothesis that aging plays a crucial role in modulating COVID-19 vaccination efficacy across different populations.","Kumar, James, Kumawat, Nabi, Sharma, Pal, Shubham, Tiwari, Sarma, Nagpal","https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines10071545","20220731","COVID-19; aging; gut microbiome; host-immune system; pandemic; vaccine response","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41692,""
"The effect of herd immunity thresholds on willingness to vaccinate","Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, media and policymakers openly speculated about the number of immune citizens needed to reach a herd immunity threshold. What are the effects of such numerical goals on the willingness to vaccinate? In a large representative sample (<i>N</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;1540) of unvaccinated Swedish citizens, we find that giving a low (60%) compared to a high (90%) threshold has direct effects on beliefs about reaching herd immunity and beliefs about how many others that will get vaccinated. Presenting the high threshold makes people believe that herd immunity is harder to reach (on average about half a step on a seven-point scale), compared to the low threshold. Yet at the same time, people also believe that a higher number of the population will get vaccinated (on average about 3.3% more of the population). Since these beliefs affect willingness to vaccinate in opposite directions, some individuals are encouraged and others discouraged depending on the threshold presented. Specifically, in mediation analysis, the high threshold indirectly increases vaccination willingness through the belief that many others will get vaccinated (<i>B</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.027, <i>p</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.003). At the same time, the high threshold also decreases vaccination willingness through the belief that the threshold goal is less attainable (<i>B</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;-0.053, <i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.001) compared to the low threshold condition. This has consequences for ongoing COVID-19 vaccination and future vaccination campaigns. One message may not fit all, as different groups can be encouraged or discouraged from vaccination.","Andersson, Tingh&#xf6;g, V&#xe4;stfj&#xe4;ll","https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-022-01257-7","20220726","Cultural and media studies; Psychology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41693,""
"Contextualized impacts of an infodemic on vaccine hesitancy: The moderating role of socioeconomic and cultural factors","This study examines how perceived information overload and misinformation affect vaccine hesitancy and how this is moderated by structural and cultural factors. By applying and extending the fundamental cause theory, this study proposes a contextualized impact model to analyze a cross-national survey of 6034 residents in six societies in Asia, Europe and North America in June 2021. The study finds that (1) Older and highly-educated participants were less susceptible to COVID-19 information overload and belief in vaccine misinformation. (2) Perceived information overload led to an increase in vaccine acceptance and uptake, whereas belief in vaccine misinformation caused a decrease. (3) The structural differentiation of vaccine hesitancy was salient and higher socioeconomic status could buffer the negative impact of misinformation on vaccine acceptance. (4) Cultural factors such as collectivism and authoritarian mentality also served as buffers against the misinformation that reduced vaccine acceptance and uptake. These findings add nuanced footnotes to the fundamental causes theory and contribute to the discussion on the global recovery from the infodemic. Besides fact-checking and improving individual information literacy, effective and long-term information management and health policies must pay attention to stratified information gaps across socioeconomic groups, and to contextualize the communication and intervention strategies in different cultures.","Lin, Chen, Cheng","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ipm.2022.103013","20220726","COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy; Cross-national survey; Culture; Infodemic; Information overload; Misinformation; Socioeconomic status; fundamental causes theory","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41694,""
"COVIDisgust: Language processing through the lens of partisanship","Disgust is an aversive reaction protecting an organism from disease. People differ in how prone they are to experiencing it, and this fluctuates depending on how safe the environment is. Previous research has shown that the recognition and processing of disgusting words depends not on the word's disgust per se but rather on individual sensitivity to disgust. However, the influence of dynamically changing disgust on language comprehension has not yet been researched. In a series of studies, we investigated whether the media's portrayal of COVID-19 will affect subsequent language processing via changes in disgust. The participants were exposed to news headlines either depicting COVID-19 as a threat or downplaying it, and then rated single words for disgust and valence (Experiment 1; N = 83) or made a lexical decision (Experiment 2; N = 86). The headline type affected only word ratings and not lexical decisions, but political ideology and disgust proneness affected both. More liberal participants assigned higher disgust ratings after the headlines discounted the threat of COVID-19, whereas more conservative participants did so after the headlines emphasized it. We explain the results through the politicization and polarization of the pandemic. Further, political ideology was more predictive of reaction times in Experiment 2 than disgust proneness. High conservatism correlated with longer reaction times for disgusting and negative words, and the opposite was true for low conservatism. The results suggest that disgust proneness and political ideology dynamically interact with perceived environmental safety and have a measurable effect on language processing. Importantly, they also suggest that the media's stance on the pandemic and the political framing of the issue may affect the public response by increasing or decreasing our disgust.","Puhacheuskaya, Hubert Lyall, J&#xe4;rvikivi","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0271206","20220725","COVID-19; Disgust; Emotions; Humans; Language; Pandemics; Politics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41695,""
"A Functional Interaction Between Y674-R685 Region of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein and the Human &#x3b1;7 Nicotinic Receptor","The &#x3b1;7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is present in neuronal and non-neuronal cells and has anti-inflammatory actions. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested that &#x3b1;7 nAChR interacts with a region of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S), and a potential contribution of nAChRs to COVID-19 pathophysiology has been proposed. We applied whole-cell and single-channel recordings to determine whether a peptide corresponding to the Y674-R685 region of the S protein can directly affect &#x3b1;7 nAChR function. The S fragment exerts a dual effect on &#x3b1;7. It activates &#x3b1;7 nAChRs in the presence of positive allosteric modulators, in line with our previous molecular dynamics simulations showing favourable binding of this accessible region of the S protein to the nAChR agonist binding site. The S fragment also exerts a negative modulation of &#x3b1;7, which is evidenced by a profound concentration-dependent decrease in the durations of openings and activation episodes of potentiated channels and in the amplitude of macroscopic responses elicited by ACh. Our study identifies a potential functional interaction between &#x3b1;7 nAChR and a region of the S protein, thus providing molecular foundations for further exploring the involvement of nAChRs in COVID-19 pathophysiology.","Chrestia, Oliveira, Mulholland, Gallagher, Berm&#xfa;dez, Bouzat","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12035-022-02947-8","20220913","Neurotransmitter receptors; Nicotinic receptor; Patch-clamp; SARS-CoV-2 spike protein; Single-channel recordings; COVID-19; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus; alpha7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41696,""
"Setting Bias Specifications Based on Qualitative Assays With a Quantitative Cutoff Using COVID-19 as a Disease Model","Automated qualitative serology assays often measure quantitative signals that are compared against a manufacturer-defined cutoff for qualitative (positive/negative) interpretation. The current general practice of assessing serology assay performance by overall concordance in a qualitative manner may not detect the presence of analytical shift/drift that could affect disease classifications. We describe an approach to defining bias specifications for qualitative serology assays that considers minimum positive predictive values (PPVs) and negative predictive values (NPVs). Desirable minimum PPVs and NPVs for a given disease prevalence are projected as equi-PPV and equi-NPV lines into the receiver operator characteristic curve space of coronavirus disease 2019 serology assays, and the boundaries define the allowable area of performance (AAP). More stringent predictive values produce smaller AAPs. When higher NPVs are required, there is lower tolerance for negative biases. Conversely, when higher PPVs are required, there is less tolerance for positive biases. As prevalence increases, so too does the allowable positive bias, although the allowable negative bias decreases. The bias specification may be asymmetric for positive and negative direction and should be method specific. The described approach allows setting bias specifications in a way that considers clinical requirements for qualitative assays that measure signal intensity (eg, serology and polymerase chain reaction).","Lim, Chang, Markus, Horvath, Loh","https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcp/aqac072","20221007","Analytical error; Analytical performance specification; Bias; External quality assurance; PCR; Proficiency testing; Qualitative; Serology; Bias; COVID-19; COVID-19 Testing; Humans; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Predictive Value of Tests","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41697,""
"The COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences for chronic pain: a narrative review","The COVID-19 pandemic transformed everyday life, but the implications were most impactful for vulnerable populations, including patients with chronic pain. Moreover, persistent pain is increasingly recognised as a key manifestation of long COVID. This narrative review explores the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic for chronic pain. Publications were identified related to the COVID-19 pandemic influence on the burden of chronic pain, development of new-onset pain because of long COVID with proposed mechanisms and COVID-19 vaccines and pain interventions. Broadly, mechanisms underlying pain due to SARS-CoV-2 infection could be caused by 'systemic inflammatory-immune mechanisms', 'direct neuropathic mechanisms' or 'secondary mechanisms due to the viral infection or treatment'. Existing chronic pain populations were variably impacted and social determinants of health appeared to influence the degree of effect. SARS-CoV-2 infection increased the absolute numbers of patients with pain and headache. In the acute phase, headache as a presenting symptom predicted a milder course. New-onset chronic pain was reportedly common and likely involves multiple mechanisms; however, its prevalence decreases over time and symptoms appear to fluctuate. Patients requiring intensive support were particularly susceptible to long COVID symptoms. Some evidence suggests steroid exposure (often used for pain interventions) may affect vaccine efficacy, but there is no evidence of clinical repercussions to date. Although existing chronic pain management could help with symptomatic relief, there is a need to advance research focusing on mechanism-based treatments within the domain of multidisciplinary care.","Shanthanna, Nelson, Kissoon, Narouze","https://doi.org/10.1111/anae.15801","20220803","COVID-19; chronic pain; long COVID; pain practice; post-acute COVID-19 syndrome; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Chronic Pain; Headache; Humans; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41698,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Diagnosis of Tuberculosis in Brazil: Is the WHO End TB Strategy at Risk?","<b>Background:</b> In 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched the ""post-2015 End TB strategy"", that aims to end the global tuberculosis (TB) epidemic by 2030. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted global public health and the strict measures to control the coronavirus spread can affect the management of other diseases, such as TB. Herein, we aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the diagnosis of TB in Brazil, during 2020. <b>Methods:</b> We carried out an ecological and population-based study, using spatial analysis techniques. The variables used were the new cases of TB, pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), and also baciloscopy-positive (BP) cases in Brazil between 2015 and 2020. The percentage of changes (% change) was calculated to verify if there was an increase or decrease of TB cases in 2020, along with time trend analyses given by Joinpoint regression model. Also, interrupted time series analyses were used to assess the trend of TB diagnosis before and after the onset of the COVID-19 in Brazil. Spatial distribution maps were elaborated, considering the % change of each Brazilian state. <b>Findings:</b> Data analyses showed a reduction in the diagnosis of TB (-8.3%) and PTB (-8.1%) in Brazil after the irruption of the COVID-19 pandemic. Likewise, 22 states depicted a reduction in TB diagnosis. An expressive reduction of BP cases (-17.1%) was also observed. Interestingly, interrupted time series analysis showed decline in TB and PTB diagnoses from March 2020. Spatial analyses revealed that all states had a progressive reduction of TB, PTB and PB cases, from March on, with the highest percentages of reduction in December (-100% to -75%). <b>Interpretation:</b> Taken together, our analyses demonstrated a reduction in TB diagnosis after the irruption of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil and its regions, signaling a serious impact on the WHO ""End TB Strategy"" global plan.","Souza, da Paz, Sales, de Jesus, Tavares, Lima, Sousa, de Melo, do Carmo, de Souza, Bezerra-Santos","https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2022.891711","20220923","COVID-19; COVID-19 pandemic; end TB strategy; global healh; tuberculosis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41699,""
"Assessing the Impacts of Meteorological Factors on COVID-19 Pandemic Using Generalized Estimating Equations","Meteorological factors have been proven to affect pathogens; both the transmission routes and other intermediate. Many studies have worked on assessing how those meteorological factors would influence the transmissibility of COVID-19. In this study, we used generalized estimating equations to evaluate the impact of meteorological factors on Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by using three outcome variables, which are transmissibility, incidence rate, and the number of reported cases. In this study, the data on the daily number of new cases and deaths of COVID-19 in 30 provinces and cities nationwide were obtained from the provincial and municipal health committees, while the data from 682 conventional weather stations in the selected provinces and cities were obtained from the website of the China Meteorological Administration. We built a Susceptible-Exposed-Symptomatic-Asymptomatic-Recovered/Removed (SEIAR) model to fit the data, then we calculated the transmissibility of COVID-19 using an indicator of the effective reproduction number (<i>R</i><sub><i>eff</i></sub> ). To quantify the different impacts of meteorological factors on several outcome variables including transmissibility, incidence rate, and the number of reported cases of COVID-19, we collected panel data and used generalized estimating equations. We also explored whether there is a lag effect and the different times of meteorological factors on the three outcome variables. Precipitation and wind speed had a negative effect on transmissibility, incidence rate, and the number of reported cases, while humidity had a positive effect on them. The higher the temperature, the lower the transmissibility. The temperature had a lag effect on the incidence rate, while the remaining five meteorological factors had immediate and lag effects on the incidence rate and the number of reported cases. Meteorological factors had similar effects on incidence rate and number of reported cases, but different effects on transmissibility. Temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, sunshine hours, and wind speed had immediate and lag effects on transmissibility, but with different lag times.

"Riding out the COVID-19 storm: How government policies affect SMEs in China","Based on a nationally representative survey on SMEs in China, we study the impact of government policy interventions on SMEs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings are three-fold. First, relief policies in the form of payment deferrals and exemptions significantly improve SMEs' cash flows and further stimulate their operational recovery. This effect is more pronounced for firms with larger shares of high-skilled employees. Second, financial support policies do not appear to be effective in alleviating SMEs' cash constraints or encouraging the reopening of small businesses, potentially due to difficulties in accessing policy-oriented loans and misallocation of credit. Last, regional and local lock-down policies decrease SMEs' incidence of reopening and delay their expected reopening in the near future, likely by reducing consumer demand. Our findings shed new light on the policy debates on supporting SMEs during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Chen, Cheng, Gong, Li","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chieco.2022.101831","20220920","COVID-19; China; Policy; SME","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41702,""

"Genetic and immunological characterization of commercial infectious bronchitis virus vaccines used in Korea","The aim of the study was to investigate the genetic and immunogenic features of commercial vaccines against infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which is a major contagious pathogen of poultry. Although numerous vaccines have been developed based on the genetic characteristics of field strains, the continual emergence of variants decreases vaccine efficacy and cross-protection. To address this issue, we compared the S1 gene sequences of three IBV vaccines commercially available in Korea with those of various field isolates. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the vaccine strains clustered into two different lineages. Comparison of commercial vaccines with their parental viruses showed that most of the genetic variability occurred around hypervariable regions (HVRs). Conversely, antigenic stimulation with commercial vaccines and regional IBV variants was not sufficient to alter major immune cell phenotypes. Our study suggests that vaccines should be selected carefully based on their genetic background because genetic variability can affect the antigenicity of vaccines and host immune responses.","Jung, Lee, Yoon, Lee, Sung, Kwon, Park","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-022-05519-2","20221014","Animals; Chickens; Coronavirus Infections; Infectious bronchitis virus; Phylogeny; Poultry Diseases; Viral Vaccines","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41704,""
"Effect of Cholecalciferol Supplementation on the Clinical Features and Inflammatory Markers in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients: A Randomized, Open-Label, Single-Center Study","Recent studies showed that a low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) level was associated with a higher risk of morbidity and severe course of COVID-19. Our study aimed to evaluate the effects of cholecalciferol supplementation on the clinical features and inflammatory markers in patients with COVID-19. A serum 25(OH)D level was determined in 311 COVID-19 patients. Among them, 129 patients were then randomized into two groups with similar concomitant medication. Group I (<i>n</i> = 56) received a bolus of cholecalciferol at a dose of 50,000 IU on the first and the eighth days of hospitalization. Patients from Group II (<i>n</i> = 54) did not receive the supplementation. We found significant differences between groups with the preferential increase in serum 25(OH)D level and &#x394; 25(OH)D in Group I on the ninth day of hospitalization (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001). The serum 25(OH)D level on the ninth day was negatively associated with the number of bed days (r = -0.23, <i>p</i> = 0.006); we did not observe other clinical benefits in patients receiving an oral bolus of cholecalciferol. Moreover, in Group I, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts were significantly higher (<i>p</i> = 0.04; <i>p</i> = 0.02), while the C-reactive protein level was significantly lower on the ninth day of hospitalization (<i>p</i> = 0.02). Patients with supplementation of 100,000 IU of cholecalciferol, compared to those without supplementation, showed a decrease in the frequencies of CD38++CD27 transitional and CD27-CD38+ mature naive B cells (<i>p</i> = 0.006 and <i>p</i> = 0.02) and an increase in the level of CD27-CD38- DN B cells (<i>p</i> = 0.02). Thus, the rise in serum 25(OH)D level caused by vitamin D supplementation in vitamin D insufficient and deficient patients may positively affect immune status and hence the course of COVID-19.","Karonova, Golovatyuk, Kudryavtsev, Chernikova, Mikhaylova, Aquino, Lagutina, Zaikova, Kalinina, Golovkin, Grant, Shlyakhto","https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14132602","20220712","25(OH)D; B cell subsets; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; inflammatory markers; vitamin D; Biomarkers; COVID-19; Cholecalciferol; Dietary Supplements; Humans; Vitamin D; Vitamin D Deficiency","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41705,""

"Subjective well-being of children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia: two data collections","This paper examines the subjective well-being (SWB) of children and adolescents (10&#x2012;18 years old) during the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia for two periods (May to July 2020 and March to May 2021), using cross-sectional data from two distinct samples of <i>N</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;1,011 (<i>M</i> age&#x2009;=&#x2009;14.61) and <i>N</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;1,640 (<i>M</i> age&#x2009;=&#x2009;14.86), respectively. Its aims are twofold: (1) to examine the state of SWB among Indonesian children, including its cognitive component (measured using the CW-SWBS), positive affect (PA), and negative affect (NA), and the participants' satisfaction with their contact with friends and how they spend their time; and (2) to compare the evolution of these SWB-related aspects from the first to the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected using Google Forms and convenience and snowball sampling. Results showed that boys displayed significantly higher mean SWB scores than girls, while elementary students displayed significantly higher mean scores for the cognitive component than middle and high school students for both data collection periods. Boys also displayed significantly higher mean PA scores than girls. There were significant school grade differences on PA and NA, depending on the period of study. In the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, children and adolescents displayed lower scores on satisfaction with their contact with friends than in the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic. These results suggest that children and adolescents adapted to the COVID-19 situation during the second year, and this adaptation protected their SWB from further decrease, as defended by the homeostasis theory.","Borualogo, Casas","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-022-03346-x","20220716","Adolescents; COVID-19; Children; Positive and negative affect; Subjective well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41707,""

"Overwhelmed by Learning in Lockdown: Effects of Covid-19-enforced Homeschooling on Parents' Wellbeing","With the closure of schools due to the Covid-19-pandemic, parents of schoolchildren had to quickly adapt their daily schedules by taking over responsibilities of homeschooling for their children, while arranging their own schedule. This study first identifies the parents who are most challenged by having to ensure homeschooling responsibilities and then assesses how homeschooling affects different dimensions of parents' wellbeing. Analyzing data from a large general population-representative panel survey in Switzerland, we compare subjective wellbeing before the Covid-19-outbreak to wellbeing at the end of the semi-lockdown. Almost one fifth of parents report being sometimes overwhelmed by homeschooling obligations for their children. Women, mid-aged and lower-educated individuals as well as those with young children and a lower income are particularly overwhelmed. Being sometimes overwhelmed by homeschooling does not cause changes in life satisfaction, stress and negative affect. Yet, it leads to a decrease in positive affect.

"Autoimmune Effect of Antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 Nucleoprotein","COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 is continuing to spread around the world and drastically affect our daily life. New strains appear, and the severity of the course of the disease itself seems to be decreasing, but even people who have been ill on an outpatient basis suffer post-COVID consequences. Partly, it is associated with the autoimmune reactions, so debates about the development of new vaccines and the need for vaccination/revaccination continue. In this study we performed an analysis of the antibody response of patients with COVID-19 to linear and conformational epitopes of viral proteins using ELISA, chip array and western blot with analysis of correlations between antibody titer, disease severity, and complications. We have shown that the presence of IgG antibodies to the nucleoprotein can deteriorate the course of the disease, induce multiple direct COVID-19 symptoms, and contribute to long-term post-covid symptoms. We analyzed the cross reactivity of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 with own human proteins and showed that antibodies to the nucleocapsid protein can bind to human proteins. In accordance with the possibility of HLA presentation, the main possible targets of the autoantibodies were identified.

"An Exploration of How Solar Radiation Affects the Seasonal Variation of Human Mortality Rates and the Seasonal Variation in Some Other Common Disorders","Many diseases have large seasonal variations in which winter overall mortality rates are about 25% higher than in summer in mid-latitude countries, with cardiovascular diseases and respiratory infections and conditions accounting for most of the variation. Cancers, by contrast, do not usually have pronounced seasonal variations in incidence or mortality rates. This narrative review examines the epidemiological evidence for seasonal variations in blood pressure, cardiovascular disease rates and respiratory viral infections in relation to atmospheric temperature and humidity, and solar UV exposure through vitamin D production and increased blood concentrations of nitric oxide. However, additional mechanisms most likely exist by which solar radiation reduces the risk of seasonally varying diseases. Some studies have been reported with respect to temperature without considering solar UV doses, although studies regarding solar UV doses, such as for respiratory infections, often consider whether temperature can affect the findings. More research is indicated to evaluate the relative effects of temperature and sun exposure on the seasonality of mortality rates for several diseases. Since solar ultraviolet-B (UVB) doses decrease to vanishingly small values at higher latitudes in winter, the use of safe UVB lamps for indoor use in winter may warrant consideration.","Grant, Boucher","https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14122519","20220627","COVID-19; UVA; UVB; blood pressure; humidity; influenza; nitric oxide; respiratory infection; temperature; viral infection; vitamin D; Humans; Respiratory Tract Infections; Seasons; Sunlight; Ultraviolet Rays; Vitamin D","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41712,""
"Empirical Model of Spring 2020 Decrease in Daily Confirmed COVID-19 Cases in King County, Washington","Projections of the near future of daily case incidence of COVID-19 are valuable for informing public policy. Near-future estimates are also useful for outbreaks of other diseases. Short-term predictions are unlikely to be affected by changes in herd immunity. In the absence of major net changes in factors that affect reproduction number (R), the two-parameter exponential model should be a standard model &#xe2;&#x20ac;"" indeed, it has been standard for epidemiological analysis of pandemics for a century but in recent decades has lost popularity to more complex compartmental models. Exponential models should be routinely included in reports describing epidemiological models as a reference, or null hypothesis. Exponential models should be fitted separately for each epidemiologically distinct jurisdiction. They should also be fitted separately to time intervals that differ by any major changes in factors that affect R. Using an exponential model, incidence-count half-life ( <i>t</i> <sub>1/2</sub> ) is a better statistic than R. Here an example of the exponential model is applied to King County, Washington during Spring 2020. During the pandemic, the parameters and predictions of this model have remained stable for intervals of one to four months, and the accuracy of model predictions has outperformed models with more parameters. The COVID pandemic can be modeled as a series of exponential curves, each spanning an interval ranging from one to four months. The length of these intervals is hard to predict, other than to extrapolate that future intervals will last about as long as past intervals.","Roach","https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.11.20098798","20220716","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41713,""
"[Thymosin alpha 1 for the adjuvant treatment of coronavirus disease 2019: a retrospective cohort study]","To evaluate the effect of thymosin alpha 1 on the prognosis of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A retrospective cohort study was performed to collect clinical data of 95 patients treated by Shanghai Aid Medical Team in Wuhan Third Hospital during January 31, 2020 and March 4, 2020, who were confirmed COVID-19. They were divided into two groups according to whether they were treated with thymosin alpha 1 after admission. The 28-day mortality (primary outcome), and 28-ventilator-free-day, lymphocyte count (LYM) level, C-reactive protein (CRP) level (secondary outcomes) were compared between two groups. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier curve. The effect of thymosin alpha 1 on 28-day survival was evaluated with Cox regression model. Among the 95 patients, there were 31 cases in thymosin group and 64 cases in non-thymosin group; 29 patients died 28 days after admission, including 11 cases (35.5%) in thymosin group and 18 cases (28.1%) in non-thymosin group. Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed that thymosin alpha 1 could improve the 28-day survival of patients with COVID-19, but the univariate Cox model analysis showed that the difference was not statistically significant [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.48, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 0.20-1.14, P = 0.098]; multivariate Cox model analysis showed that thymosin alpha 1 was the factor to improve the 28-day mortality (HR = 0.15, 95%CI was 0.04-0.55, P = 0.004), old age (HR = 1.10, 95%CI was 1.05-1.15, P &lt; 0.001), accompanied by chronic renal dysfunction (HR = 42.35, 95%CI was 2.77-648.64, P = 0.007), decrease of LYM at admission (HR = 0.15, 95%CI was 0.04-0.60, P = 0.007) and the use of methylprednisolone (HR = 4.59, 95%CI was 1.26-16.67, P = 0.021) were also risk factors for the increase of 28-day mortality. The use of immunoglobulin and antiviral drugs abidol and ganciclovir did not affect the 28-day mortality. After adjustment for age, gender, LYM and other factors, weighted multivariate Cox analysis model showed thymosin alpha 1 could significantly improve the 28-day survival of COVID-19 patients (HR = 0.45, 95%CI was 0.25-0.84, P = 0.012).

"Nationwide Trends of Pediatric Obesity and BMI z-Score From 2017-2021 in China: Comparable Findings From Real-World Mobile- and Hospital-Based Data","Lifestyle changes including COVID-19 lockdown cause weight gain and may change obesity trends; however, timely changes are largely unknown and monitoring measures are usually lack. This first large-scale study aimed to analyze the real-world national trends of obesity prevalence of Chinese children in the past five years, and the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on pediatric obesity development through both mobile- and hospital-based data. This study included children aged 3 to 19 years old all over China from January 2017 to April 2021. Hospital-measured and parent-reported cases from XIGAO database were analyzed. Body mass index (BMI) z-score calculation and obesity status evaluation were made according to Chinese standards. We evaluated obesity/overweight prevalence over the past five years and the changes of BMI z-score during COVID-19 lockdown. A total of 656396 children from 31 provinces were involved, including 447481 hospital-measured cases and 208915 parent-reported cases. The obesity and overweight prevalence were 8.05% (95%CI 7.76%-8.39%) and 10.06% (95%CI 10.79%-11.55%), comparable to those of China National Nutrition Surveys during 2015-2019. Northern China had the highest obesity prevalence. Parent-reported data had higher obesity/overweight prevalence than hospital-measured data (18.3% [95%CI 17.7%-18.9%] <i>vs.</i> 21.7% [95%CI 20.7%-23.0%]). The trend of obesity prevalence remained stable with slight decrease, but COVID-19 lockdown caused a significant increase of 1.86% in 2020. Both mobile- and hospital-based data showed weight gain in the first half of 2020. High BMI z-score increase were found among primary and junior middle school children, and children in northeast area during lockdown. Weight gain during COVID-19 among Chinese children had regional differences and mainly affect primary and junior middle school children, thus warrants targeted interventions. The mobile growth assessment based on parent-reported data was a feasible, efficient and timely way for obesity monitoring among Chinese children, especially during epidemic.","Yang, Zhang, Yu, Pei, Sun, He, Qian, Luo, Zhang, Xu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2022.859245","20220621","China; adolescent; body mass index; children; pediatric obesity; Adolescent; Adult; Body Mass Index; COVID-19; Child; Child, Preschool; China; Communicable Disease Control; Hospitals; Humans; Overweight; Pandemics; Pediatric Obesity; Weight Gain; Young Adult","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41715,""
"Vicious cycle between severity of childhood obesity and pandemic: Potential impact of metformin","COVID-19 is currently a global pandemic, and initial reports of identified COVID-19 lockdown and limitations can adversely affect childhood obesity and metabolic health.

The aim of this paper was to determine how the pandemic affects the current status, severity, and metabolic parameters of obese children. We also attempted to show potential effects of metformin therapy. The study was conducted with the participation of 101 patients with obesity (The mean age was 13.6&#xa0;&#xb1;&#xa0;2.2). The patients were evaluated using pre- and post-lockdown data with an interval of 6 months. The new classification system was used to determine the severity of obesity. All anthropometrics, metabolic parameters (Blood glucose, insulin, HbA1C, lipid profile), lifestyle, and comorbidities were evaluated by dividing the participants into various subgroups according to their obesity and metformin usage status. Our data shows that weight, height, BMI, BMI-SD, and BMI percentiles all increased significantly, after the pandemic started. The severity of obesity increased statistically (overweight decreases and class 2 obesity increases, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.001). No change was observed in metabolic parameters. Surprisingly, a significant increase was observed in insulin and HOMA-IR values in the group with-metformin. Most studies about childhood obesity have only focused on obesity increases and pandemic relation. Our study showed that although there was no significant change in metabolic status at the end of a lockdown period, there was a serious increase in the severity of obesity. Metformin use had no effect on either obesity or metabolic parameters, and even an increase in insulin resistance indicators was observed.","Samur, Samur, Gul-Sir, Hatipoglu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.obmed.2022.100433","20220716","BMI, kg/m2, Body mass index; COVID-19, Coronavirus disease; Childhood obesity; Covid-19 pandemic; Disease Severity; FBG, Fasting blood glucose; FDA, Food and Drug Administration; HDL, High-density lipoprotein; HOMA-IR, Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance; HbA1c Glycated hemoglobin A1c; HbA1c, Glycated hemoglobin A1c; Insulin; LDL, Low-density lipoprotein; Lipid profile; Metabolic parameters; Metformin; SD, Standard deviation; Severity; Severity of obesity; TC, Total cholesterol; TG, Triglyceride","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41716,""
"Adding a reaction-restoration type transmission rate dynamic-law to the basic SEIR COVID-19 model","The classical SEIR model, being an autonomous system of differential equations, has important limitations when representing a pandemic situation. Particularly, the geometric unimodal shape of the epidemic curve is not what is generally observed. This work introduces the &#x3b2;SEIR model, which adds to the classical SEIR model a differential law to model the variation in the transmission rate. It considers two opposite thrives generally found in a population: first, reaction to disease presence that may be linked to mitigation strategies, which tends to decrease transmission, and second, the urge to return to normal conditions that pulls to restore the initial value of the transmission rate. Our results open a wide spectrum of dynamic variabilities in the curve of new infected, which are justified by reaction and restoration thrives that affect disease transmission over time. Some of these dynamics have been observed in the existing COVID-19 disease data. In particular and to further exemplify the potential of the model proposed in this article, we show its capability of capturing the evolution of the number of new confirmed cases of Chile and Italy for several months after epidemic onset, while incorporating a reaction to disease presence with decreasing adherence to mitigation strategies, as well as a seasonal effect on the restoration of the initial transmissibility conditions.","C&#xf3;rdova-Lepe, Vogt-Geisse","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0269843","20220620","COVID-19; Chile; Humans; Italy; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41717,""
"""Languishing"" in critical perspective: Roots and routes of a traveling concept in COVID-19 times","As the COVID-19 pandemic entered its second year, the <i>New York Times</i> published a column offering readers a name for its negative impact on mental health and well-being: &#x201c;languishing.&#x201d; Originally developed by positive psychologists, the term was designed to capture a sense of distress involving feelings of emptiness, stagnation, and lack of motivation that fall short of clinical significance. The column struck so strong a chord with readers that it was designated the most-read <i>NY Times</i> story of 2021. In this article, I examine how the concept of &#x201c;languishing&#x201d; traveled into U.S. popular discourse and consider the term&#x2019;s emerging cultural valences and interpretive dynamics. I also examine key gaps and discrepancies between operationalized and vernacular usages of the term. Analysis focuses on a set of weekly journals created as part of the Pandemic Journaling Project, an online journaling platform and research study launched in May 2020. The journals show how a &#x201c;psy&#x201d; concept, once unmoored from its origins as a research construct, can become (re)invented as a cultural resource available to help people narrativize distress and, in some cases, name and confront injustice. Yet the popular appeal of &#x201c;languishing&#x201d; also raises urgent questions&#x2014;in particular, about the growing role of positive psychology in both public and policy discussions about health and well-being. The field&#x2019;s emphasis on individual-level behavior change tends to neglect the structural factors, ideological contexts, and relations of power that predispose some people to languish, and others to flourish, in the first place. While the language of &#x201c;languishing&#x201d; may prove helpful to some, its individual-level focus risks distracting us from another urgent need: to confront the root causes of today's profound and wide-reaching mental health burden&#x2014;a burden that may not have been precipitated, but certainly has been exacerbated, by the ongoing pandemic.","Willen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmmh.2022.100128","20220815","COVID-19; Flourishing; Idioms of distress; Languishing; Pandemic Journaling Project; Positive psychology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41718,""
"Opportunities to tackle structural racism and ethnicity-based discrimination in recovering and rebuilding from the COVID-19 pandemic","The impact of COVID-19 has been disproportionately felt by populations experiencing structural racial- and ethnicity-based discrimination. Here, we describe opportunities for COVID-19 response and recovery efforts to help build more equal and resilient societies, through investments in: (i) interventions focused on explicitly addressing racial and ethnicity-based discrimination; (ii) interventions supporting the delivery of universal services, and in ways that address compounding and intersecting drivers of exclusion and marginalization; and (iii) cross-cutting enabling measures, such as participatory mechanisms and data disaggregation.

"Downsizing of COVID-19 contact tracing in highly immune populations","Contact tracing is a key component of successful management of COVID-19. Contacts of infected individuals are asked to quarantine, which can significantly slow down (or prevent) community spread. Contact tracing is particularly effective when infections are detected quickly, when contacts are traced with high probability, when the initial number of cases is low, and when social distancing and border restrictions are in place. However, the magnitude of the individual contribution of these factors in reducing epidemic spread and the impact of population immunity (due to either previous infection or vaccination), in determining contact tracing outputs is not fully understood. We present a delayed differential equation model to investigate how the immunity status and the relaxation of social distancing requirements affect contact tracing practices. We investigate how the minimal contact tracing efficiency required to keep an outbreak under control depends on the contact rate and on the proportion of immune individuals. Additionally, we consider how delays in outbreak detection and increased case importation rates affect the number of contacts to be traced daily. We show that in communities that have reached a certain immunity status, a lower contact tracing efficiency is required to avoid a major outbreak, and delayed outbreak detection and relaxation of border restrictions do not lead to a significantly higher risk of overwhelming contact tracing. We find that investing in testing programs, rather than increasing the contact tracing capacity, has a larger impact in determining whether an outbreak will be controllable. This is because early detection activates contact tracing, which will slow, and eventually reverse exponential growth, while the contact tracing capacity is a threshold that will easily become overwhelmed if exponential growth is not curbed. Finally, we evaluate quarantine effectiveness in relation to the immunity status of the population and for different viral variants. We show that quarantine effectiveness decreases with increasing proportion of immune individuals, and increases in the presence of more transmissible variants. These results suggest that a cost-effective approach is to establish different quarantine rules for immune and nonimmune individuals, where rules should depend on viral transmissibility after vaccination or infection. Altogether, our study provides quantitative information for contact tracing downsizing in vaccinated populations or in populations that have already experienced large community outbreaks, to guide COVID-19 exit strategies.","Martignoni, Renault, Baafi, Hurford","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0268586","20220614","COVID-19; Contact Tracing; Disease Outbreaks; Humans; Quarantine; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41720,""
"Differences and Associations between Physical Activity Motives and Types of Physical Activity among Adolescent Boys and Girls","Interventions aimed at motivation for physical activity (PA) are mostly beneficial, but the effects on preventing the decrease in PA are not entirely clear, especially in girls. The main aim of this study was to identify the differences and associations between PA motives and types of PA in boys and girls and between low and high motivated boys and girls. Another aim is to identify the types of motivation and PA that increase the likelihood of achieving PA recommendations and to propose ways of increasing PA among low motivated adolescents. The research carried out before the COVID-19 pandemic (2010-2019) and involved 2,149 Czech and 1,927 Polish adolescents aged 15-19 years. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Long Form was used to identify the level of PA types, while PA motivation was examined through the Motives for Physical Activities Measure-Revised. During the ten years, a decline was observed in enjoyment, fitness, and social motives. An increase in appearance motives was observed in girls, while no significant changes were seen in boys. Boys showed a higher motivation for PA than girls in enjoyment, competence, fitness, and social motives, while girls were high motivated in appearance motives. The greatest statistically significant differences between low and high motivated individuals were found in the associations between recreation/vigorous PA and between all types of motivation in boys and girls in both countries. The strongest associations in both genders were observed between enjoyment/competence motives and recreation/vigorous PA. Respecting and using the associations between the types of PA motives and types of PA in low and high motivated boys and girls can support feelings of PA enjoyment, increase PA, support the achievement of PA recommendations, and positively affect adolescents' healthy lifestyles.","Fr&#xf6;mel, Groffik, &#x160;af&#xe1;&#x159;, Mit&#xe1;&#x161;","https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/6305204","20220613","Adolescent; COVID-19; Exercise; Female; Humans; Male; Motivation; Pandemics; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41721,""
"Capturing the Features of Physical Activity in Old Adults during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Results of an Italian Survey","The restriction measures adopted to control the COVID-19 pandemic had significant consequences on individuals' lifestyles. This study is aimed at assessing the amount and type of habitual physical activity (PA) in older adults during the advanced phase of the pandemic and their possible relationships with sociodemographic aspects. A questionnaire that included sociodemographic characteristics and the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) was administered online to elderly subjects living in the Apulia region, South Italy. A sample of 939 participants (57.1% F; mean age 75.9 &#xb1; 6.3) was obtained. In total, 68.8% of female respondents reported a decrease in PA during the pandemic, while 55.1% of men maintained their previous levels (&amp;lt;0.001). The total PASE score did not differ between gender groups (median value 91.7 in males vs. 90.0 in females; <i>p</i> = 0.067). However, differences were registered in leisure activities, particularly regarding walking (23.8 &#xb1; 14.8 in males vs. 20.2 &#xb1; 14.6 in females; <i>p</i> = 0.001). Higher PA levels were related with lower age (OR 0.253; 95% CI 0.192-0.333; <i>p</i> = 0.001). Since inactivity can affect elderly health and wellbeing, and considering the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on this habit, health promotion strategies to counteract the negative effects of the pandemic should include interventions aimed at increasing PA in this sub-group of the population, especially among women and elderly subjects.","Gall&#xe8;, Sabella, Di Muzio, Barchielli, Da Molin, Ferracuti, Liguori, Orsi, Napoli","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19116868","20220613","COVID-19; elderly; physical activity; sedentary behavior; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; COVID-19; Communicable Disease Control; Exercise; Female; Humans; Male; Pandemics; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41722,""
"Effectiveness and Durability of mRNA Vaccine-Induced SARS-CoV-2-Specific Humoral and Cellular Immunity in Severe Asthma Patients on Biological Therapy","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines effectively elicit humoral and cellular immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in healthy populations. This immunity decreases several months after vaccination. However, the efficacy of vaccine-induced immunity and its durability in patients with severe asthma on biological therapy are unknown. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness and durability of mRNA vaccine-induced SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral and cellular immunity in severe asthma patients on biological therapy. The study included 34 patients with severe asthma treated with anti-IgE (omalizumab, n=17), anti-IL5 (mepolizumab, n=13; reslizumab, n=3), or anti-IL5R (benralizumab, n=1) biological therapy. All patients were vaccinated with two doses of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine with a 6-week interval between the doses. We found that this COVID-19 vaccination regimen elicited SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral and cellular immunity, which had significantly declined 6 months after receipt of the second dose of the vaccine. The type of biological treatment did not affect vaccine-elicited immunity. However, patient age negatively impacted the vaccine-induced humoral response. On the other hand, no such age-related impact on vaccine-elicited cellular immunity was observed. Our findings show that treatment of patients with severe asthma with biological therapy does not compromise the effectiveness or durability of COVID-19 vaccine-induced immunity.","Podrazil, Taborska, Stakheev, Rataj, Lastovicka, Vlachova, Pohunek, Bartunkova, Smrz","https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2022.892277","20220608","COVID-19 vaccination; SARS-CoV-2; cellular immunity; humoral immunity; severe asthma patients on biological therapy; Antibodies, Viral; Asthma; BNT162 Vaccine; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Humans; Immunity, Cellular; Immunity, Humoral; SARS-CoV-2; Vaccination; Vaccines, Synthetic; mRNA Vaccines","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-25","",41723,""
