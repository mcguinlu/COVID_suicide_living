"Insomnia and other sleep-related problems during the remission period of the COVID-19 pandemic: A large-scale survey among college students in China","This study aimed to evaluate the sleep-related problems and predictors of probable clinical insomnia among college students during the COVID-19 remission period in China. 146,102 college students from 22 colleges/universities in Guangdong province participated in this study from 1th to 15th June, 2020. Self-administered questionnaires were used to assess demographic characteristics. Sleep-related problems, depression and anxiety symptoms were measured by Youth Self-Rating Insomnia Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7, respectively. The prevalence of difficulty in initiating sleep, difficulty in maintaining sleep, early morning awakening, sleep insufficiency, unrefreshing sleep and daytime functioning impairment were 7.2%, 3.4%, 3.5%, 9.6%, 14.6%, and 7.6%, respectively. 16.9% students had varying degrees of insomnia and 6.3% were considered as displaying probable clinical insomnia. Moreover, being urban residents, having a history of physical or mental illness, and probable clinical depression or anxiety were significant risk factors of probable clinical insomnia, while college senior degree and 7-8 hours' sleep duration per day was the protective factor for probable clinical insomnia. Unrefreshing sleep was the most prominent sleep problem among college students during COVID-19 remission in China. Good sleep hygiene practices are strongly suggested to develop in the time of prolonged home isolation.","Zhang, Wang, Zhao, Chen, Chen, Ma, Yu, Wang, Chen, Jiang, Zhu, Huang, Fan, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.114153","20210817","COVID-19; College students; Predictors; Sleep-related problems","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-18","",17196,""
"The association between the COVID-19 pandemic and postpartum care provision","The COVID-19 pandemic led to a rapid transformation of the healthcare system in order to mitigate viral exposure. In the perinatal context, one change included altering the prenatal visit cadence and utilizing more telehealth methods. Whether this approach had inadvertent negative implications for postpartum care, including postpartum depression screening and contraceptive utilization, is unknown. To examine whether preventative health service utilization, including postpartum depression screening and contraceptive utilization, differed during the COVID-19 pandemic as compared to a pre-pandemic period. This retrospective cohort study included all pregnant patients who underwent prenatal care within five academic obstetric practices and who delivered at Northwestern Memorial Hospital either before (delivery 9/1/2018-1/1/2019) or during (delivery 2/1/2020-5/15/2020) the COVID-19 pandemic. Completion of postpartum depression screening was assessed by reviewing standardized fields for documentation of this screening within the electronic health records. The method of contraception was ascertained from the postpartum clinical documentation. Patients were classified as initiating long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) if they received Nexplanon or an intrauterine device (IUD) during the delivery hospitalization or within three months following delivery. Bivariable and multivariable analyses were performed. Of 2375 pregnant patients included in this study, 1120 (47%) delivered during the COVID-19 pandemic. Pregnant patients who delivered during the COVID-19 pandemic were significantly less likely to have postpartum depression screening performed (45.5% vs 86.2%, p&lt;0.01); this association persisted after adjusting for potential confounders (aOR 0.13, 95% CI 0.11-0.16). Pregnant patients who delivered during the COVID-19 pandemic also were significantly less likely to initiate LARC methods within three months of delivery (13.5% vs 19.6%, aOR 0.67, 95% CI 0.53-0.84). The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with decreases in the completion of postpartum depression screening and fewer overall patients receiving LARC methods for contraception. These data can inform adaptations in healthcare delivery in the midst of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Sakowicz, Matovina, Imeroni, Daiter, Barry, Grobman, Miller","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajogmf.2021.100460","20210817","COVID-19 pandemic; Contraception; Depression screening; Health services; LARC; Long-acting reversible contraception; Postpartum depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-18","",17197,""
"College students' experiences early in the COVID-19 pandemic: Applications for ongoing support","To explore U.S. college students' experiences during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Students at a Northeastern public university. Participants were interviewed via videoconference between April 1 and May 31, 2020. Interviews were audio-recorded and professionally transcribed; analyzed using deductive and inductive approaches to thematic analysis. 34 students (68% female; 56% racial/ethnic minority) participated. Deductively derived themes included: (1) trust/mistrust; (2) desire for change; (3) precarity; and (4) silver linings. Subthemes included variation in vaccine confidence, concern regarding inequalities, and anxiety about education. Building on deductively derived themes, we hypothesized that participation in change-oriented activities could benefit well-being and novel approaches to information dissemination may be needed to overcome institutional distrust. This study offers insights into potential short and long-term pandemic impacts as well as mitigation strategies college and university faculty and administrations may consider.","Wallace, Putnam, Chow, Fernandes, Clary, Goff","https://doi.org/10.1080/07448481.2021.1954011","20210817","COVID-19; College student; mental health; qualitative; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-18","",17198,""
"Natural Language Processing Insight into LGBTQ+ Youth Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Longitudinal Content Analysis of Anxiety-Provoking Topics and Trends in Emotion in LGBTeens Microcommunity Subreddit","Widespread fear surrounding COVID-19, coupled with physical and social distancing orders, has caused severe adverse mental health outcomes. Little is known, however, about how the COVID-19 crisis has impacted LGBTQ+ youth, who disproportionately experienced a high rate of adverse mental health outcomes before the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to address this knowledge gap by harnessing natural language processing methodologies to investigate the evolution of conversation topics in the most popular subreddit for LGBTQ+ youth. We generated a data set of all r/LGBTeens subreddit posts (n=39,389) between January 1, 2020 and February 1, 2021 and analyzed meaningful trends in anxiety, anger, and sadness in the posts. Because the distribution of anxiety before widespread social distancing orders was meaningfully different from the distribution after (P&lt;.001), we employed latent Dirichlet allocation to examine topics that provoked this shift in anxiety. We did not find any differences in LGBTQ+ youth anger and sadness before and after government-mandated social distancing; however, anxiety increased significantly (P&lt;.001). Further analysis revealed a list of 10 anxiety-provoking topics discussed during the pandemic: attraction to a friend, coming out, coming out to family, discrimination, education, exploring sexuality, gender pronouns, love and relationship advice, starting a new relationship, and struggling with mental health. During the COVID-19 pandemic, LGBTQ+ teens increased their reliance on anonymous discussion forums when discussing anxiety-provoking topics. LGBTQ+ teens likely perceived anonymous forums as safe spaces for discussing lifestyle stressors during COVID-19 disruptions (eg, school closures). The list of prevalent anxiety-provoking topics in LGBTQ+ teens' anonymous discussions can inform future mental health interventions in LGBTQ+ youth.","Stevens, Acic, Rhea","https://doi.org/10.2196/29029","20210817","COVID-19; LGBTQ+; anxiety; coronavirus; emotion; mental health; natural language processing; outbreak","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-18","",17199,""
"Sleep quality and associated factors amongst Brazilian physiotherapists during the COVID-19 pandemic","ToÃ‚Â investigate the prevalence of sleep problems and associated factors among Brazilian physiotherapists during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Cross-sectional online survey of physiotherapists in Brazil. Sociodemographic data, sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index - PSQI) and symptoms of anxiety, depression and stress (21-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale - DASS-21) were assessed. 342 physiotherapists responded the survey (18% male, median age 31 [27-38] years, 78% frontline workers). The three biggest fears reported by frontline physiotherapists were fear of being infected (48%), shortage of personal protective equipment (24%) and the severity of the disease (16%). The overall prevalence of poor sleep quality was 86%. Frontline physiotherapists showed worse scores on all PSQI components but sleep latency, disturbances and daytime dysfunction (pÃ‚Â Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã‚Â 0.037). Symptoms of anxiety and stress were highest in frontline workers (pÃ‚Â Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã‚Â 0.032). Being a frontline worker was independently associated with a poor sleep quality (odds ratio [95% CI] 1.99 [1.01 to 3.93]). Poor sleep quality was highly prevalent among Brazilian physiotherapists during the COVID-19 outbreak. Frontline physiotherapists showed worse sleep quality and more symptoms of anxiety and stress than non-frontline physiotherapists. Being at the frontline was associated with a higher chance of poor sleep quality.","Lino, C G Frota, V Abdon, Cavalheri, Mont'Alverne, Mesquita","https://doi.org/10.1080/09593985.2021.1965271","20210817","Sleep quality; coronavirus disease 2019; physiotherapy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-18","",17200,""
"Hospital nurses' moral distress and mental health during COVID-19","To explore factors associated with nurses' moral distress during the first COVID-19 surge and their longer-term mental health. Cross-sectional, correlational survey study. Registered nurses were surveyed in September 2020 about their experiences during the first peak month of COVID-19 using the new, validated, COVID-19 Moral Distress Scale for Nurses. Nurses' mental health was measured by recently experienced symptoms. Analyses included descriptive statistics and regression analysis. Outcome variables were moral distress and mental health. Explanatory variables were frequency of COVID-19 patients, leadership communication and personal protective equipment/cleaning supplies access. The sample comprised 307 nurses (43% response rate) from two academic medical centres. Many respondents had difficulty accessing personal protective equipment. Most nurses reported that hospital leadership communication was transparent, effective and timely. The most distressing situations were the transmission risk to nurses' family members, caring for patients without family members present, and caring for patients dying without family or clergy present. These occurred occasionally with moderate distress. Nurses reported 2.5Ã‚Â days each in the past week of feeling anxiety, withdrawn and having difficulty sleeping. Moral distress decreased with effective communication and access to personal protective equipment. Moral distress was associated with longer-term mental health. Pandemic patient care situations are the greatest sources of nurses' moral distress. Effective leadership communication, fewer COVID-19 patients, and access to protective equipment decrease moral distress, which influences longer-term mental health. Little was known about the impact of COVID-19 on nurses' moral distress. We found that nurses' moral distress was associated with the volume of care for infected patients, access to personal protective equipment, and communication from leaders. We found that moral distress was associated with longer-term mental health. Leaders should communicate transparently to decrease nurses' moral distress and the negative effects of global crises on nurses' longer-term mental health.","Lake, Narva, Holland, Smith, Cramer, Rosenbaum, French, Clark, Rogowski","https://doi.org/10.1111/jan.15013","20210817","COVID-19; communication; leadership; management; mental health; moral distress; nurses; pandemics; personal protective equipment; surveys","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-18","",17201,""
"Editorial: COVID-19: lessons learned for suicide prevention","This editorial discusses lessons learned from the COVID-19 public health emergency as they relate to the prevention of suicide, the second leading cause of death in adolescents and young adults globally. Recognizing that COVID-19 impact and response varied across nations, we offer a US perspective, addressing two questions: (a) what have we learned from this pandemic and mitigation strategies used to reduce cases of COVID-19 illness and deaths; and (b) how can our research advance knowledge and be advanced by work aimed at understanding the impact of this 'unusual' period? Provisional data indicate that during the pandemic and lockdown period, there were some declines in suicide rates for the total US population and no change in youth. However, data also indicate increases in reported suicidal ideation and behavior, mental health-related ED visits, and ED visits for suicidal ideation and behavior in youth. Heterogeneity of pandemic effects is noteworthy, with ethnic and racial minority populations suffering the most from COVID-19, COVID-19-related risk factors, and possibly suicide deaths. As vaccinations can prevent severe COVID-19 cases and deaths, we also have demonstrations of effective 'psychological inoculations' such as community-based interventions for reducing suicide attempts and deaths. During COVID-19, we mobilized to provide clinical care through telehealth and digital interventions. The challenge now is to continue to put our science to work to mitigate the adverse impacts of the pandemic on suicide and suicide risk factors, our children's mental health, and enhance mental health and well-being in our communities.","Asarnow, Chung","https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpp.13489","20210817","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-18","",17202,""
"COVID-19 Experiences Predicting High Anxiety and Depression Among a Sample of BRCA1/BRCA2-positive Women in the US","<i>Purpose.</i> During the COVID-19 pandemic, breast and ovarian cancer survivors experienced more anxiety and depression than before the pandemic. Studies have not investigated the similarities of this trend among <i>BRCA1/2</i> -positive women who are considered high risk for these cancers. The current study examines the impact of COVID-19 experiences on anxiety and depression in a sample of <i>BRCA1/2</i> -positive women in the U.S. <i>Methods.</i> 211 <i>BRCA1/2</i> -positive women from medically underserved backgrounds completed an online survey. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using multivariable logistic regression for associations between COVID-19 experiences and self-reported anxiety and depression stratified by demographic factors. <i>Results.</i> Overall, women who reported quarantining/isolation (aOR, 0.46, 95% CI, 0.24-0.88) experienced significantly fewer depressive symptoms than women who did not report this experience. Racial/ethnic minority women caring for someone at home during COVID-19 were 3.78 times more likely (95% CI, 1.04-13.6) to report high anxiety while non-Hispanic white women were less likely (aOR, 0.36, 95% CI, 0.10-1.33, <i>p</i> -interaction=0.011). <i>Conclusions</i> . To date, this is the first study to analyze anxiety and depression considering several COVID-19 predictors among <i>BRCA1/2</i> -positive women.

"Perceived risk, Positive Youth-Parent Relationships, and Internalizing Problems in Adolescents: Initial Development of the Meaningful School Questionnaire","This novel paper aimed to develop the Meaningful School Questionnaire (MSQ) to assess meaning in life in school context and examined whether meaningful school serves as a moderator on the links between the coronavirus risk, youth-parent relationships, and internalizing problems. Participants included 383 adolescents (38.4% male; <i>Mean</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°14.23Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.04). Factor analysis yielded a two-factor solution: purpose-enjoyment and responsible understanding. Meaningful school moderated the mediating effect of positive youth-parent relations on the association between coronavirus risk and internalizing problems. Findings suggest that students with greater life meaning exhibit more internalizing problems when coronavirus risk is high and positive youth-parent relationships is low. This evidence supports that life meaning is key to foster the psychological health of young people during the pandemic. Thus, meaning-based intervention strategies could be developed to improve youths' sense of life meaning and purpose in the school context, which in turn enhance their resilience to foster their mental health and flourishing. These programs could facilitate youths to cope with stressful experiences such as the coronavirus pandemic by promoting their protective and promotive resources.","Arslan, YÃ„Â±ldÃ„Â±rÃ„Â±m","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12187-021-09841-0","20210817","Adolescents; Coronavirus risk; Internalizing problems; Meaningful school; Positive youthÃ¢â‚¬â€œparent relationships","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-18","",17205,""

"Opioid overdose crises during the COVID-19 pandemic: implication of health disparities","Recent data suggest a disproportionate impact of opioid overdoses on Black Americans. The study aims to describe emergency department (ED) visits at a Southern, urban ED pertaining to opioid overdose and associated health disparities. Patients presenting to the ED at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital with opioid overdoses from January 1 to October 31, 2019, and from January 1 to October 31, 2020, were identified from electronic medical records. The total number of opioid overdose visits increased 9.7% (556 to 611) between January and October 2020 compared with 2019. Among patients who presented with opioid overdose, the mean ages were 50.3Ã‚Â years and 48.3Ã‚Â years, in 2019 and 2020, respectively. In both 2019 and 2020, more Blacks than whites were treated for opioid overdose in the ED (284 vs. 258 in 2019, and 306 vs. 271 in 2020) although 28 patients did not record their race in 2020. Consistently, more overdose deaths were observed in Blacks than in whites in 2020. More individuals seeking opioid overdose treatment were single in both years. The study reported a greater number of visits for opioid overdoses from January to October of 2020 in an ED of a southeastern region, as well as higher overdose deaths in Blacks.

"Trainees' perceptions and expectations of formal academic mentoring during the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesian cardiology residency programs","During medical residency programs, physicians develop their professional identities as specialists and encounter high expectations in terms of achieving competencies. The responsibilities of medical trainees include caring for patients, balancing work with personal life, and weathering stress, depression, and burnout. Formal academic mentoring programs strive to ease these burdens. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has altered the trainee-academic mentor relationship, and solutions are needed to address these challenges. The present study aimed to evaluate the formal academic mentoring process through trainees' perceptions and expectations of formal mentoring programs during COVID-19 in Indonesian cardiology residency programs. This cross-sectional study used a self-administered online questionnaire to capture trainees' perceptions and expectations regarding academic mentoring programs in 3 cardiology residency programs in Indonesia from October to November 2020. The questionnaire was developed before data collection. Perceptions of the existing mentoring programs were compared with expectations. Responses were gathered from 169 out of 174 residents (response rate, 97.3%). Most trainees reported having direct contact with COVID-19 patients (88.82%). They stated that changes had taken place in the mode and frequency of communication with their academic advisors during the pandemic. Significant differences were found between trainees' perceptions of the existing mentoring programs and their expectations for academic mentoring programs (P&lt;0.001).
