"Suicide and self-harm in low- and middle- income countries during the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review","There is widespread concern over the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicide and self-harm globally, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) where the burden of these behaviours is greatest. We synthesised the evidence from the published literature on the impact of the pandemic on suicide and self-harm in LMIC. This review is nested within a living systematic review that continuously identifies published evidence (all languages) through a comprehensive automated search of multiple databases (PubMed; Scopus; medRxiv, PsyArXiv; SocArXiv; bioRxiv; the WHO COVID-19 database; and the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset by Semantic Scholar (up to 11/2020), including data from Microsoft Academic, Elsevier, arXiv and PubMed Central.) All articles identified by the 4th August 2021 were screened. Papers reporting on data from a LMIC and presenting evidence on the impact of the pandemic on suicide or self-harm were included. A total of 22 studies from LMIC were identified representing data from 12 countries. There was an absence of data from Africa. The reviewed studies mostly report on the early months of COVID-19 and were generally methodologically poor. Few studies directly assessed the impact of the pandemic. The most robust evidence, from time-series studies, indicate either a reduction or no change in suicide and self-harm behaviour. As LMIC continue to experience repeated waves of the virus and increased associated mortality, against a backdrop of vaccine inaccessibility and limited welfare support, continued efforts are needed to track the indirect impact of the pandemic on suicide and self-harm in these countries.","Duleeka Kniipe; Ann John; Prianka Padmanathan; Emily Eyles; Dana Dekel; Julian Higgins; Jason Bantjes; Rakhi Dandona; Catherine Macleod-Hall; Luke A McGuinness; Lena Schmidt; Roger Webb; David Gunnell","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.09.03.21263083","20210907","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-07","",17690,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on older adults living in long-term care centers in Thailand, and risk factors for post-traumatic stress, depression, and anxiety","There is a lack of data concerning impact of COVID-19 among older adults (OA) living at long-term care (LTC) centers. This study investigated how COVID-19 has affected this population. The prevalence of and risk factors for post-traumatic stress, depression, and anxiety were investigated. A semi-structured interview to determine the effect of COVID-19 was conducted to 200 OA at two government LTC centers. The 17-item Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist, the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale were used to evaluate post-traumatic stress, depression, and anxiety, respectively. Most OA reported moderate or severe impact of COVID-19. The most impacted area was financial due to decreased support from outside the center. Seventy percent of OA reported no or mild psychological stress from COVID-19; however, 5.5% had post-traumatic stress, 7.0% had depression, and 12.0% had anxiety. Higher psychological stress from COVID-19 and having respiratory tract infection symptoms were independently associated with post-traumatic stress, depression, and anxiety. Receiving COVID-19 news via social media was independently associated with post-traumatic stress and depression. Having psychiatric comorbidity was independently associated with depression. OA living in LTC centers reported moderate or severe impact from COVID-19, especially financial, but relatively low psychological stress. Psychological stress from COVID-19, having respiratory tract infection symptoms, and receiving COVID-19 news via social media were risk factors for psychological disorders. The data reflected the post-outbreak period. There is limitation in the generalizability of the results for other countries with different health care systems.","Srifuengfung, Thana-Udom, Ratta-Apha, Chulakadabba, Sanguanpanich, Viravan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.08.044","20210906","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Long-term care; Older adults; Post-traumatic stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-07","",17691,""
"Groups 4 Health protects against unanticipated threats to mental health: Evaluating two interventions during COVID-19 lockdown among young people with a history of depression and loneliness","Decades of research indicate that when social connectedness is threatened, mental health is at risk. However, extant interventions to tackle loneliness have had only modest success, and none have been trialled under conditions of such threat. 174 young people with depression and loneliness were randomised to one of two evidence-based treatments: cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) or Groups 4 Health (G4H), an intervention designed to increase social group belonging. Depression, loneliness, and well-being outcomes were evaluated at one-year follow-up; COVID-19 lockdown restrictions were imposed partway through follow-up assessments. This provided a quasi-experimental test of the utility of each intervention in the presence (lockdown group) and absence (control group) of a threat to social connectedness. At one-year follow-up, participants in lockdown reported significantly poorer wellbeing than controls who completed follow-up before lockdown, t(152)=2.41, p=.017. Although both CBT and G4H led to symptom improvement, the benefits of G4H were more robust following an unanticipated threat to social connectedness for depression (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup>(16)=31.35, p=.001), loneliness (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup>(8)=21.622, p=.006), and wellbeing (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup>(8)=22.938, p=.003). Because the COVID-19 lockdown was unanticipated, this analysis represents an opportunistic use of available data. As a result, we could not measure the specific impact of restrictions on participants, such as reduced income, degree of isolation, or health-related anxieties. G4H delivered one year prior to COVID-19 lockdown offered greater protection than CBT against relapse of loneliness and depression symptoms. Implications are discussed with a focus on how these benefits might be extended to other life stressors and transitions.","Cruwys, Haslam, Rathbone, Williams, Haslam","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.08.029","20210906","Cognitive behaviour therapy; Depression; Group memberships; Social identity; Social isolation; Well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-07","",17692,""
"Mental Health Issues During and After COVID-19 Vaccine Era","The COVID-19 pandemic has persisted for more than a year, and post-COVID-19 sequelae of neurological complications, including direct and indirect effects on the central nervous system (CNS), have been recognized. There is a plethora of evidence for neurological, cognitive, and emotional deficits in COVID-19 patients. Acute neurological symptoms like neuroinflammation, cognitive impairment, loss of smell, and brain stroke are common direct effects among SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. Work-associated stress, lockdowns, social distancing, and quarantine in response to contain SARS-CoV-2 have also affected the mental health of large populations, regardless of age. Public health emergencies have affected individuals and communities, resulting in emotional reactions and unhealthy behaviors. Although vaccines have been widely distributed and administered among large populations, vaccine hesitancy still exists and may be due to apprehension about vaccine efficacy, preliminary trials, and associated side effects. To support vulnerable people during times of a health emergency, the focus must be directed at the root cause of the problem. This review highlights the impact of COVID-19 on the CNS by outlining direct and indirect effects and factors contributing to the decline in people's mental health throughout the COVID-19 pandemic both during and after vaccine administration. Furthermore, we also discuss reasons for vaccine hesitancy and why some groups of people are deprived of vaccines. Finally, we touched upon the social determinants of mental health and their impact on disadvantaged populations during times of crisis which may help policymakers set up some action plans to mitigate the COVID-19 mental health turmoil during this ongoing pandemic.","Pandey, Thurman, Johnson, Acharya, Johnston, Klug, Olwenyi, Rajaiah, Byrareddy","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainresbull.2021.08.012","20210906","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; mental health; social determinants; vaccine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-07","",17693,""
"Impact of Covid-19 on the Mental Health of Delta State University students, Nigeria","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a substantial psychological burden among students. This study aimed at evaluating the impact of the COVID-19 on the mental health of university students and determining the prevalence of anxiety and depression. This cross-sectional descriptive study utilized an online questionnaire sent to students in the Faculty of Basic Medical Sciences, Delta State University after ethical approval. The Generalized Anxiety and Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores were analyzed using the Statistical Package of Social Sciences and expressed using descriptive statistics and percentages. An independent t-test was used to determine the gender differences in the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores while Pearson's correlation was used to establish a relationship between these scores with age. The 259 respondents comprised 118, 45.6% males and 141, 54.4% females with an average age of 21.50Ã‚Â±2.04 years. The majority (149, 57.5%) were aged 21-25 years. The scores did not show significant differences in age and gender. Moderate to severe anxiety and depression was established in 22.4% and 28.2% of the respondents respectively. This study has shown that the prevalence of anxiety and depression due to the pandemic bears no relationship with age and gender. This is however different from previous reports due to the differences in the sample size, resource setting, timing of the study, and the courses the students studied.","Ominde, Jaiyeoba-Ojigho, Igbigbi","https://doi.org/10.23750/abm.v92i4.10600","20210906","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-07","",17694,""
"Predictors of depression, anxiety and stress among remote workers during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a massive impact on work and home life, changing all daily routines of remote workers. It is extremely important to figure out some changes in home and work life that may affect the mental health of remote workers more. The first aim of the study was to investigate the predictors of depression, anxiety, and stress among first-time remote workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The second aim was to explore sex differences regarding work and homelife during the COVID-19 pandemic. The sample consisted of 459 participants who have been working from home for the first time during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online survey used included questions relating to sociodemographic characteristics, changes in work and home life, Depression Anxiety Stress Questionnaire-Short Form, Jenkins Sleep Scale, and Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire. Prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress was 17.9%, 19.6%, and 19.6%of the study participants, respectively. Poor sleep quality, trouble focusing at work, being female, workplace loneliness, low levels of control over working hours, and low levels of physical activity were predictors of depression. Poor sleep quality, increased workload, and being female were predictors of anxiety. Poor sleep quality, trouble focusing at work, being female, financial concern, and workplace loneliness were predictors of stress. It was observed a higher increase in both housework and working hours during the COVID-19 pandemic in women. Determining the variables that can affect the mental health of remote workers is highly important for timely psychological intervention.","Ã…Å¾entÃƒÂ¼rk, SaÃ„Å¸altÃ„Â±cÃ„Â±, GeniÃ…Å¸, GÃƒÂ¼nday Toker","https://doi.org/10.3233/WOR-210082","20210906","Mental health; Working from home; gender inequality; remote working; teleworking","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-07","",17695,""
"Burnout and anxiety level of healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey","COVID-19 has affected many countries in the world and has been known as one of the fast-spreading viruses in recent history. Our aim is to reveal the level of anxiety and burnout, attitudes, thoughts, and behaviors of healthcare professionals about COVID-19 in Turkey. The individuals included in the study answered seven questions containing demographic information, 27 questions determining their views and perspectives on COVID-19. Anxiety level was measured by Beck Anxiety Scale (BAI), and State Anxiety Inventory (SAI); burnout was measured by Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). We included 66 health staff (50 female, 16 male) whose mean age was 31.71Ã‚Â±5.18 years (22-46 ranged). Twenty-two (33.3%) of the participants worked on the COVID-19 frontline while 44 (66.6%) of them worked on usual wards.We found that participants' anxiety was at a moderate level in BAI (mean: 14.00Ã‚Â±12.66). The mean of the SAI was 49.93Ã‚Â±13.06. MBI subscales were low. We found that there was a significant difference in BAI between COVID-19 frontline healthcare professionals and those who worked on the usual wards (pÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.01). It is important to consider the level of anxiety and burnout in all healthcare professionals and to help them to protect their mental health.","Dogru-Huzmeli, Cam, Urfali, Gokcek, Bezgin, Urfali, Uysal","https://doi.org/10.3233/WOR-210028","20210906","Pandemic; health staff; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-07","",17696,""
"Healthcare students' mental and physical well-being during the COVID-19 lockdown and distance learning","The sudden shift into distance learning during the coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdown might have impacted university students' well-being. This study aimed to investigate undergraduate healthcare university students' health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and its predictors during COVID-19. A cross-sectional study used an online self-administered questionnaire. The study targeted undergraduate medical, dental, pharmacy, and nursing students at Jordanian universities. Data collected included demographics,12-item Short Form health survey (SF-12), students' evaluation of distance learning, Neck Disability Index (NDI), Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS21), and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Descriptive analyses were conducted to summarize primary outcome measures data. Predictors of HRQoL were determined using a multiple variable regression analysis. In total, 485 university students successfully completed this study with a mean age of 20.6 (Ã‚Â±2.0). Participants' HRQoL level measured by SF-12 mean scores were 66.5 (Ã‚Â±20.2) for physical health component and 44.8 (Ã‚Â±21.2) for mental health component. The regression model explained 65.5% of the variation (r2Ã¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.655, FÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 127.8, PÃ¢â‚¬Å &lt; Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.001) in participants' HRQoL. Factors significantly associated with HRQoL included depression, neck disability index score, stress, health self-evaluation, average of satisfaction with distance learning, IPAQ score, and weekly studying hours. This study showed that healthcare students had a relatively low level of HRQoL during COVID-19 pandemic in Jordan. Academic and non-academic factors associated with HRQoL were identified and should be considered by healthcare educational institutions for better academic planning in future similar pandemics.","Almhdawi, Alazrai, Obeidat, Altarifi, Oteir, Aljammal, Arabiat, Alrabbaie, Jaber, Almousa","https://doi.org/10.3233/WOR-205309","20210906","Health-related quality of life; healthcare students; mental health; online teaching; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-07","",17697,""
"Physical and mental well-being, risk and protective factors among older lesbians /gay women in the United Kingdom during the initial COVID-19 2020 lockdown","This article reports on a subset of findings from a recent UK survey of the impact of COVID-19 on older LGBT+ people in the UK. It considers the responses of 149 lesbian/gay women (137 cisgender, 12 trans) to questions relating to physical and mental health and wellbeing. Findings indicate that those women - in couples and singles - who were happy with their living circumstances pre-COVID showed stoicism, adaptability, and determined positivity in response to the pandemic and associated lockdown. Some even reported an improved quality of life, better personal relationships and increased neighborly support. By contrast, those women who were very unhappy with their circumstances prior to COVID-19 - generally women who lived alone and experienced a mismatch between their actual and desired social network - either remained unhappy or became more unhappy, due to its impact on fragile support systems. For trans women, formal support from trans/LGBT+ specific networks - online during COVID lockdown - were central to their wellbeing. Having access to, and being able to use, online technologies were essential to good mental health during lockdown. These findings reaffirm the diversity among older lesbians/gay women as well as highlighting how COVID-19 has acted as a magnifier to their preexisting circumstances. The narratives of those doing well - generally better-networked, intentionally positive and engaged in practices which promote their well-being - may offer insights for supporting those who find their lives more challenging, both during a public health crisis and more generally.","Westwood, Hafford-Letchfield, Toze","https://doi.org/10.1080/08952841.2021.1965456","20210906","COVID-19; Older lesbians; older cis lesbians; older gay women; older trans lesbians","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-07","",17698,""
"Mediation effect of coping strategies on general psychological health among middle-aged and older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic","In this study, we aim to assess general psychological health, associated factors, and the potential of coping strategies as a mediator for middle-aged and older Malaysian adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 535 individuals aged 52Ã¢â‚¬â€°years and above from the previous cohort and interventional studies in Peninsular Malaysia were contacted during the Movement Control Order (MCO) issued during the COVID-19 pandemic. Telephonic interviews were conducted to obtain participant information concerning socio-demography, physical activity, subjective well-being (SWB) as assessed using flourishing scale, coping strategies, and general psychological health (GHQ-12). Simple linear regression (SLR) and multiple linear regression (MLR) analyses were performed to identify the factors associated with GHQ-12. The associated factors were further analysed using mediation analysis to determine the potential of coping strategies as a mediator. It was observed that participants had a low mean GHQ-12 score (<i>M</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.80, SD = 2.19), indicating good psychological health. Living arrangement, physical activity, and flourishing scale were associated with psychological health (R<sup>2</sup>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.412, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05) in MLR. Positive reinterpretation, emotional support, instrumental support, humour, denial, and self-blame appear to partially mediate the relationship between socio-demography, physical activity, flourishing scale and GHQ-12, with lower coefficient values. Middle-aged and older adults in Malaysia had good psychological health during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially when living with family, physically active, and having good subjective well-being. These findings provide the initial evidence to help promote the ageing population's general well-being and mental health and enable them to cope with change during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Malek Rivan, Shahar, Singh, Ibrahim, Mat Ludin, Yahya, Mohamed Sakian, Mahadzir, Subramaniam, Kamaruddin","https://doi.org/10.1080/13607863.2021.1972281","20210906","COVID-19; Psychological health; coping; flourishing; living alone; physical activity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-07","",17699,""

"Individual and organisational strategies to develop resilience in the nursing workforce","Nurses are likely to encounter a wide range of distressing, challenging and sometimes traumatic situations. However, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created unprecedented levels of stress, risk, uncertainty and anxiety for nurses. Nurses have been working in highly challenging conditions, particularly on the front line of patient care, which has had adverse effects on their mental health and well-being. The challenges generated by the COVID-19 pandemic have called into question the notion of nursing being an innately resilient profession. Consequently, the pandemic has reinforced the need for individuals, teams and healthcare organisations to foster resilience in nurses. This article discusses the theoretical underpinnings of resilience, explains what resilience in nurses means, and describes the adverse effects of the pandemic on nurses' mental health and resilience. The article also explores how nurses' resilience can be developed and enhanced from an individual and organisational perspective.","Cajanding","https://doi.org/10.7748/ns.2021.e11678","20210906","COVID-19; burnout; coronavirus; leadership; management; morale; nursesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ wellbeing; organisational culture; professional; professional issues; staff welfare; workforce","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-07","",17702,""

"How did the mental health symptoms of children and adolescents change over early lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK?","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused extensive disruption to the lives of children and young people. Understanding the psychological effects on children and young people, in the context of known risk factors is crucial to mitigate the effects of the pandemic. This study set out to explore how mental health symptoms in children and adolescents changed over a month of full lockdown in the United Kingdom in response to the pandemic. UK-based parents and carers (<i>n</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 2673) of school-aged children and young people aged between 4 and 16Ã‚Â years completed an online survey about their child's mental health at two time points between March and May 2020, during early lockdown. The survey examined changes in emotional symptoms, conduct problems and hyperactivity/inattention. The findings highlighted particular deteriorations in mental health symptoms among preadolescent children, which translated to a 10% increase in those meeting possible/probable caseness criteria for emotional symptoms, a 20% increase in hyperactivity/inattention, and a 35% increase in conduct problems. In contrast, changes among adolescents were smaller (4% and 8% increase for hyperactivity/inattention and conduct problems, respectively) with a small reduction in emotional symptoms (reflecting a 3% reduction in caseness). Overall, there were few differences in change in symptoms or caseness over time according to demographic characteristics, but children and young people in low income households and those with special educational needs and/or neurodevelopmental disorders exhibited elevated symptoms (and caseness) at both time points.

"Interplay between long-term vulnerability and new risk: Young adolescent and maternal mental health immediately before and during the COVID-19 pandemic","We examine whether there has been an increase in young adolescent and maternal mental health problems from pre- to post-onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Children aged 11-12Ã‚Â years and their mothers participating in a UK population-based birth cohort (Wirral Child Health and Development Study) provided mental health data between December 2019 and March 2020, and again 3Ã‚Â months after lockdown, 89% (<i>N</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 202) of 226 assessed pre-COVID-19. Emotional and behavioural problems were assessed by self- and maternal reports, and long-term vulnerability by maternal report of prior child adjustment, and maternal prenatal depression. The young adolescents reported a 44% (95% confidence interval [CI: 23%-65%]) increase in symptoms of depression and 26% (95% CI [12%-40%]) for post-traumatic stress disorder, with corresponding maternal reports of child symptoms of 71% (95% CI [44%-99%]) and 43% (95% CI 29%-86%). Disruptive behaviour problem symptoms increased by 76% (95% CI [43%-109%]) particularly in children without previous externalising symptoms. Both female gender and having had high internalising symptoms earlier in childhood were associated with elevated rates of depression pre-pandemic, and with greater absolute increases during COVID-19. Mothers' own depression symptoms increased by 42% (95% CI [20%-65%]), and this change was greater among mothers who had prenatal depression. No change in anxiety was observed among children or mothers. None of these increases were moderated by COVID-19-related experiences such as frontline worker status of a parent. Prior to the pandemic, rates of maternal and child depression were greater in families experiencing higher deprivation, but changed only in less deprived families, raising their rates to those of the high deprivation group. COVID-19 has led to a marked increase in mental health problems in young adolescents and their mothers with concomitant requirements for mental health services to have the resources to adapt to meet the level and nature of the needs.","Wright, Hill, Sharp, Pickles","https://doi.org/10.1111/jcv2.12008","20210906","adolescence; behaviour problems; depression; longitudinal studies; sex differences","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-07","",17705,""
"Prevalence of clinical-level emotional/behavioral problems in schoolchildren during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in Japan: A prospective cohort study","Several empirical studies have investigated negative mental health outcomes related to the spread of infectious diseases, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, little is known about children's emotional/behavioral problems, especially externalizing problems, during such situations. This prospective cohort study aimed to investigate pandemic-related emotional/behavioral problems and their risk factors among schoolchildren in Japan. A total of 4800 parents with children in grades 1-12 participated in a two-wave longitudinal survey. Wave 1 and Wave 2 were conducted on March 4-8 and May 15-18, 2020, respectively. Survey items included demographic information, parental depression, children's diagnoses of neurodevelopmental disorders, the total length of school closure, and emotional/behavioral problems. Children's emotional/behavioral problems were assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), which has cutoff points to differentiate clinical-level problems, which were the primary focus of this study. The proportions of clinical-level problems were higher at Wave 2 (emotional symptomsÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 24.8%, conduct problemsÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 22.7%, hyperactivity/inattentionÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 36.8%, peer relationship problemsÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 36.2%, and lack of prosocial behaviorÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 23.5%) compared to Wave 1. Lower grade-level and lower annual family income predicted the increased proportions of children's clinical-level emotional symptoms, hyperactivity/inattention, and prosocial behavior at Wave 2. The total length of school closure was not a significant predictor of subsequent emotional/behavioral problems. The highest proportion of clinical-level problems at Wave 2 for the four SDQ subscales was observed in children with neurodevelopmental disorders. The number of schoolchildren with severe emotional/behavioral problems increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Appropriate prevention and early intervention programs should be provided, especially for children who are in lower grade levels, have low family incomes, or have neurodevelopmental disorders.","Takahashi, Honda","https://doi.org/10.1111/jcv2.12007","20210906","COVIDÃ¢â‚¬Â19; adolescents; children; hyperactivity; inattention; mental health; school closure","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-07","",17706,""
"Understanding why the COVID-19 pandemic-related lockdown increases mental health difficulties in vulnerable young children","The mental health consequences of school closure, social isolation, increased financial and emotional stress, and greater exposure to family conflicts are likely to be pronounced for primary school children who are known to be vulnerable. Data from prior to the pandemic are needed to provide robust assessments of the impact of COVID-19 on vulnerable children. The present study capitalises on an ongoing study of primary school children (4-8Ã‚Â years) identified as 'at-risk' for mental health problems by teachers. We collected mental health and socio-economic data prior to the pandemic and re-assessed this cohort (<i>n</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 142) via researcher-led video calls during the pandemic to evaluate the social and emotional impacts of COVID-19 for these families. Mental health problems, particularly anxiety, increased significantly in these children. Parental mental health difficulties (anxiety and depression) were also prevalent. There were higher reports of financial stress during lockdown amongst low-income families previously identified as living in poverty, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Financial strain was found to indirectly predict increases in child mental health problems through parental mental health. These findings show that the pandemic exacerbated mental health problems in already vulnerable children. These negative outcomes were explained by financial stress (e.g., lost employment, loss of income and inability to pay bills), which was negatively linked to parental mental health.","Adegboye, Williams, Collishaw, Shelton, Langley, Hobson, Burley, van Goozen","https://doi.org/10.1111/jcv2.12005","20210906","COVIDÃ¢â‚¬Â19; anxiety; child mental health; parent mental health; poverty","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-07","",17707,""
"Mental health of international migrant workers amidst large-scale dormitory outbreaks of COVID-19: A population survey in Singapore","Worldwide, COVID-19 clusters have emerged within communities of international migrant workers operating in high-density work and living environments. Despite their increased vulnerability, no study has documented the mental health burden of COVID-19 amongst these groups. To address this gap, we conducted a survey of migrant workers involved in large-scale dormitory outbreaks within Singapore. Between 22 June to 11 October 2020, questionnaires were distributed to 1011 migrant workers undergoing extended movement restrictions. Mental health symptoms were measured using the 21-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). As covariates, we assessed participants' socio-demographics, quarantine status, COVID-19 health concerns, financial stability, and exposure to news and misinformation. Linear regression models were fitted to identify factors associated with DASS-21 scores. Complete movement restrictions were associated with increased depression and stress symptoms, while being diagnosed with COVID-19 was associated with increased anxiety. Participants who harboured fears about their health or job, perceived their health to be poorer, or had greater exposure to COVID-19 rumours reported higher depression, anxiety, and stress levels. Across the cohort, rates of severe or extremely severe depression (3.1%, 95% CI: 2.1-4.3%), anxiety (4.1%, 95% CI: 2.9-5.5%), and stress (1.3%, 95% CI: 0.7-2.2%) were similar to those observed in the general population for the host country (Singapore). As the first mental health survey of low-waged migrant workers during the pandemic, our findings provide a basis to identify and support at-risk individuals. This is critical as migrant workers often have limited access to healthcare services. At the same time, we documented resilience within the cohort as a whole.","Saw, Tan, Buvanaswari, Doshi, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmh.2021.100062","20210906","Anxiety; Depression; Mental health; Migration; Pandemic; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-07","",17708,""

"Trust and well-being of postpartum women during the COVID-19 crisis: Depression and fear of COVID-19","During crisis, trust has been found to have a buffering effect in the prevention of the deterioration of mental well-being, as trust is considered to reflect the individual's capability to gain social resources including both formal and informal support. Additionally, during the COVID-19 pandemic, political trust has been found to reduce anxiety. Taking these findings into account, this study explores the association of generalised and political trust with mental well-being on current postpartum women who were particularly at risk due to a decline in social support leaving them an increased burden of caring newborns during the pandemic. We conducted a crosssectional survey in October 2020 in Japan (n=558). Depressive symptoms (above the cutoff of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS)) and Fear of Coronavirus-19 Scale (FCV-19S) scores were used as mental well-being indicators. Generalised and political trust were captured by binary variables. Results of regression analyses, in which covariates were fully adjusted, showed that higher generalised trust had a statistically significant association with lower possibility of depressive symptoms and a lower FCV-19S score, while political trust was not significantly associated with either indicator. For further understanding, we divided respondents into two groups; women living in cities where higher COVID-19 cases were reported and women living in areas with lower COVID-19 cases, to test whether the role of trust differs depending on the infection spread status. It was found that a higher generalised trust was significantly associated with a lower probability of having depressive symptoms in the areas with lower COVID-19 cases. However, statistical significance was not observed in the areas with high COVID-19 cases. This highlighted that even postpartum women who were normally capable of receiving formal and informal social support need to be taken care of in the current situation.","Matsushima, Tsuno, Okawa, Hori, Tabuchi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2021.100903","20210906","COVID-19; EPDS; FCV-19S; Generalised trust; Japan; Political trust","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-07","",17711,""

"Social Capital Changes After COVID-19 Lockdown Among Youths in China: COVID-19 Impact on Lifestyle Change Survey (COINLICS)","<b>Introduction:</b> Social capital, the effective functioning of social groups through networks of relationships, can affect mental health and may be affected by COVID-19. We aimed to examine the changes in social capital before and after the COVID-19 lockdown among the Chinese youth. <b>Methods:</b> A national convenience sample of 10,540 high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, from the COVID-19 Impact on Lifestyle Change Survey (COINLICS), reported their demographic and social capital information before and after the COVID-19 lockdown. Social capital was retrospectively measured at four levels: individual (ISC), family (FSC), community (CSC), and society (SSC). The changes of social capital were also compared across three educational levels. <b>Results:</b> Overall, ISC and CSC scores generally decreased after lockdown (15.1 to 14.8 and 13.4 to 13.1, respectively), while FSC and SSC scores increased significantly (12.7 to 13.0 and 7.1 to 7.2, respectively). At the individual level, most participants showed a constant perceived social capital; more of the remaining participants showed decreased than increased ISC (30.5% vs. 17.0%) and CSC scores (28.4% vs. 19.1%), while more participants showed increased than decreased FSC (21.7% vs. 9.2%) and SSC scores (10.3% vs. 3.9%).

"Daily Social Life of Older Adults and Vulnerabilities During the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Introduction:</b> The social integration of older adults is crucial for understanding their risk of infection and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the social lives of older adults differ, which means they are not all vulnerable to COVID-19 in the same way. This study analyzes everyday time use and social contacts of older adults to inform discussions of their vulnerabilities during the pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> Using the 2019 American time use survey (<i>N</i> = 4,256, aged 55 and older), hurdle model regressions were used to examine the relationship between age, gender, and six indicators of the degree of social contact and time use, including (1) time alone, (2) time spent with family members, (3) time spent with non-family members, (4) time spent with people in the same household, (5) number of public spaces visited, and (6) time spent in public spaces. <b>Results:</b> Results showed substantial heterogeneity in everyday time use and social contacts. Time in public places gradually decreased from the oldest-old (85 years or older), old-old (75-84 years), to mid-life (55-64 years) adults. The gaps were not explained by age differences in sociodemographic characteristics and social roles. Compared with mid-life adults, time with family members of the young-old and old-old adults decreased, but time with non-family members increased. Age differences in social roles over the life course partially explained the differences. <b>Conclusions:</b> Should these patterns of time use and social contacts persist during COVID-19; then, such variations in the organization of social life may create different exposure contexts and vulnerabilities to social distancing measures among older adults; such information could help inform interventions to better protect this population.","Chen","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.637008","20210906","age and gender differences; daily life; social contact; social inequality; time use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-07","",17715,""
"Investigation on the Mental Health Status of ICU Practitioners and Analysis of Influencing Factors During the Stable Stage of COVID-19 Epidemic in China","<b>Objective:</b> To understand the impact of COVID-19 epidemic on the mental health status of intensive care unit (ICU) practitioners in China, and to explore the relevant factors that may affect the mental health status of front-line medical workers so as to adopt efficient and comprehensive measures in a timely manner to protect the mental health of medical staff. <b>Methods:</b> The study covered most of the provinces in China, and a questionnaire survey was conducted based on the WeChat platform and the Wenjuanxing online survey tool. With the method of anonymous investigation, we chose ICU practitioners to participate in the investigation from April 5, 2020 to April 7, 2020. The respondents were divided into two groups according to strict criteria of inclusion and exclusion, those who participated in the rescue work of COVID-19 (COVID-19 group) and those who did not (non-COVID-19 group). The SCL-90 self-evaluation scale was used for the evaluation of mental health status of the subjects. <b>Results:</b> A total of 3,851 respondents completed the questionnaire. First, the overall mental health status of the targeted population, compared with the Chinese norm (<i>n</i> = 1,388), was reflected in nine related factor groups of the SCL-90 scale, and significant differences were found in every factor in both men and women, except for the interpersonal sensitivity in men. Second, the overall mental health of the non-COVID-19 group was worse than that of the COVID-19 group by the SCL-90 scale (OR = 1.98, 95% CI, 1.682-2.331).

"Diagnosing hospital bacteraemia in the framework of predictive, preventive and personalised medicine using electronic health records and machine learning classifiers","The bacteraemia prediction is relevant because sepsis is one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality. Bacteraemia prognosis primarily depends on a rapid diagnosis. The bacteraemia prediction would shorten up to 6 days the diagnosis, and, in conjunction with individual patient variables, should be considered to start the early administration of personalised antibiotic treatment and medical services, the election of specific diagnostic techniques and the determination of additional treatments, such as surgery, that would prevent subsequent complications. Machine learning techniques could help physicians make these informed decisions by predicting bacteraemia using the data already available in electronic hospital records. This study presents the application of machine learning techniques to these records to predict the blood culture's outcome, which would reduce the lag in starting a personalised antibiotic treatment and the medical costs associated with erroneous treatments due to conservative assumptions about blood culture outcomes. Six supervised classifiers were created using three machine learning techniques, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbours, on the electronic health records of hospital patients. The best approach to handle missing data was chosen and, for each machine learning technique, two classification models were created: the first uses the features known at the time of blood extraction, whereas the second uses four extra features revealed during the blood culture. The six classifiers were trained and tested using a dataset of 4357 patients with 117 features per patient. The models obtain predictions that, for the best case, are up to a state-of-the-art accuracy of 85.9%, a sensitivity of 87.4% and an AUC of 0.93. Our results provide cutting-edge metrics of interest in predictive medical models with values that exceed the medical practice threshold and previous results in the literature using classical modelling techniques in specific types of bacteraemia. Additionally, the consistency of results is reasserted because the three classifiers' importance ranking shows similar features that coincide with those that physicians use in their manual heuristics. Therefore, the efficacy of these machine learning techniques confirms their viability to assist in the aims of predictive and personalised medicine once the disease presents bacteraemia-compatible symptoms and to assist in improving the healthcare economy.","Garnica, GÃƒÂ³mez, Ramos, Hidalgo, Ruiz-GiardÃƒÂ­n","https://doi.org/10.1007/s13167-021-00252-3","20210906","Bacteraemia diagnosis; Bacteraemia prediction; Blood cultureÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s outcome prediction; COVID-19; Health policy; Healthcare economy; Individualised electronic patient record analysis; K-Nearest neighbours; Machine learning; Modelling; Personalised antibiotic treatment; Predictive; Preventive and personalised medicine (PPPM/3PM); Random forest; Support vector machine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-07","",17717,""
"Psychosocial Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic in Libya: A Cross-Sectional Study","<b>Background:</b> Since the outbreak of COVID-19 were announced in Wuhan, China, the virus has spread in most countries. After one year of restrictive measures applied by governments, it is unclear how this prolonged social distancing has affected the mental health of individuals in Libya. Therefore, the present study aims to assess the levels of perceived stress, depression, sleep disturbance, and self-efficacy associated with the pandemic in Libya and their association with the demographic factors. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional study was conducted between October 10 and November 10, 2020 in 21 cities in Libya using an online survey. The survey collected socio-demographic variables and other important psychological variables using valid scales: namely, the Perceived Stress scale, the PROMIS Depression scale, the PROMIS Sleep Disturbance scale, and self-efficacy 6-item scale. Additionally, data were collected regarding eating and smoking habits, housing and living situations, and the preparedness of the public to manage the upcoming waves of the pandemic. <b>Results:</b> The questionnaire was accessed 746 times, and a total of 683 completed questionnaires were analyzed (response rate of 91.6%), with ages ranging from 18 to 94 years (Mean Ã‚Â± SD = 27.09 Ã‚Â± 10.57). Among the respondents, 58.4% were females and 77% were from the age group 18-29 years. The perceived stress, depression, and sleep disturbance symptoms were high in overall population. For stress, 52.7 and 17.1% of respondents reported moderate and high stress, and for sleep quality 28.8 and 8.1% reported moderate and high sleep disturbance, respectively. For depression, the overall median score was 20 (out of 40). The perceived stress, depression, and sleep disturbance were more prevalent among females and the younger age groups (18-29 years old). The overall self-efficacy median total score was 6.67 (out of 10), with a significantly higher median total score for males than females (7 vs. 6.33, <i>p</i> = 0.001). About 14.5% of the respondents were regular cigarette smokers, and most of them (79.8%) described their smoking habits during the previous month as more than typical. In addition, the reported eating habits of almost half of the respondents (43%) had changed, with about one-third (29.6%) reporting that their eating habits had become less healthy during the pandemic. <b>Conclusion:</b> The findings of this research suggest increased levels of stress, depression, and sleep disturbances as well as COVID-19-related fear during the pandemic, especially among young females.

"The Threat of COVID-19 and Job Insecurity Impact on Depression and Anxiety: An Empirical Study in the USA","As the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic causes a general concern regarding the overall mental health of employees worldwide, policymakers across nations are taking precautions for curtailing and scaling down dispersion of the coronavirus. In this study, we conceptualized a framework capturing recurring troublesome elements of mental states such as depression and general anxiety, assessing them by applying standard clinical inventory. The study explores the extent to which danger control and fear control under the Extended Parallel Processing Model (EPPM) threat impact job insecurity, with uncertainty phenomenon causing afflicting effect on the experiential nature of depression heightened by anxiety. With the aim to explore the job insecurity relationship with anxiety and depression, and measure the impact of EPPM threat, an empirical study was conducted in the United States on a sample of 347 white collar employees. Demographic data, EPPM threat, job insecurity, anxiety, and depression data were collected <i>via</i> a standardized questionnaire during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The questionnaire consisting of multi-item scales was distributed online. All the scale items were evaluated on a 5-point Likert scale. SEM software AMOS version 23 was used to perform confirmatory factor analysis with maximum likelihood estimation. In the structural model, relationships between the threat of COVID-19, job insecurity, anxiety, and depression were assessed. The findings of the study suggest that job insecurity has a significant impact on depression and anxiety, whereas the threat of COVID-19 has a significant impact on depression. Mediating effects of job insecurity and EPPM threat impact on anxiety were not established in the study. The study contributes to the apprehension of the repercussions of major environmental disruptions on normal human functioning, and it investigates the effects of self-reported protective behaviors on risk perception. The study also explains the underlying mechanisms of coping behavior as possible antecedents to mental disorders. When subjected to stressful events, heightened psychological arousal causes physical and psychological challenges of affected employees to manifest as behavioral issues.","Obrenovic, Du, Godinic, Baslom, Tsoy","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.648572","20210906","COVID-19; EPPM model; EPPM threat; anxiety; depression; job insecurity; mood disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-07","",17719,""
"Associations Between COVID-19 Symptoms and Psychological Distress","<b>Background:</b> Hospital isolation for COVID-19 may cause significant psychological stress. The association between COVID-19 symptoms and psychological symptoms has not been systematically studied. We investigated the effects of telephonic intervention on the relationship between psychological symptoms and COVID-19 symptoms at the time of hospitalization and 1 week later. <b>Method:</b> We screened 461 patients with COVID-19 for psychiatric symptoms from February 29, 2020, to January 3, 2021. In total, 461 patients were evaluated 2 days after admission, and 322 (69.8%) were followed 1 week later. To assess anxiety and depressive symptoms, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was administered to patients once per week. The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and item 9 of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-9) were used weekly to assess insomnia and suicidal ideation. <b>Results:</b> Of 461 enrolled patients, we observed clinically meaningful psychological anxiety symptoms (in 75/16.3% of patients), depression (122/26.5%), insomnia (154/33.4%), and suicidal ideation (54/11.7%). Commonly reported COVID-19 symptoms are cough/sputum/sneezing (244, 52.9%), headache/dizziness (98, 21.3%), myalgia (113, 24.5%), and sore throat (89, 19.3%). Compared to baseline, significant improvements were found in anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation at 1 week. No significant group differences in ISI score were observed. <b>Conclusions:</b> COVID-19 symptoms at baseline had a significant and persistent negative impact on anxiety and depression at admission and at 1 week after hospitalization.

"COVID-19 Related Psychological Distress, Fear and Coping: Identification of High-Risk Groups in Bangladesh","<b>Background:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed psychological distress and fear across the globe; however, factors associated with those issues or the ways people cope may vary by country or context. This study aimed to investigate the factors associated with psychological distress, fear, and coping strategies for people living in Bangladesh during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional study conducted in August-September 2020 using online platforms in Bangladesh. People residing in Bangladesh, aged Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years, who were proficient in English and able to respond to online questionnaire. The Kessler Psychological Distress Scale was used to assess the psychological stress. Level of fear was assessed using the Fear of COVID-19 Scale, and strategies to cope were assessed using the Brief Resilient Coping Scale. <b>Results:</b> Of the 962 participants, half of them were aged between 30 and 59 years. Being born in Bangladesh, having graduate education, perceived distress due to employment change, effect of COVID-19 on financial situation, having multiple comorbidities, and visiting a healthcare provider in the last 4 weeks were associated with higher levels of both psychological distress and fear of COVID-19. Furthermore, higher psychological distress was associated with being a female (AOR 1.81, 95% CI 1.33-2.47, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), being a frontline worker (AOR 1.50, 95% CI 1.04-2.15, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), having pre-existing psychiatric problems (AOR 4.03, 95% CI 1.19-13.7, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), being a smoker (AOR 2.02, 95% CI 1.32-3.09, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01), providing care to a known/suspected COVID-19 patient (AOR 1.96, 95% CI 1.40-2.72, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), having a recent overseas travel history and being in self-quarantine (AOR 4.59, 95% CI 1.23-17.2, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), self-isolation without COVID-19 (AOR 2.63, 95% CI 1.68-4.13, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) or being COVID-19 positive (AOR 2.53, 95% CI 1.19-5.34, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), and having high levels of fear of COVID-19 (AOR 3.27, 95% CI 2.29-4.66, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).

"Gender Differences in Mental Health Disorder and Substance Abuse of Chinese International College Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Introduction:</b> The outbreak of coronavirus disease has negatively impacted college students' mental health across the world. In addition, substance abuse also is trouble among these students. This study aims to find the gender difference in Chinese international college students' mental health and substance abuse during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Method:</b> We conducted an online survey using PHQ-9, GAD-7, and several questions related to substance abuse frequency, self-injury, and suicidal thoughts, 535 male and 475 female Chinese international college students whose ages ranged from 18 to 23 years old (<b>x</b> = 20.19, SD = 1.50) were recruited during the epidemic. We utilized <i>t</i>-test and binary logistic regression in our study to find out the difference and statistical significance between substance abuse issues and mental health problems across gender. <b>Results:</b> Both male and female Chinese international college students had statistical significance with self-injury ideas and behaviors (<i>t</i> = -2.21, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, the male college students with anxiety problems had positive statistical significance with medicine (<i>OR</i> = 3.47, <i>95%CI</i> = 1.45-8.30, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) and negative statistical significance with drinks (<i>OR</i> = 0.23, 95%CI = 0.08-0.65, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). While for female college students with an anxiety problem, they had positive statistical significance with medicine (<i>OR</i> = 4.88, <i>95%CI</i> = 1.53-15.57, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01), drugs (<i>OR</i> = 4.48, <i>95%CI</i> = 1.41-14.25, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) and cigarettes (<i>OR</i> = 6.63, <i>95%CI</i> = 1.95-22.57, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) and negative statistical significance with drinks (<i>OR</i> = 0.18, <i>95%CI</i> = -0.05 to 0.65, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). <b>Conclusion:</b> This is the first cross-sectional study focusing on the Chinese international college students' mental health and substance abuse problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that Chinese international college students' mental health and substance abuse situation has been negatively influenced during this period.

"Psychological Outcomes and Associated Factors Among the International Students Living in China During the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Background:</b> The emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has created a severe mental health problem for international students living in China. Despite the little information on the psychological impact on international students, we aimed to assess the psychological outcomes and associated factors among international students currently living in China during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> An online cross-sectional survey was conducted from May 28, 2020 to June 12, 2020 on 402 full-time international students across 26 provinces in China. The frequency of symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, insomnia, psychological distress, loneliness, and fear was assessed with the English versions of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K6), University of California, Los Angeles, Loneliness Scale (UCLA-LS), and Fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S) scales, respectively. <b>Results:</b> The prevalence of symptoms of depression (73.4%), anxiety (76.6%), stress (58.5%), insomnia (77.6%), psychological distress (71.4%), loneliness (62.4%), and fear (73.1%) among international students during the COVID-19 pandemic was shown. The prevalence of moderate to extremely severe symptoms of all psychological outcomes was significantly associated with 26-30-year-old students, students who lived with roommates, and students who stayed in China shorter than 2 years. Participants in the central region reported significantly moderate to extremely severe symptom levels of all the psychological outcomes except fear symptoms. Univariate analysis indicated that a significant association of all psychological outcomes was found among 26-30-year-old students and students who stayed in China shorter than 2 years. Multivariate analysis showed that Engineering, Business, Social Sciences and Law, and Language students were significantly associated with the symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and fear. Participants staying in China for shorter than 2 years were associated with a higher risk of all psychological outcomes except psychological distress and loneliness symptoms. <b>Conclusions:</b> We found a higher prevalence of psychological outcomes and risk factors among international students during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Characterizing Changes in Screen Time During the COVID-19 Pandemic School Closures in Canada and Its Perceived Impact on Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increase in screen time for children and families. Traditionally, screen time has been associated with negative physical and mental health outcomes, and children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are at increased risk of these outcomes. The primary objectives of this study were to (1) characterize the change in screen time during COVID-19 school closures for children with ASD, and (2) examine the parent perceived impact of screen time on mental health and quality of life of children and their families. Canadian parents and caregivers of children 19 years of age and younger were eligible to participate in an anonymous, online survey study. This survey was available in English, consisted of 28 questions, took ~10-min to complete, and was available for 6 weeks (May 22 through July 6, 2020). The total sample consisted of 414 responses (ASD: <i>n</i> = 127, mean age = 11.7 Ã‚Â± 4.06 years; community sample: <i>n</i> = 287, mean age = 9.4 Ã‚Â± 4.26 years). Seventy-one respondents were missing responses to our primary question and removed from the analyses (final sample <i>n</i> = 344). Compared to the community sample, the ASD group had a significantly higher screen time use before and during the COVID-19 pandemic school closures [weekdays: difference = 1.14 (SE = 0.18), <i>t</i> = 6.56, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001; weekends: difference = 1.41 (SE = 0.20), <i>t</i> = 6.93, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001]. Mean total screen time during the pandemic was 6.9 h (95% CI 6.49, 7.21) on weekdays and 6.3 h (95% CI 5.91, 6.63) on weekends for the ASD group, and 5.6 h (95% CI 5.28, 5.92) on weekdays and 5.0 h (95% CI 4.70, 5.34) on weekends for the community sample. There was a significant increase in screen time during the COVID-19 pandemic as compared to before the pandemic period in the ASD group [weekdays: mean difference = 3.8 h (95% CI 3.35-4.25), <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001; weekends: mean difference = 1.5 h (95% CI 1.17-1.92), <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001]. Gender was a significant predictor of parent perceived mental health and quality of life, with male gender associated with a higher likelihood of negative impact [quality of life (child/family) OR = 1.8 (95% CI 1.1-2.9), corrected <i>p</i> = 0.040; mental health OR = 1.9 (95% CI 1.1-3.1), corrected <i>p</i> = 0.0028]. Parents' most frequently endorsed emotions toward screen time were guilt, frustration, and worry. Results of this survey study revealed that children with ASD were less likely to benefit from screen time to cope with social isolation, and screen time resulted in significantly more lost time on social interactions than the community sample, which may exacerbate difficulties in social domains. Given the unprecedented circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic and the novel context of technology use, the findings of this study highlight the need for revision of screen time recommendations to reflect the current needs of children and families.","Cardy, Dupuis, Anagnostou, Ziolkowski, Biddiss, Monga, Brian, Penner, Kushki","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.702774","20210906","COVID-19; autism spectrum disorder; children; pandemic; screen time","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-07","",17724,""

"Awareness and Mental Health of Male Drug Addicts With Tuberculosis During the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Introduction:</b> At present, the COVID-19 pandemic remains the most pressing global health issue. Given the significant amount of public awareness, the infection rate and rehabilitation efforts are governed not only by the compliance of transmission mitigation strategies but also by the understanding of coexisting diseases and COVID-19 in patients with chronic infectious diseases. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the differences in demographics, as well as awareness, risk perception, and emotional reactions, among imprisoned drug addicts with and without tuberculosis (TB) regarding their perceptions of and feelings toward the COVID-19 pandemic. The secondary goal of the study was also to measure how the psychological health and nutritional indices of the drug addicts with TB changed during their ongoing rehabilitation. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 265 male drug addicts, 45 of which were positive for TB and another 220 who were negative, were selected as subjects from a mandatory detoxification and rehabilitation center (MDRC). Data were collected through a combination of questionnaires (questions regarding COVID-19 awareness, emotional knowledge and responses, and SCL-90 tests), anthropometric examination, and laboratory blood tests, with which inferential and descriptive statistical analyses were performed. <b>Results:</b> During a period of 1 week in early 2021, the differences in the accuracy of the responses from the questions probing the awareness of COVID-19 symptoms, transmission, susceptible populations, what kind of mask should be worn, and preventive measures between TB addicts to non-TB addicts were 11.11 vs. 60.45%, 57.78 vs. 77.27%, 66.67 vs. 78.64%, 97.98 vs. 97.73%, and 93.33 vs. 65.91%, respectively. In the risk perception and emotional reaction sections of the questionnaire, there was a significant difference in the responses to ""What you were more worried about was?"" (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and ""Alteration in your mood since the outbreak?"" (<i>p</i> = 0.002) between the two cohorts. In the section assessing the 10 dimensions of the SCL-90 scale, there were significant differences between the TB addicts and the Chinese norm. In addition, the BMI (21.06 Ã‚Â± 2.65 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and total serum protein (77.14 Ã‚Â± 6.12 g/L) levels of the TB addicts were normal, but the serum hemoglobin (117.02 Ã‚Â± 4.97 g/L) and albumin (42.08 Ã‚Â± 1.81 g/L) levels were significantly lower in the TB addicts compared to the norm (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). <b>Conclusion:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic we are facing is both an epidemiologic and a psychological crisis. However, while the COVID-19 epidemic will eventually disappear (or become manageable, similar to the flu), the TB epidemic may still persist. To avoid the deleterious consequences of multiple simultaneous epidemics, complementary response measures to COVID-19 and TB can help curb the exacerbation of both situations and, therefore, save lives. Imprisoned drug addicts, especially those with TB, can master relevant knowledge on COVID-19.","Jia, Li, Xu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.697508","20210906","COVID-19; awareness; drug addicts; immunomodulation; mental health; rehabilitation; tuberculosis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-07","",17726,""
"Correlates and Predictors of PTSD Symptoms Among Healthcare Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Results of the egePan-VOICE Study","<b>Background:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic has led to ongoing challenges for healthcare systems across the world. Previous research has provided evidence for an increased prevalence of depression and anxiety as well as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In Germany, however, only scarce data on correlates and predictors for PTSD symptomatology in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic among healthcare workers (HCW) are available. <b>Methods:</b> This research is part of a large prospective web-based survey (egePan-VOICE study) among HCW in Germany. The current sample (<i>N</i> = 4,724) consisted of physicians (<i>n</i> = 1,575), nurses (<i>n</i> = 1,277), medical technical assistants (MTA, <i>n</i> = 1,662), and psychologists (<i>n</i> = 210). PTSD symptomatology was measured using the abbreviated version of the Impact of Event Scale (IES-6). In addition, sociodemographic, occupational, COVID-19-related, psychological (e.g., depressive symptoms and generalized anxiety), as well as work-related variables were assessed. <b>Results:</b> Our findings revealed significant higher PTSD symptoms with medium effect sizes among HCW reporting an increased self-report burden during the pandemic, increased fear of becoming infected or infecting relatives with the virus, sleep problems, feeling physically or mentally exhausted, as well as increased levels of depressiveness and generalized anxiety. According to multiple linear regression analysis, the most relevant predictors for higher IES-6 scores were increased level of generalized anxiety and depressiveness, increased fear of infecting relatives, as well as medical profession (MTA compared to physicians). <b>Conclusion:</b> Despite the cross-sectional design of our study, the here identified associations with PTSD symptomatology may provide a basis for future preventive interventions.","Steudte-Schmiedgen, Stieler, Erim, Morawa, Geiser, Beschoner, Jerg-Bretzke, Albus, Hiebel, Weidner","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.686667","20210906","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; healthcare; mental health; post-traumatic stress disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-07","",17727,""

Among these, 23-27% respondents reported clinically significant levels of anxiety and depression. Whereas, easing of the lockdown restrictions was shown to be associated with decreasing mean scores of PHQ-9 and GAD-7. The noted burden fell heavily on female workers, those with a current or a history of psychiatric disorders, suffering from chronic diseases, being in workplaces with high exposure to COVID-19 or in contact with COVID-19 patients, nurses, as well as those who were living with elderly and perceived their physical and mental health as ""much worse"" compared to the time before the pandemic. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our findings identified several predictors for anxiety and depression at different time-points of the pandemic.

"Perceived Risk of Infection Linked to Changes in Comfort in Social Situations From Before to During the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Background:</b> Social lives have significantly changed since social distancing measures have been implemented to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study aimed to investigate how our appraisal of social situations changed during the pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> In two online surveys, conducted in October 2019 and April 2020, 58 participants rated their personal level of comfort for sketches depicting social situations. Situations were separately categorized according to the risk of a possible COVID-19 infection and changes in ratings were analyzed by using a repeated measures ANOVA. Moreover, potential influencing factors on the change in ratings such as perceived infection risk and social factors like regular frequency and liking of social interactions were examined. <b>Results:</b> There was a significant interaction (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) between time of measurement and risk category. Comfort ratings of depicted situations with low and medium infection risk were higher during the second compared to the first survey period. Ratings of high-risk situations did not change significantly, although there was a tendency toward lower ratings during the pandemic. Multiple regression analyses showed that perceived probability of short-term infection could explain variance in the change of ratings of social situations with low- and medium risk, but not perceived probability of long-term infection or social factors. <b>Conclusion:</b> The results suggest that the change of participant's appraisal of the social situations during the COVID-19 pandemic relates to perceived infection risk. Both, the risk associated with the specific scenario as well as the general belief of short-term infection risk were associated with change. This change predominantly manifested in greater thought of comfort during low and medium risk situations, which might give a sense of safety during the pandemic. The finding that high-risk social situations were not rated as uncomfortable as expected must be considered with regard to the young sample and may not be generalizable to other individuals. Further research is necessary to evaluate long-term effects on social interactions caused by global pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Stierand, Luebber, Krach, Paulus, Rademacher","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.678072","20210906","COVID-19; disease avoidance; mental health; pandemic; risk perception; social distancing; social interactions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-07","",17729,""
"Drug Use Frequency Variation and Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic: an Online Survey","In December 2019, a new disease caused by a coronavirus was first identified in China and quickly spread across the world, causing a large number of deaths. Quarantine has been implemented in many countries as a measure to prevent the spread of the disease. The impact of this situation on drug use and mental health is still poorly understood. Therefore, this cross-sectional study sought to assess possible associations between quarantine, the use of psychoactive substances, and symptoms of depression and anxiety. The assessment instruments used were the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9); the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale; and an adaptation of the Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST). The sample consisted of 2398 participants who met the following inclusion criteria: being in quarantine, aged 18 years or older, and living in Brazil. There was a decrease in the frequency of use of practically all drugs investigated in the evaluated sample. However, some factors were associated with less variations in the frequency of substance use before and during quarantine. These factors were being male, single, and having an occupation different from homemaker.","Adinolfi, Bezerra, Curado, de Souza, GaldurÃƒÂ³z","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-021-00546-7","20210906","COVID-19; Drug use; Mental health; Pandemic; Quarantine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-07","",17730,""
"The Impact of Non-Ophthalmic Factors on Intravitreal Injections During the COVID-19 Lockdown","Early on in the COVID-19 pandemic, it was difficult to know what factors would affect patient and physician decision-making regarding ophthalmic care utilization. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of non-ophthalmic factors on patient decision-making to receive intravitreal injections during the COVID-19 lockdown. Data on patients who had intravitreal injection appointments at a tertiary care Veterans Health Administration clinic during a seven-week period (March 19, 2020-May 8, 2020) of the COVID-19 outbreak in Los Angeles County were collected and compared to patients who had intravitreal injection appointments during the same time period in 2019. Demographic characteristics, injection diagnoses, visual acuities, body mass indices, co-morbidities, and psychiatric conditions of patients and clinic volumes were tabulated and compared between the two time periods. There were 86 patients in the injection clinic in 2020 compared to 176 patients in 2019. The mean age and gender of patients in the injection clinic did not differ between 2019 and 2020. Compared to 2019, the number of patients who identified as Hispanic or Latino remained nearly the same, but the number of patients who identified as White, Black, or Asian or Pacific Islander decreased by nearly half. In 2020, a greater proportion of patients came to the injection clinic for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (56.5% vs 39.3%, p=0.017), but a decreased proportion of patients diagnosed with a heart condition (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.33, 0.96), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.21, 0.91), or asthma (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01, 0.70) came to the injection clinic. The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with behavioral changes in eyecare utilization influenced by race and systemic co-morbidities. These data can be used to design and implement strategies to address disparities in essential ophthalmic care among vulnerable populations.","Ashrafzadeh, Gundlach, Tsui","https://doi.org/10.2147/OPTH.S314840","20210906","anti-vascular endothelial growth factor; co-morbidities; coronavirus disease 2019; disparities; neovascular age-related macular degeneration; retina","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-07","",17731,""
"A Study on the Assessment of Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Depression: An Observational Study among the Pregnant Women","COVID-19 pandemic has affected the pregnant women both physically and mentally. This study is conducted to assess, the impact on COVID-19 pandemic on psychiatric symptoms among pregnancy and to compare them with non-pregnant women. An observational study was conducted at Govt. Medical College &amp; Hospital, Ooty (Udhagamandalam). A validated Edinburgh Depression Scale was used to screen the mental health status. Categorical variables were analysed using Chi-square test and continuous variables by independent <i>t</i> test. A Pearson's correlation analysis was performed to check the association of Edinburgh postnatal depression scores with the demographic characteristics. Paired <i>t</i> test was conducted to find the difference in EPDS scores at baseline and study conclusion visit. Regression analysis was conducted to predict the outcome variables. The Edinburgh Depression scores were significantly higher in the pregnant women group, (12.48Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.753 vs. 8.00Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.436; <i>p</i> valueÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001; 95% CI 3.340-5.627), when compared to non-pregnant women (12.90Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.731 vs. 9.20Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.973; <i>p</i> valueÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001; 95% CI 2.480-4.920).

"Impact of mental health on disease activity in mastocytosis during COVID-19 pandemic","Mast cell-related symptoms might be influenced by mental health status in mastocytosis. In this study, we aimed to investigate the influence of mental health problems developed during the COVID-19 pandemic on the course of mastocytosis. Mental health status in 60 adult patients with mastocytosis was prospectively evaluated with the total Depression-Anxiety-Stress Scale (tDASS-21) and Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) in the lockdown period (LP) and the return to normal period (RTNP) during the pandemic. The disease course was assessed from emergency and outpatient medical reports, including Scoring Mastocytosis (SCORMA) index and serum baseline tryptase levels, by telephone interviews and clinical visits. The mean FCV-19S and median tDASS-21 scores were significantly higher in LP than RTNP (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001) and there was a positive correlation between FCV-19S and tDASS-21 in LP (rÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.820, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001) and in RTNP (rÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.572 p= &lt;0.001). Disease-related symptoms including skin lesions, flushing and anaphylaxis attacks increased in 22 patients in LP, and in this group, mean FCV-19S and median tDASS-21 were higher than those without symptom exacerbation (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001). During the study period, four (6.7%) patients who experienced COVID-19 recovered without any requirement for hospitalization and had not experienced symptom exacerbation. Fear of COVID-19 can be a reason for mental health changes, including depression, anxiety and stress which may further increase mast cell-related symptoms. Therefore, psychological support is important to control the severity of mast cell-related symptoms in mastocytosis during a pandemic.","Ãƒâ€“ztop, Demir, Beyaz, ÃƒÅ“nal, Ãƒâ€¡olakoÃ„Å¸lu, BÃƒÂ¼yÃƒÂ¼kÃƒÂ¶ztÃƒÂ¼rk, Gelincik","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.alit.2021.08.002","20210906","COVID-19; DASS-21 scale; Fear of COVID-19; Mastocytosis; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-07","",17735,""
"The experience of diagnostic radiography students during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic - a cross-sectional study","The rationale for this study was to ascertain the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Undergraduate B.Sc (Hons) Diagnostic Radiography students at the University of Hertfordshire in the UK. This would provide an ideal opportunity for students to reflect on their experience and indicate if they required additional support from the University. An online anonymous cross-sectional survey was deployed to all year groups (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 283) during the first nationwide lockdown in May 2020, eliciting qualitative responses on questions about the effect of the pandemic; emotions experienced; support required and consideration of their choice of a career in the health sector. Two hundred and one students responded to the survey, with many having experienced the illness or loss of a loved one. Trying to balance family commitments and study was a concern to some students, as well as struggling with the financial burden of job losses or furlough. Many students commented that educational support was a requirement with the move to online teaching and assessment. The main focus of student responses was the emotions that they had experienced, many of which were negative. Anxiety and fear were commonly expressed feelings, along with sadness and feelings of isolation. A small number of students reported feeling grateful, happy and relieved. An overwhelming majority of respondents commented that they were proud to be healthcare students and they were resolute in wanting to continue the course and join the frontline of the NHS workforce. Some students have been deeply affected by their experiences of the pandemic, and University support mechanisms should be refined to better assist with their ongoing challenges.","Lawson Jones, York, Lawal, Cherrill, Mercer, McCarthy","https://doi.org/10.1002/jmrs.544","20210905","COVID-19; diagnostic radiography; emotion; student; support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-07","",17736,""
"Influencing Factors for Mental Health of General Practitioners in Hebei Province under the Outbreak of COVID-19: a Cross-Sectional Study","This study aimed to understand the mental health status of general practitioners (GPs) in Hebei Province during the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), analyze influencing factors, and establish and evaluate the risk prediction model. During February 25-29, 2020, a self-designed questionnaire was used to conduct an online survey of GPs in Hebei Province. The survey included a questionnaire on GPs' basic information, a questionnaire on GPs' working hardware and software facilities, and a questionnaire on GPs' mental health condition. A total of 1040 participants returned the completely filled valid questionnaire, and the answers were analyzed using the Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> test, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, and logistic regression with SPSS 20.0 software. Based on the results of multiple logistic regression analysis, a risk prediction model was established, and the receiver operating characteristic curve was used to evaluate the model. The results showed that 44.2% (460/1040) of GPs expressed anxiety after the outbreak. Absence of pre-screening clinics, fever clinics, or isolated observation rooms in primary medical institutions; persons in the administrative area required to be isolated; low sleep quality of GPs; and less than 6 h of sleep per day of GPs were risk factors affecting the mental health status of GPs. Also, epidemic-related training and adequate protective equipment were protective factors for the mental health status of GPs. The government should strengthen the infrastructure construction of community institutions, equip them with sufficient epidemic protection equipment, ensure the rest time of GPs, and strengthen mental health training to ensure the mental and physical health of GPs.","Zhang, Song, Zhang, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14783","20210905","COVID-19; epidemic situation; general practitioner; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-07","",17737,""
"COVID-19 manifestations in people with Parkinson's disease: a USA cohort","With the explosion of COVID-19 globally, it was unclear if people with Parkinson's disease (PD) were at increased risk for severe manifestations or negative outcomes.

We surveyed PD patients who reported COVID-19 to their Movement Disorders specialists at Columbia University Irving Medical Center and respondents from an online survey administered by the Parkinson's Foundation that assessed COVID-19 symptoms, general clinical outcomes and changes in motor and non-motor PD symptoms. Forty-six participants with PD and COVID-19 were enrolled. Similar to the general population, the manifestations of COVID-19 among people with PD were heterogeneous ranging from asymptomatic carriers (1/46) to death (6/46). The most commonly reported COVID-19 symptoms were fever/chills, fatigue, cough, weight loss, and muscle pain. Worsening and new onset of motor and non-motor PD symptoms during COVID-19 illness were also reported, including dyskinesia, rigidity, balance disturbances, anxiety, depression, and insomnia. We did not find sufficient evidence that PD is an independent risk factor for severe COVID-19 and death. Larger studies with controls are required to understand this further.

"Psychiatric emergency visit trends and characteristics in a mental health epicenter in Istanbul during COVID-19 lockdown","We aimed to explore the impact of the preventive measures and partial lockdown to the psychiatric emergency department (PED) visits during COVID-19 pandemic in a mental health epicenter in Istanbul. A total of 5839 patients admitted to PED during the lockdown period (LP) between March 30 and May 31, 2020, were enrolled in this retrospective cohort study. Data of these patients were compared to those of patients in the same period in 2019 between April 1 and June 2, 2019 (non-LP). We also investigated the monthly number of PED visits and hospitalizations between March 1 and December 31, 2020, and compared it to the same period in 2019. The volume of PED visits and hospitalizations in LP decreased by 12% and 41.6%, respectively. The rates of patients presenting anxiety and depressive disorders and bipolar disorders were found to significantly increase in LP than non-LP (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01, respectively). Depressive disorders, prior history of mental illness, and aggressive behavior were found to predict frequent PED visits while decrease in age and male gender found to predict hospitalizations. Regarding suicide attempt, younger patients and those with new-onset mental disorders were found to be at high risk in LP. Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in PED visits were mostly with psychotic and bipolar disorders. Policy-makers should focus on studies on mental health services to reorganize and enhance such services, which are crucial to prevent and manage adverse mental health consequences of the pandemic and congestion in PEDs.","YalÃƒÂ§Ã„Â±n, BaÃ…Å¸, Bilici, Ãƒâ€“zdemir, BeÃ…Å¸tepe, Kurnaz, GÃƒÂ¼neÃ…Å¸, Kurt, Koyu","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00127-021-02171-0","20210905","COVID-19; Lockdown; Mental health services; Psychiatric emergency department; Suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-07","",17739,""
"The psychological impact of COVID-19 among primary care physicians in the province of Verona, Italy: a cross-sectional study during the first pandemic wave","Among healthcare professionals working with COVID-19 patients, general practitioners (GPs) are under considerable pressure and may develop adverse mental health outcomes. To assess mental health outcomes on GPs working during the COVID-19 pandemic and to explore their associations with personal characteristics and features of GP practices. Observational cross-sectional study conducted on a sample of GPs working in Verona province (Italy) during the first pandemic wave. Participants were invited to complete a web-based form addressing socio-demographic and work-related information, previous practice organization, practice re-organization during the COVID-19 pandemic, and a set of measures for post-traumatic stress (IES-R), anxiety (SAS), depression (PHQ-9), and burnout (MBI-GS). A total of 215 GPs (38.3% of the eligible population) participated. Overall, 44.7% reported COVID-19-related traumatic events; among these, 35.9% (95% CI, 26%Ã¢â‚¬â€™46%) developed symptoms of post-traumatic distress. Furthermore, 36% (95% CI, 29%Ã¢â‚¬â€™43%) reported symptoms of anxiety, 17.9% (95% CI, 12%Ã¢â‚¬â€™23%) symptoms of at least moderate depression, and 25.4% (95% CI, 19%Ã¢â‚¬â€™32%) symptoms of burnout. Multivariate regressions showed that being quarantined or admitted for COVID-19 was associated with all the mental health outcomes considered. Being female, working in rural settings, and having less professional experience were associated with higher anxiety and depression. The ability to diagnose COVID-19 increased self-perceived professional efficacy, thus contributing to burnout reduction. The high prevalence of adverse mental health outcomes among GPs during the pandemic highlights the importance of timely interventions in this population and promoting targeted preventive actions in the event of future healthcare crises.","Lasalvia, Rigon, Rugiu, Negri, Del Zotti, Amaddeo, Bonetto","https://doi.org/10.1093/fampra/cmab106","20210905","COVID-19; anxiety; burnout; depression; general practitioners; post-traumatic stress symptoms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-07","",17740,""
"Factors associated with psychiatric adverse effects in healthcare personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ecuador","Since the emergence of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the world has faced a pandemic with consequences at all levels. In many countries, the health systems collapsed and healthcare professionals had to be on the front line of this crisis. The adverse effects on the mental health of healthcare professionals have been widely reported. This research focuses on identifying the main factors associated with adverse psychological outcomes. Descriptive, cross-sectional study based on surveys, applying the PHQ-9, GAD-7, ISI and EIE-R tests to healthcare professionals from Ecuador during the COVID-19 pandemic. 1028 participants, distributed in: 557 physicians (54.18%), 349 nurses (33.94%), 29 laboratory workers (2.82%), 27 paramedics (2.62%), 52 psychologists (5.05%) and 14 respiratory therapists (1.36%), from 16 of the 24 provinces of Ecuador. Of these, 27.3% presented symptoms of depression, 39.2% anxiety symptoms, 16.3% insomnia and 43.8% symptoms of PTSD, with the 4 types of symptoms ranging from moderate to severe. The most relevant associated factors were: working in Guayas (the most affected province) (ORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯2.18 for depressive symptoms and ORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯2.59 for PTSD symptoms); being a postgraduate doctor (ORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1.52 for depressive symptoms and ORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1.57 for insomnia), perception of not having the proper protective equipment (ORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1.71 for symptoms of depression and ORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1.57 for symptoms of anxiety) and being a woman (ORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1.39 for anxiety). Healthcare professionals can suffer a significant mental condition that may require psychiatric and psychological intervention. The main associated factors are primarily related to living and working in cities with a higher number of cases and the characteristics of the job, such as being a postgraduate doctor, as well as the perception of security. The main risk factors are primarily related to geographical distribution and job characteristics, such as being a resident physician and self-perception of safety.

"Mental illness and suicide among physicians","The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened interest in how physician mental health can be protected and optimised, but uncertainty and misinformation remain about some key issues. In this Review, we discuss the current literature, which shows that despite what might be inferred during training, physicians are not immune to mental illness, with between a quarter and a third reporting increased symptoms of mental ill health. Physicians, particularly female physicians, are at an increased risk of suicide. An emerging consensus exists that some aspects of physician training, working conditions, and organisational support are unacceptable. Changes in medical training and health systems, and the additional strain of working through a pandemic, might have amplified these problems. A new evidence-informed framework for how individual and organisational interventions can be used in an integrated manner in medical schools, in health-care settings, and by professional colleagues is proposed. New initiatives are required at each of these levels, with an urgent need for organisational-level interventions, to better protect the mental health and wellbeing of physicians.","Harvey, Epstein, Glozier, Petrie, Strudwick, Gayed, Dean, Henderson","https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)01596-8","20210905","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-07","",17742,""

"[About the causes and therapy of depressive disorders in COVID-19]","Brief information about the causes of depressive disorders in COVID-19 and general strategies of their treatment is presented. According to the biopsychosocial model of the development of mental diseases, depressive disorders in COVID-19 develop due to the toxic effect of the coronavirus on nervous system and other organism systems, possible side-effects of COVID-19 therapy, the psychogenic effect of excessive and inaccurate information about the coronavirus infection and the consequences of its spread, adverse social changes during the pandemic. If infection with the SARS-CoV-2 did not develop, depressive disorders may arise due to psychogenic information and negative social influences. If coronavirus infection is present, depressive disorders can manifest during the acute period of COVID-19 and after recovery from COVID-19. Depressive disorders may occur for the first time in a patient with COVID-19 or infection can aggravate depression that has been in remission. Care should consistently include psychosocial activities, psychocorrection and psychopharmacotherapy. For the prevention of onset of depressive disorders, it is better to implement social-hygienic and psychological-pedagogical measures. Psychotherapy and psychopharmacotherapy become more important in the development of clinically expressed depressive disorders.

"[Correction of mitochondrial dysfunction in the complex rehabilitation of COVID-19]","To study the effectiveness of a course of intravenous administration of cytoflavin in combination with a standard rehabilitation program for post-COVID fatigue syndrome caused by mitochondrial dysfunction. The dynamic examination of 45 patients with post-COVID syndrome at the second stage of rehabilitation was carried out. The patients were subdivided into 2 groups comparable in gender and age. The volume of lung damage in patients of both groups was also comparable at range of 25-80%. Twenty-four patients of the control group were treated with the standard post-COVID rehabilitation protocol: pulse magnetic therapy, inhalation therapy, aeroion therapy, infrared laser therapy, course aerobic training, psychotherapy, and standard drug therapy. Twenty-one patients of the main group additionally received intravenous administration of cytoflavin daily for 10 days. The dynamics of the scores on the Rehabilitation Routing Scale, HDRS, the Asthenic Status Scale, and the 6-minute walk test was analyzed. The additional intravenous administration of cytoflavin at the complex rehabilitation of post-COVID syndrome can significantly improve the therapeutic results: it significantly improves the overall functional state, reduces depression and fatigue level and increases tolerance to physical exertion.

"From the time of the Covid-19 to the time of care in nursing homes","Le bouleversement du cadre des soins en Ehpad par la gestion de la Covid-19Â nous Ã©loigne du temps intÃ©rieur des rÃ©sidents et des soignants. Le traumatisme actuel du confinement et des morts du virus doit aussi sâ€™aborder sous lâ€™angle de lâ€™aprÃ¨s-coup des traumatismes et des deuils du passÃ© institutionnel. Il amplifie lâ€™angoisse de vivre la derniÃ¨re Ã©tape de lâ€™existence, souvent masquÃ©e par les rÃ©sidents et non perÃ§ue par les soignants, et rappelle le rÃ´le psychique essentiel de la position dÃ©pressive. The upheavals in care provision engendered by the management of Covid-19 in nursing homes distances us from the inner world of inpatients and caregivers. The trauma of lockdown and death need to be viewed in the perspective of the aftermath of past trauma and bereavement in the institution. It amplifies the anxiety of being in the last stages of life, often dissimulated by residents and not perceived by caregivers, and recalls the prominent psychic component in depressive conditions.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.npg.2021.06.003","20210101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-07","",17750,""
