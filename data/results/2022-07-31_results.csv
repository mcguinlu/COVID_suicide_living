"The impact of COVID-19 on adolescents with eating disorders: Increased need for medical stabilization and decreased access to care","We aimed to identify trends of patients with eating disorders (EDs) requiring hospitalization before and during the pandemic at a children's hospital in the southeastern United States. A retrospective chart review was completed for 71 adolescents and young adults (ages 10-21Ã¢â‚¬â€°years; MÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 14.61, SDÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2.121). Results indicated a 188% increase in ED hospital admissions since the pandemic, with patients presenting with increased rates of comorbid mental health diagnoses (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .009). During COVID-19, the development of temporary outpatient multidisciplinary discharge plans (i.e., ""bridge plans"") were utilized more often due to difficulties accessing the appropriate level of care (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .039). Results suggest a significant increase in youth requiring medical stabilization for EDs since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic (2.9 times more than prepandemic), as well as a need for greater advocacy to increase specialized mental health services along the full continuum of care. This study brings awareness to the significant increase in patients needing medical stabilization secondary to restrictive EDs and increased rates of comorbid mental health diagnoses in this patient population since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients during COVID-19 were less likely to directly transition to treatment likely secondary to the strain COVID-19 placed on mental health systems/treatment centers. Increased advocacy for specialized care for eating disorder patients.","Feldman, King, Vitale, Denhardt, Stroup, Reese, Stromberg","https://doi.org/10.1002/eat.23788","20220730","adolescents; anorexia nervosa; inpatient; mental health crisis; stabilization","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-31","",35399,""

"The Mediating Role of Teacher Identification in the Relationship Between Psychological Distress and Teacher Satisfaction During COVID-19","The current study examines the potential mediating role of professional identification of school teachers in the relationship between psychological distress and teaching satisfaction. Professional identification is the extent to which an individual identifies with a professional group, including the values, beliefs, and commitment the individual has in relation to the professional group. Professional identification has been linked to negative work outcomes, such as job performance and turnover intentions, as well as to adverse mental health outcomes. In the context of education, professional identification is the extent to which teachers identify with the teaching profession. Participants (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°355) were school teachers in South Africa who completed the Center for Epidemiological Depression Scale, the Beck Hopelessness Scale, the Professional Identification Scale, and the Teaching Satisfaction Scale. Structural equation analysis showed that professional identification plays a fully mediational role in the relationship between psychological distress and teaching satisfaction. Interventions that strengthen teachers' identification with the teaching profession should be considered a priority.","Jackson, Noordien, Padmanabhanunni, Pretorius","https://doi.org/10.1177/00469580221110520","20220730","depression; hopelessness; mediation; professional identification; teaching satisfaction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-31","",35402,""
"Relevance of the post-COVID syndrome within rehabilitation (PoCoRe): study protocol of a multi-centre study with different specialisations","In Patients suffering from post-COVID syndrome, in addition to physical limitations, cognitive limitations, fatigue, dyspnea as well as depression and anxiety disorders may also be present. Up to now (as of May 2022), approx. 514 million people worldwide have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, in Germany this affects approx. 25 million. In Germany, 2.5 million people could potentially be affected by post-COVID syndrome. Post-COVID is thus a highly relevant public health issue. So far, there is no specific causal therapy for the post-COVID syndrome, but with multimodal symptom-oriented rehabilitation, the course can be favourably influenced. However, there is no study yet that focuses on patients in different rehabilitation indications and compares the focal symptomatology and coping strategies as well as the patients' benefit per indication. As first objective, pulmonal, cardiac, neurological, cognitive or/and psychological functional impairments in rehabilitation patients after COVID-19 disease will be described. The second objective is the differentiated review of the specific rehabilitation measures, in the short term and in the longer term for the purpose of future prognoses and optimisation of therapeutic interventions. This prospective, non-randomised, controlled longitudinal study, plus multi-group comparisons will take place in seven rehabilitation clinics of different specialisations: cardiological rehab, pneumological rehab, neurological rehab, psychosomatic rehab. Within 12Ã‚Â months, 1000 cases across all participating centres will be included. Somatic and psychological testing will be conducted at three measurement points: Admission (t0), discharge (t1), 6-montas Catamnesis (t2). The patients receive the usual care according to the respective rehabilitation priorities, adapted to the special challenges of post-COVID symptoms. Patients of the post-COVID outpatient clinic without rehabilitation will be used as a control group. This study will precisely assess the extent to which subclinical neurological or/and psychological impairments are present in post-COVID-19 rehabilitation and the results will help, developing, providing and evaluating appropriate treatment concepts. This may also have relevant implications for the improvement of physical ability and quality of life in post-COVID-19 patients and increase the probability of return to work.

"Changes in the clustering of health-related behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic: examining predictors using latent transition analysis","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on daily life, affecting both physical and mental health. Changes arising from the pandemic may longitudinally impact health-related behaviors (HRB). As different HRBs co-occur, in this study, we explore how six HRBs - alcohol (past-week and binge-drinking), tobacco, marijuana, benzodiazepine use, and unhealthy food consumption - were grouped and changed over time during the COVID-19 pandemic. A sample of 1038 university students and staff (18 to 73Ã¢â‚¬â€°years old) of two universities completed an online psychometrically adequate survey regarding their recalled HRB (T0, pre-COVID-19 pandemic) and the impact of COVID-19 on their behaviors during July (T1) and November (T2). Latent Transition Analysis (LTA) was used to identify HRB cluster membership and how clusters changed across T0, T1, and T2. Four clusters emerged, but remained mainly stable over time: 'Lower risk' (65.2-80%), 'Smokers and drinkers' (1.5-0.01%), 'Binge-drinkers and marijuana users' (27.6-13.9%), and 'Smokers and binge-drinkers' (5.6-5.8%). Participants who moved from one cluster to another lowered their HRB across time, migrating from the 'Binge-drinkers and marijuana users' cluster to 'Lower risk'. Participants in this cluster were characterized as less affected economically by the COVID-19 pandemic, with lower reported stress levels, anxiety, depression, and loneliness than the other clusters. Our results provide evidence of how HRBs clustered together and transitioned longitudinally during the COVID-19 pandemic. HRB clustering across time offers a valuable piece of information for the tailoring of interventions to improve HRB.","Salazar-FernÃƒÂ¡ndez, Mawditt, Palet, Haeger, RomÃƒÂ¡n Mella","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-13854-x","20220729","Alcohol; Benzodiazepines; Clustering; Latent transition analysis; Marijuana; Smoking; Unhealthy food","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-31","",35404,""
"Suicidality in clinically stable bipolar disorder and schizophrenia patients during the COVID-19 pandemic","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has a disproportionate impact on vulnerable subpopulations, including those with severe mental illness (SMI). This study examined the one-year prevalence of suicidal ideation (SI), suicide plans (SP), and suicide attempts (SA) in bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SCZ) patients during the pandemic. Prevalence rates were compared between the two disorders and associated factors were examined. A survey was conducted in six tertiary psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric units. People with a diagnosis of BD or SCZ were invited to participate. SI, SP, and SA (suicidality for short) were assessed and associated factors were examined using binary logistical regression. The 1-year prevalence of SI, SP and SA in BD patients were 58.3%, (95% CI: 54.1-62.6%), 38.4% (95% CI: 34.3-42.6%) and 38.6% (95% CI: 34.5-42.8%), respectively, which were higher than the corresponding figures in SCZ patients (SI: 33.2%, 95% CI: 28.6-37.8%; SP: 16.8%, 95% CI: 13.2-20.5%; SA: 19.4%, 95% CI: 15.5-23.3%). Patients with younger age, experience of cyberbullying, a history of SA among family or friends, a higher fatigue and physical pain score, inpatient status, and severe depressive symptoms were more likely to have suicidality. The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with increased risk of suicidality, particularly in BD patients. It is of importance to regularly screen suicidality in BD and SCZ patients during the pandemic even if they are clinically stable.","Li, Bai, Cai, Wu, Zhang, Ding, Yang, Du, Zeng, Lu, Feng, Mi, Zhang, Liu, Balbuena, Cheung, Su, An, Xiang","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-022-02045-2","20220729","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-31","",35405,""
