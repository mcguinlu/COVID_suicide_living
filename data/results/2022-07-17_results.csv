"The global evolution of mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies","The COVID-19 pandemic impacted mental health, but the global evolution of mental health problems during the pandemic is not known. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies to evaluate the global evolution of mental health problems during the pandemic. To conduct this systematic review, we searched for published articles from APA PsycInfo (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), Embase (Ovid), MEDLINE (Ovid), and Web of Science. Longitudinal (at least 2 waves during the COVID-19 pandemic) and peer-reviewed articles on mental health problems conducted as from 2020 and after were included in the current study. Of 394 eligible full texts, 64 articles were included in the analysis. We computed random effects, standardized mean differences, and log odds ratio (LOR) with 95Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% CIs. The meta-analysis protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021273624). Results showed that anxiety (LORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯-0.33; 95Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% CI, -0.54, -0.12) and depression symptoms (LORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯-0.12; 95Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% CI, -0.21, -0.04) decreased from baseline to follow up. However, other mental health problems showed no change. Higher prevalence rates (40.9Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%; 95Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% CI, 16.1Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%-65.8Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%) of psychological distress were found in months after July 2020, respectively, while there were no significant month differences for the prevalence of other mental health problems. Higher means of anxiety (dÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯3.63, 95Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% CI, 1.66, 5.61), depression (dÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯3.93; 95Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% CI, 1.68, 6.17), and loneliness (dÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯5.96; 95Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% CI, 3.22, 8.70) were observed in May 2020. Higher prevalence of anxiety, depression, and PTSD and higher means of anxiety, depression and loneliness were observed in North America. The prevalence of psychological distress and insomnia was higher in Latin America and Europe, respectively. There is a lack of longitudinal studies in some parts of the world, such as Africa, the Caribbean, India, the Middle East, in Latin America, and Asia. Results indicated that anxiety and depression symptoms decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic while other mental health problems showed no statistical change. The findings reveal that mental health problems peaked in April and May 2020. Prevalence of mental health problems remains high during the pandemic and mental health prevention, promotion and intervention programs should be implemented to mitigate the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global population.","CÃƒÂ©nat, Farahi, Dalexis, Darius, Bekarkhanechi, Poisson, Broussard, Ukwu, Auguste, Nguyen, Sehabi, Furyk, Gedeon, Onesis, El Aouame, Khodabocus, Shah, Labelle","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.07.011","20220716","COVID-19 pandemic; Longitudinal studies; Mental health problems; meta-analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-17","",34399,""

"The long-term buffering effect of sense of coherence on psychopathological symptoms during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic: A prospective observational study","The COVID-19 pandemic is a major chronic stressor affecting all societies and almost all individuals. Consequently, research demonstrated a negative impact of COVID-19 on mental health in parts of the general population. However, not all people are affected equally thus making the identification of resilience factors modulating the pandemic's impact on mental health an important research agenda. One of these factors is sense of coherence (SOC), the key component of the salutogenesis framework. The current study aimed at investigating the long-term relationship between SOC and psychopathological symptoms, and the impact of COVID-19-related rumination as its moderator. The prospective observational study assessed psychopathological symptoms and SOC before the COVID-19 outbreak in Germany (February 2020) and at six critical time points during the pandemic in an online panel (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1,479). Bivariate latent change score models and latent growth mixture modeling were used to analyze changes in psychopathological symptoms and SOC along with their interaction and to differentiate trajectories of COVID-19-related rumination. A model allowing for unidirectional coupling from SOC to psychopathological symptoms demonstrated best fit. In the total sample, psychopathological symptoms increased significantly over time. Previous SOC predicted later changes in psychopathological symptoms, whereby a stronger SOC was associated with a decrease in symptoms over time. The same pattern of results was evident in the high-rumination (17.2%) but not in the low-rumination group (82.8%). Our findings demonstrate that SOC is an important predictor and modulator of psychopathological symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in those respondents that ruminate about the pandemic.","SchÃƒÂ¤fer, Sopp, Koch, GÃƒÂ¶ritz, Michael","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2022.07.004","20220716","COVID-19; Mental health; Resilience; Rumination; Sense of coherence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-17","",34401,""

"Addressing the Behavioral Health Needs of Sexual and Gender Minorities During the COVID-19 Pandemic: a Review of the Expanding Role of Digital Health Technologies","To review the role of digital health technologies in behavioral health treatment and promotion for sexual and gender minorities (SGM). Digital technologies have advantages and limitations at multiple levels in addressing SGM's behavioral health needs. For patients, digital technologies improve convenience and may reduce stigma; however, privacy concerns in the home may limit their utilization. Providers also benefit from the convenience of these technologies; however, not all providers are comfortable delivering virtual care to SGM. For society, digital technologies reduce transportation-related costs and increase access to healthcare in an increasingly hostile political climate for SGM; however, these advantages are limited by technological access and anti-SGM policies. Digital technologies can improve the behavioral health of SGM at the patient, provider, and systemic levels. Further efforts are necessary to standardize provider training, improve SUD-specific care delivery, and increase quality and accessibility of these technologies.","Whaibeh, Vogt, Mahmoud","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11920-022-01352-1","20220716","Behavioral health; Digital health; LGBTQ; Mental health; Sexual and gender minorities; Technology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-17","",34403,""
"Effects of COVID-19, Discrimination, and Social Support on Latinx Adult Mental Health","We investigated the role of COVID-19 exposure and discrimination on depressive and posttraumatic stress symptoms among Latinx adults residing in the southeastern United States. Survey data were collected from 264 Latinx adults. Using structural equation modeling (SEM) procedures, we estimated a structural model for hypothesized direct and indirect relationships between the risk factors of COVID-19 exposure and discrimination, social support, and two mental health conditions: depression and posttraumatic stress. COVID-19 exposure and discrimination each had a significant and positive relationship with both depression and posttraumatic stress. Social support was found to have a significant and inverse relationship with depression and posttraumatic stress, as well as to mediate the relationship between discrimination and both mental health symptoms. Implications for service provision and program design are presented. Future studies should examine variation between southeastern states and consider the influence of documentation status among an immigrant-only sample.","Held, First, Huslage","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10903-022-01382-0","20220716","COVID-19; Discrimination; Latinx adult mental health; New destination southeastern states; Social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-17","",34404,""
"Surgical face masks do not impair the decoding of facial expressions of negative affect more severely in older than in younger adults","Surgical face masks reduce the spread of airborne pathogens but also disturb the flow of information between individuals. The risk of getting seriously ill after infection with SARS-COV-2 during the present COVID-19 pandemic amplifies with age, suggesting that face masks should be worn especially during face-to-face contact with and between older people. However, the ability to accurately perceive and understand communication signals decreases with age, and it is currently unknown whether face masks impair facial communication more severely in older people. We compared the impact of surgical face masks on dynamicÃ‚Â facial emotion recognition in younger (18-30Ã‚Â years) and older (65-85Ã‚Â years) adults (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°96) in an online study. Participants watched short video clips of young women who facially expressed anger, fear, contempt or sadness. Faces of half of the women were covered by a digitally added surgical face mask. As expected, emotion recognition accuracy declined with age, and face masks reduced emotion recognition accuracy in both younger and older participants. Unexpectedly, the effect of face masks did not differ between age groups. Further analyses showed that masks also reduced the participants' overall confidence in their emotion judgements, but not their performance awareness (the difference between their confidence ratings for correct and incorrect responses). Again, there were no mask-by-age interactions. Finally, data obtained with a newly developed questionnaire (attitudes towards face masks, atom) suggest that younger and older people do not differ in how much they feel impaired in their understanding of other people's emotions by face masks or how useful they find face masks in confining the COVID-19 pandemic. In sum, these findings do not provide evidence that the impact of face masks on the decoding of facial signals is disproportionally larger in older people.","Henke, Guseva, Wagemans, Pischedda, Haynes, Jahn, Anders","https://doi.org/10.1186/s41235-022-00403-8","20220716","Age; Anger; COVID-19; Contempt; Face mask; Facial emotion recognition; Fear; Online study; Pandemic; Sadness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-17","",34405,""
"Development and Cultural Adaptation of Psychological First Aid for COVID-19 Frontline Workers in American Indian/Alaska Native Communities","The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic is broadly affecting the mental health and well-being of people around the world, and disproportionately affecting some groups with already pre-existing health inequities. Two groups at greater risk of physical and/or mental health detriments from COVID-19 and more profoundly impacted by the pandemic include frontline workers and American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) communities. To provide support and prevent long-term mental health problems, we culturally adapted a psychological first aid guide specifically for COVID-19 frontline workers serving AI/AN communities. We engaged a diverse, collaborative work group to steer the adaptation content and process. We also held two focus group discussions with frontline workers in AI/AN communities to incorporate their perspectives into the adapted guide. Results from the group discussions and the collaborative work group were compiled, analyzed to extract themes and suggestions, and integrated into the adapted content of the guide. Main adaptations included updating language (i.e., to be more culturally appropriate, less prescriptive, and less text heavy), framing the guide from a harm-reduction lens, incorporating cultural activities, values, and teachings common across diverse AI/AN communities (e.g., importance of being a good relative), and validating feelings and experiences of frontline workers. The resulting adapted guide includes four modules and is available as a free online training. Our adaptation process may serve as a guiding framework for future adaptations of similar resources for specific groups. The adapted guide may stand as an enduring resource to support mental well-being, the prevention of mental health problems, and reduction of health inequities during the pandemic and beyond.","Grubin, Maudrie, Neuner, Conrad, Waugh, Barlow, Coser, Hill, Pioche, Haroz, O'Keefe","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10935-022-00695-y","20220716","American Indian/Alaska Native; COVID-19; Cultural adaptation; Indigenous; Mental health; Psychological first aid","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-17","",34406,""
"""We were building the plane as we were flying it, and we somehow made it to the other end"": syringe service program staff experiences and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic","Syringe service programs (SSPs) provide essential harm reduction and prevention services for people who inject drugs in the USA, where SSP coverage is expanding. During the COVID-19 pandemic, US SSPs underwent unprecedented shifts in operational procedures (e.g., closures of physical sites, staff redeployment into pandemic response efforts). Given the critical role of US SSP workers in the pandemic, we sought to explore the occupational experiences and well-being of SSP staff to inform future emergency response efforts. From July-October 2020, we conducted semi-structured interviews with staff members of four SSPs in diverse regions of Massachusetts. Trained interviewers administered qualitative interviews virtually. Interviews were coded in NVivo v12 and thematic analysis identified common occupational experiences and related impacts on staff well-being in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Among 18 participants, 12 (67%) had client-facing roles such as harm reduction specialists and six (33%) worked in program management or leadership. We found that staff were frequently anxious about SARS-CoV-2 transmission, which contributed to staff turnover. SSPs rapidly adapted and expanded their services to meet increasing client needs during the pandemic (e.g., food distribution, COVID-19 testing), leading to staff overexertion. Simultaneously, public health measures such as physical distancing led to staff concerns about reduced social connections with clients and coworkers. Through these challenges, SSPs worked to protect staff well-being by implementing flexible and tangible COVID-19-related policies (e.g., paid sick leave), mental health resources, and frequent communication regarding pandemic-related operational changes. SSPs in the USA adapted to the COVID-19 pandemic out of necessity, resulting in operational changes that threatened staff well-being. Despite the protective factors revealed in some narratives, our findings suggest that during prolonged, complex public health emergencies, SSPs may benefit from enhanced occupational supports to prevent burnout and promote wellness for this essential public health workforce.","Wang, Jawa, Mackin, Whynott, Buchholz, Childs, Bazzi","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12954-022-00661-1","20220715","COVID-19; Harm reduction work; Occupational health; SARS-CoV-2; Syringe service programs; Well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-17","",34407,""
"Expanding access to substance use services and mental health care for people with HIV in Alabama, a technology readiness assessment using a mixed methods approach","Alabama is one of seven priority states for the National Ending the HIV Epidemic Initiative due to a large rural burden of disease. Mental health (MH) and substance use disorders (SUD) represent obstacles to HIV care in rural areas lacking Medicaid expansion and infrastructure. Evidence-informed technologies, such as telehealth, may enhance SUD and MH services but remain understudied in rural regions. We conducted a readiness assessment using a mixed methods approach to explore opportunities for enhanced SUD and MH screening using electronic patient reported outcomes (ePROs) and telehealth at five Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program-funded clinics in AL. Clinic providers and staff from each site (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°16) completed the Organizational Readiness to Implement Change (ORIC) assessment and interviews regarding existing services and readiness to change. People with HIV from each site (PLH, NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°18) completed surveys on the acceptability and accessibility of technology for healthcare. Surveys and interviews revealed that all clinics screen for depression annually by use of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ9). SUD screening is less frequent and unstandardized. Telehealth is available at all sites, with three of the five sites beginning services due to the COVID-19 pandemic; however, telehealth for MH and SUD services is not standardized across sites. Results demonstrate an overall readiness to adopt standardized screenings and expand telehealth services beyond HIV services at clinics. There were several concerns including Wi-Fi access, staff capacity, and patients' technological literacy. A sample of 18 people with HIV (PWH), ages 18 to 65Ã‚Â years, participated in surveys; all demonstrated adequate technology literacy. A majority had accessed telehealth and were not concerned about it being too complicated or limiting communication. There were some concerns around lack of in-person interaction and lack of a physical exam and high-quality care with telehealth. This study of PWH and the clinics that serve them reveals opportunities to expand SUD and MH services in rural regions using technology. Areas for improvement include implementing routine SUD screening, expanding telehealth while maintaining opportunities for in-person interaction, and using standardized ePROs that are completed by patients, in order to minimize stigma and bias.","Eaton, Burgan, McCollum, Levy, Willig, Mugavero, Reddy, Wallace, Creger, Baral, Fogger, Cropsey","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-022-08280-z","20220715","Addiction; Healthcare delivery; Mental health; Telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-17","",34408,""
"""The emotions were like a roller-coaster"": a qualitative analysis of e-diary data on healthcare worker resilience and adaptation during the COVID-19 outbreak in Singapore","Uncertainties related to COVID-19 have strained the mental health of healthcare workers (HCWs) worldwide. Gaining the ability to adapt and thrive under pressure will be key to addressing this. We explore what characterises risk, vulnerability and resilient responses of HCWs during the early stages of the outbreak in Singapore. We undertook qualitative theory-guided thematic analysis of e-diary entries from HCWs who navigated the outbreak from June-August 2020. Data were extracted from a subset of an online survey of nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3616 participants collected across 9 institutions, including restructured hospitals, hospices and affiliated primary care partners. NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°663 or 18% submitted qualitative journal entries included for analyses. All professional cadres, local as well as foreign HCWs participated. Themes are reported according to the Loads-Levers-Lifts model of resilience and highlighted in italics. The model assumes that resilience is a dynamic process. Key factors threatening mental health (loading) risk included a notable rise in anxiety, the effects of being separated from loved ones, and experiencing heightened emotions and emotional overload. Bad situations were made worse, prompting vulnerable outcomes when HCWs experienced stigma in the community and effects of ""public paranoia""; or under conditions where HCWs ended up feeling like a prisoner with little control or choice when either confined to staff accommodation or placed on quarantine/Stay Home Notices. Those with strife in their place of residence also described already difficult situations at work being aggravated by home life. Protection (lifts) came from being able to muster a sense of optimism about the future or feeling grateful for the pace of life slowing down and having the space to reprioritise. In contrast, when risk factors were present, balancing these in the direction of resilient outcomes was achieved by choosing to re-direct stress into positive narratives, drawing on inner agency, uptake of therapeutic activities, social support as well as faith and prayer and drawing comfort from religious community among other factors. The Loads-Levers-Lifts model is used to guide analysis to inform intervention designs. Levers promoting resilience through targeting therapies, workplace policies and awareness campaigns accounting for identified loads are proposed.","Chan, Ting, Chan, Hildon","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12960-022-00756-7","20220715","COVID-19; Healthcare worker mental health; Resilience; Theory-based intervention design","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-17","",34409,""
"Going digital - a commentary on the terminology used at the intersection of physical activity and digital health","In recent years digital technologies have become a major means for providing health-related services and this trend was strongly reinforced by the current Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As it is well-known that regular physical activity has positive effects on individual physical and mental health and thus is an important prerequisite for healthy aging, digital technologies are also increasingly used to promote unstructured and structured forms of physical activity. However, in the course of this development, several terms (e.g., Digital Health, Electronic Health, Mobile Health, Telehealth, Telemedicine, and Telerehabilitation) have been introduced to refer to the application of digital technologies to provide health-related services such as physical interventions. Unfortunately, the above-mentioned terms are often used in several different ways, but also relatively interchangeably. Given that ambiguous terminology is a major source of difficulty in scientific communication which can impede the progress of theoretical and empirical research, this article aims to make the reader aware of the subtle differences between the relevant terms which are applied at the intersection of physical activity and Digital Health and to provide state-of-art definitions for them.","Herold, Theobald, Gronwald, Rapp, MÃƒÂ¼ller","https://doi.org/10.1186/s11556-022-00296-y","20220715","Aging; Digital Health; Electronic Health; Mobile Health; Physical activity; Physical training; Telehealth; Telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-17","",34410,""
"The prevalence of psychological stress in student populations during the COVID-19 epidemic: a systematic review and meta-analysis","Following the COVID-19 outbreak, psychological stress was particularly pronounced in the student population due to prolonged home isolation, online study, closed management, graduation, and employment pressures. The objective of this study is to identify the incidence of psychological stress reactions in student populations following a global outbreak and the associated influencing factors. Four English databases (Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science) and four Chinese biomedical databases (Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, VIP Database for Chinese Technical Periodicals, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang) were searched in this study. We also retrieved other search engines manually. The search period was from the time of database creation to 10 March 2022. This study included cross-sectional studies related to psychological stress reactions in student populations during the COVID-19 epidemic. Three groups of researchers screened the retrieved studies and assessed the quality of the included studies using the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Cross-Sectional Study Quality Assessment Checklist. A random-effects model was used to analyze the prevalence of depression, anxiety, stress, and fear symptoms in the student population during the COVID-19 epidemic. Of the 146,330 records retrieved, we included 104 studies (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2,088,032). The quality of included studies was moderate. The prevalence of depressive symptoms in the student population during the epidemic was 32.0% (95% CI [28.0-37.0%]); anxiety symptoms was 28.0% (95% CI [24.0-32.0%]); stress symptoms was 31.0% (95% CI [23.0-39.0%]); and fear symptoms was 33.0% (95% CI [20.0-49.0%]). The prevalence differed by gender, epidemic stage, region, education stage, student major and assessment tool. The prevalence of psychological stress in the student population during the COVID-19 epidemic may be higher compared to the global prevalence of psychological stress. We need to alleviate psychological stress in the student population in a targeted manner to provide mental health services to safeguard the student population.","Fang, Ji, Liu, Zhang, Liu, Ge, Xie, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-16328-7","20220715","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-17","",34411,""
"Perceived discrimination as a modifier of health, disease, and medicine: empirical data from the COVID-19 pandemic","Increasing reports of long-term symptoms following COVID-19 infection, even among mild cases, necessitate systematic investigation into the prevalence and type of lasting illness. Notably, there is limited data regarding the influence of social determinants of health, like perceived discrimination and economic stress, that may exacerbate COVID-19 health risks. Here, 1,584 recovered COVID-19 patients that experienced mild to severe forms of disease provided detailed medical and psychosocial information. Path analyses examined hypothesized associations between discrimination, illness severity, and lasting symptoms. Secondary analyses evaluated sex differences, timing of infection, and impact of prior mental health problems. Post hoc logistic regressions tested social determinants hypothesized to predict neurological, cognitive, or mood symptoms. 70.6% of patients reported presence of one or more lasting symptom after recovery. 19.4% and 25.1% of patients reported lasting mood or cognitive/memory problems. Perceived discrimination predicted increased illness severity and increased lasting symptom count, even when adjusting for sociodemographic factors and mental/physical health comorbidities. This effect was specific to stress related to discrimination, not to general stress levels. Further, patient perceptions regarding quality of medical care influenced these relationships. Finally, illness early in the pandemic is associated with more severe illness and more frequent lasting complaints. Lasting symptoms after recovery from COVID-19 are highly prevalent and neural systems are significantly impacted. Importantly, psychosocial factors (perceived discrimination and perceived SES) can exacerbate individual health risk.
