"Attitudes, Anxiety, and Behavioral Practices Regarding COVID-19 among University Students in Jordan: A Cross-Sectional Study","The COVID-19 pandemic represents a major public health, economic, political, and scientific concern in most countries around the globe where COVID-19 cases and deaths have been confirmed. This study assessed the attitudes, anxiety, and behavioral practices of university students in Jordan regarding COVID-19 during the early period of the infection (March 19-21, 2020) using a validated, self-administered survey questionnaire. Positive attitudes or low-risk practices were given 1 point, whereas negative attitudes or high-risk practices were scored 0. Percentages of the total score were used for categorizing data into negative attitudes or high-risk practices (&#8804; 60%), moderate attitudes or moderate-risk practices (60.01-80%), and positive attitudes or low-risk practices (> 80%). Generally, the university students displayed positive attitudes and low-risk practices toward preventing COVID-19, with an average score of 81.1% and 84.3%, respectively. Approximately two-thirds (69.1%) of the students showed a positive attitude toward COVID-19 seriousness, concern of contracting the virus, and the appropriate prevention measures, and low-risk practices (67.6%) toward preventing COVID-19 including implementation of social distancing and good hygiene. Female, older, medical, or postgraduate students practiced significantly more (P &#8804; 0.05) appropriate hygiene and social distancing behaviors toward COVID-19 than their counterparts of each group. More than two-thirds (69.2%) of the students were anxious that they might become infected with COVID-19. These results are important for health authorities to develop appropriate educational programs and protective health measures including good respiratory etiquette and handwashing practices, to enhance safer lifestyles and prevent COVID-19 transmission.","Olaimat, Amin N; Aolymat, Iman; Elsahoryi, Nour; Shahbaz, Hafiz M; Holley, Richard A","https://dx.doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.20-0418","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Am J Trop Med Hyg;2020 Jul 08.; Publication details: Am J Trop Med Hyg;2020 Jul 08.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-18","",3195,""

"A Mixed-method Study of Individual, Couple and Parental Functioning During the State-regulated COVID-19 Lockdown in Spain","During the recent COVID-19 outbreak in Spain we explored the individual and relational wellbeing of people confined together with their partners and/or children during the first three weeks of state-regulated lockdown. Adults 18 years or older (N=407) completed an online survey that included demographic, household, and employment information along with standardized measures of psychological distress (State-Trait Anxiety, Beck Depression) and relationship functioning - either the Dyadic Adjustment Scale if there were no children in the household or a Basic Family Relations Evaluation Questionnaire (CERFB) measuring conjugal, parental, and co-parental functions. Qualitative analyses of responses to an open-ended question about perceived changes in couple or family dynamics during lockdown revealed 9 specific themes comprising two overarching categories: relational improvement and deterioration. The overall prevalence of improvement themes (61.7%) exceeded deterioration themes (41.0%), with increased (re)connection and conflict atmosphere cited most often. Quantitative analyses found elevated levels of state anxiety but not trait anxiety or depression during lockdown. Consistent with the qualitative results, couples having no children at home reported high levels of dyadic adjustment, but with children present CERFB parental functioning exceeded conjugal functioning, a pattern sometimes associated with child triangulation into adult conflicts. Although correlates of psychological distress (e.g., unemployment, perceived economic risk) were relatively stable across sub-groups, predictors of relationship functioning varied substantially with household/parental status (e.g., telecommuting and employment facilitated conjugal functioning only for couples with children).","GÃƒÂ¼nther-Bel, Vilaregut, Carratala, Torras-Garat, PÃƒÂ©rez-Testor","https://doi.org/10.1111/famp.12585","20200717","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-18","",3198,""

"Mental health of orthopaedic trauma patients during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic","The outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been associated with reports of increased anxiety, depression and fear among the general population. People with underlying psychiatric disorders are more susceptible to stress than the general population. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of concomitant psychiatric conditions in the orthopaedic trauma population during the COVID-19 pandemic. This retrospective cohort study evaluated orthopaedic trauma patients who received care at our institution between February through April of 2019 and February through April of 2020. Patient sex, age, mechanism of injury, associated injuries, fracture location, tobacco use, employment status, mental health diagnosis and presence of interpersonal violence were documented. Mental health diagnoses were defined based on International Classification of Diseases-10 classification. The study included 553 orthopaedic patients evaluated at our institution during the defined time period. Patients in the 2020 cohort had a higher prevalence of mental health diagnoses (26% vs. 43%, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001) compared with the 2019 group. The odds ratio for mental health disorder in the 2020 patients was 2.21 (95% CI 1.54, 3.18) compared with the 2019 cohort. The 2020 cohort had a higher percentage of patients who reported interpersonal violence (20% vs. 11%, pÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.005). Our study showed a higher prevalence of psychiatric disease among orthopaedic trauma patients during the COVID-19 pandemic when compared with those seen during the same time of the year in 2019. Stress induced by the coronavirus pandemic can place patients with mental illness at a higher risk for perilous behaviours and subsequent fractures.","Ohliger, Umpierrez, Buehler, Ohliger, Magister, Vallier, Hirschfeld","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00264-020-04711-w","20200717","COVID-19; Interpersonal violence; Mental health; Orthopaedic trauma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-18","",3200,""
"Psychosocial and Socio-Economic Crisis in Bangladesh Due to COVID-19 Pandemic: A Perception-Based Assessment","<b>Background:</b> The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, the partial lockdown, the disease intensity, weak governance in the healthcare system, insufficient medical facilities, unawareness, and the sharing of misinformation in the mass media has led to people experiencing fear and anxiety. The present study intended to conduct a perception-based analysis to get an idea of people's psychosocial and socio-economic crisis, and the possible environmental crisis, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. <b>Methods:</b> A perception-based questionnaire was put online for Bangladeshi citizens of 18 years and/or older. The sample size was 1,066 respondents. Datasets were analyzed through a set of statistical techniques including principal component and hierarchical cluster analysis. <b>Results:</b> There was a positive significant association between fear of the COVID-19 outbreak with the struggling healthcare system (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) of the country. Also, there was a negative association between the fragile health system of Bangladesh and the government's ability to deal with the pandemic (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), revealing the poor governance in the healthcare system. A positive association of shutdown and social distancing with the fear of losing one's own or a family members' life, influenced by a lack of healthcare treatment (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), reveals that, due to the decision of shutting down normal activities, people may be experiencing mental and economic stress. However, a positive association of the socio-economic impact of the shutdown with poor people's suffering, the price hike of basic essentials, the hindering of formal education (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), and the possibility of a severe socio-economic and health crisis will be aggravated. Moreover, there is a possibility of a climate change-induced disaster and infectious diseases like dengue during/after the COVID-19 situation, which will create severe food insecurity (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) and a further healthcare crisis. <b>Conclusions:</b> The partial lockdown in Bangladesh due to the COVID-19 pandemic increased community transmission and worsened the healthcare crisis, economic burden, and loss of GDP despite the resuming of industrial operations. In society, it has created psychosocial and socio-economic insecurity among people due to the loss of lives and livelihoods. The government should take proper inclusive steps for risk assessment, communications, and financial stimulus toward the public to alleviate their fear and anxiety, and to take proper action to boost mental health and well-being.","Bodrud-Doza, Shammi, Bahlman, Islam, Rahman","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.00341","20200717","COVID-19; fear; linear regression model; perception-based questionnaire; principal component analysis (PCA); social conflict","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-18","",3201,""

"Exploring the challenges faced by frontline workers in health and social care amid the COVID-19 pandemic: experiences of frontline workers in the English Midlands region, UK","The first cases of Coronavirus (COVID-19) were reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019. Globally millions of people have been diagnosed with the virus whilst thousands have died. As the virus kept spreading health and social care frontline workers (HSCFW) were faced with difficulties when discharging their duties. This paper was set out to explore the challenges faced by different frontline workers in health and social care during the COVID-19 pandemic. The research utilized an explorative qualitative approach. A total of forty (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 40) in-depth one-to-one semi-structured interviews were undertaken with HSCFW who included support workers (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 15), nurses (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 15), and managers (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 10). Health and social care workers were drawn from domiciliary care and care homes (with and without nursing services). All the interviews were done online. The data were thematically analyzed, and the emergent themes were supported by quotes from the interviews held with participants. Following data analysis the research study found that lack of pandemic preparedness, <b>s</b>hortage of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), anxiety and fear amongst professionals, challenges in enforcing social distancing, challenges in fulfilling social shielding responsibility, anxiety and fear amongst residents and service users, delay in testing, evolving PPE guidance and shortage of staff were challenges faced by frontline health and social care workers during COVID-19 pandemic. The results of the current study point to a need for adequate pandemic preparedness within the health and social care sector to protect both frontline workers and the individuals they look after.","Nyashanu, Pfende, Ekpenyong","https://doi.org/10.1080/13561820.2020.1792425","20200717","COVID-19; UK; front-line workers; mental health; pandemic; shortage","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-18","",3203,""
"A Mixed-Methods Pilot Study of Perinatal Risk and Resilience During COVID-19","<b>Introduction/Objectives:</b> National guidelines underscore the need for improvement in the detection and treatment of mood disorders in the perinatal period. Exposure to disasters can amplify perinatal mood disorders and even have intergenerational impacts. The primary aim of this pilot study was to use mixed-methods to better understand the mental health and well-being effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as sources of resilience, among women during the perinatal period. <b>Methods:</b> The study team used a simultaneous exploratory mixed-methods design to investigate the primary objective. Thirty-one pregnant and postpartum women participated in phone interviews and were invited to complete an online survey which included validated mental health and well-being measures. <b>Results:</b> Approximately 12% of the sample reported high depressive symptomatology and 60% reported moderate or severe anxiety. Forty percent of the sample reported being lonely. The primary themes related to stress were uncertainty surrounding perinatal care, exposure risk for both mother and baby, inconsistent messaging from information sources and lack of support networks. Participants identified various sources of resilience, including the use of virtual communication platforms, engaging in self-care behaviors (eg, adequate sleep, physical activity, and healthy eating), partner emotional support, being outdoors, gratitude, and adhering to structures and routines. <b>Conclusions:</b> Since the onset of COVID-19, many pregnant and postpartum women report struggling with stress, depression, and anxiety symptomatology. Findings from this pilot study begin to inform future intervention work to best support this highly vulnerable population.","Farewell, Jewell, Walls, Leiferman","https://doi.org/10.1177/2150132720944074","20200717","disasters; mood disorders; perinatal mental health; postpartum care; prenatal care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-18","",3204,""

We developed strategies to prevent hospital-associated transmission of COVID-19 in obstetric care. Infrastructure, including the fever clinic and wards, were modified. Outpatient volume was controlled and screening processes were strictly performed. Verification of the virus was compulsory for non-surgery and non-emergency patients. Emergency operations were performed in a negative pressure theater with surgeons fully protected. Outcomes were analyzed and the patients' characteristics were evaluated. The effect of intervention on depressed and anxious patients was assessed. Data from the first 2 months of 2019 and 2020 were compared. No in-hospital COVID-19 infections occurred in our unit. During the epidemic, patient volume significantly decreased. While major characteristics of patients were similar, a higher prevalence of gestational hypertension was found in 2020 than in 2019.

"Quality of sleep and health-related quality of life among health care professionals treating patients with coronavirus disease-19","Health care professionals exposed to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are facing high levels of stress. The aim was to evaluate the quality of sleep (QoS) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL), among health care professionals treating patients with COVID-19, as well as quantifying the magnitude of symptoms of depression and levels of anxiety. We included 201 health care professionals in a cross-sectional, web-based study by applying 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) Scale, Zung Self-rating Depression Scale, 36-item Health Survey of the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (SF36), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and additional survey constructed for the purpose of the study. Health care workers who treated COVID-19 patients were more afraid of becoming infected or of transmitting the infection to a family member with a significantly low self-assessment of their mental status. Poor QoS and HRQoL correlated with high health anxiety and severe depressive symptoms and several demographic characteristics. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that higher scores on GAD-7 (betaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.71, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01) and lower scores on mental health (MH) subscale on SF36 questionnaire (betaÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-.69; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01) were independent predictors of the higher PSQI score (adjusted <i>R</i><sup>2</sup>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.61, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01 for overall model).

"Mental Health and Work Attitudes among People Resuming Work during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study in China","The unprecedented outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused an economic downturn and increased the unemployment rate in China. In this context, employees face health and social economic stressors. To assess their mental health (i.e., anxiety, depression, insomnia and somatization) and work attitudes (i.e., work engagement, job satisfaction and turnover intention) as well as the associated factors, we conducted a cross-sectional study among people who resumed work after the Spring Festival holiday during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results show that the prevalence of anxiety, depression, insomnia and somatization among these people was 12.7%, 13.5%, 20.7% and 6.6%, respectively. The major risk factor for mental health was worrying about unemployment, and the main protective factors were psychological strengths (i.e., resilience and optimism). Regarding work attitudes, the percentage of people who felt more satisfied with their job (43.8%) was larger than that of those who felt less satisfied (26.9%), while the percentage of people who thought about quitting their job more frequently (15.7%) was smaller than that of those who considered it less frequently (63.2%). However, work engagement was lower than usual. Similar to the factors associated with mental health, the major risk factor for work attitudes was also worrying about unemployment, and the main protective factors were resilience and optimism. In addition, the nature of the organization, job status, age, position and income changes were also related to these work attitudes. Our findings shed light on the need for organization administrators to be aware of the status of and factors associated with employees' mental health and work attitudes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Policies or interventions could be developed based on our findings.","Song, Wang, Li, Yang, Li","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17145059","20200717","COVID-19; employees; job satisfaction; mental health; resume work; turnover intention; work attitudes; work engagement","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-18","",3207,""

We enrolled medical students studying public health in Beijing and Wuhan to assess their COVID-19 awareness and to evaluate their mental health status/behaviors using a self-administered questionnaire. We used the Patient Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 and Health Questionnaire-9 to measure anxiety disorders and depression. We used multivariable logistic regression and path analysis to assess the associations between covariates and anxiety disorder/depression. Of 933 students, 898 (96.2%) reported wearing masks frequently when going out, 723 (77.5%) reported daily handwashing with soap, 676 (72.5%) washed hands immediately after arriving home, and 914 (98.0%) reported staying home as much as possible. Prevalence of anxiety disorder was 17.1% and depression was 25.3%. Multivariable logistic regression showed anxiety to be associated with graduate student status (odds ratio (aOR) = 2.0; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.2-3.5), negative thoughts or actions (aOR = 1.6; 95% CI: 1.4-1.7), and feeling depressed (aOR = 6.8; 95% CI: 4.0-11.7). Beijing students were significantly less likely to have anxiety than those in the Wuhan epicenter (aOR = 0.9; 95% CI: 0.8-1.0), but depression did not differ. Depression was associated with female students (aOR = 2.0; 95% CI: 1.2-3.3), negative thoughts or actions (aOR = 1.7; 95% CI: 1.5-1.9), and anxiety disorder (aOR = 5.8; 95% CI: 3.4-9.9). Path analysis validated these same predictors. Despite medical students' knowledge of disease control and prevention, their lives were greatly affected by social distancing, especially in the Wuhan epicenter. Even well-informed students needed psychological support during these extraordinarily stressful times.","Xiao, Shu, Li, Li, Tao, Wu, Yu, Meng, Vermund, Hu","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17145047","20200717","COVID-19; China; anxiety disorder; depression; knowledge; medical students; personal protective measures; social distancing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-18","",3208,""

"High Work-related Stress and Anxiety Response to COVID-19 among Healthcare Workers in South Korea: SAVE study","Background: We investigated the risk factors associated with the psychological impact of each healthcare worker group, to help optimize psychological interventions for healthcare workers in countries affected by COVID-19. Methods: Participants for this study comprised 1,783 healthcare workers drawn from two hospitals inKorea. We adopted a cross-sectional online survey design and used an anonymous questionnaire from 20-30 April 2020, with information on demographics, psychiatric history, Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics - 9 (SAVE-9), Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 (PHQ-9), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) scale. Results: Among the 1,783 healthcare workers, compared to other healthcare workers, nursing professionals had significantly higher levels of depression, general anxiety, and virus-related anxiety symptoms (p < 0.01). In the nursing professionals group, single workers reported more severe depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 = 10) than married workers (20.3% vs 14.1%; p < 0.01), and junior (< 40 years old) workers reported more anxiety about the viral epidemic (p < 0.01). Logistic regression analysis adjusted with age, sex, and work duration identified three factors as significantly associated with healthcare worker's depression (PHQ-9 = 10): being a nursing professional (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05 â€“ 1.98), single (adjusted OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.01 â€“ 1.83), and higher stress and anxiety to the viral infection (high SAVE-9 score, adjusted OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.15 â€“ 1.22). Conclusions: Psychological support and interventions for healthcare workers, especially nursing professionals, single, and high SAVE-9 level should be considered.","Myung Hee Ahn et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46235-117-0B7","20200718","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-18","",3211,""
