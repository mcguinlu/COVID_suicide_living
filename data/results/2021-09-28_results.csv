"Social and psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with Parkinson's disease: a scoping review","The COVID-19 pandemic caused countries across the globe to impose restrictions to slow the spread of the virus, with people instructed to stay at home and reduce contact with others. This reduction in social contact has the potential to negatively impact mental health and well-being. The restrictions are particularly concerning for people with existing chronic illnesses such as Parkinson's disease, who may be especially affected by concerns about the pandemic and associated reduction of social contact. The aim of this review was to synthesise published literature on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the social and psychological well-being of people with Parkinson's disease. The design of this study is a scoping review. We searched five electronic databases for English language articles containing primary data on this topic. Thirty-one relevant studies were found and included in the review. Six main themes were identified: impact of the pandemic on physical and mental health; COVID-19 concerns; access to health care; impact on daily and social activities; impact on physical activity and impact on caregivers. Levels of perceived risk of COVID-19 differed across studies, but most participants had adopted preventive measures such as staying at home and reducing social contacts. Participants in many studies reported a discontinuation of regular healthcare appointments and physiotherapy, as well as concerns about being able to obtain medication. Loss of daily activities and social support was noted by many participants. There was mixed evidence on the impact of the pandemic on physical exercise, with some studies finding no change in physical activity and others reporting a reduction; generally, participants with reduced physical activity had poorer mental health and greater worsening of symptoms. Caregivers of people with Parkinson's disease were more likely to be negatively affected by the pandemic if they cared for people with complex needs such as additional mental health problems. The COVID-19 pandemic has had negative effects on the physical and mental health of people with Parkinson's disease, perhaps due to disruption of healthcare services, loss of usual activities and supports and reduction in physical activity. We make recommendations for policy, practice and future research.","Brooks, Weston, Greenberg","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2021.08.014","20210927","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Mental health; Pandemic; Parkinson disease; Psychological impact; Scoping review; Well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-28","",18298,""
"Sleep disturbance predicts suicidal ideation during COVID-19 pandemic: A two-wave longitudinal survey","This study aimed to examine the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between sleep disturbance and suicidal ideation (SI) in a large cohort of adolescents experiencing the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis in China. One two-wave longitudinal web-based survey of sleep, SI, and depression was conducted among 67,905 college students (mean ageÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 20.23 years, SDÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.63 years; 31.3% male) during the COVID-19 outbreak (Time1, T1: Feb 3rd to 10th, 2020) and initial remission period (Time2, T2: March 24th to April 3rd, 2020). At T1 and T2, 8.5% and 9.7% of students reported sleep disturbance, 7.6% and 10.0% reported SI, respectively. The prevalence rates of SI at T1 and T2 increased significantly with sleep disturbance and short sleep duration. After adjusting for demographics, pandemic related factors, and depression at T1, sleep disturbance and short sleep duration at T1 were significantly associated with increased risk for SI at T2. Furthermore, sleep disturbance and short sleep duration predicted the new onset and persistence of SI. These findings suggested that sleep disturbance predicts the development and persistence of SI. Early assessment and treatment of sleep disturbance may be an important strategy for prevention and intervention of SI in individuals after exposure to the special public health emergency of COVID-19.","Wang, Ross, Zhou, Meng, Zhu, Zhao, Fan, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.09.038","20210927","COVID-19; College students; Longitudinal survey; Sleep disturbance; Suicidal ideation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-28","",18299,""
"Social and environmental effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on children","This study aimed to review the literature, summarizing the existing evidence on the effects of the pandemic on children, adolescents and parents, with an emphasis on the psychological, emotional, and sleep quality consequences. Empirical studies identified in the following databases: MEDLINE, ISI Web of Knowledge/Web of Science, and preprint servers. The findings point to a wide range of consequences for children and adolescents resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, which mainly includes an increase in depressive mood symptoms. There is also an increase in anxiety symptoms, suicidal ideation, as well as potential delays in language and motor development resulting from deprivation of social interaction and the closing of schools. These effects are more severe due to previous neuropsychiatric conditions. For parents, there is an increase in anxiety, depressive and post-traumatic symptoms, which are more accentuated in those who suffered socioeconomic damage due to the pandemic. There was an important increase in situations of violence towards children by parents and caregivers during the pandemic. Also, changes in routine and fear of the pandemic have negatively impacted sleep quality, globally. It is noteworthy that most studies published to date used a cross-sectional design and applied online screening questionnaires. The few studies with a longitudinal design suggest that these changes may have been transitory and more prevalent at the beginning of the pandemic.","Viola, Nunes","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jped.2021.08.003","20210927","Adolescence; COVID-19; Childhood; Mental health; Sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-28","",18300,""
"Impact of the coronavirus pandemic on anorexia nervosa and atypical anorexia nervosa presentations to an Australian tertiary paediatric hospital","The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has led to increased concerns about adolescent mental health. This study aimed to determine the effect of the pandemic on adolescent eating disorders (EDs) by measuring changes in the number and severity of presentations to an Australian paediatric ED service that utilises a standardised approach to triage and assessment. A 4-year retrospective chart review (2017-2020) of all patients (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 457) presenting to the Royal Children's Hospital Eating Disorder Service, Melbourne, was undertaken. The incidence of each diagnosis and measures of condition severity were extracted from the database and patient medical records. Clinical comments relating to the impact of COVID-19, on both ED behaviours and treatment, were also noted. Annual presentations increased from a mean of 98.7 per annum from 2017 to 2019 to 161 in 2020 (63% increase). COVID-19 restrictions were reported to be a trigger for ED behaviours in 40.4% of adolescents diagnosed with anorexia nervosa in 2020. There was no significant difference in severity across years despite increased cases. The dramatic increase in presentations has implications for primary health and paediatric care as well as specialist ED services. Increased support is needed for EDs during this time.","Springall, Cheung, Sawyer, Yeo","https://doi.org/10.1111/jpc.15755","20210927","Australia; adolescent health; anorexia nervosa; coronavirus; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-28","",18301,""
"Experiences of intensive care unit nurses with COVID-19 patients","To understand the experiences of intensive care unit nurses who provide care to patients with COVID-19. Qualitative study grounded in Alfred SchÃƒÂ¼tz's social phenomenology in which 20 nurses who work in intensive care units at public and private hospitals were interviewed between July and September 2020. Data were analyzed according to the adopted theoretical-methodological framework and the literature related to the subject. The interviewed nurses mentioned demands about working conditions, professional recognition and training, and support to physical and mental health, which proved necessary considering the care intensity experienced by these professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Learning the nurses' experiences evidenced the need to adjust to a new way of providing care that included the physical space, new institutional protocols, continuous use of protective equipment, and patients' demand for special care. This originated the necessity to be around situations that interfered with their health and motivated them to carry out professional projects after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Conz, Braga, Vasconcelos, Machado, de Jesus, Merighi","https://doi.org/10.1590/1980-220X-REEUSP-2021-0194","20210927","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-28","",18302,""
"What Articles On Measles Europeans Share On Social Media: Text Analysis Study","Despite the existence of an effective vaccine, measles is still threatening the health and lives of many Europeans. Notably, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the uptake of measles vaccines declined; as a result, after the pandemic, European societies will have to increase and restore the extent of vaccination coverage. As social media are one of the main causes of vaccine hesitancy, knowledge of the nature of information pertaining to measles that is shared on social media can probably help create educational campaigns. We aimed to define the characteristics of European measles news shared on social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest) during 2017-2019. We downloaded and translated into English 10,305 articles on measles published in the member countries of the European Union. Using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation method, we found the main topics of those articles and estimated the sentiments expressed in them. Finally, we used linear regression to determine the factors informing the number of shares for an article on social media. We found that European media mostly discuss measles only in the context of local European events. Articles containing educational information and describing world outbreaks appear less frequently. The most common emotions in the study's news dataset are fear and trust. Yet, it was found that readers are more likely to share information on educational topics and the situation in Germany, Ukraine, Italy, and Samoa. A high amount of anger, joy, and sadness in the text was also associated with a higher number of shares. We identified the features of articles that trigger an increased number of shares on social media. Social media users prefer to share educational news over informational ones. The right emotional content in the article can also increase the willingness of social media users to share it. Effective media content promoting measles vaccination should contain educational or scientific information, as well as specific emotions (anger, joy, or sadness). Articles created following these conditions offer the best chance of reaching thousands of readers on social media and disseminating a vital message to a wider audience.","Wawrzuta, Jaworski, Gotlib, Panczyk","https://doi.org/10.2196/30150","20210927","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-28","",18303,""
"Remote mental health clients prefer face-to-face consultations to telehealth during and after the COVID-19 pandemic","To guide the efficient and effective provision of mental health services to clients in Central West and Far North Queensland, we surveyed preferences for face-to-face or in-person contact. A clinician-designed survey of contact preferences was offered to 248 clients of mental health services in Far North and Central West Queensland in mid-2020. With the onset of COVID-19, the survey was modified to measure the impact of the pandemic. Just over half of the services' clients participated in the survey (50.4%), of whom more were female (63.2%). Of the participants, 46.3% in Far North and 8.6% in Central West Queensland identified as Indigenous. Strong resistance to telehealth before the pandemic across groups (76%) was moderated during COVID-19 (42.4%), an effect that appeared likely to continue past the pandemic for Central West clients (34.5%). Far North clients indicated their telehealth reluctance would return after the pandemic (77.6%). Our results suggest that remote Australians strongly prefer in-person mental health care to telehealth. Although the COVID-19 pandemic increased acceptance of telehealth across regions while social distancing continued, there was evidence that Indigenous Australians were more likely to prefer in-person contact after the pandemic.","Amos, Middleton, Gardiner","https://doi.org/10.1177/10398562211043509","20210927","Indigenous psychiatry; administrative mental health; rural mental health; telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-28","",18304,""
"Potential benefits of using hydrogen sulfide, vitamin E and necrostatin-1 to counteract acetaminophenÃ¢â‚¬â€˜induced hepatotoxicity in rats","The use of acetaminophen (APAP) is increasing recently, especially with COVID-19 outbreaks. APAP is safe at therapeutic levels, however, an overdose can cause severe liver injury. This study aims to explore possible mechanisms involved in APAPÃ¢â‚¬â€˜induced hepatotoxicity and compare different hepatoprotective agents, namely vitamin E, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and necrostatin-1 (NEC-1). Adult male albino rats were divided into groups: Control group, APAPÃ¢â‚¬â€˜induced hepatotoxicity group, Vitamin EÃ¢â‚¬â€˜treated group, H2SÃ¢â‚¬â€˜treated group and NEC-1Ã¢â‚¬â€˜treated group. Serum levels for aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), interleukin-33 (IL-33), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-ÃŽÂ±), reduced glutathione (GSH) and lipid profile were measured. Histopathological examinations of liver tissue with H(et)E stain and immunohistochemistry for activated caspase-3 were also done. APAPÃ¢â‚¬â€˜treated group showed elevated liver transaminases, hyperlipidemia, and deficient liver anti-oxidative response together with disturbed hepatic architecture and increased immune-expression of activated caspase-3 in hepatic tissue. Pretreatment with vitamin E, H2S or NEC-1 reversed the affected parameters. Vitamin E and H2S showed greater improvement when compared to NEC-1. Vitamin E, H2S and NEC-1 showed protective effects against APAP-induced hepatotoxicity, thus they may be used as an adjuvant therapy when APAP is indicated for long periods as is the case in COVID-19 patients (Tab. 2, Fig. 2, Ref. 45).

"Increased Depression during COVID-19 Lockdown Associated with Food Insecurity and Antiretroviral Non-Adherence among People Living with HIV in Uganda","The health and economic threats posed by the COVID-19 pandemic can be sources of great distress among people living with HIV, which in turn can impact the management of their HIV disease. We examined change in depression from pre- to post-lockdown restrictions and correlates of elevated depressive symptoms, including antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence. Participants enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of an ART adherence intervention in Uganda. The month-12 follow-up assessment was fully administered just prior to the start of the pandemic-related lockdown in March 2020; at the conclusion of the lockdown three months later, we administered a mixed-methods phone-based assessment. ART adherence was electronically monitored throughout the study period, including during and after the lockdown. Depression was assessed with the 8-item Patient health questionnaire (PHQ-8), on which scoresÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°9 signify a positive screen for elevated depressive symptoms. A sample of 280 participants completed both the month-12 and post-lockdown assessments. Rates of elevated depressive symptoms nearly tripled from month 12 (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°17, 6.1%) to the post-lockdown assessment (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°50, 17.9%; McNemar testÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). Elevated depressive symptoms at post-lockdown were associated with being female, indicators of economic struggles at month 12 (unemployment, low income, high food insecurity), and lower ART adherence during the 3-month lockdown period [mean of 71.9% (SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°27.9) vs. 80.8% (SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°24.1) among those not depressed; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.041] in bivariate analysis. In multiple regression analysis, higher food insecurity [adj. OR (95% CI)Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.64 (2.16-9.96)] and perception that the pandemic negatively impacted ART adherence [adj. OR (95% CI)Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.96 (1.22-3.16)] remained associated with a greater likelihood of elevated depressive symptoms, when other correlates were controlled for. Qualitative data suggested that economic stressors (lack of food, work, and money) were key contributors to elevated depressive symptoms, and these stressors led to missed ART doses because of lack of food and stress induced forgetfulness. Elevated depressive symptoms significantly increased during the COVID-19 lockdown and was associated with food insecurity and reduced ART adherence. Mechanisms for identifying and treating depression and food insecurity are needed to help PLHIV cope with and mitigate the harmful effects of unexpected crises that may impede disease management and access to food.","Wagner, Wagner, Gizaw, Saya, MacCarthy, Mukasa, Wabukala, Linnemayr","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10461-021-03371-0","20210927","Adherence; COVID-19; Depression; Economic; Food insecurity; HIV; Uganda","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-28","",18306,""

SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing and a cross-sectional survey on COVID-19's socio-behavioral impacts were conducted among a large PLHIV cohort in Hanoi, Vietnam. We examined anonymous antibody test results for 1243 PLHIV (99.8%) from whom plasma was obtained and completed surveys were collected in June/July 2020, just after the end of the first COVID-19 outbreak and nationwide lockdown. Three participants (0.2%) tested positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. HIV treatment was generally maintained without antiretroviral therapy interruption, but COVID-19 had substantial impacts on economic security and risky health behaviors among PLHIV, which may have amplified psychological stress. These findings highlight the need for continuous monitoring of COVID-19's impacts on PLHIV and for efforts to mitigate these impacts.","Matsumoto, Nagai, Luong, Nguyen, Nguyen, Van Dinh, Van Tran, Tanuma, Pham, Oka","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10461-021-03464-w","20210927","Antibody; COVID-19; HIV; Mental health; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-28","",18307,""
"Completing the picture: a proposed framework for child maltreatment surveillance and research in Canada","The COVID-19 pandemic has increased risk factors associated with family violence. In Canada, we do not know whether the pandemic has exacerbated risk of child maltreatment. Recommendations to strengthen our surveillance and research framework for child maltreatment include the addition of questions about maltreatment to national surveys on health and victimization, for example, in the upcoming Canadian Health Survey on Children and Youth. Robust surveillance and research on child maltreatment provide crucial information on trends over time among subgroups, generate hypotheses to be tested and interventions to be evaluated and implemented.

"Suicide ideation in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic","Many Canadians report decreased mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, and concerns have been raised about possible increases in suicide. This study investigates the pandemic's potential impact on adults' suicide ideation. We compared self-reported suicide ideation in 2020 versus 2019 by analyzing data from the Survey on COVID-19 and Mental Health (11 September to 4 December 2020) and the 2019 Canadian Community Health Survey. Logistic regression was conducted to determine which populations were at higher risk of suicide ideation during the pandemic. The percentage of adults reporting suicide ideation since the pandemic began (2.44%) was not significantly different from the percentage reporting suicide ideation in the past 12 months in 2019 (2.73%). Significant differences in the prevalence of recent suicide ideation in 2020 versus 2019 also tended to be absent in the numerous sociodemographic groups we examined. Risk factors of reporting suicide ideation during the pandemic included being under 65 years, Canadian-born or a frontline worker; reporting pandemic-related income/job loss or loneliness/isolation; experiencing a lifetime highly stressful/traumatic event; and having lower household income and educational attainment. Evidence of changes in suicide ideation due to the pandemic were generally not observed in this research. Continued surveillance of suicide and risk/protective factors is needed to inform suicide prevention efforts.

"Positive mental health and perceived change in mental health among adults in Canada during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic","Canadian surveys from spring/summer 2020 suggest the prevalence of some positive mental health (PMH) outcomes have declined compared to pre-pandemic levels. However, less is known about the state of PMH during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. We compared adults' self-rated mental health (SRMH), community belonging and life satisfaction in Fall 2020 versus 2019 in the overall population and across sociodemographic characteristics using cross-sectional data from the Survey on COVID-19 and Mental Health (September-December, 2020) and the 2019 Canadian Community Health Survey. We also conducted regression analyses to examine which sociodemographic factors were associated with reporting in Fall 2020 that one's mental health was about the same or better compared to before the pandemic. Fewer adults reported high SRMH in Fall 2020 (59.95%) than in 2019 (66.71%) and fewer reported high community belonging in Fall 2020 (63.64%) than in 2019 (68.42%). Rated from 0 (very dissatisfied) to 10 (very satisfied), average life satisfaction was lower in Fall 2020 (7.19) than in 2019 (8.08). Females, those aged under 65 years, those living in a population centre, and those absent from work due to COVID-19 had lower odds of reporting that their mental health was about the same or better in Fall 2020. The PMH of adults was lower during the pandemic's second wave. However, the majority of individuals still reported high SRMH and community belonging. The findings identify certain sociodemographic groups whose mental health appears to have been more negatively impacted by the pandemic. Continued surveillance is important in ensuring mental health builds back better and stronger in Canada after the pandemic. Des enquÃƒÂªtes canadiennes du printemps et de lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© 2020 ont fait ÃƒÂ©tat dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢une diminution de la prÃƒÂ©valence de certains rÃƒÂ©sultats en matiÃƒÂ¨re de santÃƒÂ© mentale positive par rapport aux niveaux dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢avant la pandÃƒÂ©mie.

"Symptoms of major depressive disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic: results from a representative sample of the Canadian population","Since the outbreak of COVID-19, numerous studies from around the world have reported declines in mental health. However, most of these studies were of low-to-moderate quality and many were based on convenience samples or used mental health measures with low validity, or both. Consequently, it has been difficult to draw conclusions. Both the 2020 Survey on COVID-19 and Mental Health (SCMH) and the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) (2015-2019) used the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 to screen for major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults aged 18 or older. The prevalence of MDD was compared between the SCMH and the CCHS. Risk and protective factors for MDD in the SCMH were examined using bivariate and logistic regression analyses. Based on SCMH data, 15.2% (95% CI: 14.2-16.2) of Canadians screened positive for MDD. The prevalence of MDD was more than two times higher in the SCMH (during COVID-19) than in the CCHS (predating COVID-19). In bivariate analysis, Canadians reporting five or more COVID-19-related risk factors were close to 30 times more likely to have MDD than those reporting no risk factors. Mastery and a sense of community belonging were protective factors for MDD. After remaining stable for two decades, the prevalence of depression among Canadians increased substantially with the onset of COVID-19. Ongoing monitoring of this common condition associated with major morbidity is vital to determine if elevated levels of MDD persist as we progress through and beyond future waves of COVID-19. Depuis le dÃƒÂ©but de la pandÃƒÂ©mie de COVID 19, de nombreuses ÃƒÂ©tudes Ãƒ lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÂ©chelle mondiale ont fait ÃƒÂ©tat dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢une dÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ©rioration de la santÃƒÂ© mentale. Toutefois, la plupart de ces ÃƒÂ©tudes sont de qualitÃƒÂ© faible ou moyenne, et bon nombre dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢entre elles sÃ¢â‚¬â„¢appuient sur des ÃƒÂ©chantillons de commoditÃƒÂ© ou utilisent des mesures de la santÃƒÂ© mentale Ãƒ faible validitÃƒÂ©, voire les deux. Par consÃƒÂ©quent, il est difficile dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢en tirer des conclusions. LÃ¢â‚¬â„¢EnquÃƒÂªte sur la COVID 19 et la santÃƒÂ© mentale (ECSM) de 2020 et lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢EnquÃƒÂªte sur la santÃƒÂ© dans les collectivitÃƒÂ©s canadiennes (ESCC) (2015-2019) ont toutes les deux utilisÃƒÂ© le Questionnaire en 9 points sur la santÃƒÂ© du patient pour dÃƒÂ©pister le trouble dÃƒÂ©pressif majeur (TDM) chez les adultes de 18 ans et plus. On a comparÃƒÂ© la prÃƒÂ©valence du TDM dans lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ECSM et dans lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ESCC. Dans lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ECSM, on a ÃƒÂ©tudiÃƒÂ© les facteurs de risque de TDM et les facteurs de protection par analyses bivariÃƒÂ©es Ãƒ lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢aide de rÃƒÂ©gressions logistiques. Selon les donnÃƒÂ©es de lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ECSM, 15,2 % (IC Ãƒ 95 % : 14,2 Ãƒ 16,2 %) des Canadiens ont obtenu un rÃƒÂ©sultat positif au dÃƒÂ©pistage du TDM. La prÃƒÂ©valence du TDM ÃƒÂ©tait plus de deux fois plus ÃƒÂ©levÃƒÂ©e dans lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ECSM (durant la COVID 19) que dans lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ESCC (avant la COVID 19). Dans lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢analyse bivariÃƒÂ©e, les Canadiens ayant dÃƒÂ©clarÃƒÂ© avoir au moins cinq facteurs de risque liÃƒÂ©s Ãƒ la COVID 19 ÃƒÂ©taient environ 30 fois plus susceptibles dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢avoir un TDM que ceux ayant dÃƒÂ©clarÃƒÂ© nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢avoir aucun facteur de risque. Le sentiment de maÃƒÂ®trise et le sentiment dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢appartenance Ãƒ la communautÃƒÂ© se sont rÃƒÂ©vÃƒÂ©lÃƒÂ©s des facteurs de protection contre le TDM. AprÃƒÂ¨s ÃƒÂªtre demeurÃƒÂ©e stable pendant 20 ans, la prÃƒÂ©valence de la dÃƒÂ©pression chez les Canadiens a considÃƒÂ©rablement augmentÃƒÂ© depuis le dÃƒÂ©but de la pandÃƒÂ©mie de COVID 19. Il est essentiel de surveiller de faÃƒÂ§on continue ce trouble courant qui est associÃƒÂ© Ãƒ une morbiditÃƒÂ© importante, afin de dÃƒÂ©terminer si les taux ÃƒÂ©levÃƒÂ©s de TDM vont persister pendant et aprÃƒÂ¨s les diffÃƒÂ©rentes vagues de COVID 19. During the second wave of COVID-19 in the fall of 2020, the prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) among Canadians aged 18 or older (defined as the proportion screening positive for MDD using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9) was 15% (13% for males and 18% for females). Based on data from eight Canadian provinces, the prevalence of MDD during the fall of 2020 was more than double what it had been in pre-COVID times (16% vs. 7%). A dose-response relationship was observed between MDD and COVID-19-related risk factors for poor mental health. Each increase in the number of COVID-19-related risk factors was associated with an increase the prevalence of MDD, ranging from 2% among those reporting no risk factors to 62% among those reporting five or more risk factors. Mastery, the extent to which individuals perceive they have control over their life circumstances, was strongly associated with MDD. Those with low levels of mastery were 17 times more likely to screen positive for MDD than those with high mastery. Individuals reporting a very weak sense of community belonging were 10 times more likely to screen positive for MDD than those with a very strong sense of belonging. Au cours de la deuxiÃƒÂ¨me vague de COVID 19 Ãƒ lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢automne 2020, la prÃƒÂ©valence du trouble dÃƒÂ©pressif majeur (TDM), dÃƒÂ©fini comme la proportion des rÃƒÂ©pondants ayant un rÃƒÂ©sultat positif au dÃƒÂ©pistage du TDM Ãƒ lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢aide du questionnaire sur la santÃƒÂ© du patient (PHQ-9) chez les Canadiens de 18 ans et plus, ÃƒÂ©tait de 15 % (13 % chez les hommes et 18 % chez les femmes). DÃ¢â‚¬â„¢aprÃƒÂ¨s les donnÃƒÂ©es de huit provinces canadiennes, la prÃƒÂ©valence du TDM Ãƒ lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢automne 2020 avait plus que doublÃƒÂ© par rapport Ãƒ la prÃƒÂ©valence observÃƒÂ©e avant la pandÃƒÂ©mie de COVID (16 % contre 7 %). Une relation dose rÃƒÂ©ponse a ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© observÃƒÂ©e entre le TDM et les facteurs de risque liÃƒÂ©s Ãƒ la COVID 19 susceptibles dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢entraÃƒÂ®ner une mauvaise santÃƒÂ© mentale. Il est Ãƒ noter que plus le nombre de facteurs de risque liÃƒÂ©s Ãƒ la COVID 19 augmente, plus la prÃƒÂ©valence du TDM augmente : ainsi, la prÃƒÂ©valence du TDM passe de 2 % chez les personnes ne dÃƒÂ©clarant aucun facteur de risque liÃƒÂ© Ãƒ la COVID 19 Ãƒ 62 % chez les personnes dÃƒÂ©clarant avoir cinq facteurs de risque ou plus. Le sentiment de maÃƒÂ®trise, cÃ¢â‚¬â„¢est Ãƒ dire la mesure dans laquelle une personne a lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢impression dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢exercer un contrÃƒÂ´le sur ses conditions de vie, est fortement associÃƒÂ© au TDM. Les personnes ayant lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢impression dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢avoir peu de maÃƒÂ®trise sur leur vie ÃƒÂ©taient 17 fois plus susceptibles dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢obtenir un rÃƒÂ©sultat positif au dÃƒÂ©pistage du TDM que celles ayant un fort sentiment de maÃƒÂ®trise de leur vie. Par ailleurs, les personnes dÃƒÂ©clarant avoir un trÃƒÂ¨s faible sentiment dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢appartenance Ãƒ la communautÃƒÂ© ÃƒÂ©taient 10 fois plus susceptibles dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢obtenir un rÃƒÂ©sultat positif au dÃƒÂ©pistage du TDM que celles ayant un trÃƒÂ¨s fort sentiment dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢appartenance.","Shields, Tonmyr, Gonzalez, Weeks, Park, Robert, Blair, MacMillan","https://doi.org/10.24095/hpcdp.41.11.04","20210927","COVID-19; coping; coronavirus; depression; family violence; mastery; mental health; sense of community belonging","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-28","",18311,""
"Applying a gendered lens to understanding self-reported changes in alcohol and cannabis consumption during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, September to December 2020","Increased alcohol and cannabis consumption and related harms have been reported since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Existing evidence shows that substance use and related harms differ by gender. Yet, no Canadian study has applied a gendered lens to alcohol and cannabis consumption use during this time. Our objectives were to (1) provide gender-specific prevalence estimates of self-reported increased alcohol and cannabis use; and (2) examine gender-specific associations between sociodemographic and mental health variables and alcohol and cannabis use. Using data from the Survey on COVID-19 and Mental Health, we calculated nationally representative, gender-specific prevalence estimates and disaggregated them by sociodemographic and mental health variables. Four logistic regression models were used to assess the likelihood of self-reported increased alcohol and cannabis use. The prevalence of self-reported increase in alcohol use (16.2% women; 15.2% men) and cannabis use (4.9% women; 5.8% men) did not differ by gender. For both genders, income, racialized group membership, working in the past week, being a parent/legal guardian of a child aged under 18 and screening positive for depression and anxiety were associated with increased alcohol use. Men and women who were between the ages of 18 to 44, screened positive for depression, or both, were more likely to report increased cannabis use. For women, education was significantly associated with increased alcohol use. For men, being a parent/legal guardian was significantly associated with lower odds of increased cannabis use. Sociodemographic factors, as well as depression and anxiety, were similarly associated with increased alcohol and cannabis use for both men and women in the second wave of the pandemic. On a fait ÃƒÂ©tat dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢une augmentation de la consommation dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢alcool et de cannabis, ainsi que les mÃƒÂ©faits qui en dÃƒÂ©coulent depuis le dÃƒÂ©but la pandÃƒÂ©mie de COVID 19. Les donnÃƒÂ©es disponibles montrent que la consommation de substances psychoactives et les dommages qui y sont associÃƒÂ©s diffÃƒÂ¨rent selon le genre. Pourtant, aucune ÃƒÂ©tude canadienne nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢a adoptÃƒÂ© de perspective axÃƒÂ©e sur le genre relativement Ãƒ la consommation dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢alcool et de cannabis pendant cette pÃƒÂ©riode. Nos objectifs ÃƒÂ©taient 1) de fournir des estimations de la prÃƒÂ©valence selon le genre dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢une consommation autodÃƒÂ©clarÃƒÂ©e accrue dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢alcool et de cannabis et 2) dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢analyser les associations stratifiÃƒÂ©es selon le genre entre les variables sociodÃƒÂ©mographiques et de santÃƒÂ© mentale et la consommation dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢alcool et de cannabis. Ãƒâ‚¬ lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢aide des donnÃƒÂ©es de lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢enquÃƒÂªte sur la COVID 19 et la santÃƒÂ© mentale, nous avons calculÃƒÂ© des estimations de prÃƒÂ©valence reprÃƒÂ©sentatives Ãƒ lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÂ©chelle nationale, spÃƒÂ©cifique Ãƒ chaque genre, et les avons ventilÃƒÂ©es par variables sociodÃƒÂ©mographiques et de santÃƒÂ© mentale. Quatre modÃƒÂ¨les de rÃƒÂ©gression logistique ont ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© utilisÃƒÂ©s pour ÃƒÂ©valuer la probabilitÃƒÂ© dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢une consommation autodÃƒÂ©clarÃƒÂ©e accrue dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢alcool et de cannabis. La prÃƒÂ©valence dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢une consommation autodÃƒÂ©clarÃƒÂ©e accrue dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢alcool (16,2 % chez les femmes, 15,2 % chez les hommes) et de cannabis (4,9 % chez les femmes, 5,8 % chez les hommes) ne diffÃƒÂ¨re pas selon le genre. Pour les deux genres, le revenu, lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢appartenance Ãƒ un groupe dit Ã‚Â« racialisÃƒÂ© Ã‚Â», le fait dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢avoir travaillÃƒÂ© au cours de la semaine prÃƒÂ©cÃƒÂ©dente, le fait dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÂªtre parent ou tuteur lÃƒÂ©gal dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢un enfant de moins de 18 ans et le fait dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢avoir reÃƒÂ§u un rÃƒÂ©sultat positif au dÃƒÂ©pistage de la dÃƒÂ©pression et de lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢anxiÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© sont associÃƒÂ©s Ãƒ une consommation accrue dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢alcool. Les hommes et les femmes ÃƒÂ¢gÃƒÂ©s de 18 Ãƒ 44 ans ou ayant obtenu un rÃƒÂ©sultat positif au dÃƒÂ©pistage de la dÃƒÂ©pression ÃƒÂ©taient plus susceptibles de dÃƒÂ©clarer une consommation accrue de cannabis. Chez les femmes, le niveau dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÂ©ducation est significativement associÃƒÂ© Ãƒ une consommation accrue dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢alcool. Chez les hommes, le fait dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÂªtre parent ou tuteur lÃƒÂ©gal est associÃƒÂ© de maniÃƒÂ¨re significative Ãƒ une probabilitÃƒÂ© moindre dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢augmentation de la consommation de cannabis. Lors de la deuxiÃƒÂ¨me vague de la pandÃƒÂ©mie, les facteurs sociodÃƒÂ©mographiques ainsi que la dÃƒÂ©pression et lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢anxiÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© ont ÃƒÂ©tÃƒÂ© associÃƒÂ©s de maniÃƒÂ¨re similaire Ãƒ une augmentation de la consommation dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢alcool et de cannabis, tant chez les hommes que chez les femmes. Between September and December 2020, 16.2% of women and 15.2% of men self-reported an increase in their alcohol consumption. During the same period, 4.9% of women and 5.8% of men self-reported an increase in their cannabis consumption. Overall, the factors associated with alcohol and cannabis use in gender-specific regression models were similar. For women, higher education was significantly associated with self-reported increased alcohol use. Men who were parents/legal guardians were significantly less likely to report increased cannabis use. For men and women, screening positive for symptoms of depression was significantly associated with higher odds of increased alcohol and cannabis use. Entre septembre et dÃƒÂ©cembre 2020, 16,2 % des femmes et 15,2 % des hommes ont dÃƒÂ©clarÃƒÂ© avoir augmentÃƒÂ© leur consommation dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢alcool.

"Measuring self-reported change in alcohol and cannabis consumption during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada","This study presents nationally representative estimates of self-reported changes in alcohol and cannabis consumption since the onset of COVID-19 in Canada. We used data from the Survey on COVID-19 and Mental Health (collected from September to December 2020) to calculate the prevalence of self-reported change in alcohol and cannabis consumption. We found that 15.7% of respondents self-reported an increase in alcohol consumption and 5.4% in cannabis consumption since the start of the pandemic. Sociodemographic disparities were also observed, indicating that increased alcohol and cannabis consumption may be more prevalent among certain populations. Cette ÃƒÂ©tude prÃƒÂ©sente des estimations reprÃƒÂ©sentatives Ãƒ lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÂ©chelle nationale portant sur les changements autodÃƒÂ©clarÃƒÂ©s relatifs Ãƒ la consommation dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢alcool et de cannabis depuis le dÃƒÂ©but de la pandÃƒÂ©mie de COVID 19 au Canada. Nous nous sommes servi de donnÃƒÂ©es de lÃ¢â‚¬â„¢EnquÃƒÂªte sur la COVID 19 et la santÃƒÂ© mentale (qui a eu lieu de septembre Ãƒ dÃƒÂ©cembre 2020) pour calculer la prÃƒÂ©valence de ces changements.

"Prevalence of stress, burnout syndrome, anxiety and depression among physicians of a teaching hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic","Health care workers experience a tremendous strain while performing their activities, very frequently leading to stress, burnout syndrome, and psychopathological impact. The COVID-19 pandemic may cause physicians to suffer these effects even to a greater extent. Our objective was to describe the frequency of stress, burnout syndrome, anxiety, and depression during the pandemic, and analyze the associations with different independent outcome measures. Observational, cross-sectional study conducted 2 months after the lockdown was established in Argentina. Clinical specialists, surgeons, emergency physicians, and those with no direct contact with patients were surveyed using a sociodemographic questionnaire and 3 self-administered inventories: Health Professions Stress Inventory, Maslach Burnout Inventory, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. The prevalence of stress was 93.7 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 90.33-96.2), burnout syndrome 73.5 % (95 % CI: 68.2-78.4), anxiety 44 % (95 % CI: 38.4-49.8), and depression 21.9 % (95 % CI: 17.3-26.9). No association was observed between the frequency and medical specialty. The frequency of burnout syndrome, anxiety, and depression was significantly higher among residents and physicians working in the emergency department. Residents and emergency physicians working 24-hour shifts showed significantly higher percentages of burnout syndrome, anxiety, and depression compared to staff and head physicians. These findings may be associated with a higher workload and less experience. It is compulsory to take preventive and therapeutic measures to protect those in the pandemic front line. IntroducciÃƒÂ³n. Los trabajadores de la salud se encuentran sometidos a una gran tensiÃƒÂ³n en el desarrollo de sus actividades, lo que genera alta frecuencia de estrÃƒÂ©s, desgaste laboral e impacto psicopatolÃƒÂ³gico. La pandemia de COVID-19 podrÃƒÂ­a provocar un incremento de estas entidades en los mÃƒÂ©dicos. El objetivo fue describir la frecuencia de estrÃƒÂ©s, sÃƒÂ­ndrome de desgaste profesional (burnout), ansiedad y depresiÃƒÂ³n durante la pandemia, y analizar las asociaciones con distintas variables independientes. MÃƒÂ©todos. Estudio observacional, transversal, realizado dos meses despuÃƒÂ©s del inicio de la cuarentena en Argentina. Se encuestÃƒÂ³ a mÃƒÂ©dicos de especialidades clÃƒÂ­nicas, quirÃƒÂºrgicas, solo de emergencias, y a aquellos sin contacto directo con pacientes, mediante un cuestionario sociodemogrÃƒÂ¡fico y tres inventarios autoadministrados: Health Professions Stress Inventory, Maslach Burnout Inventory y la Escala de ansiedad y depresiÃƒÂ³n hospitalaria. Resultados. La prevalencia de estrÃƒÂ©s fue del 93,7 % (IC95 %: 90,33-96,2), burnout 73,5 % (IC95 %: 68,2-78,4), ansiedad 44 % (IC95 %: 38,4- 49,8) y depresiÃƒÂ³n 21,9 % (IC95 %: 17,3-26,9). No se observÃƒÂ³ asociaciÃƒÂ³n entre la frecuencia y el tipo de especialidad realizada.

"Obesity is Associated with a Greater Number of Long-Term Post-COVID Symptoms and Poor Sleep Quality: A Multicenter Case-Control Study","Obesity is a risk factor associated with higher mortality at the acute phase of COVID-19; however, its influence on post-COVID symptoms is not known. Our aim was to investigate if obesity is a risk factor for the presence of long-term post-COVID symptoms in hospitalized COVID-19 survivor. A multicentre case-control study including patients hospitalised during the first wave of the pandemic was performed Patients with obesity were recruited as cases. Two age- and sex-matched patients without obesity per case were considered controls. Clinical and hospitalization data were collected from hospital medical records. Patients were scheduled for a telephone interview. A list of post-COVID symptoms was systematically evaluated, but participants were free to report any symptom. Anxiety/depressive levels and sleep quality were evaluated with The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, respectively. Overall, 88 patients with obesity and 176 without obesity were assessed 7.2 months after hospital discharge. The most prevalent post-COVID symptoms were fatigue and dyspnea. No significant difference in the prevalence of fatigue, dyspnea, anxiety, depression and limitations of daily living activities was observed between people with ad without obesity. Obesity was independently associated with a greater number of post-COVID symptoms (IRR1.56, 95%CI 1.24-1.95, P&lt;0.001) and poor sleep quality (OR2.10, 95%CI 1.13-3.83, P=0.02).

"Equivalency of In-Person Versus Remote Assessment: WISC-V and KTEA-3 Performance in Clinically Referred Children and Adolescents","Teletesting has the potential to reduce numerous barriers to patient care which have only become exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although telehealth is commonly utilized throughout medicine and mental health practices, teletesting has remained limited within cognitive and academic evaluations. This may be largely due to concern for the validity of test administration via remote assessment. This cross-sectional study examined the equivalency of cognitive [Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children - Fifth Edition (WISC-V)] and academic [Kaufman Test of Educational Achievement - Third Edition (KTEA-3)] subtests administered via either teletesting or traditional in-person testing within clinically referred youth. Chart review using a retrospective, cross-sectional design included a total of 893 children and adolescents, ranging from 4 to 17 years (Mean age = 10.2 years, SD = 2.9 years) who were administered at least one subtest from the aforementioned cognitive or academic assessments. Of these, 285 received teletesting, with the remaining (n = 608) receiving in-person assessment. A total of seven subtests (five from the WISC-V and two from the KTEA-3) were examined. A series of inverse probability of exposure weighted (IPEW) linear regression models examined differences between groups for each of the seven subtests after adjustment for numerous demographic, diagnostic, and parent-reported symptom variables. Only two significant differences were found, such that WISC-V Visual Puzzles (p &lt; .01) and KTEA-3 Math Concepts (p = .03) scores were slightly higher in the teletesting versus in-person groups. However, these differences were quite small in magnitude (WISC-V Visual Puzzles, d = .33, KTEA-3 Math Concepts, d = .18). Findings indicate equivalency across methods of service delivery without clinically meaningful differences in scores among referred pediatric patients.","Hamner, Salorio, Kalb, Jacobson","https://doi.org/10.1017/S1355617721001053","20210927","Academic; Cognitive; Neuropsychology; Pediatric; Telehealth; Telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-28","",18318,""
"Anxiety and Its Determinants among Undergraduate Students during E-learning in Bangladesh Amid Covid-19","The universities of Bangladesh are closed for more than seventeen months due to the covid-19 pandemic. This prolonged detachment has psychological consequences among the students. This study assessed the anxiety level and its determinants among the undergraduate students of Bangladesh, along with constraints faced by them during e-learning. A web-based cross-sectional survey among 206 undergraduate students was conducted using a well-structured questionnaire. Their anxiety level was estimated using Zung's self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and determinates were identified by employing a Tobit model. The problem confrontation index (PCI) was used to rank the constraints. About 82.5% of the undergraduate students in Bangladesh are experiencing mild to extreme anxiety, while 14.08% are experiencing extreme anxiety. Students' gender, father's year of schooling, family size, residential area, academic year, current accommodation, and access to high-speed internet affect their level of anxiety. Learning alone at home, lacking access to learning resources and inaccessibility to other e-learning platforms are the top three constraints students face during e-learning. Self-reported data, socio-demographic variables and online survey. Covid-19 has been causing anxiety among the students. This study recommends providing better internet services for facilitating e-learning along with access to different e-learning platforms.","Hoque, Hannan, Imran, Alam, Matubber, Saha","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadr.2021.100241","20210927","Anxiety; Covid-19; E-learning; Lockdown; Mental health; University students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-28","",18319,""
"The Long-Term Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Loneliness in People Living With Disability and Visual Impairment","<b>Background:</b> There has been growing concern about the impact of restrictions put in place to contain the coronavirus pandemic on loneliness, particularly in individuals with disabilities. This study explored the longitudinal impact of the pandemic on loneliness in these individuals, with a focus on those living with visual impairment (VI). <b>Methods:</b> An online survey was conducted in April-2020 and repeated in March 2021 to explore current life circumstances, health-related behaviours, sleep (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) and social well-being, including state anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Index) and loneliness (UCLA Loneliness scale). A convenience sample of 602 participants completed the first survey. Participants who agreed to be re-contacted were invited to take part in the follow-up survey. <b>Results:</b> Data is presented for the 160 participants who completed both timepoints. At both timepoints, median loneliness was significantly higher in participants with disabilities and those with VI than in participants with no disabilities. While there was no significant change in loneliness in any of the three subgroups, participants with VI experienced the largest increase in median loneliness. Loneliness was associated with having a mental health condition and higher levels of state anxiety at both timepoints. <b>Conclusions:</b> Individuals with disabilities such as VI experienced consistently higher levels of loneliness than those with no disabilities throughout the pandemic. While loneliness remained relatively stable in individuals with no disabilities, it increased, albeit to a non-significant level, in those with disabilities and particularly those with VI. Interventions designed to alleviate loneliness may benefit from addressing state anxiety.","Heinze, Hussain, Castle, Godier-McBard, Kempapidis, Gomes","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.738304","20210927","COVID-19; UCLA; disability; loneliness; sight loss; visual impairment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-28","",18320,""
"Comparative Study of Occupational Burnout and Job Stress of Frontline and Non-Frontline Healthcare Workers in Hospital Wards during COVID-19 Pandemic","Paying attention to the issue of mental health in the workplace, especially with current pandemic conditions of COVID-19 is of significant importance. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the factors affecting occupational burnout among health care center staff during the pandemic of coronavirus infection. The present study was a case-control study carried out in the first half of the year 2020 on medical staff working in hospitals in Tehran. The sample size was 324 individuals, including 175 employees working in general (non-COVID) wards and 149 people working in COVID-19 wards. Demographic characteristics questionnaire and two standard questionnaires of Maslach Burnout Inventory and Parker and DeCotiis Job Stress Scale were distributed. Total score of job stress and its two dimensions (time and pressure) had a significant relationship with different levels of occupational burnout. Logistic regression analyses showed significant relations between job stress with emotional exhaustion (95% CI, 1.11-1.19, OR=1.15) and depersonalization. Participants in both wards experienced statistically significant increasing trends given the different components of occupational burnout concurrently by increasing their total stress score. Hospital staff's levels of stress and occupational burnout regardless of where they worked (COVID-19 wards or general wards) were not significantly different and existed among the members of both groups. On the other hand, job stress and its dimensions (time pressure and anxiety) had a significant relationship with the main dimensions of occupational burnout.","Etesam, Akhlaghi, Vahabi, Akbarpour, Sadeghian","https://doi.org/10.18502/ijph.v50i7.6633","20210927","Burn out; COVID-19; Healthcare workers; Job stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-28","",18321,""
"Lifestyle and behavioral changes during nationwide lockdown in India-A cross-sectional analysis","After almost two months of reporting the first case of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the country, the nationwide lockdown in India was initiated on 24th of March 2020, to curtail the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in the country. While this lockdown had been in place for almost 3 months, the people of the nation have experienced changes in their routine lives in a wide range of activities, including personal behaviours. This study was conducted to identify the impacts that the lockdown had on the lifestyle and behavioural aspects of Indians during the lockdown. It was a cross sectional study, conducted by online survey. Data collection was done for the period of 3 months. The study found that a huge number of participants had significant changes in their diet, sleep, bowel habits and also their personal traits. Also, the lockdown had improved interpersonal relationships and helped people explore their hobbies or even acquire a new skill (about 25% of the participants). More than 90% of the participants perceived decrease in air pollution and a majority reported increase in personal hygiene (74.2%), perceived decrease in crime rates (67.3%) as benefits of lockdown.

"Dynamic profile and clinical implications of hematological and immunological parameters in COVID-19 patients A retrospective study","Ever since the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the SARS-CoV-2 or nCOVID-19 infection (a pandemic), continuous spread of the virus has been observed which has continuously seen to affect and kill multitudes of individuals all over the world. An understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease is necessary for an effective treatment. Laboratory investigations play an important role in the diagnosis as well as treatment of this infectious disease. Hematological parameters demonstrate alterations during the progression of nCOVID-19 infection. Of these, many are indicative of extremely poor clinical outcome. Hematological findings like leukopenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia and coagulation-related abnormalities are the most common manifestations. The aim of this study was to assess the dynamic profile and clinical implications of hematological and immunological parameters among nCOVID-19 infections. This retrospective study was designed after categorizing patients suffering from COVID-19 into three groups: (a) Group I; (b) Group II and (c) Group III or severe critical patients. Hematological and immunological parameters of neutrophilic and white blood cell counts, d-dimer levels, hemoglobin levels, immunoglobulin G (IgG) and M (IgM) levels and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were assessed. Statistical analysis using Kruskal-Wallis test was used. Normal white blood cell and neutrophil count among COVID-19 patients was seen. However, median values in Group II (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.01) and Group III (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.0001) were found to show significantly higher values when compared to Group I. A significant (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.01) decrease in lymphocytic counts was found among severe and critical patients. Hemoglobin level was found to demonstrate higher decrease (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.01) among severe and critical patients. Platelet count was found in normal range in all COVID-19 patients. Routine coagulation tests revealed increased fibrinogen (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.01) and d-dimer levels (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.0001) in severe and critical patients. Normal proportions of total CD3+ and CD4 + T lymphocytes were observed in COVID-19. However, CD8 + T lymphocytes proportion was found to be decreased (<i>P</i>-value &lt; 0.05). Immunoglobulin G levels among Groups II and III patients were found to be lower when compared with Group I (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). No statistical significance was observed between the groups in IgM levels. Plasma IL-6 levels were found to show progressive rise among Groups II and III patients (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Analysis of hematological and immunological parameters profiles in COVID-19 patients may help in deciphering the clinical progression of patients suffering from COVID-19 disease.

"COVID-19 pandemic and death anxiety among intensive care nurses working at the Hospitals Affiliated to Tehran University of Medical Science","The unpredictable challenges and conditions of COVID-19 can cause mental health problems. In such a situation, one of the most important psychological problems is the fear and anxiety of death. Death anxiety can affect the quality of patient care services and the job satisfaction and mental health of nurses. This is a descriptive cross-sectional study in which 110 nurses working in the intensive care units of hospitals affiliated to the Tehran University of Medical Sciences were selected by the convenience sampling method from April to September 2016. The data collection tools used in the study include a demographic questionnaire and a Templer death-anxiety questionnaire. The results showed that the level of death anxiety in nurses working at COVID-19 intensive care units is associated with age, working hours per week, childbearing, several patients needing end-of-life care, cases of direct participation in resuscitation operations, cases of patient death observations, and satisfaction with personal protective equipment (<i>P</i> &lt; o.o5). Increasing the nurses' awareness of the critical situations of COVID-19, management measures, improving the working environment, social support, and increasing personal protective equipment seem to be the effective factors in protecting the intensive care unit nurses against COVID-19 and reducing death anxiety.","Belash, Barzagar, Mousavi, Janbazian, Aghasi, Ladari, Taghizadeh, Jahanbakhsh, Saripour, Gholami, Rahnamaei","https://doi.org/10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_2105_20","20210927","COVID-19; mental health; personal protective equipment; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-28","",18324,""
"Dreaming during lockdown: a quali-quantitative analysis of the Italian population dreams during the first COVID-19 pandemic wave","This study aims to explore the emotional experiences related to the lockdown during the first pandemic wave, analysing the dreams of the Italian population. Through an online survey spread throughout the country, participants completed the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21), the Resilience Scale (RS) and were asked to narrate a dream they had during the lockdown. The dreams were qualitatively analysed through the thematic content analysis. Logistic regression analyses were then conducted to verify the relationship among the categories that emerged and between these categories and the DASS-21 and RS scores. In the dreams 8 categories were identified (Places, Characters, Relationships, Actions, Danger, Death, Processes, and Emotions) composed of specific sub-categories, which seem to compose a sort of narrative structure of the dream. Some sub-categories were found to be predictor of depression and resilience or with exposure to COVID-19.

A 66-year-old unconscious woman was admitted at our clinic, with a history of seropositive rheumatoid arthritis treated with methotrexate. She was in a coma, without signs of serotonin syndrome, recurrent episodes of cardio-respiratory insufficiency under supportive treatment without invasive ventilation, metabolic acidosis, increased D-dimer 3254 ng/mL. The toxicology screening confirmed low benzodiazepines levels and alcoholaemia of 526 mg/dL (5.26 g/L), due to ingestion of 70% ethanol. Considering the decreased biotransformation in the elderly, immunocompromising comorbidities, reports of fatal outcome in poisoned elderly patients with disinfectants under standard fluids supportive protocol, haemodialysis was initiated, with registered associated hypercoagulability which resulted in complete stabilization after 48 h of admission. Treatment protocols of poisoning with ethanol-based disinfectant in the elderly should consider timely performing haemodialysis at lower alcoholaemia levels than recommended.","Pereska, Simonovska, Babulovska, Berat-Huseini, Naumoski, Kostadinoski","https://doi.org/10.1177/2050313X211047717","20210927","COVID-19 pandemic; elderly; ethanol-based disinfectant; haemodialysis; poisoning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-28","",18326,""

"The impact of COVID-19 on the occupational health of oncologists: a descriptive analysis of occupational safety, perceived burnout and social support among practicing oncologists in Alexandria, Egypt","Healthcare workers, including oncologists, face a higher potential risk of contracting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) while managing patients. Moreover, the uncertainty that came with COVID-19 and its associated social stigma may worsen what was already a crisis (burnout) among oncologists. Data are scarce on the impact of COVID-19 on the occupational health and safety of oncologists in low and middle-income countries. We conducted a cross-sectional survey in February 2021 to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on practicing oncologists in Alexandria governorate, Egypt. An anonymised self-reporting questionnaire was electronically distributed to 88 participants to collect information on occupational safety at work, the prevalence of COVID-19 among respondents and the impact of COVID-19 on their wellbeing, including perceived burnout and family support. Out of the 88 contacted oncologists, 75% completed the survey. The mean age of participants was 34.79 years (SD Ã‚Â± 10.42), of which 45% were residents, 36% were specialists and 18% were consultants. Most of the oncologists (58% of 66) felt they were not adequately protected against COVID-19. The majority (78% of 66) have managed COVID-19 infected cancer patients, and 76% (out of 66) had experienced COVID-19 like symptoms. A third (<i>n</i> = 21) of the respondents were confirmed COVID-19 infected: 62% of the latter thought they were infected at the workplace, either by a patient or a colleague. The majority of the oncologists (78%) perceived being more overwhelmed or burned out than in the pre-COVID-19 era. Nearly half of the participants (48%) reported their family members and friends had reduced contact with them despite being COVID-19 negative, in fear of being infected. The burnout was significantly higher in those lacking family support than those who had, 52% versus 28% respectively (<i>p</i> = 0.038). One-third of practicing oncologists were diagnosed with COVID-19, and most thought they were infected at the hospital. Occupational safety measures, including mental health programs, need to be improved with special emphasis on the role of family support in mitigating perceived burnout among practicing oncologists.","Omar, Ramadan, Khamis, Ismail","https://doi.org/10.3332/ecancer.2021.1273","20210927","COVID-19; burnout; isolation; occupational health; oncologists","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-28","",18328,""
"Development and Validation of the Robust - Pandemic Coping Scale (R-PCS)","The psychological consequences of epidemics/pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, include an increase in psychopathological symptoms, such as depression, anxiety, and stress, and negative emotions, such as fear. However, relatively little attention has been paid to how people cope with the pandemic. Coping is a multi-component process, helping to diminish the traumatic impact of stressful events in a variety of ways. We studied how university students coped with the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, by developing the Robust - Pandemic Coping Scale (R-PCS), a new scale for measuring coping strategies related to epidemics/pandemics. The scale is based on a classification of coping strategies referred to the needs of competence, relatedness, and autonomy. To create a robust scale, such that the item values would be independent of the sample used for developing it, we employed Rasch modeling. We used a sample of 2,987 Italian university students who participated in an online survey including the R-PCS and the Power to Live with Disasters Questionnaire (PLDQ), during March 2020. First, we applied a dual approach combining exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, which supported the goodness of a 4-factor model (i.e., Despair, Adjustment, Proactivity, and Aversion) for the R-PCS, invariant across gender and age of respondents (younger or as old as 23 years, older than 23 years). We then transformed the raw scores of the R-PCS into interval logit scale scores applying the Rasch model. Second, our findings supported the discriminant validity and the criterion validity of the R-PCS, examining the correlations with the PLDQ. They also confirmed its predictive validity: the R-PCS scores were related to 2-month-later enjoyment and anger, indicating that Adjustment and Proactivity were adaptive while Despair and Aversion were maladaptive. Third, our study revealed gender and age differences: the scores were higher for Despair, Adjustment, and Proactivity for females; for Aversion for males; and for Proactivity for students older than 23 years. The study suffers from limitations related to social desirability, gender imbalance, and self-selection effects in the recruitment.","Burro, Vicentini, Rocca, Barnaba, Hall, Raccanello","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.725344","20210927","Rasch model; coping strategies; factor analysis; invariance analysis; measures; pandemic; scale development","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-28","",18329,""
"Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Depressive Symptoms, and Sleep Problem During COVID-19 Outbreak in Ethiopia Among Police Officers: A Cross-Sectional Survey","<b>Background:</b> Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an outbreak that caused serious threats to people worldwide. Police officers are one of those frontline fighters during pandemic. Our study is the first to examine psychological health response among police officers in Ethiopia during the COVID-19 outbreak. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional study design with a self-administered questionnaire was conducted among police officers from Dessie town from June 20 to July 10, 2020. A total of 385 questionnaires were completed correctly accounting for 91% of the total. The data were collected by using demographic information and psychological health assessment tools. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and Brief Resilient Coping Scale questionnaire were used to assess depression, anxiety, sleep, and coping status of participants. <b>Results:</b> The rate of depression was found to be 28.9%. Of these, 19.7% had mild, 7.3% had moderate, 1.6 had moderate-severe, and 0.3% had severe depression symptoms. The rate of general anxiety symptoms was found to be 30.2%. Of these, 22.1% of the police officers had mild, 2.6% had moderate, and 5.5% had severe anxiety. Moreover, 13.8% of police officers had subthreshold insomnia and 2.1% had clinical (moderate-severe) insomnia. Participants who are men, married, highly resilient, and have high social support were associated with lower depression, anxiety, and insomnia scores than those of women, being single or widowed/divorced, low resilient coping score, and low social support, respectively. <b>Conclusion:</b> A psychological health problem was found to be higher among police officers in Dessie town. Younger age, sex, marital status, having chronic diseases, coping, and social support with depression, general anxiety, and insomnia were found to be significantly associated with psychological health problems. There is a need for mental health services, support, and care of police officers during the pandemic.","Tsehay, Necho, Gelaye, Beyene, Birkie","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.713954","20210927","COVID-19; coping status; depression; general anxiety; sleep quality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-28","",18330,""
"China Public Psychology Analysis About COVID-19 Under Considering Sina Weibo Data","COVID-19 not only poses a huge threat to public health, but also affects people's mental health. Take scientific and effective psychological crisis intervention to prevent large-scale negative emotional contagion is an important task for epidemic prevention and control. This paper established a sentiment classification model to make sentiment annotation (positive and negative) about the 105,536 epidemic comments in 86 days on the official Weibo of People's Daily, the test results showed that the accuracy of the model reached 88%, and the AUC value was greater than 0.9. Based on the marked data set, we explored the potential law between the changes in Internet public opinion and epidemic situation in China. First of all, we found that most of the Weibo users showed positive emotions, and the negative emotions were mainly caused by the fear and concern about the epidemic itself and the doubts about the work of the government. Secondly, there is a strong correlation between the changes of epidemic situation and people's emotion. Also, we divided the epidemic into three period. The proportion of people's negative emotions showed a similar trend with the number of newly confirmed cases in the growth and decay period, and the extinction period. In addition, we also found that women have more positive emotional performance than men, and the high-impact groups is also more positive than the low-impact groups. We hope that these conclusions can help China and other countries experiencing severe epidemics to guide publics respond.","Pan, Wang, Dai, Huang, Hu, Pan, Liao","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.713597","20210927","COVID-19; China; Sina Weibo data; public psychology; sentiment classification model","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-28","",18331,""
"Job Insecurity and Job Performance: A Serial Mediated Relationship and the Buffering Effect of Organizational Justice","The study aimed to extend the current knowledge of the relationship between job insecurity and performance. In line with traditional stress theories, work-family and burnout were hypothesized as serial mediators of the negative link between job insecurity and job performance. Also, the current study hypothesized that the association between job insecurity and the mediators [i.e., Work-family conflict (WFC) and burnout] could be buffered by perceived organizational justice among employees. Therefore, we empirically tested a moderated serial mediation model. Participants were 370 employees of an Italian multiservice social cooperative. Data were collected using a self-report questionnaire in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. The obtained results indicated that WFC and burnout mediated the association between job insecurity and job performance. Furthermore, perceived organizational justice buffered the relationship between job insecurity and WFC. Concerning job burnout, the association with job insecurity was moderated only among employees perceiving medium and high levels of organizational justice. The moderated serial mediation index provided support to the role of organizational justice in decreasing the association between job insecurity and job performance. This study delves deeper into the variables explaining the relationship between job insecurity and job performance by testing a serial process mechanism that involved WFC and burnout. Additionally, the obtained results provide suggestions to organizations and managers regarding the protective role of organizational justice to sustain employees' mental health and performance. Practical implications at the organizational and managerial level are provided, along with a focus on the actual impact of the pandemic.","De Angelis, Mazzetti, Guglielmi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.694057","20210927","burnout; job insecurity; moderated mediation; organizational justice; performance; work-family conflict","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-28","",18332,""
"The Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on University Faculty, Staff, and Students and Coping Strategies Used During the Lockdown in the United Arab Emirates","<b>Introduction:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown instigated serious mental health conditions. So far, the UAE data on mental health problems due to this pandemic outbreak is still scarce. The objective of this study was to identify the prevalent psychological difficulties experienced by university students, faculty members, and staff during COVID-19 lockdown and the coping strategies used. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional design was used to collect data from 737 participants using an online electronic survey. Participants included students, faculty members, and staff from universities in the UAE. The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) was used to measure general distress, Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ-16) was used to measure worry, and the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (CISS-48) was administered to measure coping strategies used by participants during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Data were collected during May to June 2020. <b>Results:</b> The results indicated that 60.4% of students, 57.4% of the faculty members, and 52.3% of the staff experienced mild psychiatric problems. About 32.9% of students, 33.7% of the faculty members, and 25% of the staff experienced high levels of worry during the COVID-19 lockdown. Changes in eating patterns, worsening chronic health problems, change in sleep patterns, and concentration difficulties were reported. Furthermore, significant differences were observed in worry and coping strategies among participants.

"Sex Differences in Psychological Status and Fatigue of Frontline Staff After the COVID-19 Outbreak in China: A Cross-Sectional Study","<b>Background:</b> The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading globally, and it is significant to pay attention to the mental health of frontline staff in this pandemic. This study is aimed to explore the sex difference among the frontline staff in demographics, characteristics of mental state, and the potential relationship between them. <b>Method:</b> A total of 2,614 Chinese frontline staff were recruited. The Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) were used for assessing the mental status of frontline staff, and the Fatigue Self-Assessment Scale (FSAS) was used for detecting fatigue. <b>Result:</b> The prevalence rate of anxiety for female frontline staff is higher than that of male (<i>P</i> = 0.003), and the prevalence rate of depression is similar between them (<i>P</i> = 0.091).

Other viral infections have been associated with psychiatric sequelae: infection-triggered disturbing of the immune system and the stressful intensive unit care can cause psychological and psychiatric complications. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 can potentially induce neuronal injuries, leading to neurocognitive disabilities. Previous studies during the COVID-19 pandemic reported a high occurrence rate of psychopathological and neurocognitive conditions among COVID-19 survivors, highlighting the need for screening for these impairments in order to implement early interventions and secondary prevention. However, many psychiatric disorders can take several years to develop, and it is still difficult to differentiate between factors linked to the infection itself or to the global context of the pandemic. In this review, we describe the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on mental health, the mechanisms involved in psychiatric and neurocognitive sequelae, and the strategies of prevention and management.

"Technology Enhanced Health and Social Care for Vulnerable People During the COVID-19 Outbreak","The COVID-19 pandemic has spread rapidly worldwide with critical consequences in health, as well as in social, economic, and particularly in psychological conditions of vulnerable people, especially older adults. Therefore, it is necessary the direct attention to their health care needs and related interventions. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) have direct impact on older adults' health and quality of life leading to decreased depression and loneliness, along with empowerment of independent life. Many studies involve cognitive training programs/software based on new technological systems that provide to vulnerable people access to gamified, attractive, cognitive exercises for overall functionality everywhere and at any time. Twenty-four participants (mean age 69.3 years) were assigned to this study. The cognitive training component of LLM Care was used as an interactive software to enhance participants' cognitive functions. The intervention lasted 12 weeks with the frequency of 2-4 times per week in sessions of at least 30 min. Participants used their personal devices (tablets/laptops) in their own residence, while technical and consulting guidance was provided by LLM Care certified trainers. They were informed about the purpose of the study, while consent forms along with psychological assessments were distributed every 2 weeks to periodically evaluate their psychosocial and mental health conditions. The assessments included the World Health Organization-Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5), the Short Anxiety Screening Test (SAST), the System Usability Scale (SUS) and the Impact Factor Event Scale (IES-R). According to the results, the participants with improved well-being tended to report decreased subjective distress caused by COVID-19, and their engagement with new technologies can potentially minimize the negative outcomes occurred by the current stressful situation, mitigating the effect of hyperarousal symptoms, while increasing their overall well-being. Well-being seems to remain relatively stable among older adults and decreases only when adversities occur, while the usability of the software was perceived as marginally acceptable by participants. The exploitation of the LLM Care contributes to the improvement of older adults' well-being and alleviates the negative experience caused by stressful situations like COVID-19.","Romanopoulou, Zilidou, Gilou, Dratsiou, Varella, Petronikolou, Katsouli, Karagianni, Bamidis","https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2021.721065","20210927","COVID-19; ICT; cognitive training; healthcare; quality of life; technology; vulnerable people; web-based","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-28","",18337,""
"Rebooting mental health care delivery for the COVID-19 pandemic (and beyond): Guiding cautions as telehealth enters the clinical mainstream","Across the COVID-19 pandemic, we have witnessed perhaps the field's largest and most abrupt transformation in scope of practice. In the context of surging mental health needs and historically limited feasibility of traditional office-based services, telehealth has launched into the clinical mainstream and has become a dominant mode of outpatient mental health care delivery during the pandemic. The articles in this terrific Special Issue outlined some of the field's most exciting innovations from the past 18 months. The present commentary discusses how these unprecedented times have prompted unprecedented resourcefulness and innovation in the field. Issues related to evolving and uncertain telehealth regulation and reimbursement policies are discussed, and cautions for the road ahead are offered as we prepare for post-pandemic practices. The commentary concludes with a call to redouble efforts to move beyond the use of telehealth to largely treat only those populations who already enjoyed access to traditional office-based services. Understanding and overcoming barriers to telehealth care and ensuring equitable access to telehealth options are critical steps for actualizing the great potential of telehealth strategies for increasing the reach of supported care to underserved populations.","Comer","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpra.2021.09.002","20210927","COVID-19; coronavirus; telehealth; telemental health; treatment innovation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-28","",18338,""

"The psychological impacts of COVID-19 related stressors on Syrian refugees in Turkey: The role of resource loss, discrimination, and social support","COVID-19 does not leave behind refugees. They are disproportionately affected during the current pandemic. The present study aimed to investigate the psychological impacts of COVID-19 related stressors -resource loss and perceived discrimination during the COVID-19 pandemic- on Syrian refugees in Turkey. Further, the buffering role of perceived social support against the detrimental impacts of such stressors was examined. An online cross-sectional study was conducted between September-October 2020. A sample of 345 Syrian refugees in Turkey completed the questions about demographic characteristics, resource loss and perceived discrimination during the pandemic, perceived social support, and depressive and anxiety symptoms. A high level of depressive and anxiety symptoms was reported in our sample. Resource loss and perceived discrimination during the pandemic significantly and positively predicted depressive and anxiety symptoms. Perceived social support acted as a buffer against the detrimental effect of resource loss on mental health. For those with higher perceived social support, resource loss during the pandemic did not significantly predict depressive and anxiety symptoms. The results indicate the detrimental role of COVID-19 related stressors on refugee mental health. Social support is an important protective factor for mental health amidst the pandemic.

"Status quo and influencing factors for anxiety, depression, and insomnia among 4 237 nurses in Hunan Province","Public health emergencies have caused significant psychological burden on nurse and affect their mental health. After the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, the nurse's mental health has been paid much attention. This study aims to investigate status and influencing factors for anxiety, depression, and insomnia in nurses during the normalized epidemic period, and to further compare the risk of anxiety, depression, and insomnia among nurses at different levels of hospitals between front-line epidemic nurses and other nurses so as to provide a basis for mental health work, nursing management, and relevant study in hospital. A total of 4 237 nurses from all levels of hospitals in Hunan Province participated in the survey in December 2020. A self-designed anonymous questionnaire was used in this study. Anxiety, depression, and insomnia were assessed using Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 items (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 items (PHQ-9), and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), respectively. Descriptive statistical analysis was used to evaluate nurses' anxiety, depression, and insomnia; <i>t</i>-test, analysis of variance, and multiple linear stepwise regression analysis were used to analyze the influencing factors of nurses' anxiety, depression, and insomnia. The scores of GAD-7 among 4 237 nurses were 4.44Ã‚Â±4.20, with 10.3% of them experienced moderate to severe level anxiety. The scores of PHQ-9 were 6.03Ã‚Â±4.76, with 17.5% of them experienced moderate to severe level depressive symptom. The scores of ISI were 8.37Ã‚Â±5.42, with 12.3% of them experienced moderate to severe insomnia. There were significant differences in GAD-7, PHQ-9, and ISI scores among different groups of hospital levels, gender, professional title, position, education level, night shifts, and family monthly income (all <i>P</i>&lt;0.05). Marital status, whether to participate in the front-line, and whether to participate in psychology training groups were not associated with anxiety, depression, and insomnia (all <i>P</i>&gt;0.05). Gender, hospital level, professional title, educational background, more night shifts, and family monthly income were the influencing factors for the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores. Gender, length of service, position, hospital level, educational background, night shifts in the last year, and family monthly income were the influencing factors for ISI score. There is no difference in the scores of the GAD-7, PHQ-9, and ISI between nurses whether to participate in the front-line, indicating that series of measures for front-line medical staff are effective in China.Meanwhile, some nurses experienced anxiety, depression, and insomnia, and attention should be paid to nurses with low position, more night shifts, lower-level hospitals, and families with low income. It is recommended that management policies, psychological support, and human resource protection should be given to relieve the pressure and maintain the mental health of nurses. At the same time, it is necessary to make mental health knowledge training as a routine training when responding to public health emergencies. <b>Ã§â€ºÂ®Ã§Å¡â€ž</b>:

"An Impact Analysis of the Early Months of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Health in a Prospective Cohort of Canadian Adolescents","The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescent mental health is a global concern; however, most research is cross-sectional or started after the pandemic response began and thus unable to evaluate within-individual change. The purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate the effect of the initial COVID-19 response on adolescent mental health and ill-health as a natural experiment. We used 3-year linked data from the COMPASS study, including 7,653 Canadian (Quebec, Ontario) adolescents from which 2,099 completed surveys in all three waves (pre-COVID-19 [2018 and 2019] and online [May-July 2020], 2-3Ã‚Â months into the pandemic). A structural equation modeling approach to fixed effects and a difference-in-differences design were used to estimate pre-COVID-19-to-early lockdown change in mental health (psychosocial well-being [flourishing-reverse scored]) and ill-health (depression and anxiety symptoms), compared with 2018-to-2019 change. Models were adjusted for self-selection, age of entry into the cohort, and sociodemographics. Depression, anxiety, and reverse-flourishing scores increased across all waves; however, the mental health changes from the pre-COVID-19 wave (2019) to 2020 were not greater relative to the changes seen across the 2018-to-2019 waves. Our results do not support a detrimental effect of the initial stages of the COVID-19 lockdown measures on adolescent mental health. The deterioration in mental health in the early COVID-19 response was less than the decline found over a prepandemic period. Further prospective research is needed to explore the impact of the prolonged pandemic and related measures on adolescents and inequitable effects in population subgroups.","BÃƒÂ©langer, Patte, Leatherdale, GansaonrÃƒÂ©, Haddad","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2021.07.039","20210927","Adolescents; COVID-19; Cohort; Longitudinal; Mental health; Pandemic; Prospective; Youth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-28","",18342,""
"Frontline healthcare workers' mental distress, top concerns, and assessment on hierarchy of controls in response to COVID-19: a cross-sectional survey study","The existing studies showed that frontline healthcare workers during an epidemic experienced unusual stressors and mental distress which even lasted for years after the crisis. It is important to learn about their concerns early to mitigate the negative impact as well as to evaluate disease control from experiences on the front lines for improving responses to the outbreak. The study aimed to provide insights on how to strengthen public health responses to protect healthcare workers both physically and mentally, and effectively control the disease in light of hierarchy of controls. A cross-sectional survey was distributed online via Qualtrics to frontline healthcare workers during the COVID-19 through a university's nursing program and received 267 valid responses from 103 certificated nursing assistants, 125 nurses, and 39 other health professionals. A descriptive data analysis with a Chi-square test at a two-sided 0.05 level of significance was performed on factors that potentially affected mental health of healthcare workers and effectiveness of disease control at workplace in five domains. The themes were summarized on open-ended questions. About 30% of the respondents showed the symptom of depression and needed a further investigation. The influencing factors in five domains were examined. Engineering and administrative controls, as well as PPE were widely used in response to COVID-19. The respondents assessed the state and workplace responses to COVID-19 better than the federal government responses. The workplace responses were considered most effective. Multiple factors with a statistically significant correlation with effectiveness of the disease control at workplace were identified. The study suggested that timely responses at policy level will be more effective than other measures in early prevention and control of the pandemic, mental distress should be addressed in addition to PPE, and nursing programs should consider providing a situation-specific career coaching or counseling for students. A longitudinal study at a larger scale is warranted to capture the variation of time change with the disease control evolvement and across geographic regions.","Zhang, Flike, Gakumo, Shi, Leveille, Thompson","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12960-021-00661-5","20210927","COVID-19; Healthcare workers; Hierarchy of controls; Mental distress; Workplace response","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-28","",18343,""
"Adrift in time: the subjective experience of circadian challenge during COVID-19 amongst people with mood disorders","Social distancing/lockdown policies during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic may alter social rhythms of people through imposition of restrictions on normal daily activities. This may in turn challenge circadian function, particularly in people with mood disorders. Although objective data describing the relationship between circadian disturbances and mood disorders exist, data regarding the subjective experience of circadian challenge is sparse, and its association with mood symptoms is unclear. The present qualitative study was one component of a mixed-methods multi-national project, which took advantage of widespread disruption to daily routines due to Government COVID-related lockdowns during 2020. The Behavior Emotion and Timing during COVID-19 (BEATCOVID) survey study included three open questions generating qualitative data on participants' subjective experience of social disruption due to social distancing/lockdown policies, two of which asked about the barriers and opportunities for stabilizing routines. Responses were coded and analyzed using Thematic Analysis. A total of <i>N</i> =Ã‚Â 997 participants responded to at least one of the free-text questions. Four themes were identified: 1) loss of daily timed activities, 2) role of social interaction, 3) altered time perception and 4) disruption to motivation and associated psychological effects. Themes were organized into a provisional heuristic map, generating hypotheses for future research centered on the new concept of 'psychological drift.'","Kahawage, Crowe, Gottlieb, Swartz, Yatham, Bullock, Inder, Porter, Nierenberg, Meesters, Gordjin, Haarman, Murray","https://doi.org/10.1080/07420528.2021.1967971","20210927","COVID-19; bipolar disorder; circadian; depression; mood; social rhythms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-28","",18344,""
"The new normal for breast cancer surgery during COVID-19 pandemic: An international survey conducted by SENATURK","The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way many health institutions approach their workload. Physicians managing patients with cancer now have to deal not only with the disease but also the restrictions and limitations imposed because of the global pandemic. We aimed to determine how surgical preferences in breast cancer management were affected globally using a questionnaire-based survey. Under the auspices of the Turkish Senology Society (SENATURK) we asked 122 surgeons from 27 countries to reply to a 26-question survey designed to measure the impact of COVID-19 on their surgical practice when treating patients with breast cancer. The characteristics of participant surgeons were statistically similar when comparing the participants' answers from Turkey and other countries. From the responses given to our questionnaire, it was understood that breast cancer surgery decreased by 25% (p&lt;0.05) in institutions all over the world, including Turkey, but there was no change in the approach technique to the axilla. Globally breast surgeons have adapted to the new normal due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many surgical approaches and some follow up protocols have been changed, although the degree of change has varied from country to country. In addition, the availability of multidisciplinary case conferences has been reduced in some centers which may affect the quality of services provided to patients.","Canturk, Guler, Kocdor, Simsek","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+new+normal+for+breast+cancer+surgery+during+COVID-19+pandemic:+An+international+survey+conducted+by+SENATURK.","20210926","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-28","",18345,""
"Bullying, Cyberbullying, Anxiety, and Depression in a Sample of Youth during the Coronavirus Pandemic","While we know that the pandemic and its social isolation, loss of school experiences, increased screen use, and financial stress have likely had a psychological impact upon children and teens, little research has been done directly with youth to assess social and emotional factors during the pandemic and in its immediate aftermath. In this study, a sample of 240 youth reported on their experiences with bullying, fighting, sexting, cyberbullying, anxiety, and depression during the period from March 2020 to April 2021. The results indicated that bullying, cyberbullying, sexting, and fighting showed only small or no increases, but anxiety and depression were dramatically increased relative to before the pandemic. Female and LGBTQ youth were particularly vulnerable during the months since March 2020. The results suggest that youth will need positive social experiences and, in some cases, psychological interventions and treatment to restore emotional equilibrium in the months ahead.","Englander","https://doi.org/10.3390/pediatric13030064","20210926","anxiety; bullying; cyberbullying; depression; pandemic; social and emotional learning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-28","",18346,""
"Well-Being and Mental Health of Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic","During the COVID-19 pandemic, a decrease in well-being and an increase in mental health problems were registered in medical and psychotherapeutic practices, counseling centers, and clinics. According to previous studies, younger people and women seemed to be particularly affected. The aim of this study was to describe mental health problems of students and to draw consequences for the further handling of pandemics and other crises. Students at the University of Heidelberg, a typical German ""full university,"" were surveyed online using internationally comparable screening instruments like the Well-Being Index (WHO-5) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ). In addition, the students had the opportunity to describe in a narrative form their well-being and to make suggestions how to improve their situation. Out of a population of 27,162 students who were contacted by email, 2,137 students completed the questionnaire. The salient finding is that according to the WHO-5 Well-Being Index, 72.2% of the respondents feel seriously impaired in their well-being. This corresponds to the finding that 75.8% of the respondents in the PHQ-D show indications of at least one syndrome diagnosis. Depression was found in 41.8% of the respondents in the PHQ-D. Indications of moderate to severe and severe depressive syndromes were present in 31.8%. Signs of somatoform syndromes are found in 25.4% and of anxiety syndromes in 20.0%. 1,089 students gave narrative reports on how they were feeling and made suggestions for improvement. About 75% reported severely reduced well-being. Their main complaints were loneliness and depression and lack of recognition for their specific academic and life situation during the pandemic. By far, the largest proportion of students supposed that their mental health issues were caused and/or intensified by the pandemic-related social contact restrictions. The vast majority of them made reasonable suggestions for controlled relaxation of contact restrictions. Students suffer severely from the pandemic-related social restriction. In respect to future pandemic outbreaks or other crises leading to social isolation, the dramatic consequences of social lockdowns should be taken into account. Under pandemic conditions, we especially should support persons lacking social networks.","Holm-Hadulla, Klimov, Juche, MÃƒÂ¶ltner, Herpertz","https://doi.org/10.1159/000519366","20210926","COVID-19 pandemic; Depression; Mental health; Social isolation; University students; Well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-28","",18347,""
"Cinnamon and its possible impact on COVID-19: The viewpoint of traditional and conventional medicine","The COVID-19 global epidemic caused by coronavirus has affected the health and other aspects of life for more than one year. Despite the current pharmacotherapies, there is still no specific treatment, and studies are in progress to find a proper therapy with high efficacy and low side effects. In this way, Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM), due to its holistic view, can provide recommendations for the prevention and treatment of new diseases such as COVID-19. The muco-obstruction of the airway, which occurs in SARS-CoV-2, has similar features in TPM textbooks that can lead us to new treatment approaches. Based on TPM and pharmacological studies, Cinnamomum verum (Darchini)'s potential effective functions can contribute to SARS-CoV-2 infection treatment and has been known to be effective in corona disease in Public beliefs. From the viewpoint of TPM theories, Cinnamon can be effective in SARS-CoV-2 improvement and treatment through its anti-obstructive, diuretic, tonic and antidote effects. In addition, there is pharmacological evidence on anti-viral, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, organ-o-protective and anti-depression effects of Cinnamon that are in line with the therapeutic functions mentioned in TPM.Overall, Cinnamon and its ingredients can be recommended for SARS-CoV2 management due to multi-targeting therapies. This review provides basic information for future studies on this drug's effectiveness in preventing and treating COVID-19 and similar diseases.","Yakhchali, Taghipour, Mirabzadeh Ardakani, Alizadeh Vaghasloo, Vazirian, Sadrai","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2021.112221","20210926","COVID-19; Cinnamomum verum; Cinnamon; Obstruction; Opener; Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-28","",18348,""
"Family caregiving and changes in mental health status in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a widespread significant impact on mental health. However, the effect of providing care to family members (informal caregiving) on changes in mental health status during the pandemic remains unclear. Using cross-sectional data from a large internet survey conducted between August and September 2020, we investigated the association of informal caregiving status with the incidence of mental health deterioration (increased loneliness, self-reported deterioration in mental health, and new suicidal ideation) in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic. Among 25,482 participants (mean age 48.8 [standard deviation 17.3]; 50.3% women), 2,500 (9.8%) were providing informal care during the pandemic. After adjusting for potential confounders, informal caregivers were more likely than non-caregivers to experience increased loneliness (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.16; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.70-2.76), self-reported deterioration in mental health (aOR 1.54; 95% CI 1.14-2.08), and new incidence of suicidal ideation (aOR 3.65; 95% CI 1.92-6.92). The degree of mental health deterioration depended on the intensity of care. For example, the incidence rates of new suicidal ideation were 15.0%, 5.2%, and 3.6% for individuals who provided high-intensity caregiving, those who provided low-intensity caregiving, and non-caregivers, respectively (p-for-trend&lt;0.001). The stratified analysis by gender showed that informal caregiving was associated with self-reported deterioration in mental health status among women (aOR 2.19; 95% CI 1.49-3.21) but not men (aOR 1.08; 95% CI 0.75-1.56). Informal caregivers were more likely to experience mental health deterioration than non-caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Taniguchi, Miyawaki, Tsugawa, Murayama, Tamiya, Tabuchi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.archger.2021.104531","20210926","COVID-19; Caregivers; Informal caregiving; Japan; Loneliness; Mental health; Suicidal ideation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-28","",18349,""
"Psychological well-being of ruminative adolescents during the transition to COVID-19 school closures: An EMA study","Adolescents with moderate-to-severe levels of trait rumination are at heightened risk for psychopathology and may be particularly vulnerable to disruptions caused by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. As most past research documenting the impact of COVID-19 on adolescent well-being has been cross-sectional, it is unclear exactly how ruminative adolescents responded to the onset of the pandemic as it unfolded. We used ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to explore changes in rumination among adolescents during the initial transition to distance learning in the United States. A subsample of 22 ruminative youth (MageÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 13.58; SDÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.96; 54.5% male; 86.4% White) from a larger study provided EMA data throughout January-April 2020 (M responses per participantÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 105.09, SDÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 65.59). Following school closures, we hypothesized that adolescents would report greater rumination (i.e., focusing on emotions and problems) and depressive symptom level would moderate this effect. Surprisingly, rumination decreased, and this effect was moderated by depressive symptom level for emotion-focused rumination, i.e., those with average and below-average depressive symptoms experienced decreases in rumination. These results suggest that the first wave of stay-at-home orders and the transition to distance learning were not immediately distressing to vulnerable adolescents. However, more research is needed to determine whether the results from recent research are generalizable to other adolescents and to examine the long-term impact of the pandemic on adolescent well-being.","Swords, Lecarie, Doane, Hilt","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adolescence.2021.09.006","20210926","Adolescents; COVID-19; Depressive symptoms; EMA; Rumination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-28","",18350,""

"Restricted visitation policies in acute care settings during the COVID-19 pandemic: a scoping review","Restricted visitation policies in acute care settings because of the COVID-19 pandemic have negative consequences. The objective of this scoping review is to identify impacts of restricted visitation policies in acute care settings, and describe perspectives and mitigation approaches among patients, families, and healthcare professionals. We searched Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Healthstar, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials on January 01/2021, unrestricted, for published primary research records reporting any study design. We included secondary (e.g., reviews) and non-research records (e.g., commentaries), and performed manual searches in web-based resources. We excluded records that did not report primary data. Two reviewers independently abstracted data in duplicate. Of 7810 citations, we included 155 records. Sixty-six records (43%) were primary research; 29 (44%) case reports or case series, and 26 (39%) cohort studies; 21 (14%) were literature reviews and 8 (5%) were expert recommendations; 54 (35%) were commentary, editorial, or opinion pieces. Restricted visitation policies impacted coping and daily function (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°31, 20%) and mental health outcomes (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°29, 19%) of patients, families, and healthcare professionals. Participants described a need for coping and support (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°107, 69%), connection and communication (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°107, 69%), and awareness of state of well-being (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°101, 65%). Eighty-seven approaches to mitigate impact of restricted visitation were identified, targeting families (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°61, 70%), patients (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°51, 59%), and healthcare professionals (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°40, 46%). Patients, families, and healthcare professionals were impacted by restricted visitation polices in acute care settings during COVID-19. The consequences of this approach on patients and families are understudied and warrant evaluation of approaches to mitigate their impact. Future pandemic policy development should include the perspectives of patients, families, and healthcare professionals.
