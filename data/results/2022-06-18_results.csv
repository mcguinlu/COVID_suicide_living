"It hurts your heart: frontline healthcare worker experiences of moral injury during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background: Moral injury is defined as the strong emotional and cognitive reactions following events which clash with someones moral code, values or expectations. During the COVID-19 pandemic, increased exposure to potentially morally injurious events (PMIEs) has placed healthcare workers (HCWs) at risk of moral injury. Yet little is known about the lived experience of cumulative PMIE exposure and how NHS staff respond to this. Objective: We sought to rectify this knowledge gap by qualitatively exploring the lived experiences and perspectives of clinical frontline NHS staff who responded to COVID-19. Methods: We recruited a diverse sample of 30 clinical frontline HCWs from the NHS CHECK study cohort, for single time point qualitative interviews. All participants endorsed at least one item on the 9-item Moral Injury Events Scale (MIES) (Nash et al., 2013) at six month follow up. Interviews followed a semi-structured guide and were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Results: HCWs described being routinely exposed to ethical conflicts, created by exacerbations of pre-existing systemic issues including inadequate staffing and resourcing. We found that HCWs experienced a range of mental health symptoms primarily related to perceptions of institutional betrayal as well as feeling unable to fulfil their duty of care towards patients. Conclusion: These results suggest that a multi-facetted organisational strategy is warranted to prepare for PMIE exposure, promote opportunities for resolution of symptoms associated with moral injury and prevent organisational disengagement.","Siobhan Hegarty; Danielle Lamb; Sharon Stevelink; Rupa Bhundia; Rosalind Raine; Mary Jane Docherty; Hannah Rachel Scott; Anne Marie Rafferty; Victoria Williamson; Sarah Dorrington; Matthew hotopf; Reza Razavi; Neil Greenberg; Simon Wessely","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.06.17.22276433","20220617","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-18","",32982,""

"A qualitative exploration of psychologists' experiences of teletherapy within the Irish Public Mental Health System","Objective Method Results Conclusions The current qualitative study aimed to investigate psychologists' experiences of teletherapy throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, with a particular focus on teletherapy's impact on therapeutic relationships.Fifteen participants, consisting of clinical and counselling psychologists employed by the Health Service Executive (HSE) in Ireland, participated in semi-structured interviews conducted via telephone.Constructionist thematic analysis yielded three prominent themes: (i) psychologists experienced a lack of control over therapeutic boundaries with their clients, such as the setting and time in which sessions take place. Teletherapy also encroaches on psychologists' personal boundaries from having aspects of their home lives becoming associated with clients' trauma;(ii) psychologists have to work much harder to make the connection with clients due to the substantial loss of information, including non-verbal cues, transmitted across teletherapeutic platforms;and (iii) psychologists themselves feel uncontained from being insufficiently supported by the HSE, which impacts on their ability to contain high-risk clients via teletherapy.Various aspects of the therapeutic relationship, including therapeutic boundaries between psychologists and their clients, and psychologists' ability to make the connection and foster containment with their clients, were impacted by teletherapy. Psychologists need to feel heard, supported and appreciated to ensure optimal delivery of teletherapy in future.

"Outcomes in clients transitioning from in-person counselling to telehealth counselling with trainees","The onset of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic necessitated a rapid transition of mental health services from in-person to telehealth counselling. Despite the far-reaching impact of this transition, we know little about the impact of this transition on outcomes for clients working with counsellor trainees. The present study utilised longitudinal data collected from a counselling training centre at a major U.S. university to compare client ratings of depression, anxiety and working alliance across 1) in-person services delivered (i.e. pre-pandemic) and 2) telehealth services delivered after the pandemic began (i.e. intra-pandemic) among the same group of clients. Results support our hypothesis that changes in clients' self-reports would be generally equivalent across in-person and telehealth services. Depression and anxiety symptoms decreased, and working alliance tended to increase during both in-person and telehealth care;however, these trends were only statistically significant during telehealth services. Limitations related to sample size (NÂ =Â 15 clients;up to 17 sessions per client) and low statistical power are discussed. Nonetheless, this study supports the growing body of literature supporting the efficacy of telehealth counselling services. We provide suggestions for future telehealth research and discuss implications for counsellor training.

"Elevated Anxiety and Depression Symptoms in Injured and Uninjured Adolescents","Introduction: Musculoskeletal injuries are common among adolescents with roughly half reporting an injury in the last year. Injury impairs function, but it may impact psychological or behavioral well-being as well. Mental health concerns such as anxiety and depression can negatively affect an adolescentâ€™s quality of life. As mental health disorders are being seen more frequently in the young population it is important to understand their relationship with injury. Athletes who are no longer able to participate in their normal activities due to injury may have elevated symptoms of anxiety and depression from this sudden lifestyle change. The purpose of this study was to determine if a musculoskeletal injury is associated with elevated anxiety and depression in adolescent athletes. Methods: Adolescents between the ages of 12-18 from sports medicine clinics presenting with musculoskeletal injuries were age and sex matched to non-injured adolescents from high school health and weight training classes as well as adolescent medicine clinics. The General Anxiety Disorder-7 and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 were used to assess for anxiety and depression symptoms, respectively. Scores of =5 on each questionnaire were considered elevated. Chi-Square analyses analyzed the differences in proportions of elevated anxiety and depression in the injured and uninjured participants. Results: Matched data was available for 108 participants, 54 in each group. Average age was 15.99Â± 1.58 and 83% were females. Overall, 41% reported elevated anxiety symptoms and 36% reported elevated depressive symptoms. There were no differences in the proportion of injured adolescents that had elevated anxiety or depression compared to uninjured adolescents (p=.386 and p=.071, respectively). Discussion: Elevated anxiety and depressive symptoms are common among injured and non-injured adolescents. High rates in our sample could be impacted by the predominance of female participants, as female are more likely to experience this symptomology than males. It is possible that the severity of the injury may influence anxiety and depression symptoms, which we did not assess. In addition, participants were enrolled during COVID-19, which may have influenced the rates of elevated anxiety and depression symptoms. Elevated anxiety and depressive symptoms are associated with high levels of functional impairment. Therefore, adolescents should be routinely assessed for anxiety and depression, regardless of injured status.","Young, Julie A.; Allison, Ellee, Mohr, Drew, Bonny, Andrea E.; Valasek, Amy E.; Onate, James A.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Elevated+Anxiety+and+Depression+Symptoms+in+Injured+and+Uninjured+Adolescents","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Orthopaedic journal of sports medicine; 10(5 suppl2), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-18","",32988,""
"The Detrimental Clinical Associations of Anxiety and Depression with Difficult Asthma Outcomes","Difficult asthma describes asthma in which comorbidities, inadequate treatment, suboptimal inhaler technique and/or poor adherence impede good asthma control. The association of anxiety and depression with difficult asthma outcomes (exacerbations, hospital admissions, asthma control, etc.) is unclear. This study assessed the clinical associations of anxiety and depression with difficult asthma outcomes in patients with a specialist diagnosis of difficult asthma. Using real-world data, we retrospectively phenotyped patients from the Wessex Asthma Cohort of Difficult Asthma (N = 441) using clinical diagnoses of anxiety and depression against those without anxiety or depression (controls). Additionally, we stratified patients by severity of psychological distress using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). We found that depression and/or anxiety were reported in 43.1% of subjects and were associated with worse disease-related questionnaire scores. Each psychological comorbidity group showed differential associations with difficult asthma outcomes. Anxiety alone (7.9%) was associated with dysfunctional breathing and more hospitalisations [anxiety, median (IQR): 0 (2) vs. controls: 0 (0)], while depression alone (11.6%) was associated with obesity and obstructive sleep apnoea. The dual anxiety and depression group (23.6%) displayed multimorbidity, worse asthma outcomes, female predominance and earlier asthma onset. Worse HADS-A scores in patients with anxiety were associated with worse subjective outcomes (questionnaire scores), while worse HADS-D scores in patients with depression were associated with worse objective (ICU admissions and maintenance oral corticosteroid requirements) and subjective outcomes. In conclusion, anxiety and depression are common in difficult asthma but exert differential detrimental effects. Difficult asthma patients with dual anxiety and depression experience worse asthma outcomes alongside worse measures of psychological distress. There is a severity-gradient association of HADS scores with worse difficult asthma outcomes. Collectively, our findings highlight the need for holistic, multidisciplinary approaches that promote early identification and management of anxiety and depression in difficult asthma patients.","Wei Chern Gavin, Fong, Rafiq, Ishmail, Harvey, Matthew, Stanescu, Sabina, Ainsworth, Ben, Varkonyi-Sepp, Judit, Mistry, Heena, Mohammed Aref, Kyyaly, Barber, Clair, Freeman, Anna, Wilkinson, Tom, Djukanovic, Ratko, Dennison, Paddy, Haitchi, Hans Michael, Kurukulaaratchy, Ramesh J.","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Detrimental+Clinical+Associations+of+Anxiety+and+Depression+with+Difficult+Asthma+Outcomes","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Personalized Medicine; 12(5):686, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-18","",32989,""
"COVID-19 and suicides in India: Where do we stand?","Introduction1 The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has ignited many debates and has undoubtedly shaken up the core foundations of the health-care system worldwide. There has been plenty of evidence that pandemic and the effects of lockdown have Studies have resulted in elevated levels of psychological symptoms such as depression, anxiety, phobia, trauma, etc. Concerning the COVID-19 outbreak (since late January 2020 in India), the first case that was reported in India is stated to be due to fear of being infected with COVID-19. Similarly, COVID-19 suicide occurrences were reported as of fear of infection, economic crisis and social boycott in Bangladesh and Pakistan, from the neighbouring countries of India. Though the report of the National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB) was released as last as Octoberâ€™21 this year, many of the incidents were reported by press and over social media platforms. The NCRB Statistics - 20202 A total of 1,53,052 suicides were reported in the country during 2020 showing an increase of 10.0% in comparison to 2019 & the rate of suicides has increased by 8.7% during 2020 over 2019. Majority of suicides were reported in Maharashtra (13.0%) followed by Tamil Nadu (11.0%), Madhya Pradesh (9.5%), West Bengal (8.6%) & Karnataka (8.0%). These 5 States together accounted for 50.1% of the total suicides reported in the country. Family Problems (33.6%) & Illness (18.0%)â€™ were the major causes of suicides. Drug Abuse/Addiction (6.0%), Marriage Related Issues(5.0%), Love Affairs (4.4%), Bankruptcy or Indebtedness (3.4%), Unemployment (2.3%), Failure in Examination (1.4%) & Poverty (1.2%) were other causes. Daily wage earners accounted for the maximum percentage (24.6%). Hangingâ€™ (57.8%), consuming â€˜Poisonâ€™ (25.0%), â€˜Drowningâ€™ (5.2%) and â€˜Fire/Self Immolationâ€™ (3.0%) were the prominent means/mode. Beyond the NCRB Statistics3 The NCRB report has some significant limitations. NCRB underestimates suicide rates due to under- reporting of cases & this data is usually made available after a significant delay of between 12 and 24 months. Furthermore, NCRB releases summary annual data rather than weekly or monthly data to analyse trends (Important during COVID19). NCRB does not keep any record of attempted suicides as well. Analysis of media reports reveals that the rates of suicide and attempted suicide between 24 March to 3 May 2020 compared to the same dates in 2019 showed a 67.7% increase in reported suicides and attempted suicides during the lockdown. More suicides & attempted suicides were by older employed men. Suicides increased in 2020 in states which traditionally have low suicide rates such as Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Haryana, and Chandigarh (also economically less developed & inadequate health infrastructure). There were 39 alcohol-related suicides & 7 attempted suicides as compared to no such suicide/ attempted suicide cases in 2019. Conclusion3 The possibility that the pandemic may have increased the risk of suicide as reflected from the media reports has been attested by the recently released NCRB data. However, both the reports are an underestimate of the true figures. The pandemic however has now provided an opportunity for cross- sectoral collaboration for suicide prevention rather than restricting suicide prevention to the health sector Symposium Proposal: Digital Phenotyping in Mental Health This symposium explores the emerging field of digital phenotyping in mental health. Despite developments, psychiatry heavily relies on patientsâ€™ interviews and self-reporting to match the diagnostic criteria of the ICD or DSM and is still handicapped by the lack of objective measurements for diagnosis and management. Smartphones and wearables, which have emerged as new tools for health investigation, generate many digital fingerprints that provide insights into human behavior. They collect data in naturalistic settings in-situ, leveraging the lived experiences of patients and no longer confined to clinics or research laboratories. However, such technology with revolutionary p tential is also associated with challenges and controversies. Various legal, ethical, and security issues concern digital phenotyping in mental health. The first presentation by Vijay Gogoi of LGBRIMH sets the scene for what follows1. He discusses the advent and concept of using digital devices and the Internet of Things (IoT) for personal sensing in the context of mental health. Terminologies like computational behavioral analysis, personal sensing, continuous measurement are being applied in similar research approaches. Hence, some researchers also view digital phenotyping as a variant of deep phenotyping, closely aligned with the goals of precision medicine and a new tool for the National Institute of Mental Healthâ€™s Research Domain Criteria. Dhrubajyoti Chetia of LGBRIMH then discusses the various research trends in mental health using digital devices2. The features studied as behavioral markers for social context, stress, sleep, mood, and clinical disorders like depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder will be discussed. Changes in location and activity patterns, keyboard interaction dynamics, voice modulation, social communication logs are used to predict depressive and manic states. Proactive screening in online environments and automatic natural language processing of social media posts have been used successfully to identify individuals with evidence of psychological distress. Signals from smartphones and clinical measurements may provide a safety net for patients at risk of self-harm or suicide. The challenges and limitations of using digital technology are highlighted by Sajjadur Rehman of Lady Hardinge Medical College3. Results are not comparable across studies because of varying data collection techniques and research designs. As most research is currently being carried out in small samples as proof of concept studies, replicating the same in a large population is a challenge. Variability from geographical location, characteristics of people, data types, environments, etc., is a barrier. With rapid technological advancements, and people changing their usage, machine learning algorithms are bound to become inaccurate. Finally, as health care professionals, the ethical and security concerns were discussed by Kunal Deb of LGBRIMH4. Accountability for safety and efficacy, usually assessed by government agencies, is still not well developed for digital health technologies. Strict data privacy and protection regulations also need to be in place. The use of various data streams may assist the third party in re-identifying individuals without their knowledge, with the potential impacts of mental health diagnosis and predictions on employment, insurance, litigation, and other contexts. 1.Vijay Gogoi, Associate Professor, Psychiatry, LGBRIMH, Tezpur, Assam 2.Dhrubajyoti Chetia, Associate Professor, LGBRIMH, Tezpur Assam. 3.Sajjadur Rehman, Assistant Professor, Psychiatry, Lady Hardinge Medical College, Delhi 4.Kunal Deb, Assistant Professor, Psychiatry, LGBRIMH, Tezpur, Assam.","Vijayakumar, Lakshmi, Sarkhel, Sujit, Mehta, Varun S.","https://www.google.com/search?q=COVID-19+and+suicides+in+India:+Where+do+we+stand?","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Indian journal of psychiatry; 64(Suppl 3):S648-S649, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-18","",32990,""
"â€œA Cross sectional Study correlating wellness and anxiety in Covid-19 pandemicâ€","BACKGROUND: An outbreak of a new coronavirus pneumonia occurred in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. According to a study, during this pandemic, the prevalence rate of depression was at 50.7%, generalized anxiety was at 44.7%, and insomnia 36.1%. Study from Spain, concluded that psychological well-being is key for confronting COVID-19 and preventing mental disorders and coping with emotions. Thus, the extent to which wellbeing makes a difference in anxiety towards COVID-19 has not been explored so far, as per our knowledge. AIMS: 1. To assess the prevalence of corona virus anxiety and wellbeing in Covid-19 pandemic 2. To assess the relation between corona virus anxiety and wellbeing in COVID-19 patients and general population. METHOD: There is total 345 patients, 54 were COVID positive and 291 COVID negative, were assessed after taking informed consent, 2 scales were used, the HERO wellness scale and Corona virus anxiety scale. RESULTS: 1. Significant difference of mean CAS scale scores between COVID positive and negative. 2. Significant difference of mean HERO scale scores between male and female but not in CAS scale. 3. CAS scale score was found to have significantly negative correlation with happy, enthusiastic, resilient and mental wellbeing but not with optimism.

"Psychiatric and Neuropsychiatric issues in persons with COVID-19 infection: A case-control online study from India â€“ NEOREALIST STUDY","Background: Few studies across the globe have evaluated the adverse mental health consequences of COVID-19, in patients who suffered from COVID-19 infection. However, a comparative study of persons who suffered from COVID-19 and those who witnessed the COVID-19 infection in their 1 st degree relative/s is lacking. Aims & Objectives: This study aims to compare the psychiatric morbidity in persons who suffered from COVID-19 infections, and those who witnessed the illness in one of their first degree relative/s. Methods: In this cross-sectional online survey, 2964 adult participants completed the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCS-19), Brief Resilient Coping Scale (BRCS), The Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) and a self-designed questionnaire to evaluate Neuropsychiatric issues. Results- Mean PHQ-9, GAD-7 and FCS-19 were significantly higher in those who themselves suffered from COVID-19 as compared to those who witnessed the infection in their 1 st degree relative (7.41 Â± 7.09 vs 6.56 Â± 6.15;p&lt;0.0001;5.58 Â± 6.59 vs 5.10 Â± 5.97;p=0.001;11.32Â±6.45 vs 10.48Â±6.12;p=0.001 respectively). However, BRS coping score was not significantly different between both the groups. Overall, about 1/3 rd of the participants who developed COVID-19 infection had depression and one-third had anxiety disorders. One-fifth of the participants reported high fear, PTSD and OCD symptoms, while 1/6 th reported other neuropsychiatric manifestations. Conclusion: Patients who suffered from COVID-19 had higher prevalence of PHQ-9, GAD-7 and FCS-19 as compared to those to witnessed COVID-19 in relatives but with similar BRCS.","Vaishnav, Mrugesh, Grover, Sandeep, Vaishnav, Parth, Sharma, Kamal, Avasthi, Ajit","https://www.google.com/search?q=Psychiatric+and+Neuropsychiatric+issues+in+persons+with+COVID-19+infection:+A+case-control+online+study+from+India+â€“+NEOREALIST+STUDY","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Indian journal of psychiatry; 64(Suppl 3):S512-S512, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-18","",32992,""
"Mental health following an initial period of COVID-19 restrictions: findings from a cross-sectional survey in the Republic of Ireland [version 1;peer review: 2 approved]","Background: We assessed the mental health of individuals in the general population, during an initial period of easing of COVID-19 restrictions in the Republic of Ireland (RoI). Methods: Data were collected through a nationally representative cross-sectional telephone survey, during the first period of easing of restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic between May and July 2020. Mental health was examined using the Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety Depression Scale. Poisson regression analyses were conducted to estimate risk ratios with robust variance estimation of the association between selected demographic factors and the risk of having depression and anxiety symptoms. Results: Of the 1,983 participants, 27.7% (n = 549;95% CI: 0.26 - 0.30) reported depression and anxiety symptoms, while 74 (3.8%;95% CI: 0.03 - 0.05) disclosed self-harm and/or suicidal thoughts. Females (RR: 1.60, 95% CI: 1.37 - 1.87, p &lt; 0.0005), employed individuals who experienced a change in work status (RR: 1.50, 95% CI: 1.24 - 1.82, p &lt; 0.0005), participants cocooning due to a health condition (RR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.08 - 1.66, p&lt; 0.01), participants who were self-isolating (RR: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.03 - 1.51, p=0.025) and moderate-heavy drinkers (RR: 1.27, 95% CI: 1.09 - 1.47, p&lt;0.01) were at increased risk of depression and anxiety. Young people aged 18-29 years and those in the two lowest income categories were most likely to report self-harm and/or suicidal thoughts. Conclusion: As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, with further waves and associated restrictions, the impact on mental health in the population as a whole and in specific subgroups must be considered.

"Pancreatic Stone Protein as a Biomarker for Sepsis at the Emergency Department of a Large Tertiary Hospital","Early recognition of sepsis is essential for improving outcomes and preventing complications such as organ failure, depression, and neurocognitive impairment. The emergency department (ED) plays a key role in the early identification of sepsis, but clinicians lack diagnostic tools. Potentially, biomarkers could be helpful in assisting clinicians in the ED, but no marker has yet been successfully implemented in daily practice with good clinical performance. Pancreatic stone protein (PSP) is a promising biomarker in the context of sepsis, but little is known about the diagnostic performance of PSP in the ED. We prospectively investigated the diagnostic value of PSP in such a population for patients suspected of infection. PSP was compared with currently used biomarkers, including white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Of the 156 patients included in this study, 74 (47.4%) were diagnosed with uncomplicated infection and 26 (16.7%) patients with sepsis, while 56 (35.9%) eventually had no infection. PSP was significantly higher for sepsis patients compared to patients with no sepsis. In multivariate regression, PSP was a significant predictor for sepsis, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.69. Positive and negative predictive values for this model were 100% and 84.4%, respectively. Altogether, these findings show that PSP, measured at the ED of a tertiary hospital, is associated with sepsis but lacks the diagnostic performance to be used as single marker.","Titus, A.

"Anxiety and Depression in a Non-Clinical Sample of Young Polish Adults: Presence of Meaning in Life as a Mediator","Early adulthood, between 18 and 25, is viewed as a decisive period of life for the prevention and treatment of anxiety and depression. Although the topic of their mutual relationship is well-known, little has been uncovered about the mechanism underlying this connection. To understand the indirect pathways between anxiety and depression, we chose the sense of meaning of life as a mediator because peopleâ€™s beliefs that their lives are or can be purposeful may protect against depression. The sample was composed of 277 Polish young adults. A small majority of the participants were women (58.8%). The mean age was M = 22.11 (SD = 1.72). We used in the research the Direct Behavior Rating-Scale Items Scale, the Meaning in Life Questionnaire, and the Brief Screen for Depression. Correlational analysis showed that, consistent with past findings, anxiety correlated positively with depression and searching for meaning. It was also negatively associated with presence of meaning. Moreover, depression was negatively linked to presence of meaning and positively with searching for meaning. Regression-based mediation analyses (PROCESS macro 3.4) proved that the relationship between anxiety and depression was mediated by presence of meaning in life, suggesting that having a sense of meaning may be a pathway by which feelings of tension relative to adverse events protect against depression.","Szczesniak, Malgorzata, Falewicz, Adam, Strochalska, Klaudia, Rybarski, Radoslaw","https://www.google.com/search?q=Anxiety+and+Depression+in+a+Non-Clinical+Sample+of+Young+Polish+Adults:+Presence+of+Meaning+in+Life+as+a+Mediator","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(10):6065, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-18","",32995,""
"Designing and conducting support groups","Aims: 1. To orient psychiatrists in understanding the increasing need of support groups for psychiatric disorders for various types of target populations. 2. To train psychiatrists to design and structure support groups addressing the different concerns. 3. To share tips on the practical logistical & social media aspects of conducting support groups in the Indian context. 4. To enhance skills of reaching out to individuals with mental illness and their caregivers. Outline: Support groups or self-help groups for mental health are one of the most common types of research based support available. While qualitative research shows positive evidence and quantitative research shows mixed evidence when it comes to showing favourable effects on the symptoms and the social functioning of patients(1), there is still inadequate effort directed towards researching about and running support groups given the mental health burden and the treatment gap observed in the Indian context. Unfortunately, the processes which impact the recovery processes involvement in self-help groups are not fully understood and hence it stands as one of the major hurdles in being recommended as part of treatment.(2) Researchers and mental health consumer advocates argue that the approach to recovery from mental illness should emphasize not just on the symptoms of the disorder but also on the â€˜life-contextâ€™ of these individuals.(3) Hence, recovery should be described not merely as some end-point, but a social-psychological process.(4) These trainer-facilitated but member governed groups provide social support and knowledge by interaction with peers probably experiencing similar symptoms and in many ways finding acceptance by their â€œownâ€. This important step provides cognitive changes that improve the quality of the stigmatized individualâ€™s life.(5) Peer services allow very high levels of acceptance and understanding which no other professional relationship could possibly reciprocate. (6) The covid pandemic has been mentally exhausting for majority people and has also exacerbated or worsened a lot of psychiatric disorders. During this time, although psychological help was available, it was remote or difficult for everyone to approach and the need for support groups has surfaced. Considering this need, many poorly directed online support groups have mushroomed. Unfortunately in India, there is a paucity of peer support service in providing mental health service to a large extent. Surprisingly, there is no provision of peer support in either government programs like the National Mental Program or the National Health Policy of India considering the fact that it will require a good level of funding and investment. (6) With this aspect in mind, this workshop would include training psychiatrists to design and conduct well-functioning and professionally supervised support groups. This workshop would include presentations, personal experiences of conducting support groups, oral discussions and group activities to empower psychiatrists to tap into this much needed resource for recovery of patients with mental illness. 1.

"Setting priorities for connections and activities during a pandemic","This paper will describe and analyze restrictions on connection and interaction (i.e., social distancing) during the first pandemic in a century. During a pandemic, decision makers are required to make difficult decisions with incomplete information, under high levels of uncertainty, public scrutiny and urgency. Many critical and far-reaching priority setting decisions have occurred outside the health sector, for instance the closing of schools or restrictions on businesses or transportation. These decisions, like decisions about allocating vaccine or hospital care, involve the allocation of some budgetary and human resources. However, more so than in healthcare, they also explicitly involve the allocation of burdens or costs, from both limits on movement and, for instance for service workers, greater exposure to infection. These decisions, like those about allocating healthcare resources, have critical consequences for health. Households suffer job losses and reduced income;children miss school;many, especially those residing in institutions, suffer social isolationâ€”outcomes which have been associated with declines in physical and mental health. These burdens of restrictions on movement and connection and consequent health outcomes may be unevenly distributed and exacerbate existing health inequities. Fair decision making about priorities for connection and interaction is as crucial as fair decision making about allocating intensive care and vaccine. The application of priority setting methods and principles, however, has focused on healthcare and not on other policy actions that can profoundly influence health. This paper presents an analysis of restrictive measures introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic, what we have learned, so far, about the consequences of those restrictions, and makes recommendations for the development and application of priority setting frameworks in this arena to inform future research and practice.","Susan Dorr, Goold, Jaffe, Kate, Bernardo Aguilera, Dreyse, Godfrey, Biemba, Danis, Marion, Williams, Lestyn","https://www.google.com/search?q=Setting+priorities+for+connections+and+activities+during+a+pandemic","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: BMJ Global Health; 7(Suppl 2):A37-A38, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-18","",32997,""
"Mental Health Impact of COVID-19 Lockdown and its relationship with the Resilience among Undergraduate Health Sciences Students","Background â€¢ Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a rapidly evolving as well as a psychologically distressful situation. â€¢ Undergraduate (UG) Health sciences students (HSSs) are prone to depression, anxiety, and stress during such pandemic period due to the negative impact of COVID-19 lockdown on their academics. Aim â€¢ To assess the mental health impact of COVID-19 lockdown and its relationship with the resilience among undergraduate health sciences students. Method â€¢ Data were collected from undergraduate health sciences students by using Depression, Anxiety, and Stress scale â€“ 21 item (DASS -21) which was used to assess mental health impact of COVID-19 and the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) which was used to assess the level of Resilience among study participants. â€¢ Data were analyzed by using SPSS 15, Chi-square, Fisher exact and Pearsonâ€™s correlation tests. Results â€¢ The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress were 7.6%, 6.3%, and 1.0% respectively. â€¢ As regards resilience, 1.3%, 56.7%, and 42.0% had high, normal, and low levels respectively. â€¢ Those study participants with high resilience had lower rates depression, anxiety, and stress as the psychological impact of COVID-19 lockdown. Conclusion â€¢ Resilience acts as a protective factor against depression, anxiety, and stress due to COVID-19 lockdown. â€¢ Hence, programs to strengthen the resilience among undergraduate health sciences students must be the priority which can have preventing value during stressful period of pandemics.","Sureshrao Ghogare*, Ajinkya, Wasudeorao Bele, Ashish","https://www.google.com/search?q=Mental+Health+Impact+of+COVID-19+Lockdown+and+its+relationship+with+the+Resilience+among+Undergraduate+Health+Sciences+Students","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Indian journal of psychiatry; 64(Suppl 3):S694-S694, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-18","",32998,""
"Effects of Smartphone Overdependence and the Quality of Friendship on Depression among High School Students","This study analyzes the effects of smartphone overdependence and the quality of friendship on depression among high school students in Korea. The study subjects were 121 high school students. Smartphone overdependence was assessed using the smartphone overdependence scale for adolescents, depression was assessed using the Korean version of the patient health questionnaire-9, and the quality of friendship was assessed using the friendship quality questionnaire. The results of the correlation analysis showed statistically significant differences among all the variables. The results of the multiple linear regression analysis showed that smartphone overdependence increases the depression level, whereas the quality of friendship lowers it. To decrease depression among high school students, smartphone overdependence and the quality of friendship should be managed appropriately. Moreover, the causal relationships and mediating effects between smartphone overdependence and the quality of friendship should be analyzed.","Sung-min, Son, Byoung-jin, Jeon","https://www.google.com/search?q=Effects+of+Smartphone+Overdependence+and+the+Quality+of+Friendship+on+Depression+among+High+School+Students","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Occupational Therapy International; 2022, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-18","",32999,""
"Understanding and accepting the â€œNew Normalâ€ in Children and Adolescents","Aim: 1. To revisit â€œnormalcyâ€ as we understood. 2. To understand digital natives and their norms. 3. To explore the impact of the pandemic on the above. Outline: The pandemic was a challenging time for everyone which had an effect on everyday life of multiple individuals. However, the trajectory of the psychological, social and cultural development of the developing minds took a completely different turn. The additional screen use was somewhat inevitable because everything right from personal life to education turned online but on the same hand the prevalence of problematic screentime including social media and gaming increased exponentially. (1) Youth with anxiety, depression, psychotic illness and neurodevelopmental disorders were especially vulnerable to worsening or re-emergence of their symptoms in the times of changing uncertainties. (2) Along with contact restrictions and isolation, there was increased report of parental mental illness, domestic violence and child maltreatment which had a direct effect on the development of the childrenâ€™s minds. (3) Although there is lack of significant evidence, increased incidence of cases of gender dysphoria and confused sexuality has been noticed due to decreased social exploration and increased exposure to online content in this regard. There are a myriad of changes which has happened in the past two decades because of advent of technology which are both positive and negative, but this Pandemic has amplified both. This workshop will consist of presentations, oral discussions and group activities to understand these changing trends in the development of young minds during the pandemic. References 1.

"Tele-mental Healthcare as the â€œNew Normalâ€: Revisiting the Nuances","The COVID-19 pandemic has seen a significant rise in the demand for mental health services. Technology advancement and pandemic restrictions have revolutionised the mental health field with mental health professionals adapting and shifting towards online platforms. Recent research suggests that online therapy can be as effective as in-person therapy for various mental health conditions. Online psychotherapy isnâ€™t a new practice, rather it has been used during pre-covid times with caution. Several studies have proven the effectiveness of telemental health indicating that both clients and providers who use telehealth generally view it favourably. Online psychotherapy and telemedicine could be more approachable, convenient while increasing access to out-of-state professionals. Online therapy and tele-consultation have its strengths as well as challenges including flexibility in scheduling, convenience, saving time from commuting to and from appointments, enhancing vulnerability and disclosure. However, it has its own set of challenges and ethical concerns, particularly revolving around privacy and confidentiality in the digital space. This symposium will highlight the strengths and challenges of telemental health based on empirical researches and personal experiences of psychotherapists and psychiatrists. With increasing onus over the providers, it becomes important to discuss and address the new demands. It will enable the mental health practitioners to be more equipped and competent to continue offering telehealth as demand for mental health services grows, particularly services offered virtually. Finally, the symposium glances at the future of tele mental healthcare in the light of the recent guidelines and what it possibly holds for service providers.

"Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Availability and Utilization Of Mental Health Services: Findings of a Multi-Centric Study","Aims: To explore the availability, access and utilization of mental health services during COVID-19 pandemic restrictions (1st wave) in patients registered at psychiatry facilities across India and to assess difficulties faced by caregivers of these patients. Methodology: It was a multi-centric study carried at 4 centres across India, providing mental health services. It used convenience sampling method, wherein we recruited a total of 500 subjects from all centres over a period of 6 months using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. A semi structured performa to explore the availability, access and utilization of mental health services and difficulties faced by caregivers during COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Of the 500 subjects recruited, 54.6 % were males, 80.4% were Hindus and 56% were from rural areas. The subjects reported that 75.3% had problems accessing the mental health services, owing to closure of OPD services (83.2%), non-availability of doctors (63.5%), poor availability of transport (61.9%). It was reported that 16.3% changed their psychiatrist and had to contact GPs (16.5%), their illness worsened in 66.1% of the cases, 68.8% faced difficulties in availing psychotropic medications. The caregivers of these subjects reported that 80.3% of them faced difficulties during lockdown which was attributed to non-availability of doctors (67.5%) and medication (33.6%). Discussion: This sub-sample of registered OPD patients at 4 treatment facilities across India, showed that three fourth of subjects had problems accessing OPD, which was largely due to closure of routine OPDs and non-availability of doctors as well as transport facilities due to pan India lockdown. One sixth of patients had to change their psychiatrist and resort to GPs for consultation.

"A Prospective study on Delirium in covid 19","Background: Victoria hospital a specialized COVID center in Bangalore saw more than 10,000 patients with COVID-19 infection who have been admitted. Most of them were moderate to severely or critically ill patients who are at risk of developing acute brain dysfunction (delirium). Neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2 and its neurological manifestations have now been confirmed. Hence to find the prevalence, risk factors for developing delirium in patients admitted with COVID-19 infection, was the objective of this research work. Methodology: The study includes 10,200 covid infected patient who were admitted to Victoria hospital, from June 2020 to June 2021. Among them 550 cases were found to have neuropsychiatric symptoms. Patients who were on life support, prisoners, patients were with pre-existing Psychiatric illness, neurodegenerative disorders, congenital or acquired brain damage, hepatic coma, drug dependence (Except ADS and NDS), suicide attempt were excluded. Patients who were blind or deaf were also excluded. Patient demographics, delirium assessments, and management strategies were noted and entered in Microsoft Excel sheets. The outcome was to determine the prevalence of delirium and to find any associated risk factors for delirium the next day. Results: Delirium was diagnosed in 106 patients.The mean age of patients was 60 years. 68 % were males & 32 % were females. 80 % of them had medical history, 10 % had past history of Alcohol dependence. 40 % of cases were treated in ICU& 32 % of them were treated on Invasive mechanical ventilation (Ventilators). On investigations, inflammatory markers raised in almost all (C- reactive protein 100 %, D-dimmer 64% and Serum ferritin 69 %). Treatment given was Steroids (Dexamethasone IV) in 100%, Remdesivir in 85 %, Iv antibiotics (Cephalosporin) in 100 %. For Symptomatic delirium treatment Injection Haloperidol IV 1.5 mg to 5mg thrice per day to once daily in 98% cases, some received Quetiapine 12.5 mg to 100mg /day in 5% or Tab Olanzapine 2.5 mg to 10 mg per day in 9% cases. Delirium Mortality rate was 45 % and recovery rate was 55 %. Conclusions: Severe SARS-CoV2 infection may be associated with COVID-19 delirium. High mortality, (more than 50 %) is found in covid delirium patients. Hypoxia could be the main reason for delirium in Covid 19.

"Transcranial Photobiomodulation Therapy for Sexual Dysfunction Associated with Depression or Induced by Antidepressant Medications","Sexual dysfunction (SD) is frequently encountered in patients suffering from depression. There is a bidirectional relationship between various types of SD and depression, so the presence or treatment of one condition may exacerbate or improve the other condition. The most frequent sexual problem in untreated depressed patients is declining sexual desire, while in treated depressed patients it is difficulties with erection/ejaculation and with orgasm. Numerous classes of neuropsychiatric medications, commonly used in depressed patientsâ€”such as antidepressant, antipsychotic, alpha sympathetic, and opioid drugsâ€”may cause SD. Photobiomodulation (PBM) therapy, also called low-level light/laser therapy, is a novel neuromodulation technique for neuropsychiatric conditions, such as depression. Transcranial PBM (tPBM) targets the cellular metabolismâ€”through the mitochondrial respiratory enzyme, cytochrome c oxidaseâ€”and has numerous cellular and physiological beneficial effects on the central nervous system. This paper represents a comprehensive review of the application of tPBM to SD, coexisting with depression or induced by antidepressant medications.","Salehpour, Farzad, Khademi, Mahsa, Vahedifard, Farzan, Cassano, Paolo","https://www.google.com/search?q=Transcranial+Photobiomodulation+Therapy+for+Sexual+Dysfunction+Associated+with+Depression+or+Induced+by+Antidepressant+Medications","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Photonics; 9(5):330, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-18","",33012,""

"Impact of COVID 19 on the mental health of children and adolescents","The COVID 19 pandemic has affected everyone in one form or the other. Children and adolescents seem to be a vulnerable group considering their critical period of development. The pandemic has affected their daily routines. High rates of depression, anxiety and stress reaction has been observed in children and adolescents during the pandemic. Containment measures including closure of schools, isolation and restriction of outdoor activities have impacted their day to day activities. This can additionally lead to difficulties with social development and may in turn contribute to onset of various metal health issues in this age group. Besides onset of new symptoms, children already having mental health issues including psychiatric disorders and neuro developmental disorders may experience an exacerbation of pre-existing symptoms. Disruption of services including medical services, special schools and rehabilitation services also poses one of the major challenges. Witnessing the death of either parent, relatives or both parents to COVID is quite stressful and one of the major psychosocial issues which hasnâ€™t been adequately addressed. This can further lead to mental health issues along with various economic and logistic issues including employment, homelessness, migration and poverty.Addressing these issues includes inter-sectoral coordination and there is pressing need to focus on mental health issues of children and adolescents in a more holistic manner.

"Treatment Adherence in Adolescents With Histories of Adverse Childhood Experiences: A Systematic Review","Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are associated with poor treatment adherence and worse health outcomes among adults, but evidence among adolescents is less clear. The current systematic review identified and synthesized results from studies examining associations between ACEs and treatment adherence among adolescents. An expert medical librarian conducted searches in seven databases. Results were analyzed using a narrative synthesis framework. A total of six studies were eligible for review. Assessment strategies for ACEs and treatment adherence varied across studies. Most studies assessed for histories of maltreatment and neglect. Treatment adherence was most often defined as some form of attendance in a treatment program. Results support a relationship between ACEs and treatment nonadherence in adolescents. ACEs related to maltreatment, particularly emotional abuse, may be more predictive of treatment nonadherence than other types of ACEs. Specific qualities of ACEs (e.g., timing, intensity, frequency) may influence the relationship between ACEs and treatment nonadherence.

"A Web-Based Escape Room to Raise Awareness About Severe Mental Illness Among University Students: Randomized Controlled Trial","Background: People with severe mental illness (SMI) face discriminatory situations because of prejudice toward them, even among health care personnel. Escape rooms can be a novel educational strategy for learning about and empathizing with SMI, thus reducing stigma among health care students. Objective: This study aimed to examine the effect of the Without Memories escape room on nursing studentsâ€™ stigma against SMI. Methods: A pre- and postintervention study was conducted with a control group and an experimental group. A total of 306 students from 2 Andalusian universities participated in the study. Data were collected through a pre-post study questionnaire, consisting of an adapted version of the Attributional Style Questionnaire and a questionnaire on motivation for cooperative playful learning strategies. The control group carried out an escape room scenario without sensitizing content, whereas the experimental group carried out an escape room scenario on SMI, with both escape rooms being carried out in a 1-hour session of subjects related to mental health. To answer the research questions, a 2-way analysis of variance with repeated measures, a linear regression, and a 2-way analysis of variance were performed. Results: After the intervention, a significant reduction (P&lt;.001) was observed in the experimental group in stigmatizing attitudes compared with the control group, in which no statistically significant changes (P&gt;.05) were observed. In contrast, the linear regression (t195=-22.15;P&lt;.001) showed that there was an inverse relationship between flow and the level of reduced stigma. When controlling for having or not having a close relative, the intervention was also shown to be effective (P&lt;.001) in reducing the stigma displayed, both for people with affected and unaffected relatives. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the Without Memories escape room can be used as an effective tool to educate and raise awareness about stigmatizing attitudes toward SMI in university students studying health care. Future testing of the effectiveness of educational escape rooms should be designed with new programs through playful strategies of longer duration to evaluate whether they can achieve a greater impact on motivation, acquisition of knowledge, and awareness. In addition, the feasibility of implementing the Without Memories escape room in other careers related to health and community should be investigated.","Rodriguez-Ferrer, Jose M.; Manzano-LeÃ³n, Ana, Cangas, Adolfo J.; Aguilar-Parra, Jose M.","https://www.google.com/search?q=A+Web-Based+Escape+Room+to+Raise+Awareness+About+Severe+Mental+Illness+Among+University+Students:+Randomized+Controlled+Trial","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: JMIR Serious Games; 10(2), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-18","",33016,""

Method: cross-sectional study was conducted with pediatric nurses at the Instituto da CrianÃ§a e do Adolescente based on online self-rated survey about clinical practice and mental health impact during COVID-19 pandemic. Validated self-reported scales for anxiety, depression and burnout were used for assessing these professionals. Results: 107/298 (36%) nurses answered, 90% were female, median age was 41(23-64) years, 68% worked with adolescents, 66% in frontline. Burnout, anxiety and moderate/severe depression occurred in 65%, 72% and 74%, respectively. Lack of standardized treatment protocol for nurses (27%vs.10%, p=0.049), moderate/severe depression (74% vs. 16%, p=0.002) and burnout (82% vs. 58%, p=0.01) were significantly higher in pediatric nurses with anxiety compared to those without. Pediatric nurses that worked with adolescents compared to those that did not showed higher frequency of burnout in the former group (77% vs. 32%, p=0.0001). Multivariable analysis revealed that adequate quarantine adherence increased the presence of anxiety in 4.6 times [OR4.6(CI 1.1-20.2), p=0.04].

"The Effect of Employee-Oriented Flexible Work on Mental Health: A Systematic Review","The effect of flexible work on mental health is not well known. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the effects of employee-oriented flexible work on mental health problems and associated disability. Literature searches were conducted in the PubMed, Scopus, Web of Sciences, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, ProQuest and EconPapers databases from their inception through October-November 2020. Sixteen studies on the associations of worktime control, working from home, or flexible working arrangements with mental health related outcomes were included in the review: one cluster randomized controlled trial, two non-randomized controlled trials, two cross-over studies, and 11 prospective cohort studies. Three reviewers independently assessed the met-hodological quality of the included studies and extracted the data. The included studies differed in design, intervention/exposure, and outcome, so meta-analysis was not carried out and qualitative results were reported. A few prospective cohort studies found that low employeesâ€™ control over worktime increases the risk of depressive symptoms, psychological distress, burnout, and accumulated fatigue. One cross-over and a few cohort studies found small beneficial effects of working partly from home on depressive symptoms, stress, and emotional exhaustion. A small number of controlled trials, cross-over or cohort studies found that flexible working arrangements increase employeesâ€™ control over working hours, but have only modest beneficial effects on psychological distress, burnout, and emotional exhaustion. This systematic review suggests that employee-oriented flexible work may have small beneficial effects on mental health. However, randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies are needed to identify the health effects of flexible work.","Rahman, Shiri, Turunen, Jarno, Kausto, Johanna, Leino-Arjas, PÃ¤ivi, Varje, Pekka, VÃ¤Ã¤nÃ¤nen, Ari, Ervasti, Jenni","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Effect+of+Employee-Oriented+Flexible+Work+on+Mental+Health:+A+Systematic+Review","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Healthcare; 10(5):883, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-06-18","",33020,""

In order to prevent the infection, government implemented lockdown, which extensively restricted the public life. Quarantine, Lockdown and lack of proper treatment guidelines created many psychological and behavioral issues among the people especially children. Many children complained of depression, panic disorder and PTSD like symptoms and school drop outs were also increased in the current pandemic. Unexplained somatic complaints, poor social communication, Irregular sleep patterns and nocturnal enuresis are the alarming signals for psychological and behavioural issues among the children.

"Certification in psychiatry: Designing evidence based and organizationally relevant management proformas and protocols","IPS PERINATAL PSYCHIATRY TASK FORCE SYMPOSIUM ANCIPS 2022: Prescribing Psychotropics In Pregnancy And Lactation The management of mental health problems during pregnancy and the postnatal period differs from disorders occurring at other times.The impact of the mental illness and treatment thereof is on the mother, the child and the family. 1 in 5 women experience some form of perinatal mental illness Only 50% are diagnosed 15% have depression ,anxiety disorders. Severe mental illness can be 2 to 3 per 1000 Postpartum psychosis can be 1 to 2 in 1000 COVID times has seen an increase in depression and anxiety in the perinatal period(Wang 2020,Wu 2020) Psychosis can re-emerge or be exacerbated during pregnancy and the postnatal period. Although response to treatment is good, these problems frequently go unrecognized and untreated in pregnancy and the postnatal period. Psychiatric relapse in the setting of medication discontinuation for pregnancy is extremely common. Hence an appropriate treatment plan for psychiatric disorders during pregnancy and lactaction needs to be individualized and protocolised. Domestic violence during the perinatal period is recognised as major public health issues (Buist et al. 2005) and are associated with poor outcomes for women and their children and partners(Murray et al. 2003).It also contributes to increased risk of mental illness in pregnancy and lactation Intervention studies indicate that mental health problems during the perinatal period can be minimised if women and families engage in appropriate service (Armstrong et al. 2002;Kemp et al. 2011;Shaw et al. 2006). However concerns with regards to knowledge gaps and safety issues in prescribing psychotropic medication exist. This symposium by the Perinatal Psychiatry Task Force will address the important area of perinatal psychiatry ie prescribing of psychotropics in pregnancy and lactaction.The format will be discussion of the same with illustrative cases.
