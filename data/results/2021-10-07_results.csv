"Loneliness in older adult mental health services during the COVID-19 pandemic and before: Associations with disability, functioning and pharmacotherapy","Loneliness is associated with psychiatric morbidity. Restrictions placed on the population during the first COVID-19 lockdown may have disproportionately affected older adults, possibly through increasing loneliness. We sought to investigate this by examining loneliness in referrals to mental health of older adults (MHOA) services during the first UK COVID-19 lockdown. Referrals to MHOA services from a large South London catchment area were identified for the 16-week period of the UK lockdown starting in March 2020, and for the corresponding period in 2019. A natural language processing algorithm identified loneliness in the patients' records. We applied logistic regression models adjusted for age, gender, ethnicity and diagnosis, to examine associations of loneliness in the study population. 1,991 referrals were identified, 56.9% of whom were female, with a mean age of 77.9 years. Only 26.9% occurred during the 2020 lockdown, but with a higher prevalence of loneliness (22.0 vs. 17.7%, p = 0.028). In the whole sample, loneliness was associated with non-accidental self-injury (Odds ratio (OR): 1.65), depressed mood (OR: 1.73), psychotic symptoms (OR: 1.65), relationship problems (OR: 1.49), problems with daytime activities (OR: 1.36), and antidepressant use (OR: 2.11). During lockdown, loneliness was associated with non-accidental self-injury (OR: 2.52), problem drinking or drug-taking (OR 2.33), and antidepressant use (OR 2.10). Loneliness is associated with more severe symptoms of affective illness, worse functional problems and increased use of antidepressant medication in older adults. During lockdown loneliness in referrals to MHOA services increased, and was associated with increased risk-taking behaviour. Loneliness is a potential modifiable risk factor for mental illness, and efforts to minimise it in older adults should be prioritised as we emerge from the pandemic.

"Depresssion, Anxiety and Other Cognitive Consequences of Social Isolation: drug and non-drug treatments","During the COVID-19 pandemic, quarantine and staying at home is advised. The social relationship between people has become deficient, and human social isolation (SI) has become the consequence of this situation. It was shown that SI has made changes in hippocampal neuroplasticity, which will lead to poor cognitive function and behavioral abnormalities. There is a connection between SI, learning, and memory impairments. In addition, anxiety-like behavior and increased aggressive mood in long-term isolation have been revealed during the COVID-19 outbreak. Term searches was done in Google Scholar, Scopus, ScienceDirect, Web of Science and PubMed databases as well as hand searching in key resource journals from 1979-2020. Studies have shown that some drug administrations may positively affect or even prevent social isolation consequences in animal models. These drug treatments have included opioid drugs, anti-depressants, Antioxidants, and herbal medications. In addition to drug interventions, there are non-drug treatments that include an enriched environment, regular exercise, and music. This manuscript aims to review improved cognitive impairments induced by SI during COVID-19.","Taheri Zadeh, Rahmani, Alidadi, Joushi, Esmaeilpour","https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14949","20211006","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Drug Treatments; Learning and Memory; Non-drug Treatments; Social Isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-07","",18611,""
"Social isolation and its impact on child and adolescent development: a systematic review","This study aims to analyze the effects of social isolation on children's and teenagers' development, with emphasis on the possible impacts over their physical and mental health. Review of the literature following the standards of PRISMA using the SciELO, LILACS and PubMed databases. The following key-words were used: ""social isolation"" and ""child development"", ""quarantine"" and ""adolescent development"" according to the Medical Subject Headings (MESH) and their translation to the Portuguese. Studies in English, Portuguese and Spanish from inception were included. 519 studies were screened and 12 were included in the systematic review. Five of those focused the psychology and social issues, two of them the effects of pandemics on these issues; four studies reported on impacts on general health and two consequences over the hypothalamus- hypophysis - adrenal axis and the cognitive and social development. The review shows a strong association between social isolation and anxiety and depression in children and adolescents. Social isolation leads to higher levels of cortisol and worse cognitive development. Therefore, the mental and physical health of children and adolescents need a careful follow up by health professionals during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Almeida, Rego, Teixeira, Moreira","https://doi.org/10.1590/1984-0462/2022/40/2020385","20211006","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-07","",18612,""

Individuals living in Brazil answered an online questionnaire on their sociodemographic and behavioral aspects, emotional scale (DASS-21), Impact of Event Scale, and Pain Screener in Temporomandibular Disorders (TMD-Pain Screener) during June 2020. Descriptive statistical analyses and logistic and linear regressions were applied (5% significance). Overall, 2301 individuals were included, 89.1% practiced social isolation, 72.6% were employed/studying, at least 15% presented severe or extremely severe levels of emotional distress and presence of powerful (34.1%) and severe impact event (15%). During the outbreak, 53.2% perceived feeling worse and 31.8% reported that orofacial pain started or worsened after the pandemic outbreak. Gender was associated with ""social class"" (P=0.036), ""pain/stiffness in the jaw on awakening"" (P=0.037), ""change of pain during jaw habits"" (P=0.034) and ""perception of change in the situations mentioned in the TMD-Pain Screener"" (P=0.020), ""depression"" (P=0.012), ""anxiety"" (P=0.006) and ""impact of the event"" (P=8.3E-11). Social isolation had a lesser chance to change the routine, to be practiced by the unemployed/not studying, and to be practiced by men (all with P&lt;0.001). Associations were found between social class and all subscales of the DASS-21 and IES, all with P&lt;0.001. The practice of social isolation has social determinants.

"Coping in mental health during social isolation: analysis in light of Hildegard Peplau","to analyze the coping of individuals in social isolation due to suspicion or confirmation of coronavirus infection from the perspective of Hildegard Peplau's Theory of Interpersonal Relations. this is a qualitative, descriptive research, carried out with 34 individuals in social isolation due to suspicion or confirmation of coronavirus infection who passed through a screening tent of a university hospital in ParanÃƒÂ¡. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews in June and July 2020. Empirical categories were interpreted by content analysis. four categories emerged: Distance; Social and emotional support; Self-awareness and resolution; Learning. These categories established the coping strategies. individuals undergoing social isolation are more likely to present problems related to mental health.

"COVID-19 pandemic preparedness period through healthcare workers' eyes: A qualitative study from a Romanian healthcare facility","Healthcare providers represent a limited resource, and their mental health is crucial for patient care and for ensuring containment of the pandemics. We aimed to explore how healthcare workers experienced the preparedness period of COVID-19 pandemic, in order to ascertain the perceived weaknesses and strengths. Interviews were conducted with 17 participants encompassing senior physicians, residents, and nurses. They were audio-recorded, and the transcription was verbatim. We used thematic analysis. We identified four themes, with subsequent subthemes: dealing with the unknown, human versus doctors, sense of helplessness, and a bridge to heaven, which explore how healthcare workers experienced the lack of knowledge, their feeling of losing control, and how they managed their internal fights. The disappointment provoked by the authorities and their colleagues was further evaluated. We identified factors involved in their well-being. COVID-19 pandemic represented and will still pose a challenge for healthcare workers (HCWs) from all over the world. They felt unprepared for such a crisis. Further measures should be implemented in every hospital to maintain HCWs awareness and to prevent physical imbalance. Appropriate standards of care should be further stated by the authorities so that the healthcare providers may find easier a balance between their safety and their patients' needs. Conducting qualitative research involving HCWs during pandemic times may help in informing more significant policy decisions.","Stoichitoiu, Baicus","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0257381","20211006","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-07","",18615,""
"COVID-19 in lung transplant recipients-Risk prediction and outcomes","Patients after lung transplantation are at risk for life-threatening infections. Recently, several publications on COVID-19 outcomes in this patient population appeared, but knowledge on optimal treatment, mortality, outcomes, and appropriate risk predictors is limited. A retrospective analysis was performed in a German high-volume lung transplant center between 19th March 2020 and 18th May 2021. Impact of COVID-19 on physical and psychological health, clinical outcomes, and mortality were analyzed including follow-up visits up to 12 weeks after infection in survivors. Predictive parameters on survival were assessed using univariate and multivariate proportional hazards regression models. Out of 1,046 patients in follow-up, 31 acquired COVID-19 during the pandemic. 12 of 31 (39%) died and 26 (84%) were hospitalized. In survivors a significant decline in exercise capacity (p = 0.034), TLC (p = 0.02), and DLCO (p = 0.007) was observed at follow-up after 3 months. Anxiety, depression, and self-assessed quality of life remained stable. Charlson comorbidity index predicted mortality (HR 1.5, 1.1-2.2; p = 0.023). In recipients with pre-existing CLAD, mortality and clinical outcomes were inferior. However, pre-existing CLAD did not predict mortality. COVID-19 remains a life-threatening disease for lung transplant recipients, particularly in case comorbidities. Further studies on long term outcomes and impact on pre-existing CLAD are needed.","Kamp, Hinrichs, Fuge, Ewen, Gottlieb","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0257807","20211006","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-07","",18616,""
"The Impact of Social Media on College Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic: a Multinational Review of the Existing Literature","During the COVID-19 pandemic, both social media use and rates of anxiety and depression among college students have increased significantly. This begs the question, what is the relationship between social media use and college student mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic? Prior studies have found mixed results regarding the relationship between social media use and college student mental health. This relationship has become increasingly complex during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that excessive or problematic social media use during the COVID-19 pandemic was correlated with worse mental health outcomes that could be mitigated by dialectical thinking, optimism, mindfulness, and cognitive reappraisal. The COVID-19 pandemic acts as a moderator by strengthening the relationship between social media use and mental health. Future studies should consider the impact of social media on college student mental health and concentrate on intervention initiatives to ensure the psychological well-being of college students during a global pandemic outbreak.","Haddad, Macenski, Mosier-Mills, Hibara, Kester, Schneider, Conrad, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11920-021-01288-y","20211006","COVID-19; College students; Literature review; Mental health; Pandemic; Social media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-07","",18617,""
"Children's Psychological Reactions to the COVID-19 Pandemic","This paper reviews the literature on the psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on children and the reactions of vulnerable children. Research reveals increases in clinically significant depression, suicidal ideation and behavior, and some anxiety symptoms. Substance use studies suggest an inadvertent decrease in substance use in some youth though findings are inconsistent across substances and for males and females. Children with pre-existing emotional and behavioral problems are especially vulnerable though some children appear to improve in the context of public health measures which have decreased the stresses associated with school and socialization. In addition, children with pre-existing problems are likely to have established resources and relationships that may protect them relative to other children. COVID-19 has had a major effect on the mental health of children around the world, but findings should be considered preliminary until more rigorous research has been conducted.","Pfefferbaum","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11920-021-01289-x","20211006","COVID-19; Child disaster mental health; Disaster; Disaster reactions; Pandemic; Vulnerable children","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-07","",18618,""
"Balance and visual reliance in post-COVID syndrome patients assessed with a robotic system: a multi-sensory integration deficit","The symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection are not limited to the acute phase, with vertigo, peripheral neuropathies, headache, fatigue, memory loss, and depression being the most common post-acute clinical manifestations. Such post-COVID syndrome is a new clinically relevant challenge for diagnosis and therapy. Our goal was to quantify deficit in balance and proprioception related to post-COVID syndrome and, in this sense, we prospectively analyzed data of 66 post-COVID-19 outpatients (mean age 47.3Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°11.1Ã‚Â years, 50 females, 25 hospitalized), evaluated using the robotic device hunova. The dynamic balance was assessed with open (OE) and closed eyes (CE) and three indexes, proportional to subject instability, were measured: the sway path and two oscillation ranges. Hospitalized group showed the worst performance with respect to non-hospitalized patients and normality range in both visual conditions for the sway path and the oscillation ranges, with the worst performance being with CE. When compared to normality ranges, post-COVID patients were significantly more distant from normality in the OE condition compared to the CE condition. These results suggest that independently from the severity of the disease experienced, post-COVID syndrome makes the elastic balance test performances more distant from the normality when the subject integrates vision, somatosensory information, and vestibular information. In the absence of visual feedback, patients seem to implement compensatory strategies, presumably seeking more significant feedback from the lower limbs, which improve their performance. These data suggest a new mechanism of the post-COVID syndrome that deserves further investigation for its potential impact on activities of daily living.","Gervasoni, LoMauro, Ricci, Salce, Andreoli, Visconti, Pantoni","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10072-021-05647-8","20211006","Balance; Multi-sensory integration deficit; Post-COVID syndrome; Robotic system; SARS-CoV-2 infection","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-07","",18619,""
"Beam Me Out: Review of Emergency Department Telepsychiatry and Lessons Learned During COVID-19","The aim of this review is to critically evaluate recent literature on the use of telepsychiatry in emergency departments (EDTP) and synthesize the evidence on telepsychiatry during public health emergencies. We also report on experiences and success stories from a state-wide EDTP program in South Carolina during the COVID-19 pandemic. We identified 12 peer-reviewed articles published between January 2019 and February 2021 that evaluated EDTP interventions and their impact on patient outcomes. The recent evidence on EDTP shows a significant association between EDTP implementation or use and decreased patients' wait time in emergency department (ED), shorter length of stay in certain settings, reduced ED revisit rates, improved ED patient disposition (e.g., more discharge to home, less observational stays, and decreased inpatient admissions), and reduced follow-up encounters involving self-harm diagnosis. The EDTP virtual delivery model can help healthcare systems reduce burden of public health emergencies on providers, staff, and patients alike. While a disruption of magnitude seen by COVID-19 may be infrequent, strategies used during the pandemic may be implemented to enhance care in rural settings, and/or enhance preparedness of communities and healthcare systems during more commonly occurring natural disasters.","Natafgi, Childers, Pollak, Blackwell, Hardeman, Cooner, Bank, Ratliff, Gooch, Rogers, Narasimhan","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11920-021-01282-4","20211006","Emergency department; Emergency telepsychiatry; Mental health; Public health emergency; Telehealth; Telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-07","",18620,""
"Social Isolation Induces Neuroinflammation And Microglia Overactivation, While Dihydromyricetin Prevents And Improves Them","<b>Background:</b> Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent mental illnesses in the U.S. and are estimated to consume one-third of the country's mental health treatment cost. Although anxiolytic therapies are available, many patients still exhibit treatment-resistance, relapse, or substantial side effects. Further, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and stay-at-home order, social isolation, fear of the pandemic, and unprecedented times, the incidence of anxiety has dramatically increased. Previously, we have demonstrated dihydromyricetin (DHM), the major bioactive flavonoid extracted from <i>Ampelopsis grossedentata</i> , exhibits anxiolytic properties in a mouse model of social isolation-induced anxiety. Because GABAergic transmission modulates the immune system in addition to the inhibitory signal transmission, we investigated the effects of short-term social isolation on the neuroimmune system. <b>Methods:</b> Eight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were housed under absolute social isolation for 4 weeks. The anxiety like behaviors after DHM treatment were examined using elevated plus maze and open field behavioral tests. Gephyrin protein expression, microglial profile changes, NF-ÃŽÂºB pathway activation, cytokine level, and serum corticosterone were measured. <b>Results:</b> Socially isolated mice showed increased anxiety levels, reduced exploratory behaviors, and reduced gephyrin levels. Also, a dynamic alteration in hippocampal microglia were detected illustrated as a decline in microglia number and overactivation as determined by significant morphological changes including decreases in lacunarity, perimeter, and cell size and increase in cell density. Moreover, social isolation also induced an increase in serum corticosterone level and activation in NF-ÃŽÂºB pathway. Notably, DHM treatment counteracted these changes. <b>Conclusion:</b> The results suggest that social isolation contributes to neuroinflammation, while DHM has the ability to restore neuroinflammatory changes induced by anxiety.","Omran, Shao, Watanabe, Zhang, Zhang, Xue, Watanabe, Davies, Shao, Liang","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-923871/v1","20211006","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-07","",18621,""
"Depressive symptoms in higher education students during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic An examination of the association with various social risk factors across multiple high- and middle-income countries","Higher-education students face substantial risks for developing depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic or experiencing exacerbated pre-existing depressive symptoms. This study uses data from the COVID-19 International Student Well-Being Study, which collected data through a non-representative convenience sample in 125 higher-education institutions (HEI) across 26 high- and middle-income countries (N: 20,103) during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. It describes the prevalence of depressive symptoms in higher-education students. We find substantial cross-national variation in depressive symptoms, with lowest mean levels established in the Nordic countries and France, while highest mean levels of depressive symptoms were found in Turkey, South Africa, Spain and the USA. Elevated risk for depressive symptoms was found in female students, students with fewer social support resources and in a more disadvantaged socioeconomic position, and students with a migrant background. COVID-19 related stressors, such as reduced social contact, increased financial insecurity, and academic stress explained a relatively larger proportion of the variance in depressive symptoms compared to non-COVID-19 related stressors. This finding shows that not the pandemic itself, but rather the secondary effects of the pandemic relate to students' mental health. Our results enable HEIs to be better equipped to target groups that are particularly at risk during a pandemic.","Van de Velde, Buffel, van der Heijde, Ãƒâ€¡oksan, Bracke, Abel, Busse, Zeeb, Rabiee-Khan, Stathopoulou, Van Hal, Ladner, Tavolacci, Tholen, Wouters","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2021.100936","20211006","COVID-19; Depressive symptoms; Higher education students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-07","",18622,""
"Prospective COVID-19 related changes in physical activity and sedentary time and associations with symptoms of depression and anxiety","The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with psychological distress. Decreased moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and increased sedentary time may be exacerbating pandemic-related symptoms of anxiety and depression, but existing studies exploring these associations are almost entirely cross-sectional. Reported data from 2018 and Summer 2020 were used to create change categories based on compliance with MVPA guidelines and relative sedentary time. Participants completed the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4) in Summer 2020. Associations among changes in MVPA and sedentary time (separately and jointly) with psychological distress (total PHQ-4 score) were examined with ordinal logistic regression and associations with depressive or anxiety symptoms were examined with logistic regression. Among 2,240 participants (65% women, mean age 57.5 years), 67% increased sedentary time and 21% became inactive between the two time points. After multivariate adjustment, participants who became (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.71, 95% CI: 1.05-2.78) or remained inactive (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2.07, 1.34-3.22) were more likely to experience depressive symptoms compared to those who remained active. Participants who increased sedentary time were also more likely to experience depressive symptoms compared to those who maintained sedentary time (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.78, 1.13-2.81). Jointly, those who increased sedentary time while remaining (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 3.67, 1.83-7.38) or becoming inactive (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 3.02, 1.44-6.34) were much more likely to have depressive symptoms compared to the joint referent (remained active/maintained sedentary time). Associations with anxiety symptoms were not statistically significant. These findings support the value of promoting MVPA and limiting sedentary time during stressful events associated with psychological distress, like the COVID-19 pandemic.","Rees-Punia, Newton, Westmaas, Chantaprasopsuk, Patel, Leach","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mhpa.2021.100425","20211006","Coronavirus; Movement behaviors; Pandemic; Psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-07","",18623,""
"HIV and SARS-CoV-2 Co-Infection: What are the Risks?","The dramatic increase of the global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 infection represents a critical issue that needs to be investigated to evaluate the associated risk factors for acquisition and worse outcome. The interplay between immune activation and immune depression during SARS-CoV-2 infection is an intriguing topic that still needs to be clarified. The role of HIV in SARS-CoV-2 infection is not well defined. Chronic inflammation linked to HIV infection could be a driver for a worse prognosis in people living with HIV (PLWH). We explored the role of HIV as a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity and which factors contributed to a worse prognosis when HIV infection was present. PubMed/MEDLINE was searched for ""COVID-19"" or ""SARS-CoV2"" and ""HIV"" or ""AIDS"" and (""hospitalization"" or ""intensive care"" or ""mechanical ventilation"" or ""death"" OR ""mortality""), both in MeSH and as free text in all fields. Our review focused on 21 studies that enrolled at least 40 PLWH. In most studies, HIV infection did not represent a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection. On the contrary, the risk of severe COVID-19 and hospitalization was higher in PLWH. Low CD4 cell count consistently emerged as a risk factor for severe COVID-19. Comorbidities, either in people with or without HIV diagnosis, played a key role, especially because of their early development in PLWH.","Squillace, Ricci, Colella, Bonfanti","https://doi.org/10.2147/IDR.S277899","20211006","COVID-19; CoV-2; HIV; SARS","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-07","",18624,""
"PA during the COVID-19 outbreak in China: a cross-sectional study","COVID-19 has undergone several mutations and is still spreading in most countries now. PA has positive benefits in the prevention of COVID-19 infection and counteracting the negative physical and mental effects caused by COVID-19. However, relevant evidence has indicated a high prevalence of physical inactivity among the general population, which has worsened due to the outbreak of the pandemic, and there is a severe lack of exercise guidance and mitigation strategies to advance the knowledge and role of PA to improve physical and mental health in most countries during the epidemic. This study surveyed the effects of COVID-19 on PA in Chinese residents during the pandemic and provided important reference and evidence to inform policymakers and formulate policies and planning for health promotion and strengthening residents' PA during periods of public health emergencies. ANOVA, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, the chi-square test and Spearman correlation analysis were used for statistical analysis. A total of 14,715 participants were included. The results show that nearly 70% of Chinese residents had inadequate PA (95%CI 58.0%-82.19%) during the COVID-19 outbreak, which was more than double the global level (27.5%, 95%CI 25.0%-32.2%). The content, intensity, duration, and frequency of PA were all affected during the period of home isolation, and the types of PA may vary among different ages. The lack of physical facilities and cultural environment is the main factor affecting PA. However, there was no significant correlation between insufficient PA and the infection rate. During the period of home isolation and social distance of epidemic prevention, it is necessary to strengthen the scientific remote network monitoring and guidance for the process of PA in China.","Nie, Ma, Li, Wu, Liu, Tan, Li, Zhang, Lv, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00521-021-06538-x","20211006","COVID-19; Chinese residents; Health well-being; Home isolation; Influence; PA; PA guidance; Social distancing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-07","",18625,""
"The Role of Online Psychotherapy in COVID-19: An Evidence Based Clinical Review","COVID-19 is an infectious disease that is easily widespread and has clinical manifestations as mild, moderate, or severe disease. COVID-19 patients are required to be isolated during treatment to reduce transmission. This can cause anxiety and depression, which in turn worsens the patient's illness. Providing supportive psychotherapy can help provide a feeling of safety, comfort and calm for patients. The choice of method in providing supportive psychotherapy can be done online/teleconsultation or internet-based. This clinical review aims to determine the effect of online teleconsultation or internet-based psychotherapy on COVID-19 patients. A systematic search was performed using online databases, such as PubMed, Cochrane, EBSCO/CINAHL and ProQuest. The identified articles were screened using eligibility criteria. There were 2 studies (Zhou et al, and Wei et al) which were analyzed critically using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. Both studies showed that management of psychotherapy through teleconsultation or internet-based on COVID-19 patients can help relieve the patient's psychological symptoms. Zhou et al studied 63 suspected COVID-19 with 23.8% (n = 15) having a Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) score of 8 or more. There was a significant decrease in HADS-A nxiety (HADS-A) scores (p &lt;0.01) and HADS-Depression (HADS-D) scores (p &lt;0.01) in 15 patients, and from the overall HADS scores (p &lt; 0.01). Wei et al. Showed 17-HAMD and HAMA scores in the online psychological intervention group also showed a significant reduction in symptoms of depression and anxiety compared to controls. Psychotherapy through online teleconsultation or internet-based on COVID-19 patients can help relieve symptoms of anxiety and depression and teleconsultation and also effective in dealing with psychological complications in patients with COVID-19.","Shatri, Prabu, Tetrasiwi, Faisal, Putranto, Ismail","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Role+of+Online+Psychotherapy+in+COVID-19:+An+Evidence+Based+Clinical+Review.","20211006","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; online; teleconsultation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-07","",18626,""
"""It changed everything"": The safe Home care qualitative study of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on home care aides, clients, and managers","Home care (HC) services are crucial to the health and social wellbeing of older adults, people with disabilities, and the chronically ill. Although the HC sector is growing rapidly in the USA, there is high job turnover among the HC aide workforce. HC provides an important alternative to facility-based care, yet it has often been overlooked within the larger health care system: most recently, in COVID-19 pandemic planning. The objective of the study was to characterize qualitatively the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on three key HC stakeholders: clients, aides, and agency managers. The study included 37 phone interviews conducted during April - November 2020: HC clients (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°9), aides (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°16), and agency managers (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°12). All interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Qualitative analysis of the transcripts followed the grounded theory approach. The interview transcriptions were coded line-by-line into hierarchical themes with NVivo 12 software which allowed weighting of themes based on the number of interviews where they were coded. Fear of infection and transmission among HC clients and aides were strong themes. Infection prevention and control became the top priority guiding day-to-day business operations at agencies; sourcing adequate personal protective equipment for staff was the most urgent task. HC aides expressed concerns for their clients who showed signs of depression, due to increased isolation during the pandemic. The disappearance of comforting touch - resulting from physical distancing practices - altered the expression of compassion in the HC aide-client care relationship. The findings suggest that the pandemic has further increased psychosocial job demands of HC aides. Increased isolation of clients may be contributing to a wider public health problem of elder loneliness and depression. To support the HC stakeholders during the on-going COVID-19 pandemic, for future pandemic planning or other health emergencies, it is important to improve HC aide job retention. This action could also ease the serious care services shortage among the growing population of older adults.","Markkanen, Brouillette, Quinn, Galligan, Sama, Lindberg, Karlsson","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-021-07076-x","20211006","COVID-19 pandemic; Home care; Home care aide; Home care aide job retention; Home health care; Infection prevention and control; Personal protective equipment; Psychosocial demands; Qualitative methods","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-07","",18627,""
"A novel profit cutting mechanism for Chinese Banks: Theory and Multi-dimensional evidence","As Chinaâ€™s macroeconomic growth faces increasing pressure from the global COVID-19 pandemic, a surprising and politically controversial phenomenon has emerged: the profitability of banks in China exceeded that of enterprises and non-financial industries. The Peopleâ€™s Bank of China and regulatory authorities have hence taken measures to incentivize banks to transfer part of their profits to enterprises, with the aim to stabilize enterprises and employment. This paper proposes a novel profit cutting mechanism focusing on loan structure adjustments to address the limitations of the current approach centering on lowering loan interest rates. The theoretical and empirical analysis show, at both the macro and micro level, that an increase in the proportion of credit loans can benefit the development of enterprises without weakening banksâ€™ operating performance in the long term, leading to a Pareto improvement within enterprise-banking sectors. The findings suggest that banks in China should gradually adjust their loan structures by providing greater credit loan access to enterprises, either voluntarily or directed by policy.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.najef.2021.101541","20211101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-07","",18628,""
