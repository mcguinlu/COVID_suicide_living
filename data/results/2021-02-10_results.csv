"Aggression and non-suicidal self-injury among depressed youths: The mediating effect of resilience","Background: The global spread of COVID-19 not only exerted an enormous impact on the public in different countries but also aggravated depression among youths  The aggressive tendencies of depressed individuals can harm their body and life and threaten those of others  The aggressive and non-suicidal self-injurious behaviors of depressed youths may seriously affect their physical and psychological health if not identified and mediated promptly  Method: A total of 875 young respondents (including college students, community youths, migrant workers, and so on) from three provinces in China were surveyed in 2020 using a depression scale, non-suicidal self-injury scale, aggression scale, and resilience scale  Results: Depression, non-suicidal self-injury, and aggression are significantly higher among the members of the depression group compared with the members of the healthy control group (P&lt;0 001), and the resilience of the members of the former group is remarkably lower than that of the members of the latter group (P&lt;0 001)  Aggression among the depressed youths exhibits a significant positive correlation with non-suicidal self-injury (r= 0 43, P&lt;0 01), whereas aggression (r= â€“0 18, P&lt;0 05) and non-suicidal self-injury (r= â€“0 20, P&lt;0 05) demonstrates significant negative correlations with resilience  The resilience of the youths in the depression group plays a partial mediating role in the relationship between aggression and non-suicidal self-injury  Conclusion: The more aggressive the behaviors of the depressed youths, the more serious their non-suicidal self-injurious symptoms  Furthermore, resilience plays a partial mediating role in the relationship between aggression and non-suicidal self-injury  Â© 2021 Zhang et al  Iranian Public Health Association, and Tehran University of Medical Sciences","Zhang, L.; Chen, M.; Yao, B.; Zhang, Y.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Aggression+and+non-suicidal+self-injury+among+depressed+youths:+The+mediating+effect+of+resilience","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Iranian Journal of Public Health;50(2):288-296, 2021.; Publication details: Iranian Journal of Public Health;50(2):288-296, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-10","",10476,""
"A Case of Suicide Related with COVID-19: Turkish Journal of Psychiatry","The worldwide public health problem of suicide, requires a multidisciplinary assessment, given its economic, cultural, social and psychological aspects  The global COVID-19 pandemic that originated from the Peoples Republic of China in the last months of 2019 has the potential to trigger mental disorders and even suicidal attemps through fear, psychosocial pressures and as a result of disruption of the customary daily life styles  In this report we discuss a case of completed suicide of a 34-year old male who had confined himself to his home, after stocking up large amounts of food, drinking water and cleaning materials in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in our country using site investigation reports, medico-legal autopsy and psychological authopsy of the deceased  It was found out that the victim was following the internet and the television daily for news on the COVID-19 outbreak in the country  One week before the event, he had left his workplace telling his colleagues that he would confine himself to his home for 15-20 days to clean up the premises  Washed banknotes and blister tablets were found in the house as well as stocked water and cooked food  The deceased had twice consulted hospitals for fear of COVID-19 infection 2 days before his demise  It was discussed that he might have the diagnosis of â€œmixed anxiety and depressionâ€  Evaluation of his experiences, discourses and behaviours within the span of 3-4 days before the act and the site investigation have suggested that he might have attempted suicide as a response to stress","TugÃ§e, Toker UGUrlu, Baltaci, Ayse SeydaoGUllari, AkÃ‡A, Alper, Acar, Kemalettin","https://www.google.com/search?q=A+Case+of+Suicide+Related+with+COVID-19:+Turkish+Journal+of+Psychiatry","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Turk Psikiyatri Dergisi;31(4):290-293, 2020.; Publication details: Turk Psikiyatri Dergisi;31(4):290-293, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-10","",10477,""
"Sleep habits and patterns among youth with CF in the modulator era: A preliminary, observational study","Introduction: Pediatric patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) are at risk for sleep disorders for many reasons including respiratory symptoms, medication effects, and time constraints  To date, there are limited studies using actigraphy to evaluate sleep among youth with CF with none published in the modulator era  In addition, COVID-19 fundamentally changed daily schedules  This study, which was underway prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, uses actigraphy to measure sleep timings and patterns among youth with CF from October 2019-April 2020  General sleep quality, quantity, and patterns are characterized;any alterations in sleep patterns before and after the implementation of stay-at-home orders due to COVID-19 are also described  Methods: 7-day actigraphy was completed among youth with CF (ages 10-17 years) as part of baseline testing in a larger, IRB-approved, CFF-funded, prospective behavioral sleep intervention study (SLEEP-CF)  Participants wore a Phillips Actiwatch II device for 7 days and simultaneously were asked to complete sleep logs for comparison  Phillips Actiware 6 software was used to analyze the data, which was verified by a sleep medicine physician  Results: 10 actigraph devices were distributed, and sufficient data were available on devices from 9 patients with 5 patients also providing sleep logs for comparison (mean age 15 2 years, 7 female, mean FEV1 91 6%, 8 patients on modulator therapy, and 2 with mental health co-morbidity)  7 patients completed actigraphy prior to COVID-19 restrictions with 2 patients completing actigraphy post-COVID-19 restrictions (March 15, 2020) with data collection ongoing  In the Pre-COVID group, average bedtime was 10:40PM with average wake-time of 6:41AM  Mean sleep time was 7 15 (range 6-8 2) hours with mean sleep latency of 20 6 minutes, mean wake after sleep onset of 29 4 minutes and 87% sleep efficiency  Patients often showed significant â€œcatch-upâ€ sleep on weekends with large variance between weekday and weekend sleep totals  In the patients studied after COVID-19 restrictions were in place, total sleep time remained low (average 6 7 hours) with longer sleep onset latency (81 minutes), longer wake after sleep onset (37 2 minutes) and decreased sleep efficiency (75%)  These patients demonstrated delayed bedtimes and wake-times (mean bedtime 3:30AM;mean wake-time 12:22PM) without variance of weekdays and weekends  Overall, 100% of patients in the cohort demonstrated total sleep times less than recommended for age by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine  Discussion: Insufficient sleep was universal in this cohort, which is consistent with the national epidemic of inadequate sleep among youth in the US  Patients with CF did not show significant sleep disruption or prolonged wake after onset to suggest that respiratory symptoms and overnight therapies lead to sleep disruption, representing the overall healthy baseline of patients in the modulator era  In patients studied after stayat- home orders due to COVID-19, sleep and wake times were delayed, consistent with normal sleep physiology in teenagers  As insufficient sleep affects physical and mental health, assessments of sleep are vital in routine care of youth with CF","Strang, A.

"Firearm Access and Suicide: Lethal Means Counseling and Safe Storage Education in a Comprehensive Prevention Strategy","Most firearm-related deaths are deaths by suicide, and approximately half of all suicide deaths involve a firearm 1 Recent research has identified a sustained risk of suicide by firearm for those who own handguns and has suggested that risk for suicide peaks just after an individual's first handgun purchase 2 During the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, the United States has seen record-breaking gun sales, and many purchasers are first-time owners, which may mean that a large section of the population is at newly elevated risk for suicide 3 Although policymakers tend to focus on certain laws to reduce gun violence, these laws are not sufficient to fully address suicide risk when an individual's risk is not apparent  Extreme Risk Protection Order laws are intended to remove firearms from the home of someone at high risk for harming himself or herself or others  Because suicide is often an impulsive act taken in response to acute stressors, it is not always possible to preemptively identify and act on risk of suicide 1 A person experiencing a transient crisis may not satisfy any statutory or other legal criteria prohibiting gun acquisition  [   ]researchers should seek to evaluate similar interventions in other populations","McCourt, Alexander D.

"Developing communication tools for CF patients during a pandemic","Background: At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the CF Center at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) was forced to shutter operations as usual and find new ways to communicate with the 235 pediatric patients and their families  In-person appointments and direct communication were decreased to minimize possible exposure to COVID-19  Information had to be shared in varying ways to answer questions for fearful patients and caregivers, as well as provide tools to empower them at home  Method: A virtual town hall was held in April 2020 that featured three providers who discussed information about COVID-19, how it affected both the inpatient and outpatient settings for our patients with CF, methods to cope with the stresses of living through a pandemic, followed by a Q&A with the webinar participants  A second virtual town hall was held in May to continue communication with patients and families regarding the effects of COVID-19 on current practices at CCHMC  A link to a recording of the town halls was emailed to all families and recordings and pertinent information were also posted on the CCHMC COVID-19 website  Another town hall is scheduled for June 2, 2020, and the CF Center anticipates holding these at least once a month moving forward  Just prior to the pandemic outbreak, the CF Center at CCHMC created a Pulmonary Exacerbation Scoring (PES) tool which enabled patients and caregivers to provide an objective score to signs and symptoms of a CF exacerbation  This tool is individualized for each patient, contains a list of each person's home maintenance respiratory medications, and helps families identify their child's baseline to know when symptoms increase  The PES tool was emailed to each patient/caregiver to empower and encourage them to continue care at home during this pandemic  A video, created by a parent partner, was included in the email to explain how to utilize the PES tool  Two social workers initiated patient-family communication by sending out an email of resources (CF-specific, med/food delivery, rent/mortgage/ food/utilities aid, etc) available to our patients in our tri-state region  Following this, several CF care members created and distributed informative videos concerning their respective fields  Our school liaison specialist offered tips to set up the caregivers for success with remote learning  The psychologist proffered two videos: one video was a COVID-19 specific video to address fear and anxiety, while the second video addressed mental health resources offered through CCHMC  Our physical therapist presented different ways patients and families can engage in activities while also under quarantine  Outcome: To date there have been 236 views of all recordings distributed  Families prior to the CF town hall webinar expressed concerns regarding COVID-19 and its effects on operations, but once the town hall was complete, felt that their concerns had been addressed  Verbatim feedback after the town halls included: â€œGreat job everyone!

"The Public Health Penalty of Attending to the Proximal","Clearly, a distal approach to this challenge would be to dismantle a system of incarceration that also doubles as a system of housing people with mental illness and to replace that with a compassionate approach that considers how we tackle the influences that might drive mental illness and how we create systems that can provide support and care for persons with mental illness rather than consign them to a carceral system that, at best, does not tend to their core mental health problems and, at worst, exacerbates them 5 The challenge for public health is that we have a large, and seemingly intractable, system of incarceration as a clear and present reality, and thinking only about undoing such a system exposes us to reasonable charges of unhelpful idealism  Hedden et al  study such systems with the aim of finding whether race/ethnicity is associated with access to jail- and community-based mental health treatment  Given the simple observation that those with more power, privilege, and access are more likely to obtain benefit from any intervention,6 even in, for example, a jail system, it stands to reason that an intervention that targets only the more proximal mechanisms of action will result in exposing underlying inequities, potentially widening health gaps","Galea, Sandro M.

"Improving clinic communication for telehealth in outpatient cystic fibrosis clinic visits","Introduction: Due to sheltering in place from the COVID-19 pandemic, our CF team required a means of managing clinic flow with the sudden change from in-person to telehealth appointments for our patients  Our team was in need of a complete and concise medium to communicate with one another during virtual clinic visits and provide necessary data to conduct the individual visits more efficiently  Prior to COVID-19, clinic visits occurred in-person and the team used a white dry-erase board to communicate clinic flow along with patient information helpful for the patient encounter  Due to shelter-in-place orders, most of the CF clinical staff are working remotely  Having a communication tool like a virtual white board allows for effective management of clinic flow  We want the patient clinic experience to be safe and meet the needs of our patients regardless of virtual or in-person  Methods: The process started with the CF clinic team recognizing a continued need for an effective communication tool, similar to the white board used in clinic  Using Google Sheets, a virtual white board was created based on the physical white board used in-person  Both the in-person and virtual white boards had a similar approach of listing patient names, appointment time, multidisciplinary roles, lab report dates, and imaging dates  After developing the virtual white board, it was reviewed by the team during pilot virtual clinics  Changes occurred over multiple plan-do-study-act cycles  The listed patient name became a hyperlink that connected directly to the virtual encounter with that specific patient  The listed dates for labs and imaging became hyperlinks to the actual lab and imaging reports  Other hyperlinks included a team encounter for discussion between staff, a shared patient folder, the patient discharge form, and the program spreadsheet for data tracking  All forms are accessible to staff for any changes and updates  Drop-down menus were added for the pulmonologists to notate exacerbation scores and for the mental health coordinator to notate the completion of mental health screens, assisting with Port CF Registry data  A post-survey was sent out via SurveyMonkey to our staff and patient family partners after the pilot virtual clinic for feedback  Results: The CF center has a total of 30 team members for both the pediatric and adult teams  Not all of the disciplines participated in virtual clinics due to COVID-19 changes for staff availability, such as physical therapy  The survey was completed by 19 (63%) of the 30 team members  Of the completed surveys, all staff feedback showed that the virtual white board was the most successful implementation in our telehealth clinics  The new virtual white board was well organized and staff liked â€œthat everything was in one place â€ Conclusion: The goal is to have effective communication between the team during clinic visits, improving the ability to provide individualized care  With the positive feedback response from the team, we have chosen to adopt this process as a part of our clinics moving forward for both virtual and in-person clinic visits","Dodd, C.; Villagomez, K.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Improving+clinic+communication+for+telehealth+in+outpatient+cystic+fibrosis+clinic+visits","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Pediatric Pulmonology;55(SUPPL 2):324, 2020.; Publication details: Pediatric Pulmonology;55(SUPPL 2):324, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-10","",10487,""
"Peer consultation groups: A model for promoting professional resilience, connectedness and skill building in CF care","Background: Mental health (MH) providers have become more integrated into CF teams over the past several years, in large part due to the 2015 guidelines for mental health care  (Quittner, et al  2016)  Distance between CF care centers often presents as a barrier to collaboration and consultation among MH providers  We sought to better understand MH providers' experience of their work and to continue peer consultation groups as a way of promoting resilience, connectedness, and skill building among MH providers (Morse, 2012;Beidas, 2013)  Methods: MH providers were invited via several professional listservs to participate in 6 monthly, one-hour consultation groups via a video conferencing  Providers (N=93) were assigned to 12 groups (65 clinical social workers, 20 psychologists, 13 other), with an average of 9 per group  Providers were from both adult and pediatric clinics across the US, with at least 85 different institutions represented  Facilitators were encouraged to guide a supportive and case-based peer discussion  Although not required, several groups began meeting more frequently shortly after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic  Results: Providers (N=50) completed a survey prior to beginning group meetings and identified three main goals: 1) skill building (60%), 2) support (58%), and 3) sense of community (32%)  About half reported feeling connected (â€œsomewhatâ€ or â€œveryâ€) to the larger CF community (56%), while almost everyone reported feeling connected to providers within their own CF center (98%)  The majority indicated feeling that the work they do within CF is somewhat or very emotionally difficult (70%), and many (30%) indicated feeling overwhelmed/burned out at times by their work in CF  Notably, all endorsed greatly enjoying their work in CF  Attrition has been minimal (N=13) and primarily due to scheduling issues  Several groups started meeting twice/month, both to discuss patient needs and work/life balance related to the COVID-19 pandemic  Analysis of postgroup feedback is ongoing with plans to survey after conclusion of six sessions  Conclusions: Peer consultation groups have been very well received by CF MH providers as indicated by low attrition rates and positive feedback  Although MH providers indicated greatly enjoying their work in CF, more than half feel the work is emotionally difficult and for many the work has resulted in feeling overwhelmed/burned out  This format may serve as a model for burnout prevention for MH providers, as well as other allied health providers in CF care with the same barriers to discipline-specific support and consultation","Cooney, K.; Mueller, A.; Prieur, M.

"Cancer during Corona Pandemic: Plight of cancer patients when two evils join hands","In the unprecedented times of Corona Pandemic (CP), each individual is facing uncertainty and stress. Presence of cancer during these times compounds the troubles. The changing scenario of consultation and treatment during pandemic, logistic issues, dwindling finances and fear are making a negative impact on the mental health of cancer patients. In a qualitative analysis conducted in a tertiary oncology hospital from 1st June to 6th July on the recently diagnosed or under treatment cancer patients. The face to face interview was conducted using a semi structured questionnaire specific to Cancer amid CP, General Anxiety Disorder Item Scale 7 and Physical Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9). There were total 294 patients, mean age around 51 years with a male female ratio of 3:2, 40% were suffering from head and neck malignancy. There was a delay initiating cancer treatment in 22.4% of patients and three fourths of them attributed it to CP. Almost 80% of patients perceived that pandemic has adversely affected their treatment and 50% thought they would have had a better chance of cure. Half of our cohort stated that due to social distancing and usage of masks, there is a communication gap between them and the doctors. They also felt that now, with decreased nonverbal communication; they felt lack of empathy. 14.9% patients were more concerned about corona pandemic as compared to malignancy. This study is about the challenges and perspective of cancer patients during the CP. It indicates a need for more systematic and patient friendly approach by the regulatory authorities, hospital management and staff. Timely intervention of those under stress is recommended more frequently during CP.","Patni, Nidhi; Hota, Arati; Patni, Ayushi; Misra, Pragya","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.currproblcancer.2020.100671","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Curr Probl Cancer;: 100671, 2020 Nov 16.; Publication details: Curr Probl Cancer;: 100671, 2020 Nov 16.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-10","",10494,""
"Mental health interventions for healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain; Intervenciones de salud mental para trabajadores sanitarios durante la pandemia de COVID-19 en EspaÃ±a","OBJECTIVE: In order to reduce distress associated with working with COVID-19 patients, several psychological intervention programs for healthcare workers have been developed in Spain. We aimed to describe the main characteristics and components of these programs for healthcare workers treating COVID-19 patients in Spanish hospitals. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An online survey was designed to evaluate the main characteristics of psychological intervention programs for healthcare workers during the peak of COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Valid responses were received from 36 hospitals. Most of these programs offered both in-person and online therapy. The most common aim of these interventions was emotional regulation, which was treated by psychoeducational and cognitive-behavioural techniques in individual interventions. Group interventions mainly used psychoeducation and mindfulness. Only half of the teams that offered in-person interventions received training in the proper use of personal protective equipment. CONCLUSIONS: Several hospitals in Spain have developed mental health interventions for healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, deploying a wide range of therapeutic modalities and techniques. The rapid implementation of these programs during the pandemic suggests that safety may not have received sufficient attention. The planning and development of interventions for healthcare workers during pandemics merits greater attention by national and regional authorities and institutions.","Priede, Amador; LÃ³pez-Ãlvarez, InÃ©s; Carracedo-SanchidriÃ¡n, Diego; GonzÃ¡lez-Blanch, CÃ©sar","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rpsm.2021.01.005","","Country: ES; ESPANHA; SPAIN; ESPAÃ‘A; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Rev Psiquiatr Salud Ment;2021 Feb 04.; Publication details: Rev Psiquiatr Salud Ment;2021 Feb 04.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-10","",10495,""
"Multiscale Attention Guided Network for COVID-19 Diagnosis Using Chest X-ray Images","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is one of the most destructive pandemic after millennium, forcing the world to tackle a health crisis. Automated lung infections classification using chest X-ray (CXR) images could strengthen diagnostic capability when handling COVID-19. However, classifying COVID-19 from pneumonia cases using CXR image is a difficult task because of shared spatial characteristics, high feature variation and contrast diversity between cases. Moreover, massive data collection is impractical for a newly emerged disease, which limited the performance of data thirsty deep learning models. To address these challenges, Multiscale Attention Guided deep network with Soft Distance regularization (MAG-SD) is proposed to automatically classify COVID-19 from pneumonia CXR images. In MAG-SD, MA-Net is used to produce prediction vector and attention from multiscale feature maps. To improve the robustness of trained model and relieve the shortage of training data, attention guided augmentations along with a soft distance regularization are posed, which aims at generating meaningful augmentations and reduce noise. Our multiscale attention model achieves better classification performance on our pneumonia CXR image dataset. Plentiful experiments are proposed for MAG-SD which demonstrates its unique advantage in pneumonia classification over cutting-edge models. The code is available at https://github.com/JasonLeeGHub/MAG-SD.","Li, Wang, Wang, Wang, Liu, Jin, Sun","https://doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2021.3058293","20210209","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-10","",10496,""

Participants included in this retrospective analysis consisted of adult New York City residents with opioid use disorder eligible for enrollment in the NYC Health+Hospitals Virtual Buprenorphine Clinic between March and May 2020 (nÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 78). Follow-up data were comprised of rates of retention in treatment at 2 months, referrals to community treatment, and induction-related events. During the initial 9 weeks of clinic operations, the clinic inducted 78 patients on to buprenorphine-naloxone and completed 252 visits. Patient referrals included non-NYC Health + Hospitals (nÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 22, 28.2%) and NYC Health + Hospitals healthcare providers (nÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 17, 21.8%), homeless shelter staff (nÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 13, 16.7%), and the NYC Health + Hospitals jail reentry program in Rikers Island (nÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 11, 14.1%). At 8 weeks, 42 patients remained in care (53.8%), 21 were referred to a community treatment program (26.9%), and 15 were lost to follow-up (19.2%). No patients were terminated from care due to disruptive behavior or suspicions of diversion or misuse of Buprenorphine. Adverse clinical outcomes were uncommon and included persistent withdrawal symptoms (nÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 8, 4.3%) and one nonfatal opioid overdose (0.5%).

"Dual-mode gradient HPLC and TLC densitometry methods for the simultaneous determination of paracetamol and methionine in the presence of paracetamol impurities","Paracetamol is one of the most widely analgesic and antipyretic drugs recently integrated into the supportive therapy of COVID-19. The pharmaceuticals containing methionine with paracetamol may contribute to avoid hepatotoxicity and eventual paracetamol overdose-dependent death. The current work purposes to develop and validate two chromatographic methods for the simultaneous determination of methionine and paracetamol in presence of two paracetamol impurities (4-nitrophenol and 4-aminophenol). Two chromatographic methods were established and validated according to the International Conference on Harmonization guidelines. The first one was a RP-HPLC/UV method based on applying a &quot;dual-mode&quot; gradient elution. The separation was realized via varying both the composition of the ternary mobile phase (acetonitrile-methanol-water) and its flow rate. This strategy enabled a relatively rapid analysis with a satisfactory resolution, although the investigated compounds exhibit a significant difference in lipophilicity. The second one relied on TLC- densitometry, where the optimum separation was realized using a quaternary mobile phase system composed of butanol-dioxane-toluene-methanol (8: 2.5: 3.5: 0.3, by volume). Both methods were monitored at 220Ã¢â‚¬â€°nm. The developed methods were proven to be robust, accurate, specific, and appropriate for the routine analysis of paracetamol in its pure form or in pharmaceutical formulations with methionine in quality control laboratories. The corresponding methods are suitable to determine methionine and paracetamol in the presence of paracetamol impurities. The study achieves the analysis of methionine and paracetamol in the presence of paracetamol impurities via the application of HPLC and TLC- densitometry methods.","Ibrahim, Hamdy, Merey, Saad","https://doi.org/10.1093/jaoacint/qsab021","20210209","Dual-mode gradient; HPLC; Methionine; Paracetamol; TLC","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-10","",10500,""

"Future perspectives of robot psychiatry: can communication robots assist psychiatric evaluation in the COVID-19 pandemic era?","Direct face-to-face interview between a psychiatrist and a patient is crucial in psychiatric evaluation, however, such traditional interviews are becoming difficult to conduct because of the infection risk in the COVID-19 era. As telepsychiatry, video interviews using internet are suggested to be useful to evaluate and assist individuals with mental disorders. However, some patients especially with social phobia, depression, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) hesitate to use even such face-to-face-like tools. Communication robots have been proposed as future assistant tools for such patients. Herein, we summarize recent advancements in robot psychiatry, and propose the benefits of communication robots in psychiatric evaluation. Recent studies have suggested that communication robots are effective in assisting people with ASD. As a pilot trial, we herein conducted semi-structured interviews to evaluate depression and hikikomori, a form of pathological social withdrawal, using a communication robot and a psychiatrist, respectively. There was almost identical evaluation between the two. Interestingly, a person with hikikomori answered that the robot was easier to disclose. Robots can reduce the burden of human resources and the infection risk in the COVID-19 era. Robot interview is expected to be implemented for future evaluation system in psychiatry.","Yoshikawa, Kumazaki, Kato","https://doi.org/10.1097/YCO.0000000000000692","20210209","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-10","",10502,""
"Challenges and concerns of patients with congenital bleeding disorders affected by coronavirus disease 2019","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new medical challenge for all individuals, especially for those with underlying disorders, such as congenital bleeding disorders (CBDs). Therefore, the pandemic might significantly change the behaviour of patients with CBDs and results in some challenges. In the present study, we assessed the main challenges of COVID-19 infection to patients with CBDs. Data were collected from medical files and interviews of patients with CBDs who had COVID-19 infection. Follow-ups were performed on patients who had active severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection between April and October 2020. All patients were interviewed by an expert in order to collect the pertinent data. Some questions were about patients' preventive behaviors and feelings prior to infection, and some were about the consequences of infection on patients' replacement therapy and bleeding management. Among 25 patients, infection and death of loved ones (n: 7, 28%), and their own (n: 5, 20%) or family members' (n: 1, 4%) infection, and the resulting economic burden (n: 2, 8%) were main concerns. Six patients experienced depression during the pandemic. The pandemic caused all severely affected patients but one (n: 11, 92%) to abandon replacement therapy. However, two received on-demand therapy after exacerbation of their bleeding. Only one (25%) of four patients on prophylaxis received in-home therapy, whereas the others (75%) abandoned prophylaxis. It seems that COVID-19 infection has great consequences on the lives of patients with CBDs, causing some to take dangerous actions, such as abandonment of their treatment. Healthcare systems, and healthcare providers, should have an appropriate strategy for management of patients with CBDs that prevents infection and provides timely replacement therapy.","Dorgalaleh, Tabibian, Baghaipour, Dabbagh, Bahoush, Jazebi, Bahraini, Fazeli, Yousefi","https://doi.org/10.1097/MBC.0000000000001019","20210209","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-10","",10503,""

Associations were estimated by the chi-square test. The mean scores were compared among work categories with ANOVA (ÃŽÂ±Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°5%) and the prevalence of symptoms was estimated. 1,609 healthcare workers participated in the survey [mean age: 36.9 (SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°11.6) years, womenÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°83.6%]. There was no association between work category and changes in mental health during the pandemic (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.288) or prevalence of unsafe feeling (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.218). A significant relationship was observed between maintaining work activities during the pandemic and work category (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Physicians had the lowest out-of-work prevalence (9.5%) while dentists had the highest (32.3%). Physicians and nurses showed the highest prevalence of in-person work routine. Psychologists presented the highest prevalence of remote work (64.0%) while dentists had the lowest (20.2%). A high prevalence of depression (D), anxiety (A), and stress (S) symptoms was observed in all professional categories (D: 57.2, 95% CI 48.3-66.1%; A: 46.20%, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°37.2-55.2%; S: 55.80%, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°46.8-64.8%), with physicians (DÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°38.4%, AÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°25.80%, SÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°37.90%), psychologists (DÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°50.2%, AÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°39.0%, SÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°43.1%), and nurses (DÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°50.0%, AÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°40.9%, SÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°49.0%) having significantly lower scores. Psychologists had the lowest pandemic-related psychological impact (42.70%, 95% CI 36.8-48.6%). Extreme changes in the work routine of dentists and psychologists and an overall high prevalence of mental symptoms due to the pandemic were found. Researchers should focus on gathering information that can identify workers at increased risk of mental illness to guide discussions and develop actions to minimize the harm of the pandemic. In addition, we suggest that healthcare and support systems urgently adopt mental health care measures with specialized professionals to protect the psychological well-being of the healthcare community.","Campos, Martins, Campos, de FÃƒÂ¡tima ValadÃƒÂ£o-Dias, MarÃƒÂ´co","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00420-021-01656-4","20210209","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Healthcare professionals; Pandemic; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-10","",10504,""
"The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health associated trauma, admissions and fractures at a London major trauma centre","Non-injury-related factors have been extensively studied in major trauma and have been shown to have a significant impact on patient outcomes. Mental illness and associated medication use has been proven to have a negative effect on bone health and fracture healing. We collated data retrospectively from the records of orthopaedic inpatients in a non-COVID and COVID period. We analysed demographic data, referral and admission numbers, orthopaedic injuries, surgery performed and patient comorbidities, including psychiatric history. There were 824 orthopaedic referrals and 358 admissions (six/day) in the non-COVID period, with 38/358 (10.6%) admissions having a psychiatric diagnosis and 30/358 (8.4%) also having a fracture. This was compared with 473 referrals and 195 admissions (three/day) in the COVID period, with 73/195 (37.4%) admissions having a documented psychiatric diagnosis and 47/195 (24.1%) having a fracture. There was a reduction in the number of admissions and referrals during the pandemic, but a simultaneous three-fold rise in admissions with a psychiatric diagnosis. The proportion of patients with both a fracture and a psychiatric diagnosis more than doubled and the number of patients presenting due to a traumatic suicide attempt almost tripled. While total numbers using the orthopaedic service decreased, the impact of the pandemic and lockdown disproportionately affects those with mental health problems, a group already at higher risk of poorer functional outcomes and non-union. It is imperative that adequate support is in place for patients with vulnerable mental health during these periods, particularly as we look towards a potential 'second wave' of COVID-19.","Hay, Jamal, Al-Tawil, Petohazi, Gulli, Bednarczuk, Baldwin-Smith, Gibbons, Sinha","https://doi.org/10.1308/rcsann.2020.7026","20210209","Bone fractures; COVID-19; Depression; Mental health; Pandemic; Trauma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-10","",10505,""
"Experiences of women with ovarian cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic: Examining intolerance of uncertainty and fear of COVID-19 in relation to psychological distress","Our research aimed to examine the role of intolerance of uncertainty (IU) in psychological distress (PD) among women with ovarian cancer. Fear of COVID-19 (FCOV) was examined as a mediator, and participant health status and the reopening status of their geographic region were examined as moderators. A cross-sectional quantitative design was employed. Participants (<i>nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°100) were recruited through various online sources and completed the study via Qualtrics. Moderated mediation models and post-hoc linear regression analyses were used to determine the role of predictor variables in PD. No significant moderators or mediators were found. Despite a strong correlation between FCOV and IU, both variables explained unique variance in the anxiety and stress models, while FCOV was not significant in the depressive symptoms model. Both IU and FCOV should be considered in helping women with ovarian cancer manage their PD during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hill, Frost, Martin","https://doi.org/10.1080/07347332.2021.1880524","20210209","Fear of COVID-19; intolerance of uncertainty; ovarian cancer; perceived health status; psychological distress; reopening status","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-10","",10506,""

"Early Pandemic Experiences of Autistic Adults: Predictors of Psychological Distress","The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted lives around the world. Autistic adults are at higher risk for co-occurring medical and psychiatric conditions and may be more prone to difficulties adapting to pandemic-related changes and social distancing mandates and coping with ongoing uncertainties. On the other hand, the pandemic may lead to greater understanding and acceptance of accommodations in the broader community that may facilitate supports for autistic adults beyond the pandemic. To learn more about their early pandemic experiences, online surveys were sent to independent adults enrolled in the Simons Powering Autism Research Knowledge (SPARK). The first survey was open from March 30 to April 19, 2020; a follow-up survey sent to original responders was open from May 27 to June 6, yielding 396 participants with data for both surveys. We found that adults who were female, younger, had prior diagnoses of a mental health condition, personal COVID-19 experience (i.e., knowing someone who had symptoms or tested positive) or less frequent hope for the future reported the greatest negative impacts. Decrease in feelings of hopefulness over time predicted greater psychological distress at T2, accounting for T1 impact and distress levels and increases in total COVID-19 impact. Less perceived benefit of online services also predicted later distress. Although there tends to be a focus on coping with negative effects of the pandemic, mental health providers may consider approaches that focus on positives, such as fostering hope and understanding factors that facilitate benefit from online services. LAY SUMMARY: Autistic adults may be at risk for psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. The current study suggests that autistic adults who were younger, female, had a mental health diagnosis before the pandemic and knew someone who showed symptoms or tested positive for COVID-19 reported more areas negatively impacted by COVID-19 and greater difficulty coping with those effects. Decreases in hope over time were associated with greater psychological distress. Less perceived benefit from online services also predicted distress 2Ã¢â‚¬â€°months later. These results suggest important areas to further explore as we develop supports for autistic adults during the pandemic.","Bal, Wilkinson, White, Law, Feliciano, Chung","https://doi.org/10.1002/aur.2480","20210209","COVID-19 pandemic; adults; co-morbid conditions; gender/female ASD; hope; loneliness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-10","",10508,""
"Emotion Regulation Strategies Predict PTSS During the COVID-19 Pandemic in an American Indian Population","Poor emotion regulation is associated with post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). However, limited prospective research prevents any directional conclusions. No known studies have assessed emotion regulation with PTSS in American Indians, a high-risk population for poor mental health outcomes. The present prospective study explored whether emotion regulation strategies (cognitive reappraisal, expressive suppression) predicted later PTSS related to the COVID-19 global pandemic in a solely American Indian sample. American Indian participants (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°210; Mean (SD) ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°54.85(13.08) years, 58.7% female) completed the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) during Phase 1 (a few weeks before pandemic declaration) and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic during Phase 2 (7-8Ã‚Â weeks after pandemic declaration). Bivariate correlations and hierarchical linear regression analyses were utilized. ERQ reappraisal was negatively associated with IES-R total scores, such that higher reappraisal predicted lower PTSS. In contrast, ERQ suppression was positively associated with IES-R total scores, such that higher suppression predicted higher PTSS. Greater suppression and lower reappraisal predicts PTSS in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in an entirely American Indian sample, providing critical information for future interventions in a population at high-risk for mental health disparities.","Tyra, Ginty, John-Henderson","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12529-021-09964-2","20210209","American indians; COVID-19; Coronavirus; Emotional regulation; Posttraumatic stress; Prospective studies","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-10","",10509,""

This study characterizes suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide attempts (SA) in a sample of adolescents psychiatrically hospitalized during COVID-19. Rates of SI and SA are compared to a historical hospital sample from a matched period in the year prior. Associations between specific stressors and COVID-related SI are also explored. This cross-sectional chart review utilizes hospital intake data, including self-reports of SA, SI (general and COVID-related), and COVID-specific stressors. SA and SI ratings were higher in the COVID-19 sample compared to the historical sample. Stressors related to missing special events, financial problems, in-home conflict, and changes in living circumstances were associated with COVID-related SI. Among first-time admissions, several interpersonal stressors were linked to COVID-related SI. Analyses were cross-sectional, limiting our ability to draw conclusions about causality. This study offers preliminary evidence that COVID-19 may be contributing to suicidal thoughts and behaviors in high-risk adolescents.","Thompson, Thomas, Burke, Nesi, MacPherson, Bettis, Kudinova, Affleck, Hunt, Wolff","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadr.2021.100100","20210209","Adolescents; COVID-19; Coronavirus; Suicidal ideation; Suicide attempts","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-10","",10510,""

This study involved 25 participants from a range of frontline professions in health and social care. Interviews were conducted over the phone or video call, depending on participant preference. From the analysis, we identified 5 overarching themes: communication challenges, work-related stressors, support structures, personal growth and individual resilience. The participants expressed difficulties such as communication challenges and changing work conditions, but also positive factors such as increased team unity at work, and a greater reflection on what matters in life. This study provides evidence on the support needs of health and social care professionals amid continued and future disruptions caused by the pandemic. It also elucidates some of the successful strategies (such as mindfulness, hobbies, restricting news intake, virtual socialising activities) deployed by health and social care professionals that can support their resilience and well-being and be used to guide future interventions.","Aughterson, McKinlay, Fancourt, Burton","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-047353","20210209","COVID-19; health policy; medical education &amp; training; mental health; public health; qualitative research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-10","",10511,""
"Implementation of remote consulting in UK primary care following the COVID-19 pandemic: a mixed-methods longitudinal study","To reduce contagion of COVID-19, in March 2020 UK general practices implemented predominantly remote consulting via telephone, video, or online consultation platforms. To investigate the rapid implementation of remote consulting and explore impact over the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Mixed-methods study in 21 general practices in Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire. Longitudinal observational quantitative analysis compared volume and type of consultation in April to July 2020 with April to July 2019. Negative binomial models were used to identify if changes differed among different groups of patients. Qualitative data from 87 longitudinal interviews with practice staff in four rounds investigated practices' experience of the move to remote consulting, challenges faced, and solutions. A thematic analysis utilised Normalisation Process Theory. There was universal consensus that remote consulting was necessary. This drove a rapid change to 90% remote GP consulting (46% for nurses) by April 2020. Consultation rates reduced in April to July 2020 compared to 2019; GPs and nurses maintained a focus on older patients, shielding patients, and patients with poor mental health. Telephone consulting was sufficient for many patient problems, video consulting was used more rarely, and was less essential as lockdown eased. SMS-messaging increased more than three-fold. GPs were concerned about increased clinical risk and some had difficulties setting thresholds for seeing patients face-to-face as lockdown eased. The shift to remote consulting was successful and a focus maintained on vulnerable patients. It was driven by the imperative to reduce contagion and may have risks; post-pandemic, the model will need adjustment.","Murphy, Scott, Salisbury, Turner, Scott, Denholm, Lewis, Iyer, Macleod, Horwood","https://doi.org/10.3399/BJGP.2020.0948","20210209","general practitioners; online consultation; remote consultation; telephone consultation; triage","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-10","",10512,""

"Impacts of the Covid-19 lockdown and relevant vulnerabilities on capability well-being, mental health and social support: an Austrian survey study","Impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic and its public health measures go beyond physical and mental health and incorporate wider well-being impacts in terms of what people are free to do or be. We explored the impacts of the Covid-19 lockdown and relevant vulnerabilities on capability well-being, mental health and social support in Austria. Adult Austrian residents (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°560) provided responses to a cross-sectional online survey about their experiences during Covid-19 lockdown (15 March-15 April 2020). Instruments measuring capabilities (OxCAP-MH), depression and anxiety (HADS), social support (MSPSS) and mental well-being (WHO-5) were used in association with six pre-defined vulnerabilities using multivariable linear regression. 31% of the participants reported low mental well-being and only 30% of those with a history of mental health treatment received treatment during lockdown. Past mental health treatment had a significant negative effect across all outcome measures with an associated capability well-being score reduction of -Ã¢â‚¬â€°6.54 (95%CI, -Ã¢â‚¬â€°9.26, -Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.82). Direct Covid-19 experience and being 'at risk' due to age and/or physical health conditions were also associated with significant capability deprivations. When adjusted for vulnerabilities, significant capability reductions were observed in association with increased levels of depression (-Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.77) and anxiety (-Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.50), and significantly higher capability levels (+Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.75) were associated with higher levels of social support.

The PTSD checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), Trauma Exposure Scale, abbreviated version of the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-10), Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS) and Demographic Questionnaire were used to examine posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, trauma exposure, resilience and perceived social support among 898 patients who were hospitalized after being diagnosed with COVID-19 in China. The data were analyzed with t tests, one-way ANOVA and multivariable logistic regression analysis. The results showed that the prevalence of PTSD, depression and anxiety was 13.2, 21.0 and 16.4%, respectively. Hospitalized patients who were more impacted by negative news reports, had greater exposure to traumatic experiences, and had lower levels of perceived social support reported higher PTSD, depression and anxiety.

"The need for additional mental health support for women in the postpartum period in the times of epidemic crisis","This retrospective study aimed to identify possible intensification of mental health difficulties among women seeking support in the postpartum period during the epidemic state in Poland. We assumed that the epidemic crisis, social isolation, and restrictions in hospitals which affect pregnant and postpartum women - lack of family labors, lack of the possibility to be with the newborn when he/she is hospitalized, may increase fear and reduce psychosocial resources of women, hinder their normal process of transition to motherhood and thus contribute to the intensified severity of depressive symptoms. The study participants were women seeking support at the on-line platform of the project 'Next Stop: Mum', which is a part of the postpartum depression prevention's program implemented by the Ministry of Health in Poland, and enables remote self-screening for the severity of the postpartum depression symptoms with the EdinburghÃ‚Â Postnatal Depression Scale developed by Cox and collaborators. The analyzed data in this study were obtained from 139 women: 61 filled forms from October 1 - November 10, 2019 (non-epidemic period), and 78 filled forms from February 20-March 30 (beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic), 2020. A statistically significant difference in the severity of postpartum depression symptoms were observed among women making a self-assessment with EPDS scale at the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic in Poland (MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°15.71; SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°6.23), compared to the pre-epidemic neutral period (MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°13.56; SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°6.46). The results of this study indicate that the epidemic crisis may be associated with an increased need for additional caution and support of women's mental health in the postpartum period. We believe that recommendations for medical staff, policy, and families of women struggling with postpartum depression symptoms during crisis should be widespread as the second wave of COVID-19 disease may develop in the autumn-winter 2020 and spring 2021.","Chrzan-DÃ„â„¢tkoÃ…â€º, Walczak-KozÃ…â€šowska, Lipowska","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-021-03544-8","20210209","Affective disorder; Covid-19; Edinburgh postnatal depression scale; Epidemic crisis; Motherhood; Postpartum depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-10","",10516,""
"A validation of the Postpartum Specific Anxiety Scale 12-item research short-form for use during global crises with five translations","Global crises inevitably increase levels of anxiety in postpartum populations. Effective and efficient measurement is therefore essential. This study aimed to create a 12-item research short form of the 51-item Postpartum Specific Anxiety Scale [PSAS] and validate it for use in rapid response research at a time of global crises [PSAS-RSF-C]. We also present the same 12-items, in five other languages (Italian, French, Chinese, Spanish, Dutch) to increase global accessibility of a psychometric tool to assess maternal mental health. Twelve items from the PSAS were selected on the basis of a review of their factor loadings. An on-line sample of UK mothers (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°710) of infants up to 12Ã‚Â weeks old completed the PSAS-RSF-C during COVID-19 'lockdown'. Principal component analyses on a randomly split sample (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°344) revealed four factors, identical in nature to the original PSAS, which in combination explained 75% of the total variance. Confirmatory factor analyses (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°366) demonstrated the four-factor model fit the data well. Reliability of the overall scale and of the underlying factors in both samples proved excellent. Findings suggest the PSAS-RSF-C may prove useful as a clinical screening tool and is the first postpartum-specific psychometric scale to be validated during the COVID-19 pandemic. This offers psychometrically sound assessment of postpartum anxiety. By increasing the accessibility of the PSAS, we aim to enable researchers the opportunity to measure maternal anxiety, rapidly, at times of global crisis.","Silverio, Davies, Christiansen, Aparicio-GarcÃƒÂ­a, Bramante, Chen, Costas-RamÃƒÂ³n, de Weerth, Della Vedova, Infante Gil, Lustermans, Wendland, Xu, Halford, Harrold, Fallon","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-021-03597-9","20210209","Anxiety; Maternal mental health; Postpartum; Psychometric assessment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-10","",10517,""
