"Predictors of adverse outcome in patients with suspected COVID-19 managed in a virtual hospital setting: a cohort study","Objective: Identify predictors of adverse outcome in a Virtual Hospital (VH) setting for COVID 19. Design: Real-world prospective observational study. Setting: Virtual hospital remote assessment service in West Hertfordshire NHS Trust, UK. Participants: Patients with suspected COVID-19 illness enrolled directly from the community (post-accident and emergency (A&E) or medical intake assessment) or post-inpatient admission. Main outcome measure: Death or (re-)admission to inpatient hospital care over 28 days. Results: 900 patients with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 (455 referred from A&E or medical intake and 445 post-inpatient) were included in the analysis. 76 (8.4%) of these experienced an adverse outcome (15 deaths in admitted patients, 3 deaths in patients not admitted, and 58 additional inpatient admissions). Predictors of adverse outcome were increase in age (OR 1.04 [95%CI: 1.02, 1.06] per year of age), history of cancer (OR 2.87 [95%CI: 1.41, 5.82]), history of mental health problems (OR 1.76 [95%CI: 1.02, 3.04]), severely impaired renal function (OR for eGFR <30 = 9.09 [95%CI: 2.01, 41.09]) and having a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR result (OR Mike Moo]). Conclusions: These predictors may help direct intensity of monitoring for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 who are being remotely monitored by primary or secondary care services. Further research is needed to identify the reasons for increased risk of adverse outcome associated with cancer and mental health problems.","Nick A Francis; Beth Stuart; Matthew Knight; Rama Vancheeswaran; Charles Oliver; Merlin Willcox; Andrrew Barlow; Michael Moore","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.09.20228189","20201113","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-13","",7073,""
"Subjective mental health and need for care among psychiatric outpatients during the COVID-19 pandemic: results from an outreach initiative in Sweden","Importance: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic restricts access to care for psychiatric patients. The physical and mental well-being of patients with severe mental illness in the current circumstances is unknown. Objective: To evaluate physical and mental well-being, subjective mental health, and need for updated psychiatric management plans in a sample of patients with severe mental illness during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Design: Cross-sectional study of structured telephone assessments conducted between April 23 and June 30, 2020. Setting: Regional psychiatric outpatient care centre in Stockholm, Sweden. Participants: Patients who had not been in contact with their psychiatric clinic between April 9 and April 23, 2020. A total of 1071 patients were contacted by phone. Exposures: Occurrence of respiratory symptoms, changes in psychiatric symptoms, and the need for updated psychiatric management plans, as determined by the telephone assessors. Subjective mental health rated 0-100 by patients. Main Outcomes and Measures: Self-rated physical, respiratory and psychiatric symptoms according to a semi-structured interview. Subjective mental health rated on a scale from 0-100. Results: Patients (n = 1071) were on average 45 years old (SD = 16.9), of which 570 (53%) were female. Neurodevelopmental disorders, psychotic disorders, and bipolar disorder were the most common diagnostic categories. The majority of respondents reported no respiratory symptoms (86%), and few reported light (10%) or severe (4%) respiratory symptoms. Similarly, most patients reported no worsening in psychiatric symptoms (81%). For those who reported a worsening of psychiatric symptoms (19%), the psychiatric management plans that were already in place were deemed appropriate in most cases (16.5%), whereas 22 patients (2.5%) reported a worsening of psychiatric symptoms that warranted an earlier or immediate follow-up by their psychiatric clinic. Patients rated their subjective mental health on a 0-100 scale as 70.5 [95% CI 69 - 71.9] on average (n = 841). Response rates to the questions of the structured assessment varied from 79% - 82%. Conclusions and Relevance: The majority of patients reported no respiratory symptoms, no change in psychiatric symptoms and a rather high subjective well-being. Patients in psychiatric care with a mental health care plan experienced stability in the management of their psychiatric symptoms and general well-being, and only a minority were in need of acute support during the early pandemic phase in Stockholm, Sweden.","Oskar Flygare; Volen Z Ivanov; Roland Sall; Henrik Malaise; Christian Ruck; Nitya Jayaram-Lindstrom; Lina Martinsson","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.10.20229039","20201113","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-13","",7074,""
"Psychometric properties and factor invariance for the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28): study in Peruvian population exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic","Abstract Large-scale epidemics are known to significantly disrupt the mental health and perceived well-being of most populations. In spite of the wide range of screening tools, there are not many reliable and widespread tools for the identification of psychological symptoms in non-clinical populations during a health crisis. Objective: The aim of this study was to conduct a psychometric analysis of the Goldberg's GHQ-28 (1) through a sample of Peruvian adults using confirmatory factor analysis. Materials and methods: 434 individuals have been examined, studying the goodness and structure of the Goldberg GHQ-28 questionnaire. Result: We found high reliability indicating optimal values ( by Cronbach = .829), also there are four correlated factors that show strict invariance among the 28 items. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) were used to examine the structure of the subscales. There are high levels of anxiety (X=1.01) and social dysfunction (X=1.21) in the assessed sampling. Conclusion: The factorial structure obtained in this study is similar to that originally described by the researchers involved in the original questionnaire. It is concluded that GHQ-28 is suitable to explore prevalence of psychopathologies in emergency contexts and social isolation for general non-psychiatric population.

"Mental Health of Keyworkers in the UK during the COVID-19 Pandemic: a Cross-sectional Analysis of a Community Cohort","Objectives: Previous pandemics have resulted in high levels of psychological morbidity among frontline workers. Here we report on the early mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on keyworkers in the UK, as assessed during the first six weeks of nationwide social distancing measures being introduced. Comparisons are made with non-keyworkers, and psychological factors that may be protective to keyworkers mental health are explored. Design: Cross-sectional analysis of a community cohort study. Results: Keyworkers reported significantly higher depression, anxiety, and stress than pre-pandemic population norms. Compared to non-keyworkers, keyworkers were more likely to worry about COVID-19 and perceived they were at higher risk from the virus. This was particularly evident for health and social care keyworkers. Younger keyworkers and those in a clinically increased risk group were more likely to report poorer mental health. Lower positive mood, greater loneliness and worrying more about COVID-19 were all associated with poorer mental health outcomes amongst keyworkers. Conclusions: The mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on keyworkers in the UK has been substantial. Worry about COVID-19 and perceived risk from COVID-19 in keyworkers are understandable given potential increased exposure to the virus. Younger and clinically vulnerable keyworkers may benefit most from any interventions that seek to mitigate the negative mental health impacts of the pandemic.","Kieran Ayling; Ru Jia; Trudie Chalder; Adam Massey; Elizabeth Broadbent; Carol Coupland; Kavita Vedhara","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.11.20229609","20201113","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-13","",7076,""

"Anxiety and depression among people living in quarantine centers during COVID-19 pandemic: A mixed method study from western Nepal","BackgroundIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, incoming travelers were quarantined at specific centers in Nepal and major checkpoints in Nepal-India border. Nepal adopted a generic public health approaches to control and quarantine returnee migrants, with little attention towards the quality of quarantine facilities and its aftermath, such as the poor mental health of the returnee migrants. The main objective of this study was to explore the status of anxiety and depression, and factors affecting them among returnee migrants living in institutional quarantine centers of western Nepal.

MethodsA mixed method approach was used which included a quantitative survey and in-depth interviews (IDIs). Survey questionnaire utilized Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) tools, which were administered among 441 quarantined returnee migrants and IDIs were conducted among 12 participants which included a mix of quarantined migrants and healthcare workers from the quarantine centres. Descriptive and inferential analyses were conducted on quantitative data; and thematic analysis was utilized for qualitative data.

ResultsMild depression (9.1%; 40/441) and anxiety (16.1%, 71/441) was common among respondents followed by moderate depression and anxiety {depression (3.4%; 15/441), anxiety (4.1%, 18/441)} and severe depression and anxiety {depression (1.1%; 5/441), anxiety (0.7%, 3/441)}. Anxiety and depression were independent of their socio-demographic characteristics. Perceived fear of contracting COVID-19, severity and death were prominent among the respondents.

Respondents experienced stigma and discrimination in addition to being at the risk of disease and possible loss of employment and financial responsibilities. In addition, poor (quality and access to) health services, and poor living condition at the quarantine centres adversely affected respondents mental health.

ConclusionDepression and anxiety among quarantined population warrants more research. Institutional quarantine centers of Karnali province of Nepal were in poor conditions which adversely impacted mental health of the respondents. Poor resources allocation for health, hygiene and living conditions can be counterproductive to the population quarantined.","Udaya Bahadur BC; Sunil Pokharel; Sabika Munikar; Chetan Nidhi Wagle; Pratik Adhikary; Brish Bahadur Shahi; Chandra Thapa; Ram Prasad Bhandari; Bipin Adhikari; Kanchan Thapa","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.05.20224436","20201110","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-13","",7078,""

During the pandemic, SUD, a significant problem related to Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is affecting adolescents. The recent available literature also emphasizes understanding the relationship between mental illness and SUD. Hence, it is essential to evaluate the scientific approach and examine the presented findings of articles published on SUD during the COVID-19 pandemic. A systematic review will be conducted using PubMed, PubMed Central, and Scopus bibliographic databases. The grey literature on the impact of SUD on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic among adolescents will be identified using scholar google. The dependability and credibility of the findings will be examined using the ConQual approach. The methodologies of the included studies will be compared using ROBIS (risk of bias in systematic reviews tool), a measurement tool to assess systematic reviews (AMSTAR), and the JBI critical appraisal tool. The systematic review will be carried out on published articles, so it is exempt from ethics approval.

"High-density lipoprotein cholesterol as a factor affecting virus clearance in covid-19 patients","There were COVID-19 patients with SARS-COV-2 nucleic acid long-term positive. This article aims to understand the relevant factors that affect SARS-COV-2 clearance time. The clinical data of 115 COVID-19 patients with SARS-COV-2 nucleic acid positive time exceeding 14 days were collected retrospectively, and the relationship between clinical characteristics, chest CT scans, blood cells, biochemical indicators, and the time of viral nucleic acid turning negative were analyzed. The time from symptom onsets to nucleic acid turning negative was (32.5Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 8.7) days in this group of patients. The time of nucleic acid turning negative: no fever group was longer than fever group, diabetes group was longer than no comorbidity group, elevated levels of ALT (alanine aminotransferase), or GLU (fasting blood glucose) group, decreased levels of ALB (albumin) group or HDLC (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) group was longer than it's normal group separately (PÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.05).

"Bidirectional associations between COVID-19 and psychiatric disorder: retrospective cohort studies of 62Ã¢â‚¬Ë†354 COVID-19 cases in the USA","Adverse mental health consequences of COVID-19, including anxiety and depression, have been widely predicted but not yet accurately measured. There are a range of physical health risk factors for COVID-19, but it is not known if there are also psychiatric risk factors. In this electronic health record network cohort study using data from 69 million individuals, 62Ã¢â‚¬Ë†354 of whom had a diagnosis of COVID-19, we assessed whether a diagnosis of COVID-19 (compared with other health events) was associated with increased rates of subsequent psychiatric diagnoses, and whether patients with a history of psychiatric illness are at a higher risk of being diagnosed with COVID-19. We used the TriNetX Analytics Network, a global federated network that captures anonymised data from electronic health records in 54 health-care organisations in the USA, totalling 69Ã‚Â·8 million patients. TriNetX included 62Ã¢â‚¬Ë†354 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between Jan 20, and Aug 1, 2020. We created cohorts of patients who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 or a range of other health events. We used propensity score matching to control for confounding by risk factors for COVID-19 and for severity of illness. We measured the incidence of and hazard ratios (HRs) for psychiatric disorders, dementia, and insomnia, during the first 14 to 90 days after a diagnosis of COVID-19. In patients with no previous psychiatric history, a diagnosis of COVID-19 was associated with increased incidence of a first psychiatric diagnosis in the following 14 to 90 days compared with six other health events (HR 2Ã‚Â·1, 95% CI 1Ã‚Â·8-2Ã‚Â·5 vs influenza; 1Ã‚Â·7, 1Ã‚Â·5-1Ã‚Â·9 vs other respiratory tract infections; 1Ã‚Â·6, 1Ã‚Â·4-1Ã‚Â·9 vs skin infection; 1Ã‚Â·6, 1Ã‚Â·3-1Ã‚Â·9 vs cholelithiasis; 2Ã‚Â·2, 1Ã‚Â·9-2Ã‚Â·6 vs urolithiasis, and 2Ã‚Â·1, 1Ã‚Â·9-2Ã‚Â·5 vs fracture of a large bone; all p&lt;0Ã‚Â·0001). The HR was greatest for anxiety disorders, insomnia, and dementia. We observed similar findings, although with smaller HRs, when relapses and new diagnoses were measured. The incidence of any psychiatric diagnosis in the 14 to 90 days after COVID-19 diagnosis was 18Ã‚Â·1% (95% CI 17Ã‚Â·6-18Ã‚Â·6), including 5Ã‚Â·8% (5Ã‚Â·2-6Ã‚Â·4) that were a first diagnosis. The incidence of a first diagnosis of dementia in the 14 to 90 days after COVID-19 diagnosis was 1Ã‚Â·6% (95% CI 1Ã‚Â·2-2Ã‚Â·1) in people older than 65 years. A psychiatric diagnosis in the previous year was associated with a higher incidence of COVID-19 diagnosis (relative risk 1Ã‚Â·65, 95% CI 1Ã‚Â·59-1Ã‚Â·71; p&lt;0Ã‚Â·0001). This risk was independent of known physical health risk factors for COVID-19, but we cannot exclude possible residual confounding by socioeconomic factors. Survivors of COVID-19 appear to be at increased risk of psychiatric sequelae, and a psychiatric diagnosis might be an independent risk factor for COVID-19. Although preliminary, our findings have implications for clinical services, and prospective cohort studies are warranted.

"Physical Activity, Screen Time, and Mood Disturbance Among Chinese Adolescents During COVID-19","The purpose of the current study was to explore the physical activity and screen time status among Chinese adolescents during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) lockdown and their association with mood disturbance and conflicts with parents. A total of 1,680 7th to 12th grade students enrolled at a large middle-high school located in Southwest China completed an online survey measuring mood states, physical activity, screen time, conflicts with parents, and body height and weight. Physical activity, particularly of at least 150 minutes' duration each week, significantly decreased the likelihood of negative mood among adolescents during lockdown. Screen time, specifically other than that spent on online study, had a negative association with mood, after controlling for the relevant variables (i.e., physical activity and body mass index). Less screen time and accumulating 150 minutes of physical activity were associated with fewer conflicts with parents. With the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, local school districts, school leaders, and health professionals should develop greater awareness of potential problems with, and engage parents in developing specific guidance on controlling, screen time and promoting physical activity in a time-sensitive manner.

"The psychological states of people after Wuhan eased the lockdown","It has been two months since Wuhan eased the lockdown and the people of Wuhan have been under great pressure during COVID-19. The psychological status among healthcare workers and residents were barely know due to the lack of research after Wuhan eased of the lockdown. The purpose of this study was to assess people's mental health and the changes after Wuhan eased the lockdown. A cross-sectional online study among citizens in Wuhan was conducted. Among 1417 participants, 387(27.0%) were frontline healthcare workers and 1035(73.0%) were residents from the general public. Their COVID-19 psychological status was evaluated using Patient Health Questionnaire-9(PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7), and the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C). Results show that 16.1%,22.3% and 17.2% healthcare workers and 21.2%, 16.7% and 17.2% general public had symptoms of depression, anxiety and PTSD ranging from moderate to severe. Anxiety levels were not significantly different between healthcare workers and the general public. The decreased income and the frequent social media exposure are the risk factors for general public. Compared to the early COVID-19 epidemic period, the proportion of anxiety and depression among both the general public and health workers decreased after Wuhan eased the lockdown. Our finding can be used to help the government of Wuhan to develop psychological interventions to improve the mental health of the population and work as a reference of public health guidelines for other cities with severe COVID-19 outbreak.","Lu, Li, Lu, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0241173","20201112","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-13","",7112,""
"Mental Health-Related Emergency Department Visits Among Children Aged &lt;18 Years During the COVID-19 Pandemic - United States, January 1-October 17, 2020","Published reports suggest that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a negative effect on children's mental health (1,2). Emergency departments (EDs) are often the first point of care for children experiencing mental health emergencies, particularly when other services are inaccessible or unavailable (3). During March 29-April 25, 2020, when widespread shelter-in-place orders were in effect, ED visits for persons of all ages declined 42% compared with the same period in 2019; during this time, ED visits for injury and non-COVID-19-related diagnoses decreased, while ED visits for psychosocial factors increased (4). To assess changes in mental health-related ED visits among U.S. children aged &lt;18 years, data from CDC's National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP) from January 1 through October 17, 2020, were compared with those collected during the same period in 2019. During weeks 1-11 (January 1-March 15, 2020), the average reported number of children's mental health-related ED visits overall was higher in 2020 than in 2019, whereas the proportion of children's mental health-related visits was similar. Beginning in week 12 (March 16) the number of mental health-related ED visits among children decreased 43% concurrent with the widespread implementation of COVID-19 mitigation measures; simultaneously, the proportion of mental health-related ED visits increased sharply beginning in mid-March 2020 (week 12) and continued into October (week 42) with increases of 24% among children aged 5-11 years and 31% among adolescents aged 12-17 years, compared with the same period in 2019. The increased proportion of children's mental health-related ED visits during March-October 2020 might be artefactually inflated as a consequence of the substantial decrease in overall ED visits during the same period and variation in the number of EDs reporting to NSSP. However, these findings provide initial insight into children's mental health in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight the importance of continued monitoring of children's mental health throughout the pandemic, ensuring access to care during public health crises, and improving healthy coping strategies and resiliency among children and families.","Leeb, Bitsko, Radhakrishnan, Martinez, Njai, Holland","https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6945a3","20201112","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-13","",7113,""
"The Relationships of Deteriorating Depression and Anxiety with Longitudinal Behavioral Changes in Google and YouTube Usages among College Students in the United States during COVID-19: Observational Study","Depression and anxiety disorders among the global population are worsened during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Yet, current methods for screening these two issues rely on in-person interviews, which can be expensive, time-consuming, blocked by social stigma and quarantines. Meanwhile, how individuals engage with online platforms such as Google Search and YouTube undergoes drastic shifts due to COVID-19 and subsequent lockdowns. Such ubiquitous daily behaviors on online platforms have the potential to capture and correlate with clinically alarming deteriorations in depression and anxiety profiles of users in a non-invasive manner. The goal of this study is to examine, among college students in the United States, the relationships of deteriorating depression and anxiety conditions with the changes in user behaviors when engaging with Google Search and YouTube during COVID-19. This study recruited a cohort of undergraduate students (N=49) from a U.S. college campus during January 2020 (prior to the pandemic) and measured the anxiety and depression levels of each participant. The anxiety level was assessed via the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7). The depression level was assessed via the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). This study followed up with the same cohort during May 2020 (during the pandemic), and the anxiety and depression levels were assessed again. The longitudinal Google Search and YouTube history data of all participants were anonymized and collected. From individual-level Google Search and YouTube histories, we developed 5 features that can quantify shifts in online behaviors during the pandemic. We then assessed the correlations of deteriorating depression and anxiety profiles with each of these features. We finally demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing the proposed features to build predictive machine learning models. Of the 49 participants, 49% (n=24) of them reported an increase in the PHQ-9 depression scores; 53% (n=26) of them reported an increase in the GAD-7 anxiety scores. The results showed that a number of online behavior features were significantly correlated with deteriorations in the PHQ-9 scores (r ranging between -0.37 and 0.75, PÃ¯â€šÂ£.03) and the GAD-7 scores (r ranging between -0.47 and 0.74, PÃ¯â€šÂ£.03). Simple machine learning models are shown to be useful in predicting the change in anxiety and depression scores (MSE ranging between 2.37 and 4.22, R2 ranging between 0.68 and 0.84) with the proposed features. The results suggested that deteriorating depression and anxiety conditions have strong correlations with behavioral changes in Google Search and YouTube usages during the COVID-19. Though further studies are required, our results demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing pervasive online data to establish non-invasive surveillance systems for mental health conditions that bypasses many disadvantages of existing screening methods.","Zhang, Zaman, Silenzio, Kautz, Hoque","https://doi.org/10.2196/24012","20201112","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-13","",7114,""

This has resulted in the dramatic growth of Video-Based Telemental Health (V-TMH) services. It is critical for behavioral health providers and the mental health field to understand the implication of V-TMH expansion on its stakeholders who use the service, including patients and clinicians, to provide the service that addresses both patients' and clinical needs. Some key questions arise as a result: (1) In what ways does V-TMH affect the practice of psychotherapy? (clinical needs); (2) To what extent are ethical and patient-centered concerns warranted in terms of V-TMH services? (patient needs); and (3) How do factors related to user experience affect treatment dynamics for both the patient and therapist? (patient and clinical needs) We discuss how behavioral health providers can consider the future delivery of mental healthcare services given the questions posed. These questions pose strong implications for technological innovation, adaptations of treatments to new technologies, and the training of professionals delivering V-TMH and other digital health interventions.","Chiauzzi, Clayton, Huh-Yoo","https://doi.org/10.2196/24021","20201112","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-13","",7115,""
"[Moral distress in medical students and young professionals: research desiderata in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic]","The COVID-19 pandemic poses particular challenges for people working in the medical sector.

"Standalone Smartphone Cognitive Behavioral Therapy-Based Ecological Momentary Interventions to Increase Mental Health: Narrative Review","A growing number of psychological interventions are delivered via smartphones with the aim of increasing the efficacy and effectiveness of these treatments and providing scalable access to interventions for improving mental health. Most of the scientifically tested apps are based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) principles, which are considered the gold standard for the treatment of most mental health problems. This review investigates standalone smartphone-based ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) built on principles derived from CBT that aim to improve mental health. We searched the MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and PubMed databases for peer-reviewed studies published between January 1, 2007, and January 15, 2020. We included studies focusing on standalone app-based approaches to improve mental health and their feasibility, efficacy, or effectiveness. Both within- and between-group designs and studies with both healthy and clinical samples were included. Blended interventions, for example, app-based treatments in combination with psychotherapy, were not included. Selected studies were evaluated in terms of their design, that is, choice of the control condition, sample characteristics, EMI content, EMI delivery characteristics, feasibility, efficacy, and effectiveness. The latter was defined in terms of improvement in the primary outcomes used in the studies. A total of 26 studies were selected. The results show that EMIs based on CBT principles can be successfully delivered, significantly increase well-being among users, and reduce mental health symptoms. Standalone EMIs were rated as helpful (mean 70.8%, SD 15.3; n=4 studies) and satisfying for users (mean 72.6%, SD 17.2; n=7 studies). Study quality was heterogeneous, and feasibility was often not reported in the reviewed studies, thus limiting the conclusions that can be drawn from the existing data. Together, the studies show that EMIs may help increase mental health and thus support individuals in their daily lives. Such EMIs provide readily available, scalable, and evidence-based mental health support. These characteristics appear crucial in the context of a global crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic but may also help reduce personal and economic costs of mental health impairment beyond this situation or in the context of potential future pandemics.","Marciniak, Shanahan, Rohde, Schulz, Wackerhagen, KobyliÃ…â€žska, Tuescher, Binder, Walter, Kalisch, Kleim","https://doi.org/10.2196/19836","20201112","CBT; COVID-19; EMI; cognitive behavioral therapy; ecological momentary intervention; mHealth; mobile app; mobile phone; smartphone","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-13","",7117,""
"&quot;At home, with care&quot;: Lessons from New York City Home-based Primary Care practices managing COVID-19","COVID-19 required rapid innovation throughout the health care system. Home-based primary care (HBPC) practices faced unique challenges maintaining services for medically complex older populations for whom they needed to adapt a traditionally hands-on, model of care to accommodate restrictions on in-person contact. Our aim was to determine strategies used by New York City-area HBPC practices to provide patient care during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic with the goal of informing planning and preparation for home-based practices nationwide. Cross-sectional qualitative design using semi-structured interviews and inductive and deductive thematic analysis. HBPC practices in the New York City (NYC) metro area during spring 2020. HBPC leadership including clinical/medical directors, program managers, nurse practitioners/nursing coordinators and social workers/social work coordinators (n=13) at 6 NYC-area practices. Participants described care delivery and operational adaptations similar to those universally adopted across health care settings during COVID-19, such as patient outreach and telehealth. HBPC-specific adaptations included mental health services for patients experiencing depression and isolation, using multiple modalities of patient interactions to balance virtual care with necessary in-person contact, strategies to maintain patient trust, and supporting team connection of staff through daily huddles and emotional support during the surge of deaths among long-standing patients. NYC-area HBPC providers adapted care delivery and operations rapidly during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Keeping older, medically complex patients safe in their homes required considerable flexibility, transparency, teamwork and partnerships with outside providers. As the pandemic continues to surge around the US, HBPC providers may apply these lessons and consider resources needed to prepare for future challenges. This article is protected by copyright.

"Comparison of COVID-19 and MERS Risk Communication in Korea: A Case Study of TV Public Service Advertisements","In recent years, the world has been under threat of novel infectious diseases such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Governmental risk communication plays a key role in overcoming the public health crises caused by the emergence of these infectious diseases. The purpose of this study was to identify the focus of Korean public service advertisements (PSAs) in response to the MERS and COVID-19 outbreaks, along with the differences between them. A total of five MERS and 17 COVID-19 TV PSAs were analyzed using Lasswell's Sender, Message, Channel, Receiver, and Effect model and the responses of the Korean government were compared between the MERS and COVID-19 outbreaks. During the MERS outbreak, the Korean government failed to gain the public's trust through its PSAs. Despite its best efforts, it provided opaque and selective information on the crisis. Conversely, in the case of COVID-19, the Korean government has successfully worked to strengthen community awareness by supporting and encouraging the public. Despite the Korean government's improved communication in the COVID-19 crisis, there has been an insufficient response to the needs of vulnerable groups that could be placed in at-risk situations as a result of domestic violence or mental health problems during outbreaks of novel infectious diseases that require aggressive management.","Park, Ha","https://doi.org/10.2147/RMHP.S269230","20201112","SARS-CoV-2; community awareness; coronavirus disease; public health crisis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-13","",7119,""
"Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Its Associated Factors Among Health Care Workers Fighting COVID-19 in Southern Ethiopia","Healthcare workers (HCWs) are among the many groups of people who are in the frontline caring for people and facing heavy workloads, life-or-death decisions, risk of infection, and have been facing various psychosocial problems. So, monitoring mental health issues to understand the mediating factors and inform evidence-based interventions in a timely fashion is vital. This study aimed to assess generalized anxiety disorder and its associated factors among HCWs fighting COVID-19 in Southern Ethiopia. An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 798 HCWs from 20 May to 20 June 2020. A pre-tested and structured interviewer-administered KOBO collect survey tool was used to collect data. The study participants were selected using a simple random sampling technique by allocating a proportion to each health institute. The association between the level of generalized anxiety disorder and its independent variables was examined by ordinal logistic regression. Assumptions for the proportional odds model were checked using parallel line tests. An adjusted proportional odds ratio with a 95% CI was used to calculate the strength of the statistical association between the independent and dependent variables. The prevalence of mild and moderate anxiety disorder among HCWs was 29.3% and 6.3%, respectively. Contact with confirmed or suspected cases (aPOR =1.97; 95% CI: 1.239, 3.132), no COVID-19 updates (aPOR=4.816, 95% CI=2.957, 7.842), no confidence on coping with stresses (aPOR=2.74, 95% CI=1.633, 4.606), and COVID-19-related worry (aPOR=1.85, 95% CI=1.120, 3.056) were positively associated with higher-order anxiety disorder. However, not feeling overwhelmed by the demands of everyday life (aPOR=0.52, 95% CI=0.370, 0.733) and feeling cannot make it (aPOR=0.44, 95% CI=0.308, 0.626) were negatively associated with a higher order of anxiety. The study revealed that the prevalence of anxiety disorder among HCWs was high in the study area. The findings of the current study suggest immediate psychological intervention for health care workers in the study area is vital. Therefore, proactive measures should be taken by the stakeholders at different hierarchies to promote the psychological wellbeing of HCWs in order to control the impact of the pandemic on the HCWs, and containing the pandemic.","Teshome, Glagn, Shegaze, Tekabe, Getie, Assefa, Getahun, Kanko, Getachew, Yenesew, Temtmie, Tolosie","https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S282822","20201112","Ethiopia; anxiety; associated factor; health care workers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-13","",7120,""
"Coping with COVID-19 in United Nations peacekeeping field hospitals: increased workload and mental stress for military healthcare providers","This study aimed to explore the impact of COVID-19 on the United Nations peacekeeping field hospitals where medical supply and manpower are extremely insufficient. A level II hospital was deployed in Wau, South Sudan, as the regional referral centre of the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS). It had a total strength of 63 personnel with 47 medical staff (average age 38.3Ã‚Â±8.0 years, 33 men). A new 'appointment-triage-disinfection' work pattern was adopted to cope with the COVID-19 outbreak in the mission. Data on medical service statistics and workload before/after the outbreak were collected and compared. The mental health of staff was analysed from the quarterly psychological survey, including Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)-10, Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD)-7 and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9. The number of outpatients decreased slightly after the COVID-19 outbreak (41.9Ã‚Â±11.9 to 37.6Ã‚Â±11.8 per week, p=0.49), whereas the weekly hospital length of stay of inpatients increased significantly (0.4Ã‚Â±1.0 to 3.1Ã‚Â±3.9 days, p=0.02). Total weekly working hours increased from 1884.9Ã‚Â±34.1 to 2023.5Ã‚Â±67.3 hours (p&lt;0.001). Elevated mental stress (PSS-10: 4.3Ã‚Â±2.4 in February to 7.5Ã‚Â±3.9 in May, p&lt;0.001; GAD-7: 4.0Ã‚Â±2.3 to 9.4Ã‚Â±4.0, p&lt;0.001; PHQ-9: 2.1Ã‚Â±1.2 to 3.2Ã‚Â±2.4, p&lt;0.001) was documented among healthcare providers after the outbreak. The threat of COVID-19 infection, delay in rotation and family-related concerns constituted the main stressors. COVID-19 imposes a huge pressure on peacekeeping field hospitals. Increased workload and mental stress among frontline healthcare providers deserve the attention of UNMISS officials. Facilitating the rotation of the medical staff might potentially improve the operational readiness of the hospital by bringing in well-trained personnel and sufficient medical supplies.","Zhang, Xiang, Alejok","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjmilitary-2020-001642","20201112","health &amp; safety; infection control; infectious diseases; mental health; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-13","",7121,""
"Containing COVID: the establishment and management of a COVID-19 ward in an adult psychiatric hospital","As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in the UK emerged and escalated, clinicians working in mental health in-patient facilities faced unique medical, psychiatric and staffing challenges in managing and containing the impact of the virus and, in the context of legislation, enforcing social distancing. To describe (a) the steps taken by one mental health hospital to establish a COVID-19 isolation ward for adult psychiatric in-patients and (b) how staff addressed the challenges that emerged over the period March to June 2020. A descriptive study detailing the processes involved in changing the role of the ward and the measures taken to address the various challenges that arose. Brief clinical cases of two patients are included for illustrative purposes. We describe the achievements, lessons learned and outcomes of the process of repurposing a mental health triage ward into a COVID-19 isolation facility, including the impact on staff. Flexibility, rapid problem-solving and close teamwork were essential. Some of the changes made will be sustained on the ward in our primary role as a triage ward. Although the challenges faced were difficult, the legacy they have left is that of a range of improvements in patient care and the working environment.","Knowles, Aref-Adib, Moslehi, Aubrey-Jones, Obeney-Williams, Leveson, Galis, Pitman","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2020.126","20201112","COVID-19; In-patient treatment; physical health; psychiatry and law; staff well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-13","",7122,""
"A stoic and altruistic orientation towards their work: a qualitative study of healthcare professionals' experiences of awaiting a COVID-19 test result","Extensive measures to reduce person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 are required to control the current outbreak. Special attention is directed at healthcare professionals as reducing the risk of infection in healthcare is essential. The purpose of this study was to explore healthcare professionals' experiences of awaiting a test result for a potential COVID-19 infection. Qualitative interviews with 15 healthcare professionals were performed, underpinned by a phenomenological hermeneutical analytical framework. The participating healthcare professionals' experiences of awaiting a COVID-19 test result were found to be associated with a stoic and altruistic orientation towards their work. These healthcare professionals presented a strong professional identity overriding most concerns about their own health. The result of the coronavirus test was a decisive parameter for whether healthcare professionals could return to work. The healthcare professionals were aware that their family and friends were having a hard time knowing that the COVID-19 infection risk was part of their jobs. This concern did not, however, cause the healthcare professionals to falter in their belief that they were doing the right thing by focusing on their core area. The threat to own health ran through the minds of the healthcare professionals occasionally, which makes access to testing particularly important. The participating healthcare professionals had a strong professional identity. However, a discrepancy between an altruistic role as a healthcare professional and the expectations that come from the community was illuminated. A mental health coronavirus hotline for healthcare professionals is suggested.","Missel, Bernild, Dagyaran, Christensen, Berg","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-020-05904-0","20201112","2019-nCoV; COVID-19; Coronavirus; Healthcare professionals; Qualitative study; Testing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-13","",7123,""
"Occupational stress, mental health, and self-efficacy among community mental health workers: A cross-sectional study during COVID-19 pandemic","During the COVID-19, community mental health care workers (CMHWs) faced much heavier workloads, which make them vulnerable to mental problems. This study aims to investigate coronavirus disease-related occupational stress and its single and cumulative effect on mental health and self-efficacy among CMHWs. A quick-response online cross-sectional survey WA conducted during the coronavirus disease outbreak. A total of 536 CMHWs were recruited in March 2020, in China. Demographics, occupational stress, depression, anxiety, positive and negative emotions, and self-efficacy were collected. Logistic regression analysis was employed to test the single and cumulative effect of occupational stress on mental health and self-efficacy. CMHWs did not show high level of depression or anxiety in this study. Those who provided service for suspected people who were quarantined reported higher risk of depression and anxiety. Staying out for more than 3 days was a risk factor of depression while cleaning/sterilising streets or communities was a protective factor of depression. Those who received psychiatric training showed higher positive emotion and self-efficacy, and providing psychological assistance online increased the self-efficacy. CMHWs with two different types of work had 0.996 times more risk of depression than those with only one type of work. The potential cumulative effect of occupation stress suggested that reasonable job assignment and organisational support are necessary safeguards for CMHWs.","Sun, Song, Liu, Mao, Sun, Cao","https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764020972131","20201112","Coronavirus; anxiety; community networks; depression; emotions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-13","",7124,""

"Anxiety and depression levels in Covid-19 disease and their relation to hypertension","<b>Objectives</b>: The study aimed to assess the relation of anxiety and depression levels with hypertension in COVID-19 outbreak. The analysis of the association of selected socio-demographic and clinical parameters on the presence and severity of psychological distress was also performed. <b>Methods</b>: The study involved 91 patients applying with a medical history supportive of COVID-19 infection. According to the hospitalization criteria and diagnostic result of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test certainty of the disease, three groups were created. Patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test results were consisted of 31 hospitalized subjects. To assess the applicant psychological state, a specially developed questionnaire was used, as the presence and severities of the symptoms were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). <b>Results</b>: Statistically, a significantly higher average level of depression and a higher incidence of anxiety were demonstrated among applicants in the Covid-19 pandemic (% 24 and % 44). Also a higher level of anxiety was demonstrated in hospitalized patients compared with the outpatient group. Different from the presence of depression symptoms, the presence of anxiety symptoms was associated independently with hypertension in our study group OR 2.6 (95% CI, 0.99-6.78) <i>P</i> =Ã‚Â .04). <b>Conclusions</b>: In the aftermath of COVID-19 outbreak both anxiety and depression are common psychological disorders. Also, different from the symptoms of depression, the symptoms of anxiety are associated independently with hypertension. The described socio-demographic parameters and clinical characteristics had no impact on the symptoms of depression and anxiety irrespective of hospitalized status in the investigated groups.","Sensoy, Gunes, Ari","https://doi.org/10.1080/10641963.2020.1847132","20201112","Covid-19; Depression; anxiety","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-13","",7126,""

"Nine Months in the Life of a College Student During 2020: A Case Study Using Multi-Modal Assessments to Capture Personalized Contexts of Well-being","Emerging adulthood is a period marked by tremendous growth and opportunity, but also of significant risk. It is during this phase that the majority of major disease processes have their onset and also the time during which individuals develop habits for adaptive ways of managing stress and help-seeking when necessary. Recent work has demonstrated the feasibility of estimating stress levels through monitoring of physiological signs of sympathetic nervous system activity (e.g., heart rate, heart rate variability, respiration rate, galvanic skin response, etc.) using wearable devices. However, this method of objective monitoring only captures changes in internal states but not the contextual factors â€“ such as mental activity and social interactions â€“ that are critical for diagnosis, treatment and prevention of mental health problems that may follow from the long-term effects of stress. Thus, there is a fundamental need to capture higher-level life events and contextual information to enable root cause analysis for treatment and prevention. The proposed case study is part of a larger pilot study in which we intensely follow a small sample of college students over the course of 9-months during an historic and tumultuous year in which COVID-19 disrupted daily living to understand contextual factors relevant to their mental health while capturing mood, sleep, physical activity, and physiology. In this case study, we showcase a single participant as support for the feasibility and potential of this approach for understanding more personalized models for mental health and treatment.","Jessica Borelli et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4618F-A2A-040","20201112","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Early Adulthood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; emerging adulthood; covid-19; ema; personalized approaches; iot; internet-of-things; young adulthood; wiot; mental health; wearable internet-of-things","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-13","",7128,""
