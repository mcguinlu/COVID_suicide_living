"Impact of COVID-19 on Employment: Exploring the Perspectives of Job Loss and Mental Health of Individuals From Minimal-Resource Communities","This qualitative study examines the experiences of COVID-19 job loss by individuals from minimal-resource communities. Six participants were interviewed regarding their experience with becoming unemployed during the global pandemic. In general, participants described experiences that aligned with the core tenets of Gowan and Gatewood's (1997) model of response to job loss, as well as additional subthemes, including (a) internal support, (b) external support/resources, (c) survival, (d) mind-set, (e) emotion regulation, and (f) mental health effects. Implications are provided to career practitioners with consideration of these experiences when working with unemployed individuals who have limited resources.","Wright, Galaxina G.; Herbert, Lea, Hilaire, Breahannah, Campbell, Laurie O.","https://doi.org/10.1002/cdq.12275","","Database: Wiley; Publication details: The Career Development Quarterly; 69(4):299-312, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23647,""
"Student experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic: Perspectives from first-generation/lower-income students and others","Twenty-eight University of Michigan students (12 first-generation/low-income and 16 from more educated, affluent families) were invited online to provide open-ended responses and photographs representative of their experiences during COVID-19, in a modified Photovoice approach. Given the literature, we expected that cultural mismatch, class stereotypes, and relative deprivation would be relevant features of the accounts of self-identified first-generation/lower-income students? experience, in contrast to their peers. Using thematic analysis, three themes differentiated the written accounts of the experiences of the two groups of students: changed environmental demands, comparison to similar or different other students, and change or continuity in the availability of institutional support. Both groups of students shared concerns about issues with mental health, and concern for family. While first-generation/lower-income students reported that they experienced less access to space and quiet for their schoolwork, their counterparts reported that their conditions for studying were better. Additionally, when comparing themselves to others, first-generation students mentioned their best guesses about the experiences of more affluent students, while nonfirst-generation students tended to compare themselves to those like themselves. Finally, while nonfirst-generation students wrote of continued institutional support and dedication to schoolwork, first-generation students reported having fewer resources for academic success.","Kiebler, Jessica M.; Stewart, Abigail J.","https://doi.org/10.1111/asap.12288","","Database: Wiley; Publication details: Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23648,""
"Examination of the Japanese version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale among Adults Using Classical Test Theory and Item Response Theory12","Globally, the COVID-19 pandemic has impaired every aspect of life, especially causing much psychological damage?for instance, increasing the risk of suicide. Intense fear and anxiety are considered to play a central role in mental health problems. This study examined the psychological properties of the Japanese version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) using classical test theory (CTT) and item response theory (IRT). Five hundred fifty participants aged 18?69?years and from across Japan completed questionnaires, including the Japanese FCV-19S, the Japanese Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-15 (DASS-15), and the Japanese version of the Kessler 6 (K6). CTT showed that each item of the Japanese FCV-19S had no ceiling and floor effect and was close to the normal distribution, and IRT revealed that each item had an appropriate parameter of discrimination and difficulty. Finally, the Japanese FCV-19S was shown to have an acceptable reliability and moderate good concurrent validity. Consequently, the Japanese FCV-19S has robust psychometric properties and can be useful for early detection of adults impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Adachi, Keiichiro, Yada, Hironori, Odachi, Ryo","https://doi.org/10.1111/jpr.12398","","Database: Wiley; Publication details: Japanese Psychological Research;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23649,""
"Forensic Evaluators' Opinions on the Use of Videoconferencing Technology for Competency to Stand Trial Evaluations After the Onset of COVID-19","We surveyed practicing forensic psychologists (N = 176) in the United States after the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic to obtain their opinions about using videoconferencing for competence to stand trial evaluations. The survey included a broad range of questions to identify perceived concerns about, and benefits of, videoconferencing. Many of the evaluators who reported having conducted a competence evaluation using videoconferencing had done so only after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic (79.7%). Evaluators expressed concerns that the results of videoconferencing evaluations were slightly less reliable (M = 73.6% agreement) than in-person evaluations (M = 79.2%, d = .57 [.43, .70]), but agreed that videoconferencing has the potential to make the evaluation process more efficient for evaluators (77.2%) and to reduce evaluation wait times for defendants (83.8%). The most common concerns were about the ability to assess general mental health symptoms (42.7%) and feigning (68.1%), as opposed to specific psycholegal abilities (10% to 30%). Overall, those who had used videoconferencing for a competence evaluation or had received training related to videoconferencing were less likely to endorse concerns about its use. Findings represent a first step in providing data to inform ongoing discussions about professional standards for using videoconferencing for competence evaluations.","Trupp, G. F.; Ricardo, M.

"Prevalence of adjustment disorder in Poland during the COVID-19 pandemic and its association with symptoms of anxiety and depression","Purpose: Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, many new stressors have arisen, which is associated with an increased risk of mental disorders. The purpose of this article is to assess the prevalence of adjustment disorder and symptoms of anxiety and depression in the Polish population, on the basis of two studies conducted during the pandemic. Methods: Two online survey studies were conducted at different time points: the first in March 2020 on a N = 1742 sample, the second in June 2020, on the sample of N = 567. In both cases, the same self-description questionnaires were used to measure adjustment disorder, depression and generalized anxiety. Results: In Study I, 75% of participants considered the COVID-19 pandemic to be highly stressful and 43% declared they met the criteria for adjustment disorder. When anxiety and depression were excluded 8.4% of participants met the criteria. On the other hand, in Study II, the criteria for this disorder (without the exclusion of other disorders) were met by 52%. In both studies, significant positive correlations were observed between the symptoms of adjustment disorder and those of anxiety and depression. Conclusions: The research provides important data on the mental health of Poles during the pandemic. The proportion of people who have potentially met the criteria for adjustment disorder, as well as for depression and anxiety, seems very high. It is advisable to continue monitoring the occurrence of these disorders, depending on developments in the changing context of the pandemic.","Juszczyk, A.; Dragan, M.; Grajewski, P.; Holas, P.","https://doi.org/10.5114/ppn.2021.110764","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Postepy Psychiatrii I Neurologii; 30(3):141-153, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23651,""
"Anorexia nervosa and the gastrointestinal tract","Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a complex eating disorder associated with a high morbidity and mortality, however, there is a lack of dedicated training for healthcare professionals outside of mental health specialities. There has been a reported increase in acute admissions of patients with AN, which may have been precipitated by the isolation and loss of support networks created by the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this review is to highlight that AN can present with a wide variety of signs and symptoms relating to both the hollow and solid organs of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract some of which may even be life threatening. The overlap of symptoms with several other functional and organic GI diseases makes diagnosis challenging. Gastroenterologists and allied healthcare professionals need to be aware of the wide array of possible GI manifestations not only to help rationalise investigations but to also facilitate early involvement of the relevant multidisciplinary teams. Many of the GI manifestations of AN can be reversed with careful nutritional therapy under the guidance of nutrition support teams.","Jafar, W.; Morgan, J.","https://doi.org/10.1136/flgastro-2021-101857","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Frontline Gastroenterology;: 9, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23652,""
"Mental health patterns during COVID-19 in emergency medical services (EMS)","Purpose This study aims to explore patterns of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) personnel's mental health, regarding their levels of anxiety, depression, stress, COVID-19 anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms and well-being;and to explore variables that contribute to these patterns, among sociodemographic/professional and COVID-19 experience variables. Design/methodology/approach Participants were 214 EMS personnel, who answered the Patient-Health Questionnaire, Perceived Stress Scale, COVID-19 Anxiety Scale, Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory, Well-Being Questionnaire and COVID-19 related questions. Findings EMS personnel showed an adequate psychological adjustment during COVID-19. Two clusters/patterns were found: the poorly (34%) and the well (66%) psychologically-adjusted. Personnel's age, COVID-19 fear and workplace security measures' adequacy contributed to which pattern they were more likely to belong to. Research limitations/implications Despite being cross-sectional and not controlling for pre-COVID-19 data, this study adds to the COVID-19 literature. Findings call for the need to explore: other COVID-19 fears;how personnel perceive workplace security measures;COVID-19 valid instruments;pre-COVID-19 data;and mental health patterns with different rescuers. Practical implications Findings explored EMS personnel's patterns of mental health during the COVID-19, as well as its covariates. Results allow to better prepare emergency management, which can develop prevention strategies focused on older professionals, COVID-19 related fears and how personnel assess security measures. Originality/value This study contributes to the scarce literature focused on COVID-19 mental health patterns instead of focussing on isolated mental health variables, as well as what contributes to these patterns. Moreover, it is one of the few studies that focused on EMS personnel rather than hospital staff.","Fonseca, S. M.; Faria, S.; Cunha, S.; Silva, M.; Ramos, M. J.; Azevedo, G.; Campos, R.; Barbosa, A.

"Left Alone Outside: A Prospective Observational Cohort Study on Mental Health Outcomes Among Relatives of COVID-19 Hospitalized Patients","Hospitalization due to COVID-19 bears many psychological challenges. While focusing on infected patients, their relatives are being largely neglected. Here, we investigated the mental health implications of hospitalization among relatives over a one-month course. A single center study was conducted to assess relatives of COVID-19 patients during the first month from their admission to the hospital and elucidate risk and protective factors for mental health deterioration. Ninety-one relatives of the first patients to be hospitalized in Israel were contacted by phone and screened for anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) at three time points (25-72 hours, 7-18 days, and one month). We found that anxiety and depression decreased significantly during the first month from their admission. Risk factors for deteriorated mental health at one month included feelings of mental exhaustion, financial concerns, and social disconnection. Being ultra-orthodox was a protective factor for anxiety and depression but not PTSS.

"Associations between psychiatric morbidity and COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy: An analysis of electronic health records and patient survey","Psychiatric illness confers significant risk for severe COVID-19 morbidity and mortality;identifying psychiatric risk factors for vaccine hesitancy is critical to mitigating risk in this population. This study examined the prevalence of vaccine hesitancy among those with psychiatric illness and the associations between psychiatric morbidity and vaccine hesitancy. Data came from electronic health records and a patient survey obtained from 14,365 patients at a group medical practice between February and May, 2021. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds for vaccine hesitancy adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics and physical comorbidity. OfÂ 14,365 participants 1,761 (12.3%)Â participants reported vaccine hesitancy. Vaccine hesitancy was significantly more prevalent among participants with substance use (29.6%), attention deficit and hyperactivity (23.3%), posttraumatic stress (23.1%), bipolar (18.0%), generalized anxiety (16.5%), major depressive (16.1%), other anxiety (15.5%), and tobacco use disorders (18.6%), and those previously infected with COVID-19 (19.8%) compared to participants without these disorders. After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and physical comorbidities, substance use disorders and tobacco use were significantly associated with increased odds for vaccine hesitancy and bipolar disorder was significantly inversely associated with vaccine hesitancy.

"Wellbeing of Employees During COVID-19 Pandemic: A Study of Innovative HR Practices of Organisations","The whole world has been battling through the COVID-19 pandemic which has resulted in the prevailing global crisis. There has been an adverse impact of this pandemic on economic, physical and psychological/mental wellbeing of the people. Many researchers have found that COVID-19 related anxiety is leading to psychological and behavioural changes. Most reported psychological changes are depression, psychological distress, worry, anxiety about being infected, subjective wellbeing and reduced quality of life. These behavioural and psychological changes are reducing the effectiveness of the workforce which is eventually taking a toll on the overall productivity. Several organisations have implemented a number of strategies to deal with the unforeseen challenges faced by their employees.

"Mattering and Anti-Mattering in Emotion Regulation and Life Satisfaction: A Mediational Analysis of Stress and Distress During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The current study focused primarily on the associations that feelings of not mattering have with life satisfaction, stress, and distress among students trying to cope with the uncertain and novel circumstances brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. A sample of 350 University students from Italy completed measures that included the General Mattering Scale and the Anti-Mattering Scale, as well as measures of self-esteem, difficulties in emotion regulation, life satisfaction, perceived stress, anxiety, and depression. Psychometric analyses confirmed the factor structure, reliability, and validity of the General Mattering Scale and the Anti-Mattering Scale. As expected, feelings of not mattering were associated with lower life satisfaction as well as with greater reported difficulties in emotion regulation, stress, and distress. Mattering and self-esteem were both unique predictors of levels of life satisfaction during the pandemic. The results of mediational analyses suggested that individuals who feel as though they do not matter may be especially vulnerable to stress, depression, and anxiety and this may promote a decline in life satisfaction. Given the potential destructiveness of feelings of not mattering, in general but especially during a global pandemic, it is essential to proactively develop interventions and programs that are designed to enhance feelings of mattering and reduce anti-mattering experiences and feelings.","Giangrasso, Barbara, Casale, Silvia, Fioravanti, Giulia, Flett, Gordon L.; Nepon, Taryn","https://doi.org/10.1177/07342829211056725","","Database: Sage; Publication details: Journal of Psychoeducational Assessment;: 07342829211056725, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23662,""

It details the redesign of the evaluation to ensure methods wrapped around the modified product and could deliver real-time, practical insights. The paper seeks to fill knowledge gaps in the DHI evaluation space and outlines four key principles that support evaluation re-design in an agile setting. These include a user-centred approach to evaluation design, proportionate data collection, mixed (and flexible) methodologies, and agile evaluation reporting. The paper concludes with key lessons and reflections from the evaluators about what worked at Movember, to support other evaluators planning digital evaluations.","Erskine, Kathryn, Healey, Matt","https://doi.org/10.1177/1035719X211053072","","Database: Sage; Publication details: Evaluation Journal of Australasia;: 1035719X211053072, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23663,""

"Crafting Conscious Employee Engagement through Wellbeing: A Key Differentiator to Long-Term Organizational Success within the Hospitality Industry","Discussions on pandemics that hit the human race have dominated the scientific research world, on the contrary, due to the developments in technology and globalisation the work environment has evolved into a complex space and for this reason, there is a wide research gap on how the workforce can get back to normal or cope with an ever-changing pandemic phenomenon. The objectives of the current paper are aligned to identify the impact of Covid-19 on different levels of the employeesâ€™ life, to analyse the effect on mental health and wellbeing, and to formulate a relationship between mindful employee engagement and its impact on organisational success. The current scenario requires the employees to continue working from home for the businesses to sustain themselves in the future. By reviewing 20 research articles, an understanding is developed of the remote-work model and its positive and negative impacts on employees as well as organisations. Using a semi-structured questionnaire to interview service industry professionals, data has been gathered. Using a semi-structured analysis the authors aim to illustrate the pandemicâ€™s effects from the employeesâ€™ perspective.

"Perceived stress and subjective well-being of COVID-19 confinement in Latin American pediatric dentists and dental students: A cross sectional study","Aim: The COVID-19 pandemic, the first registered in the last 100 years, triggered fear and uncertainty, with manifestations related to stress, anxiety, and depression, mainly in health professionals. The study aimed to evaluate the psychological impact of the community quarantine, implemented due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in pediatric dentists and pediatric dentistry graduate students in Latin America. Materials and Methods: Convenience sample made up of 139 pediatric dentists and postgraduate pediatric dentistry students from different Latin American countries, who were asked to fill out a questionnaire, submitted electronically, with prior authorization of participation through an informed consent. The anonymity of the participants was protected using identification codes, and only their email address was requested for subsequent follow-up. Results: The multivariate model shows an association between the value of the PSS-14 v25 questionnaire and the different study variables;thus, the variablesâ€”quality of sleep (P = 0.001), number of biosafety measures (P=0.02), age (P = 0.04), and perception of their state of health (P = 0.03)â€”were statistically significant in the perceived stress and subjective well-being, caused by COVID-19 lockdown. In the same way, in the most representative demographic variables related to the affective and social support perceived by the participant, it was observed that, with increasing age, there is a decrease in perceived affective support and, consequently, in participants with mandatory quarantine and time restriction;there is a perception of not having emotional support. Conclusion: The disease caused by COVID-19 has modified the habits and quality of life of all professionals in the health field. The psychological impact that the community quarantine implemented due to the COVID-19 pandemic has produced is evident, as older and female individuals more frequently present signs of stress and anxiety, manifested by fear and uncertainty.","Ortega-LÃ³pez, Fernanda, Armas-Vega, Ana, Parise-Vasco, Juan Marcos, Agudelo-SuÃ¡rez, AndrÃ©s, Arroyo-Bonilla, David, Viteri-GarcÃ­a, AndrÃ©s","https://doi.org/10.4103/JIOH.JIOH_148_21","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Journal of International Oral Health; 13(6):623-630, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23666,""
"Implementing Trauma-Informed Education Practices in Undergraduate Mental Health Nursing Education","Background: Nursing students may have risk factors for trauma reactivation through learning activities conducted as part of their education and training. Trauma-informed education practices (TIEP) could help reduce this risk. Method: Course policies, content, procedures, and support structures consistent with the tenets of TIEP were implemented in undergraduate mental health courses with traditional third-year nursing students at two universities. Results: Students responded positively to the implementation of TIEP. Most (92%) qualitative feedback students provided in formal evaluations was directly related to at least one principle of TIEP, most commonly â€œpromoting social, emotional, and academic safety.â€ Some students (39.3%) interpreted TIEP as demonstrations of â€œgenuineâ€ caring for the students as individuals and their own mental health. Conclusion: Integrating TIEP into an undergraduate nursing mental health course is feasible and beneficial and allows faculty to role model skills and values central to nursing practice.

"Influence of socioeconomic variables on physical activity and screen time of children and adolescents during the COVID-19 lockdown in Germany: the MoMo study","The COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic created aÂ multitude of natural experiments about the change of human behavior in aÂ widely unfamiliar situation. Besides physical and mental health, physical activity (PA) and peopleâ€™s movement behaviors were of particular interest to researchers all over the world. In aÂ recent study, we found that among youth in Germany, sports activity declined, whereas recreational screen time and habitual activity increased during the first COVID-19 lockdown. In the present study, we analyze the influence of the socioeconomic status and the housing situation on the changes in PA behavior and recreational screen-time before and during the first COVID-19 lockdown among children and adolescents living in Germany. We found an alignment of PA behavior among youth from families with different socioeconomic backgrounds during the first lockdown and identified the housing situation to be aÂ meaningful predictor of the increase in habitual activity. We conclude that restriction policies, communities, and in the last instance parents need to enable access to nonorganized PA to all children and adolescents every day and especially during potential future lockdowns.","Schmidt, Steffen C.

"Post-viral mental health sequelae in infected persons associated with COVID-19 and previous epidemics and pandemics: Systematic review and meta-analysis of prevalence estimates","Aims Post-viral mental health problems (MHP) in COVID-19 patients and survivors were anticipated already during early stages of this pandemic. We aimed to synthesize the prevalence of the anxiety, depression, post-traumatic and general distress domain associated with virus epidemics since 2002. Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase from 2002 until April 14, 2021 for peer-reviewed studies reporting prevalence of MHP in adults with laboratory-confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-1, H1N1, MERS-CoV, H7N9, Ebolavirus, or SARS-CoV-2 infection. We included studies that assessed post-viral MHP with validated and frequently used scales. A three-level random-effects meta-analysis for dependent sizes was conducted to account for multiple outcome reporting. We pooled MHP across all domains and separately by severity (above mild or moderate-to-severe) and by acute (one month), ongoing (one to three months), and post-illness stages (longer than three months). A meta-regression was conducted to test for moderating effects, particularly for exploring estimate differences between SARS-Cov-2 and previous pandemics and epidemics. PROSPERO registration: CRD42020194535. Results We identified 59 studies including between 14 to 1002 participants and providing 187 prevalence estimates. MHP, in general, decreased from acute to post-illness from 46<U+25A1>3% to 38<U+25A1>8% and for mild and moderate-to-severe from 22<U+25A1>3% to 18<U+25A1>8%, respectively. We found no evidence of moderating effects except for non-random sampling and H1N1 showing higher prevalence. Pooled MHP differed somewhat between previous pandemics/ epidemics and SARS-CoV-2 but were in a comparable range. Conclusions MHP prevalence estimates decreased over time but were still on a substantial level at post-illness. Post-viral mental health problems caused by SARS-CoV-2 could have been expected much earlier, given the previous post-viral sequelae.","ZÃ¼rcher, Simeon Joel, Banzer, CÃ©line, Adamus, Christine, Lehmann, Anja, Richter, Dirk, Kerksieck, Philipp","https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.29.21259615","","Database: other preprints; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23670,""
"Poison or Cure? a Study on the Periodic Sponge Effect in Denmarkâ€™s Tourism Industry","This paper investigates the crucial role of tourism with the periodic sponge effect played in the development of Denmark's industry structure. The existence of the periodic sponge effect between tourism and manufacturing is analysed by proposing an approach to calculate the periodic sponge effect index. This phenomenon describing wane and wax shifting between the industry sector and the service sector is jointly contributed by the natural seasonal variations in the tourism industry and the flexicurity labour market with flexible employment policies in Denmark. To prove that the service sector with periodic sponge effect will not cause the Dutch disease, the relationship between the service sector and GDP in Denmark are studied by adopting a unit root test, Johansen cointegration test and Granger causality test. The global disaster, including the global financial crisis, can be regarded as an outlier in the periodic economic oscillation. The impacts of the financial crisis of 2008 on the alteration of industry structure are revealed. Moreover, during this economic crisis, the de-industrialisation that is a replacement of the manufacturing proportion by tourism is discussed. In terms of the unemployment issue, the depression of manufacturing is the main factor to cause the unemployment problem. Tourism becomes a significant contributor to provide job opportunities. Furthermore, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the current situation of Denmark is discussed.","Yan, Hongxuan, Wang, Shouyang","https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3899761","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23671,""
"Bicycle Industry As a Post-pandemic Green Recovery Driver in an Emerging Economy: A SWOT Analysis","The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed socioeconomic vulnerabilities around the world. After fighting the coronavirus for more than one and a half years now, the countries are recovering from the epidemic with the help of cutting-edge medical research. The policymakers are implementing stimulus packages for post-pandemic economic recovery. However, sustainable â€˜green recoveryâ€™ plans are yet to get adequate attention. Sustainable investment in green industries can create green jobs, promote a low-carbon economy, and foster long-lasting economic growth in the post-pandemic world. The COVID-19 affected countries with emerging economies call for even more focus on such investments. In Bangladesh, the bicycle industry - a growing low-carbon industry â€“ has been showing promising potential for growth since the beginning of the pandemic. Both the local and global markets of Bangladeshi bicycles have seen substantial growth during the epidemic. In this paper, we analyze the potential of the Bangladeshi bicycle industry as an effective green recovery driver. We conduct semi-structured interviews with relevant experts and professionals, analyze their opinions, and perform a â€˜strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT)â€™ analysis. The analysis reveals valuable insights regarding post-pandemic sustainable economic and environmental recovery which will be beneficial to the policymakers of Bangladesh and similar developing countries.","Xames, Doulotuzzaman, Shefa, Jannatul, Sarwar, Ferdous","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1097162/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23672,""
"Association of Vaccination With the Persistence of Post-COVID Symptoms","Background: Patients who have had COVID-19 often report persistent symptoms after resolution of their acute illness. Recent reports suggest that vaccination may be associated with improvement in post-acute symptoms. We used data from a prospective cohort to assess differences in post-acute sequelae of COVID (PASC) among vaccinated vs. unvaccinated patients.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Methods: We used data from a cohort of COVID-19 patients enrolled into a prospective registry established at a tertiary care health system in New York City. Participants underwent a baseline evaluation before COVID-19 vaccines were available and were followed six months later. We compared unadjusted and propensity score-adjusted baseline to 6-month change for several PASC-related symptoms and measures: anosmia, respiratory (cough, dyspnea, phlegm, wheezing), depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD;COVID-19-related and other trauma), quality of life domains, body mass index, and blood pressure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Findings: The study included 453 COVID-19 patients with PASC, of which 324 (72%) were vaccinated between the baseline and six-month visit. Unadjusted analyses did not show significant differences in the baseline to six-month change in anosmia, respiratory symptoms, depression, anxiety, PTSD, quality of life, body mass index, or blood pressure (p&gt;0.05 for all comparisons). Similar results were found in propensity-adjusted comparisons and in secondary analyses based on the number of vaccine doses received.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Interpretation: Our findings suggest that COVID vaccination is not associated with improvement in PASC.

"Subjective Health Status: An Easily Available, Independent, Robust And Significant Predictive Factor At The Prometaphase of Vaccination Programs For The Vaccination Behavior of Chinese Adults","Background:  The World Health Organization (WHO) proposed COVID-19 vaccination as an emergent and important method to end the COVID-19 pandemic. Since China started vaccination programs in December 2020, vaccination has spread to provinces and municipalities nationwide. Previous research has focused on people's vaccination willingness and its influencing factors but has not examined vaccination behavior. We examine the effectiveness of psychosocial factors in predicting vaccination behavior. Methods: : A cross-sectional online survey was performed among Chinese adults on 8 May and 4 June 2021. The statistical analysis of the data included univariate analysis, receiver operator characteristics (ROC) analysis and ordinal multiclassification logistic regression model analysis. Results: : Of the 1300 respondents, 761 (58.5%) were vaccinated. Univariate analysis showed that a high education level and good subjective health status were protective factors for vaccination behavior, while suffering from chronic diseases was a risk factor. ROC analysis showed that subjective health status (AUC = 0.625, 95% CI: 0.594â€“0.656, P &lt; 0.001) was the best predictor of vaccination behavior. Logistic regression analysis with subjective health status as a dependent variable indicated that older age, female sex, depression, neurasthenia, obsession, hypochondriasis and chronic disease were significant risk factors, while positive coping tendencies were a significant protective factor. Conclusion:  Our study found a simple and effective marker, subjective health status, that can predict vaccination behavior. This finding can guide future epidemic prevention work.","Wang, Zuxing, Chen, Lili, Xiao, Jun, Jiang, Fugui, Min, Wenjiao, Liu, Shuyun, Wang, Yunqiong, Qi, Mengsha","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1033041/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23674,""
"The phenomenology of tics and tic-like behavior in TikTok","ABSTRACT Background and Objective Pediatricians and pediatric subspecialists worldwide have reported a marked increase in functional (conversion) disorders with tic-like behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. These patients often report frequent viewing of Tourette Syndrome (TS) TikTok videos, suggesting disease modeling. We aimed to evaluate tic phenomenology in videos posted on TikTok. Methods The 100 most-viewed videos under #tourettes in TikTok were randomly assigned to two primary reviewers (n=3;&lt;2 years independent practice), all pediatric neurologists specializing in movement disorders, for extraction and classification of tic phenomenology. Initial disagreements were solved by consensus. If not resolved, a senior reviewer (n=5;&gt;2 years independent pediatric movement-disorder practice) served as tiebreaker. In addition, two primary and one senior reviewer rated each video on a Likert scale from 1= â€œAll the tics are typical of TSâ€ to 5= â€œNone of the tics are typical of TSâ€. Mean scores and Spearman correlation between primary and senior reviewers were calculated. Results Six videos without tic-like behaviors were excluded. Most videos depicted coprophenomena (coprolalia: 53.2%;copropraxia: 20.2%), often with unusual characteristics. Frequently, videos demonstrated atypical phenomenology such as very strong influence by the environment (motor: 54.3%;phonic: 54.3%), aggression (19.1%), throwing objects (22.3%), self-injurious behaviors (27.7%), and long phrases (&gt;3 words;45.7%). Most videos portrayed atypical, non-tic behaviors (Median [IQR] Likert ratings: Primary 4.5 [4-5];Senior 5 [3-5]). Primary vs. senior rater scores demonstrated moderate agreement (r = 0.46;p&lt;0.001). Conclusions TS symptoms portrayals on highly-viewed TikTok videos are predominantly not representative or typical of TS. Highlights Many teenagers with functional tic-like disorder have been reported during the COVID-19 pandemic. These patients report increased viewing of Tourette Syndrome TikTok videos, a popular social media platform, and present with similar tic-like behaviors. Current TikTok videos are poorly representative of Tourette syndrome and more consistent with functional tic-like behavior. We provide a detailed description of the phenomenology tics and tic-like behavior portrayed in TikTok.","Vera, Alonso Zea, Bruce, Adrienne, Garris, Jordan, Tochen, Laura, Bhatia, Poonam, Lehman, Rebecca, Lopez, Wendi, Wu, Steve, Gilbert, Donald","https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.08.21263218","","Database: other preprints; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23675,""
"Healthy diets, lifestyle changes and wellbeing during and after lockdown: Longitudinal evidence from the West Midlands","ABSTRACT Background â€˜Lockdownsâ€™ to control the spread of COVID-19 in the UK have affected many aspects of life, with concerns that they may have adversely affected diets. We aimed to examine (i) the effect of living in lockdown on fruit and vegetable consumption;(ii) whether any population subgroup was particularly adversely affected;(iii) the barriers and facilitators to a healthy diet in lockdown;and (iv) the effect of lockdown on secondary outcomes such as weight and mental wellbeing. Methods We conducted a mixed-method longitudinal study, involving an online survey of 1003 adults in the West Midlands, UK, 494 of whom were surveyed at two different points in time. Our first time point (T0: May 2020) was during stringent COVID-19 lockdown and the second (T1: September 2020) during a period of more relaxed restrictions. The survey included detailed quantitative questions about fruit and vegetable consumption;questions on physical activity, socio-demographic characteristics, BMI and wellbeing;and qualitative data collection about the reasons behind reported changes. Results We find no evidence for respondents decreasing their fruit and vegetable consumption during lockdown compared to afterwards. If anything, consumption of fruit and vegetables increased by about half a portion daily among women, particularly among those who normally have a long commute. These findings combined with a significant increase in physical activity, suggest that behaviours were healthier during lockdown, consistent with higher self-reported health compared with afterwards. However, there was a marked deterioration in wellbeing during lockdown, and on average participants self-reported being heavier during this period as well. Our qualitative data suggested that an abundance of resources supported higher fruit and vegetable consumption during lockdown, for instance, participants had more time, while access issues were one barrier to consumption. Conclusions Our results are reassuring for those concerned that lockdowns may have adversely affect diets. They may point to the impact of commuting on diet, particularly for women, and intervening to reduce commuting times may be one way to improve population diets. Our study adds longitudinal evidence to a growing body of literature on the adverse effect of lockdown on mental health.","van Rens, Thijs, Hanson, Petra, Oyebode, Oyinlola, Walasek, Lukasz, Barber, Thomas, Mujcic, Redzo, Al-Khudairy, Lena","https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.19.21253951","","Database: other preprints; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23676,""

Participants: Participants were N = 736 young adults from a three-wave longitudinal study on mindfulness that took place over a year. The third assessment wave took place in May, 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Participants completed self-report measures of trait mindfulness, compassion, well-being, internalized distress, coping, and compliance. Results: Results of autoregressive cross-lagged panel mediation models revealed the mindfulness predicted better coping via greater well-being and lower internalized distress. Greater compassion was linked with greater adherence to CDC guidelines through greater well-being. Conclusions: Findings suggest that trait mindfulness and compassion play an important role in college studentsâ€™ coping and compliance during the pandemic, and point to potential intervention targets.","Van Doren, Natalia, Mahlobo, Christa, Roeser, Robert","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/h26t7","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23677,""
"Using telehealth consultations for healthcare provision to patients from racial/ethnic minorities: A systematic review","ABSTRACT Objective The COVID-19 pandemic has seen a rapid adoption of telehealth consultations, potentially creating new barriers to healthcare access for racial/ethnic minorities. This systematic review explored the use of telehealth consultations for people from racial/ethnic minority populations in relation to health outcomes, access to care, implementation facilitators and barriers, and satisfaction with care. Materials and Methods This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis and the JBI Manual for Evidence Synthesis. Five major databases were searched to identify relevant studies. Screening, full-text review, quality appraisal and data extraction were all completed independently and in duplicate. A convergent integrated approach to data synthesis was applied with findings reported narratively. Results A total of 28 studies met the inclusion criteria. Telehealth-delivered interventions were mostly effective for the treatment/management of physical and mental health conditions including depression, diabetes and hypertension. In several studies, telehealth improved access to care by providing financial and time benefits to patients. Technological difficulties were the main barriers to effective telehealth consultation, although overall satisfaction with telehealth-delivered care was high. Discussion Telehealth-delivered care for racial/ethnic minorities offers promise across a range of conditions and outcomes, particularly when delivered in the patientâ€™s preferred language. However, telehealth may be problematic for some due to cost and limited digital and health literacy. Conclusion The development and implementation of guidelines, policies and practices in relation to telehealth consultations for racial/ethnic minorities should consider the barriers and facilitators identified in this review to ensure existing health disparities are not exacerbated.","Truong, Mandy, Yeganeh, Ladan, Cook, Olivia, Crawford, Kimberley, Wong, Pauline, Allen, Jacqueline","https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.25.21262592","","Database: other preprints; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23678,""
"A Longitudinal Study of the Mental Health of Children and Adolescents with Autism and their Parents during COVID-19: Part 1, Quantitative Findings","Children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and their parents are likely to have been disproportionally affected during the COVID-19 pandemic. There has been little focus on how the mental health of these vulnerable families developed during the pandemic and how it compared to those with other special educational needs and disabilities (SENDs). Questionnaires were completed by 527 parents/carers about their own and their childâ€™s mental health at one or more time points between 23rd March 2020 (at the onset of the first lockdown) and 10th October 2020 (when schools fully reopened for face-to-face teaching). Multi-level regression models were fitted to the data. Young people with ASD had more depression and anxiety symptoms compared to those with other SENDs throughout the study period. As lockdown progressed and schools subsequently re-opened for face-to-face teaching anxiety levels decreased for young people with SENDs but not for those with ASD, whose anxiety remained stable throughout. Depression symptoms, however, remained stable for both groups during this period as did parents/carersâ€™ psychological distress and wellbeing. These findings shed new light on the disproportionate effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on anxiety levels in young people with ASD.","Toseeb, Umar, Asbury, Kathryn","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/hjygt","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23679,""
"Prevalence of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms Among Psychiatric Patients during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background:  The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused extensive public health concerns, posing significant challenges to healthcare services. One particular area of concern is the mental health of psychiatric patients, who are often a neglected group. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of, and associated factors for symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among psychiatric patients in China during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: : Self-reported questionnaires were distributed to patients in four psychiatric hospitals in Beijing, China, between April 28 th and May 30 th , 2020. Information regarding sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19 related factors, support, psychosomatic factors, and PTSD symptoms was collected data using a series of scales, such as the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale, and so on. Multivariate regression was used to identify factors related to PTSD symptoms. Results: : A total of 1,055 psychiatric patients were included in the final sample. The prevalence of PTSD symptoms was 41.3%. Hierarchical linear regression demonstrated that fear of the pandemic and anxiety were shared associated factors for both symptoms of PTSD and its subscales. Additionally, age was an associated factor for the total PTSD ( ÃŸ = 0.12, p &lt; 0.01), intrusion ( ÃŸ = 0.18, p &lt; 0.001), and avoidance ( ÃŸ = 0.1, p &lt; 0.05) symptoms;depression was an associated factor for the total PTSD s ( ÃŸ = 0.13, p &lt; 0.001), intrusion ( ÃŸ = 0.11, p &lt; 0.01), and hyperarousal ( ÃŸ = 0.19, p &lt; 0.001) symptoms. Conclusions: : The prevalence of PTSD symptoms was high among psychiatric patients during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. This study found that age, fear of the pandemic, anxiety and depression are significant associated factors of PTSD symptoms in psychiatric patients during the pandemic. We call for higher awareness and introduction of PTSD interventions to relieve the psychological stress in these patients.","Tang, Lirong, Gao, Yue, Qi, Shuangyi, Cui, Jie, Zhou, Li, Feng, Yi","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-139931/v2","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23680,""
"Mental Health, Partnerships, and Sexual Behavior of German Students After the Third Wave During the Corona Pandemic","Background:  The corona pandemic has drastically changed students' lives and increased their perceived stress. At the end of winter and in spring 2021, Germany experienced the third wave of the pandemic. This study aims to examine the state of studentsâ€™ mental health after the third wave as well as partnerships and sex life during the pandemic. Methods. In June and July 2021, 928 students (mean age: 23.6;63.5% females) from four universities in Germany completed an online survey. The PHQ-9 and GAD-7 were used to assess mood problems and worrying. Results. Our results show that 56.4% were above the cut-off value for clinically relevant mood problems, 35.7% for worrying and 33.4% were above both cut-off values simultaneously (=10). The female gender, higher study stress, low financial resources, higher strain due to corona and more loneliness were associated with severe symptoms, whereas higher life satisfaction, more sleep, and psychological/psychiatric treatment were related to better mental health. Students who started studying in the pandemic showed slightly more mood problems than longer enrolled students. The vast majority (89.3%) of all students were happy with their current relationship. While half of the students noted no change in their relationship, a quarter each reported improvement or deterioration. Every third single student has had less sex and in every fifth partnership it came to more sex during the pandemic. Conclusion: StudentsÂ´ mental health seems to be worse compared to pre-pandemic data and also compared to the first wave data, especially concerning mood problems (depressive symptoms). Women are significantly more burdened than men. It should be further investigated whether rates of symptom load will be lower again when universities reopen and study life becomes normal.","Supke, Max, Hahlweg, Prof Dr Kurt, Kelani, Krenare, Muschalla, Prof Dr Beate, Schulz, Prof Dr Wolfgang","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-842233/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23681,""
"â€œThe idea is to help people achieve greater success and libertyâ€: a qualitative study of expanded methadone take-home access in opioid use disorder treatment","Background Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States (US) was already facing an epidemic of opioid overdose deaths. Overdose deaths continued to surge during the pandemic. To limit COVID-19 spread and to avoid disruptions in access to medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), including buprenorphine and methadone, US federal and state agencies granted unprecedented exemptions to existing MOUD guidelines for Opioid Treatment Programs (OTPs), including loosening criteria for unsupervised take-home doses. We conducted a qualitative study to evaluate the impact of these policy changes on MOUD treatment experiences for providers and patients at an OTP in California. Methods We interviewed 10 providers and 20 patients receiving MOUD. We transcribed, coded, and analyzed all interviews to identify emergent themes. Results Providers discussed clinical decision-making processes and experiences providing take-homes. Implementation of expanded take-home policies was cautious. Providers reported making individualized decisions, using patient factors to decide if benefits outweighed risks of overdose and misuse. Decision-making factors included patient drug use, overdose risk, housing status, and vulnerability to COVID-19. New patient groups started receiving take-homes and providers noted few adverse events. Patients who received take-homes reported increased autonomy and treatment flexibility, which in turn increased likelihood of treatment stabilization and engagement. Patients who remained ineligible for take-homes, usually due to ongoing non-prescribed opioid or benzodiazepine use, desired greater transparency and shared decision-making. Conclusion Federal exemptions in response to COVID-19 led to the unprecedented expansion of access to MOUD take-homes within OTPs. Providers and patients perceived benefits to expanding access to take-homes and experienced few adverse outcomes, suggesting expanded take-home policies should remain post-COVID-19. Future studies should explore whether these findings are generalizable to other OTPs and assess larger samples to quantify patient-level outcomes resulting from expanded take-home policies.","Suen, Leslie, Castellanos, Stacy, Joshi, Neena, Satterwhite, Shannon, Knight, Kelly","https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.20.21262382","","Database: other preprints; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23682,""
"RuralCovidLife: Study protocol and description of the data","RuralCovidLife is part of Generation Scotlandâ€™s CovidLife project, investigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and mitigation measures on people in Scotland. The RuralCovidLife project focuses on Scotlandâ€™s rural communities, and how they have been impacted by the pandemic. During survey development, Generation Scotland consulted with people living or working in rural communities, and collaborated with a patient and public involvement and engagement (PPIE) group composed of rural community leaders. Through this consultation work, the RuralCovidLife survey was developed to assess the issues most pertinent to people in rural communities, such as mental health, employment, transport, connectivity, and local communities. Between 14th October and 30th November 2020, 3,365 participants from rural areas in Scotland took part in the survey. Participant ages ranged from 16 to 96 (mean = 58.4, standard deviation [SD] = 13.3), and the majority of the participants were female (70.5%). Over half (51.3%) had taken part in the original CovidLife survey. RuralCovidLife includes a subsample (n = 523) of participants from the Generation Scotland cohort. Pre-pandemic data on health and lifestyle, as well as biological samples, are available for these participants. These participantsâ€™ data can also be linked to past and future healthcare records, allowing analysis of retrospective and prospective health outcomes. Like Generation Scotland, RuralCovidLife is designed as a resource for researchers. RuralCovidLife data, as well as the linked Generation Scotland data, is available for use by external researchers following approval from the Generation Scotland Access Committee. RuralCovidLife can be used to investigate mental health, well-being, and behaviour in participants living in rural areas during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as comparisons with non-rural samples. Moreover, the sub-sample with full Generation Scotland data and linkage can be used to investigate the long-term health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic in rural communities.","Stevenson, Anna, Huggins, Charlotte, Forbes, Alison, Hume, Jim, Fulton, Grant, Thirlwall, Claire, Miles, Janet, Fawns-Ritchie, Chloe, Campbell, Archie, Nangle, Clifford, Dawson, Rebecca, Edwards, Rachel, Flaig, Robin, Hartley, Louise, Levein, Christie, McCartney, Daniel, Deary, Ian, Hayward, Caroline, Marioni, Riccardo, McIntosh, Andrew, Sudlow, Cathie, Porteous, David","https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.17325.1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23683,""
"The COVID-19 Pandemic and Mental Health: Disentangling Crucial Channels","Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, a major source of concern has been its effect on mental health. Using pre-pandemic information and five customized questionnaires in the Dutch LISS panel, we investigate how mental health in the working population has evolved along with the most prominent risk factors associated with the pandemic. Overall, mental health decreased sharply with the onset of the first lockdown but recovered fairly quickly. In December 2020, levels of mental health are comparable to those in November 2019. We show that perceived risk of infection, labor market uncertainty, and emotional loneliness are all associated with worsening mental health. Both the initial drop and subsequent recovery are larger for parents of children below the age of 12. Among parents, the patterns are particularly pronounced for fathers if they shoulder the bulk of additional care. Mothers' mental health takes a particularly steep hit if they work from home and their partner is designated to take care during the additional hours.","Siflinger, Bettina, Paffenholz, Michaela, Seitz, Sebastian, Mendel, Moritz, Gaudecker, Hans-Martin von","https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3823633","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23684,""
"The Cognitive and Psychiatric Subacute Impairment in severe Covid-19","Background:  Neurologic impairment persisting months after acute severe SARS-CoV-2 infection has been described because of several pathogenic mechanisms, including persistent systemic inflammation. The objective of this study is to analyze the selective involvement of the different cognitive domains and the existence of related biomarkers. Methods: : Cross-sectional multicentric study of patients who survived severe infection with SARS-CoV-2 consecutively recruited between 90 and 120 days after hospital discharge. All patients underwent an exhaustive study of cognitive functions as well as plasma determination of pro-inflammatory, neurotrophic factors and light-chain neurofilaments. A Principal Component Analysis extracted the main independent characteristics of the syndrome. Results: : 152 patients were recruited. The results of our study preferential involvement of episodic and working memory, executive functions, and attention and relatively less affectation of other cortical functions. In addition, anxiety and depression pictures are constant in our cohort. Several plasma chemokines concentrations were elevated compared with both, a non-SARS-Cov2 infected cohort of neurological outpatients or a control healthy general population. Conclusion:  Severe Covid-19 patients can develop an amnesic and dysexecutive syndrome with neuropsychiatric manifestations. We do not know if the deficits detected can persist in the long term and if this can trigger or accelerate the onset of neurodegenerative diseases.","Serrano-Castro, Pedro, Garzon-Maldonado, Francisco, Casado-Naranjo, Ignacio, Ollero-Ortiz, Angela, Minguez-Castellanos, Adolfo, Iglesias-Espinosa, Mar, Baena-Palomino, Pablo, Sanchez-Sanchez, Violeta, Perez, Rosa Maria Sanchez, Rubi-Callejon, Jose, Estevez-Maria, Jose Carlos, Galeano-Bilbao, Benito, Romero-Imbroda, Jesus, Sobrino-Diaz, Beatriz, Arrabal-Gomez, Carlos, Oliver-Martos, BegoÃ±a, MuÃ±oz-Becerra, Luis, Requena-OcaÃ±a, Nerea, de Sotomayor, Maria del Mar Gonzalez Alvarez, Estivill-Torrus, Guillermo, Suarez, Juan, Petersen, Nicolas Ciano, Pons-Pons, Gracia, Reyes-Bueno, Jose Antonio, Cabezudo-Garcia, Pablo, Aguilar-Castillo, Maria Jose, Cosme, Carlos De la Cruz, Duque-Holguera, Maria, Cuartero-Cuartero, Eva, Vilches-Carrillo, Rosa Maria, Carrera-MuÃ±oz, Ismael, Carnero-Pardo, Cristobal, Ramirez-Garcia, Teresa, Oropesa, Juan Manuel, Dominguez-Mayoral, Ana, Pelaez-ViÃ±as, Nazaret, de Santis, Lucia Valiente, de Fonseca, Fernando Rodriguez","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-780220/v2","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23685,""
"Parents Under Stress â€“ Evaluating Emergency Childcare Policies During the First Covid-19 Lockdown in Germany","What are the effects of school and daycare facility closures during the COVID-19 pandemic on parental well-being and parenting behavior? Can emergency childcare policies during a pandemic mitigate increases in parental stress and negative parenting behavior? To answer these questions, this study leverages cross-state variation in emergency childcare eligibility rules during the first COVID-19 lockdown in Germany and draws on unique data from the 2019 and 2020 waves of the German AID:A family panel. Employing a DDD and IV approach we identify medium-term ITT and LATE effects and find that while emergency care policies did not considerably affect parents' life satisfaction, partnership satisfaction or mental health, they have been effective in diminishing harsh parenting behavior. We find partly gendered effects, specifically on paternal parenting behavior. Our results suggest that decreasing parental well-being likely constitutes a general effect of the pandemic, whereas the observed increase in negative and potentially harmful parenting behavior is largely directly caused by school and daycare facility closures.","SchÃ¼ller, Simone, Steinberg, Hannah","https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3851032","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23686,""
"The Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Mental Health and Subjective Well-Being of Workers: An Event Study Based on High-Frequency Panel Data","Using individual monthly panel data from December 2018 to December 2020, we estimate the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and two lockdowns on the mental health and subjective well-being of German workers. Employing an event-study design using individual-specific fixed effects, we find that the first and the second wave of the pandemic reduced workers' mental health substantially. Momentary happiness and life satisfaction also decline in response to Covid-19, but to a smaller extent. We observe adapation in our study outcomes between waves of the pandemic. This applies to a lesser extent to indicators of well-being in certain areas of life, such as satisfaction with the job and with leisure, which are negatively affected, too. Women do not seem to suffer greater well-being losses than men. However, workers in the German short-time work scheme are particularly negatively affected. Our results imply that increased anxiety about the future and restricted personal freedoms are among the drivers of the well-being impact of the pandemic.","Schmidtke, Julia, Hetschko, Clemens, SchÃ¶b, Ronnie, Stephan, Gesine, Eid, Michael, Lawes, Mario","https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3905073","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23687,""
"The impact of technology systems and professional support in digital mental health interventions: a secondary meta-analysis","ABSTRACT Background A rapid review of systematic reviews was conducted to assess the effectiveness of digital mental health interventions for people with a chronic disease. Although it provided an overview of the evidence, it offered limited understanding of ethe types of interventions that were the most effective. The aim of this study was to perform a meta-analysis of primary studies identified in this rapid review of systematic reviews by focusing on the needs of knowledge users. Methods This secondary meta-analysis follows a rapid review of systematic reviews, a virtual workshop with knowledge users to identify research questions and a modified Delphi study to guide research methods. We conducted a secondary analysis of the primary studies identified in the rapid review. Two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts and applied inclusion criteria: RCT design using a digital mental health intervention in a population of adults with another chronic condition, published after 2010 in French or English, and including an outcome measurement of anxiety or depression. Results 708 primary studies were extracted from the systematic reviews and 84 primary studies met the inclusion criteria Digital mental health interventions were significantly more effective than in-person care for both anxiety and depression outcomes. Online messaging was the most effective technology to improve anxiety and depression scores;however, all technology types were effective. Interventions partially supported by healthcare professionals were more effective than self-administered. Conclusions While our meta-analysis identifies digital interventionâ€™s characteristics that are more effective, all technologies and levels of support can be used considering implementation context and population.

"Opinion of Health Care Providers on Birth Companions in Obstetrics Department of a Tertiary Care Hospital in North India","ABSTRACT Background Despite impressive improvements in institutional births and a fall in maternal mortality, satisfaction of women with birthing experience in public health institutions is low (68%). Birth Companion is an important part of the Labour room Quality Improvement (LaQshya) programme introduced by the Government of India in 2017. Despite mandates, implementation of the concept has been unsatisfactory (9%), even though the importance of Birth Companion has increased due to enhanced risk posed by COVID-19. Little is known about awareness among health care providers on Birth Companions, perceived barriers or their suggestions. Methods We canvassed a 15-question instrument using ordinal scales on 151 health care providers comprising consultants, post graduates, residents, and nurses (response rate 69%) in the department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, Lok Nayak Hospital, Delhi, India to gauge their awareness and opinions about Birth Companions. Results Most health care providers across all categories were aware of the concept (93%), World Health Organizationâ€™s recommendation (83%) and Governmentâ€™s instructions for its hospitals (68%) that every woman should be accompanied by a Birth Companion of her choice during labour. Birth Companions of choice suggested by them were the mother (70%), husband (69%). sister (46%) or nurse (43%). Most health care providers agreed that a Birth Companion should wear clean clothes (95%), be free from any communicable disease (91%), stay with the pregnant woman throughout the process of labour (74%) and should have herself gone though labour (42%). Almost all providers (95%) agreed that the presence of a Birth Companion during labour will be beneficial, as they would provide emotional support (99%), boost the womanâ€™s confidence (98%), provide comfort measures like massage (95%), early initiation of breastfeeding (93%), reduce post-partum depression (91%), humanize labour (83%), reduce need for analgesia (70%) and increase spontaneous vaginal births (69%). Yet support for its introduction in their hospital was low (59%). Staff nurses had reservations (62%) with only 40% of those who believed Birth Companion to be beneficial approving of its introduction in their hospital. Over-crowding in labour room and privacy concerns for other women were identified as key barriers. Conclusion Even though most health care providers were aware of and convinced of multiple benefits of Birth Companion during labour, lack of adequate infrastructure in the labour room prevented them from supporting its introduction. Government should provide adequate funding to upgrade labour rooms in a way that provides privacy to the delivering women and frame guidelines and train Birth Companions to perform their role appropriately.","Sarwal, Tanvi, Sarwal, Yamini, Tyagi, Shakun, Sarwal, Rakesh","https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.24.21259462","","Database: other preprints; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23689,""
"The effect of COVID-19 vaccinations on self-reported depression and anxiety during February 2021","Using the COVID-19 Trends and Impacts Survey (CTIS), we examine the effect of COVID-19 vaccinations on (self-reported) feelings of depression and anxiety (""depression""), isolation, and worries about health, among vaccine-accepting survey respondents during February 2021. Assuming no unmeasured confounding, we estimate that vaccinations caused a -4.3 (-4.7, -3.8), -3.4 (-3.9, -2.9), and -4.8 (-5.4, -4.1) percentage point change in these outcomes, respectively. We further argue that these effects provide a lower bound on the mental health burden of the pandemic, implying that the COVID-19 pandemic was responsible for at least a 28.6 (25.3, 31.9) percent increase in feelings of depression and a 20.5 (17.3, 23.6) percent increase in feelings of isolation during February 2021 among vaccine-accepting CTIS survey respondents. We also posit a model where vaccinations affect depression through worries about health and feelings of isolation, and estimate the proportion mediated by each pathway. We find that feelings of social isolation is the stronger mediator, accounting for 41.0 (37.3, 44.7) percent of the total effect, while worries about health accounts for 9.4 (7.6, 11.1) percent of the total effect. We caution that the causal interpretation of these findings rests on strong assumptions. Nevertheless, as the pandemic continues, policymakers should also target interventions aimed at managing the substantial mental health burden associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.","Rubinstein, Max, Haviland, Amelia","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+effect+of+COVID-19+vaccinations+on+self-reported+depression+and+anxiety+during+February+2021","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23690,""
"The Role of Family Support and Conflict as Predictors of Cyberbullying and Subjective Well-Being During the Covid-19 Period for Chilean Adolescents","Introduction : Life satisfaction plays a crucial role in integral development during childhood and adolescence as it helps promote mental health, positive social attachments, and more. Recently, it has been shown that cyberbullying has severe consequences for the mental health and wellbeing of victims such as increased anxiety, depressive symptoms and even suicide risk. Although the role of the family in life satisfaction and cyberbullying behaviors has been studied, there is limited information on its impacts during the current pandemic period. This period has given rise to a number of alterations in social dynamics, a notable decrease in life satisfaction in addition to an increase in cyberbullying behaviors. Objective : The aim of this study is to determine the predictive role of family variables regarding studentsâ€™ levels of life satisfaction and cyberbullying victimization during the pandemic period. Method : Structural equation modeling was done using data from a cross-sectional study (n = 287) conducted in six schools in Santiago, Chile during 2020. Results : The tested model has a good fit and parsimonious adjustment. It explained 25.9% of the life satisfaction and 9% of the variance of cyberbullying victimization. Family support positively predicted life satisfaction (p&lt;.001) and negatively predicted cyberbullying victimization (p=.02). Likewise, family conflict positively predicted levels of cyberbullying victimization (p=.038) and negatively predicted life satisfaction levels (p&lt;.001). Finally, family visits only positively predicted life satisfaction (p=.007). Conclusions: Generating interventions on several levels focused on positive family bonds has become essential and urgent. This is especially important considering their protective impacts on cyberbullying victimization in promotion of adolescent well-being and quality of life.","RodrÃ­guez-Rivas, MatÃ­as, Varela, Jorge, GonzÃ¡lez, Constanza, Chuecas, MarÃ­a Josefina","https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3931695","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23691,""
"Psychometric properties of the Inventory of Complicated Grief in Mexican community sample during COVID-19 pandemic","Objective: The aim of the present study was to validate the Inventory of Complicated Grief (ICG) in the adult population, since there is no valid instrument that evaluates this construct in the Mexican population. Method: This study was based on an Ex Post Facto, instrumental design with a convenience sample. The ICG was applied to 4014 participants (3540, females, 470 males and 4 individuals classified as other) who had experienced a loss of a loved one during the COVID-19 pandemic. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted. The internal reliability of each factor was examined by means of the Cronbachâ€™s alpha index (a). Correlation analyses between the ICG, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, the Satisfaction with life scale and the Beck's Hopelessness Scale were performed to assess convergent and divergent validity of the ICG. Results: The ICG showed a high internal reliability with a Cronbach alpha of 0.92. The confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated that a four-factor model of the ICG (normal grief symptoms, emotional-anxious detachment, intense negative emotions, loss-impairing anxiety) fits the data well. According to bivariate analyses the ICG was correlated with measures of life satisfaction (r = -.208, n = 1984, p = .001), hopelessness (r = .522, n = 1984, p = .001), and depressive symptoms (r = .641, n = 1984, p = .001).

"Global and regional prevalence and outcomes of COVID-19 in people living with HIV: A cutting-edge systematic review and meta-analysis","Background The relationship between HIV infection and COVID-19 clinical outcome is uncertain, with conflicting data and hypotheses. We aimed to assess the prevalence and risk of severe COVID-19 and death in people living with HIV (PLWH) on the global and continental level. Methods Electronic databases were systematically searched in July 2021. Studies were screened and then extracted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Narratives were synthesised and data pooled for global and continental prevalence and relative risk of severity and mortality in HIV-infected COVID-19 patients using random-effect model. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa score, Eggerâ€™s test and presented as funnel plots. Results A total of 46 studies were included involving 18,034,947 COVID-19 cases of which 31,269 were PLWH. The global prevalence of PLWH with SARS-CoV-2 infection was 1% (95% CI = 0.9% -1.1%) with the highest prevalence observed in sub-Saharan Africa. The relative risk (RR) of COVID-19 severity was significant only in Africa (RR, 95% CI = 1.14, 1.08 â€“ 1.24) while risk of COVID-19 mortality was 1.53% (95% CI = 1.45 â€“ 2.03) globally. The prevalence of PLWH in COVID-19 cases was significantly low, and the calculated global risk ratio show that HIV infection may be linked with increased COVID-19 death. The between-studies heterogeneity was significantly high while risk of publication bias was not significant. Conclusion There is low prevalence of HIV-SARS-CoV-2 co-infection. HIV infection was linked with severe COVID-19 in Africa and increased risk of death globally.","Raya, Reynie Purnama, Kamila, Ami, Alqahtani, Jaber, Hjazi, Ahmed, Li, Amy, Oyelade, Tope","https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.12.21260361","","Database: other preprints; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23693,""
"COVID Induced Digital Inequality for Senior Citizens","The global pandemic of COVID-19 has fundamentally changed how people interact, especially with the introduction of technology-based measures that aim at curbing the spread of the virus. As the country that currently implements one of the tightest technology-based COVID prevention policy, China has protected its citizen with a prolonged peaceful time of zero case as well as a fast reaction to potential upsurging of the disease. However, such mobile-based technology does come with sacrifices, especially for senior citizens who find themselves difficult to adapt to modern technologies. In this study, we demonstrated the fact that most senior citizens find it difficult to use the health code apps called ''JKM'', to which they responded by cutting down on travel and reducing local commuting to locations where the verification of JKM is needed. Such compromise has physical and mental consequences and leads to inequalities in infrastructure, social isolation and self-sufficiency. As we illustrated in the paper, such decrease in life quality of senior citizens can be greatly reduced if improvements on the user interactions of the JKM can be implemented. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first systemic study of digital inequality due to mobile-based COVID prevention technologies for senior citizens in China. As similar technologies become widely adopted around the world, we wish to shed light on how widened digital inequality increasingly affects the life quality of senior citizens in the pandemic era.","Qiu, Nicky","https://www.google.com/search?q=COVID+Induced+Digital+Inequality+for+Senior+Citizens","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23694,""
"Evaluating the Clinical Feasibility of an Artificial Intelligence-Powered Clinical Decision Support System: A Longitudinal Feasibility Study","Objective We examine the feasibility of an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered clinical decision support system (CDSS), which combines the operationalized 2016 Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments guidelines with a neural-network based individualized treatment remission prediction. Methods Due to COVID-19, the study was adapted to be completed entirely at a distance. Seven physicians recruited outpatients diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) as per DSM-V criteria. Patients completed a minimum of one visit without the CDSS (baseline) and two subsequent visits where the CDSS was used by the physician (visit 1 and 2). The primary outcome of interest was change in session length after CDSS introduction, as a proxy for feasibility. Feasibility and acceptability data were collected through self-report questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. Results Seventeen patients enrolled in the study;14 completed. There was no significant difference between appointment length between visits (introduction of the tool did not increase session length). 92.31% of patients and 71.43% of physicians felt that the tool was easy to use. 61.54% of the patients and 71.43% of the physicians rated that they trusted the CDSS. 46.15% of patients felt that the patient-clinician relationship significantly or somewhat improved, while the other 53.85% felt that it did not change. Conclusions Our results confirm the primary hypothesis that the integration of the tool does not increase appointment length. Findings suggest the CDSS is easy to use and may have some positive effects on the patient-physician relationship. The CDSS is feasible and ready for effectiveness studies.","Popescu, Christina, Golden, Grace, Benrimoh, David, Tanguay-Sela, Myriam, Slowey, Dominique, Lundrigan, Eryn, Williams, JÃ©rÃ´me, Desormeau, Bennet, Kardani, Divyesh, Perez, Tamara, Rollins, Colleen, Israel, Sonia, Perlman, Kelly, Armstrong, Caitrin, Baxter, Jacob, Whitmore, Kate, Fradette, Marie-Jeanne, Felcarek-Hope, Kaelan, Soufi, Ghassen, Fratila, Robert, Mehltretter, Joseph, Looper, Karl, Steiner, Warren, Rej, Soham, Karp, Jordan, Heller, Katherine, Parikh, Sagar, McGuire-Snieckus, Rebecca, Ferrari, Manuela, Margolese, Howard, Turecki, Gustavo","https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.03.21259812","","Database: other preprints; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23695,""
"Differential ADAR editing landscapes in major depressive disorder and suicide","Neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression and suicide, are becoming an increasing public health concern. Rising rates of both depression and suicide, exacerbated by the current COVID19 pandemic, have only hastened our need for objective and reliable diagnostic biomarkers. These can aide clinicians treating depressive disorders in both diagnosing and developing treatment plans. While differential gene expression analysis has highlighted the serotonin signaling cascade among other critical neurotransmitter pathways to underly the pathology of depression and suicide, the biological mechanisms remain elusive. Here we propose a novel approach to better understand molecular underpinnings of neuropsychiatric disorders by examining patterns of differential RNA editing by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs). We take advantage of publicly available RNA-seq datasets to map ADAR editing landscapes in a global gene-centric view. We use a unique combination of Guttman scaling and random forest classification modeling to create, describe and compare ADAR editing profiles focusing on both spatial and biological sex differences. We use a subset of experimentally confirmed ADAR editing sites located in known protein coding regions, the excitome, to map ADAR editing profiles in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and suicide. Using Guttman scaling, we were able to describe significant changes in editing profiles across brain regions in males and females with respect to cause of death (COD) and MDD diagnosis. The spatial distribution of editing sites may provide insight into biological mechanisms under-pinning clinical symptoms associated with MDD and suicidal behavior. Additionally, we use random forest modeling including these differential profiles among other markers of global editing patterns in order to highlight potential biomarkers that offer insights into molecular changes underlying synaptic plasticity. Together, these models identify potential prognostic, diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers for MDD diagnosis and/or suicide.","Plonski, Noel-Marie, Meindl, Richard, Piontkivska, Helen","https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.22.445267","","Database: other preprints; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23696,""
"Two-Year Post-Housing Outcomes for a Housing First Cohort in Aotearoa New Zealand","Background: Housing First (HF) is an approach that improves outcomes for people who have experienced homelessness. Housing provision in HF is immediate, non-conditional, and permanent, with open-ended wraparound support offered. This paper reports one-year and two-year post-housing outcomes for 387 people housed by the first HF programme in Aotearoa New Zealand (NZ).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Methods: We linked the de-identified cohort to Statistics NZâ€™s (StatsNZ) Integrated Data Infrastructure (IDI). This database contains administrative data on services provided by the NZ Government. This paper reports on interactions with government services by the cohort both before and after being housed. We focus on the domains of health, justice, and income.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Results: The cohort experienced a sizeable drop in healthcare service interactions. Average bed-nights in both mental health inpatient (-59%) and residential units (-50%) more than halved in year one and maintained the reduced average in year two (-41% and -51%). Outpatient events increased 15% in year one and 31% in year two. The average person in the HF cohort had almost $3,000 more in overall total income across benefits and wages/salaries in the two years after being housed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Conclusions: Our findings show promising early changes in mental health outcomes and income rates for those housed, demonstrating that the HF approach is likely to have had early positive impacts. In a dynamic policy context, support and coordination of services is still needed at two years post-housed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Funding: This paper was supported by funding from the Aotearoa NZ Ministry of Business,&lt;br&gt;Innovation, and Employment Endeavour Fund.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Declaration of Interest: Clare Aspinall has received compensation via a contract with Community Housing Aotearoa to advise on Covid-19 response, and is Vice-Chair of Dwell Housing Trust.

"Mental health during the COVID-19 outbreak in Uruguay: the impact of healthy lifestyle behaviors and sociodemographic factors","Background: Numerous studies have reported high rates of depressive and anxiety symptoms related to the COVID-19 crisis and the measures implemented to contain the virus spread. Even though restrictive measures, such as mandatory lockdown were not applied in Uruguay, mental health could be affected. Moreover, sociodemographic and lifestyle factors could modulate this impact. We aimed to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on depressive and anxiety symptoms among Uruguayan people and examine the associated factors. Methods: This study was conducted in a non-probabilistic sample of 1051 adults (aged =18 years). Depressive (Beck Depression Inventory-II) and anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) symptoms were assessed along with isolation conditions, sociodemographic factors, and lifestyle behaviors. Linear models were adjusted to analyze the data. Results: Participants in our sample reported mild-to-moderate depressive symptoms and severe anxiety symptoms. Those who did total isolation reported the highest levels of symptomatology. Also, as days of isolation increased, symptoms increased. Finally, sex, socioeconomic status, age, physical activity, sleeping routines, exposure to light and outdoor activities have an effect on mental health. Conclusions: This study illustrates that the COVID-19 outbreak impacts mental health even in a country with mild-lockdown. Our results highlight the importance of considering sociodemographic and lifestyle factors when developing clinical intervention programs to mitigate the current crisisâ€™s effects.","Paz, Valentina, Chirullo, Vicente, Montero, Federico, Ruiz, Paul, Selma, Hugo, FernÃ¡ndez-Theoduloz, Gabriela","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/r8v4f","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23698,""
"Automatic Detection of COVID-19 and Pneumonia from Chest X-Ray using Deep Learning","In this study, a dataset of X-ray images from patients with common viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, confirmed Covid-19 disease was utilized for the automatic detection of the Coronavirus disease. The point of the investigation is to assess the exhibition of cutting edge convolutional neural system structures proposed over the ongoing years for clinical picture order. In particular, the system called Transfer Learning was received. With transfer learning, the location of different variations from the norm in little clinical picture datasets is a reachable objective, regularly yielding amazing outcomes.

"The Invisible COVID-19 Crisis: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Risk Among Frontline Physicians Treating COVID-19 Patients","This study evaluated post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among frontline US physicians (treating COVID-19 patients) in comparison with second-line physicians (not treating COVID-19 patients), and identified the significance and patterns of factors associated with higher PTSD risk. A cross-sectional, web-based survey was deployed during August and September, 2020, to practicing physicians in the 18 states with the largest COVID-19 cases. Among 1,478 responding physicians, 1,017 completed the PTSD Checklist (PCL-5). First, the PCL-5 was used to compare symptom endorsement between the two physician groups. A greater percentage of frontline than second-line physicians had clinically significant endorsement of PCL-5 symptoms and higher PCL-5 scores. Second, logistic regression and seven nonlinear machine learning (ML) algorithms were leveraged to identify potential predictors of PTSD risk by analyzing variable importance and partial dependence plots. Predictors of PTSD risk included cognitive/psychological measures, occupational characteristics, work experiences, social support, demographics, and workplace characteristics. Importantly, the final ML model random forest, identified patterns of both damaging and protective predictors of PTSD risk among frontline physicians. Key damaging factors included depression, burnout, negative coping, fears of contracting/transmitting COVID-19, perceived stigma, and insufficient resources to treat COVID-19 patients. Protective factors included resilience and support from employers/friends/family/significant others. This study underscores the value of ML algorithms to uncover nonlinear relationships among protective/damaging risk factors for PTSD in frontline physicians, which may better inform interventions to prepare healthcare systems for future epidemics/pandemics.","Mukherjee, Sayanti, Rintamaki, Lance, Shucard, Janet, Wei, Zhiyuan, Carlasare, Lindsey, Sinsky, Christine","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Invisible+COVID-19+Crisis:+Post-Traumatic+Stress+Disorder+Risk+Among+Frontline+Physicians+Treating+COVID-19+Patients","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23700,""
"Happiness, Domains of Life Satisfaction, Perceptions, and Valuation Differences Across Genders","Happiness is strongly associated with goal attainment, productivity, mental health and suicidal risk. This paper examines the effect of satisfaction with areas of life on subjective well-being (SWB), the importance of relative perceptions compared to absolute measures in predicting overall life satisfaction, and differences in the domains of life which have the greatest impact on happiness of men and women. The findings suggest that relative perceptions have a large statistically significant effect on SWB. Satisfaction with family life and health have the largest while satisfaction with income has the lowest impact on overall SWB for both genders. Work satisfaction is more important for men than for women, whereas partner's happiness is more valued by female respondents. Satisfaction with household compared to personal income has a larger effect on SWB in all subsamples except employed women. Understanding the perceived and factual determinants of happiness has urgent implications in the context of the detrimental impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on SWB.","Milovanska-Farrington, Stefani, Farrington, Stephen","https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3823637","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23701,""
"Surviving the Covid-19 Pandemic: An Examination of Adaptive Coping Strategies","The mental health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic have been significant in Australia. The aim of this study was to investigate coping strategies that individuals have adopted to assist them through this stressful period. Survey data collected in September and December 2020 as part of a larger study (the COLLATE project) was analysed. The number of adaptive coping strategies endorsed by respondents had a significant negative relationship with depression and a significant positive relationship with resilience. Females tended to use more of these strategies than men, as did people who said their mental health had improved rather than deteriorated because of the COVID-19 restrictions imposed by government. Specific adaptive coping strategies differed for those with and without a mental illness. People with a mental illness were more likely to seek professional and online help, while people without a mental illness were more likely to use self-help. Focusing on what one is grateful for and keeping oneself productively occupied (â€œusing the time to do things around the houseâ€) were the most beneficial coping strategies in terms of alleviating depression, anxiety and stress. Public health messaging promoting adaptive coping strategies may be useful in bolstering the mental health of individuals during lockdown periods. In particular, the promotion of coping flexibility should be recommended rather than the frequent use of the same coping strategies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Funding: AP and WLT are supported by National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia (NHMRC) Project Grants (CIA- GNT1159953, CIA- GNT1161609, respectively).

"Caregivers of people with dementia and mental health during COVID-19: findings from a cross-sectional study","Background:  There is sparse evidence on the impact on vulnerable populations of the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of our study was to explore burden and mental wellbeing (including depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms) in caregivers of people with dementia during the first wave of the pandemic in Italy and southern Switzerland, two bordering regions severely hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We conducted an online cross-sectional survey with family carers of people with dementia between May and June 2020. We registered socio-demographic characteristics, and information about the relationship with the care recipient, dementia subtype, care inputs from others, and the need of care of the person with dementia. We measured caregiver burden with the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI), psychological distress with the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), and perceived isolation with the 3-item UCLA Loneliness Scale (UCLALS3). Results Caregivers (N=571) reported moderate to severe care-related burden (mean=54.30;SD=18.33), moderate anxiety symptoms (mean=10.04;SD=6.93), mild depressive symptoms (mean=11.79;SD=6.12) and mild stress (mean=12.95;SD=5.53), and 72.3% of participants reported to feel lonely. All scores were significantly more severe in Swiss compared to Italian caregivers (all p values&lt;0.001). Conclusions We found that caregiversâ€™ burden, anxiety symptoms, depression and perceived loneliness were marked during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, in two severely hit bordering countries. Regional differences in the impact of the epidemic on caregivers could be due to contextual, societal, and cultural circumstances. As the pandemic endures, support to caregivers of people with dementia should be proportionate and tailored to needs and adapted to contextual factors.","Messina, Anna, Lattanzi, Martina, Albanese, Emiliano, Fiordelli, Maddalena","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-966605/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23703,""

"Automatic Detection of Depression from Stratified Samples of Audio Data","Depression is a common mental disorder which has been affecting millions of people around the world and becoming more severe with the arrival of COVID-19. Nevertheless proper diagnosis is not accessible in many regions due to a severe shortage of psychiatrists. This scarcity is worsened in low-income countries which have a psychiatrist to population ratio 210 times lower than that of countries with better economies. This study aimed to explore applications of deep learning in diagnosing depression from voice samples. We collected data from the DAIC-WOZ database which contained 189 vocal recordings from 154 individuals. Voice samples from a patient with a PHQ-8 score equal or higher than 10 were deemed as depressed and those with a PHQ-8 score lower than 10 were considered healthy. We applied mel-spectrogram to extract relevant features from the audio. Three types of encoders were tested i.e. 1D CNN, 1D CNN-LSTM, and 1D CNN-GRU. After tuning hyperparameters systematically, we found that 1D CNN-GRU encoder with a kernel size of 5 and 15 seconds of recording data appeared to have the best performance with F1 score of 0.75, precision of 0.64, and recall of 0.92.","Manoret, Pongpak, Chotipurk, Punnatorn, Sunpaweravong, Sompoom, Jantrachotechatchawan, Chanati, Duangrattanalert, Kobchai","https://www.google.com/search?q=Automatic+Detection+of+Depression+from+Stratified+Samples+of+Audio+Data","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23705,""

"Why is non-suicidal self-injury more prevalent among women? Mediation and moderation analyses of psychological distress, emotion dysregulation, and impulsivity","Objective Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) appears to be more common among women than men, though the underlying reasons for this remain unclear. In a community sample of young adults ( n =996, aged 18-30) assessed during the COVID-19 pandemic, we investigated gendered patterns in NSSI etiology. Methods Mediation and moderation analyses considered associations between past-year NSSI prevalence, gender, and putative mechanistic variables: self-reported psychological distress (K10), emotion dysregulation (DERS), and impulsivity (UPPS-P). Results Nearly twice as many women as men reported past-year NSSI (14.47% versus 7.78%). Women reported significantly higher psychological distress and significantly lower sensation seeking and positive urgency than men. Psychological distress partially statistically mediated the relationship between gender and past-year NSSI. Gender did not significantly moderate associations between self-reported distress, emotion dysregulation, or impulsivity and past-year NSSI. Past-year NSSI prevalence did not significantly decrease with age and we found no significant age by gender interaction. Conclusions Greater levels of NSSI in young women are explained by their greater levels of emotional distress. Women do not appear to be more likely than men to report NSSI due to differences in how they manage emotional distress: gender did not moderate the association between psychological distress and past-year NSSI, and there were no gender differences in emotion dysregulation or negative urgency. Furthermore, we show that NSSI remains prevalent beyond adolescence. Early interventions which reduce distress or improve distress tolerance, strengthen emotion regulation skills, and provide alternative coping strategies merit investigation for NSSI.

"Disentangling dynamic affect trajectories for distinct depression courses during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background. Why does adversity lead to mental health complaints in some, but not others? Individual differences in the development of depressive complaints are related to the regulation of affect states. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a prolonged period of perturbations to the daily lives of people across the globe, providing an unparalleled opportunity to investigate how fluctuations in positive and negative affect relate to the evolution of mood complaints.Methods. 228 participants from the Boston College daily sleep and well-being survey completed at least 20 assessments of positive and negative affect and depression complaints between March 20th 2020 and June 26th 2020. We explored affect trajectories throughout this period and estimated longitudinal multilevel network models. Furthermore, we investigated how individual network structures relate to changes in depression severity over time.Results. On average, positive affect was reported somewhat higher than negative affect. However, when separating affect trajectories based on the individualsâ€™ depressive complaints, we identified that individuals consistently experiencing depressive complaints report higher levels of negative affect compared with positive affect. Contrary, individuals consistently reporting no depressive complaints show opposite results. Furthermore, we found many and strong associations in the multilevel network between the distinct affect states and depressive complaints. Lastly, we established that the higher the connectivity of an individualâ€™s network, the larger their change in depressive complaints is.Conclusions. We conclude that affect fluctuations are directly related to the development of depressive complaints, both within- and across individuals, and both within a single measurement moment and over time.","Lunansky, Gabriela, Hoekstra, Ria, Blanken, Tessa","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/hv4cb","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23708,""
"Impact of Family Function on Mental Health Problems of College Students in China During COVID-19 Pandemic and Moderating Role of Coping Style: A Longitudinal Study","Background:  . During the COVID-19 pandemic, college students were required to stay at home and maintain social distancing the entire spring semester of 2020. There is little research on how family function influenced mental health problems and how coping styles moderated the relationship between family function and mental health problems among college students during their stay-at-home period. Methods:  . We carried out four evaluations between February and October 2020 through an online survey. A total of 13,462 college students (age = 16--29 years) participated. Family function, coping styles, depression symptoms, and anxiety symptoms were studied. To evaluate the associations between variables, a generalized estimating equation was used. Results:  . Findings indicate that the incidence rates of depression rose during stay-at-home period from 33.87% to 40.08% after schools reopened. The incidence rates of anxiety rose from 17.45% to 26.53% through the entire period. The two-way interaction of time Ã— family function for depression and anxiety were significant (<U+03C7> 2 = 52.97, p &lt; 0.001 and <U+03C7> 2 = 51.25, p &lt; 0.001, respectively).

"Predicting self-harm and suicide ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia: A brief report of nationwide survey","Background: It is estimated that 77.0% of suicide cases occurred in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs), which would increase because of the COVID-19 pandemic and socioeconomic inequity. However, there is lack of reports on this topic from LMICs, especially during the pandemic. Therefore, this nationwide study aimed to explore self-harm and suicide ideation and its predictive variables during the pandemic in Indonesia as a MIC with the highest COVID-19 fatality rate in Asia. Methods: Non-random sampling online survey was conducted nationwide between 25 May and 16 June 2021. The collected data were demographic variables (i.e. age group), loneliness from social isolation using The UCLA Loneliness Scale Six Items (ULS-6), and self-harm and suicide ideation using item 9 of The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Predictive model was analyzed using hierarchical logistic regression. Results: A total of 5,211 participants from all 34 provinces in Indonesia completed the survey. Among 39.3% of them reported self-harm and suicide ideation during the pandemic, which significantly correlated with loneliness. The predictive variables associated with the likelihood of self-harm and suicide ideation were age, residence, job, religion, sex-gender, sexual orientation, HIV status, disability status, and loneliness. The predictive model showed a significant goodness-of-fit to the observed data (x2(15) = 1,803.46, p&lt;.001), RN2 = .40. Conclusion: Four out of 10 Indonesians experienced self-harm and suicide ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly people within the age range of 18-24, living in the Java Island, unemployed/student/retired and freelancer, women, members of minority and marginalized communities, and experience of loneliness during the pandemic.","Liem, Andrian, Prawira, Benny, Magdalena, Selvi, Siandita, Monica Jenifer, Hudiyana, Joevarian","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/f3c8w","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23710,""
"Symptoms network analysis of serious mental illness: A cross disasters comparison","Background The Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K-6) has been used worldwide in community epidemiological surveys and served as a screening measure for serious mental illness in the general population. We take a novel approach by examining the symptoms network of the K-6 and the exploration of differences between three types of disasters: Nature related, Terror attacks, and COVID-19. Aims To explore the K-6 symptoms network and its structure replication across the three types of disasters. Methods A network analysis of psychological distress symptoms as assessed by the K-6 was conducted using data from 9,271 participants from different disaster samples: Terror (n = 5842), COVID-19 (n = 2428), and Nature related (n = 1001). Results While there were extensive connections between items across all disaster samples, network structure differed across the disaster types. While after a nature related disaster and the COVID-19 pandemic depression- and anxiety-items were interconnected, a terror attack resulted in more separated manifestations of anxiety and depression. Centrality analysis showed â€œdepressed/no cheering upâ€ to be the node with the highest strength centrality in all networks;in the Nature-related network, â€œrestless or fidgetyâ€ was also highly central. Conclusions Results:  provide evidence of different psychological distress structures in different disasters. Depending on the type of disaster, trauma-focused interventions may need to be augmented, with specific components directed at depression and/or anxiety.","Levin, Yafit, Rahel, Bachem, Goodwin, Robin, Ben-Ezra, Menachem","https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.10.21255242","","Database: other preprints; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23711,""
"Pandemic-Related Differences in Physical and Mental Health of Older Adults","Background:  As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in data collection methods have been introduced in research to ensure continuity despite physical distancing and lockdown restrictions. However, little is currently known about the potential differences in information collected using these traditional face-to-face methods compared to the incorporation of virtual methods to address the above, particularly in studies involving older adults. Aims Our objectives were, therefore, to compare data collected during the pandemic using hybrid methods from older individuals participating in falls research to that collected through traditional face-to-face methods. Methods Participants comprised of individuals recruited to two fall studies which hurdled the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Both studies recruited individuals aged 60 years and over with at least one fall in the past 12 months, and controls with no history of falls in the past 12 months. Pre-pandemic, individuals were interviewed face-to-face exclusively, those interviews after the start of the pandemic were conducted virtually with physical assessments conducted face-to-face to minimize physical contact. Cognitive, physical, and psychological status were determined using the visual cognitive assessment tool (VCAT), timed-up-and-go (TUG), functional reach (FR), handgrip strength (HGS), and the 21-item depression, anxiety and stress scale (DASS-21). In addition quality of life, physical activity and social participation were also measured. Results Of the 145 participants (median age (interquartile range, IQR) of 73.5 (67-81) years), 69 (47.6%) were interviewed face-to-face, while 76 (53.4%) were assessed using a hybrid method. Participants in both groups had similar age, gender, ethnic breakdown, marital status, education levels, anthropometric measurements, and medication burden. More face-to-face participants had hypertension and fall compared to hybrid participants Differences were observed in presence of fall characteristics, with fewer fallers seeing a doctor and more fallers attending the emergency department after the start of the pandemic. After adjustment for baseline differences, participants interviewed using hybrid status had lower depression scores (odds ratio, OR (95% confidence interval, CI)=0.29(0.14-0.61) and stress scores (OR(95%CI)=0.33(0.15-0.72)), but greater fear of falling (OR(95%CI)=2.16(1.04-4.48)) and reduced social participation (OR(95%CI)=2.64(1.20-5.79)). Conclusion Alterations in recruitment and data collection methods to overcome pandemic restrictions should take into consideration potential differences in individuals who agree to participate as well as the influence of major life events on the psychological status of participants.","Lau, Chun Fatt, Shahimi, Nur Husna, Mat, Sumaiyah, Kioh, Sheng Hui, Khoo, Ee Ming, Zakaria, Mohd Idzwan, Khaliddin, Nurliza, Mazlan, Mazlina, Khoo, Selina, Saedon, Nor Izzati, Khor, Hui Min, Nyman, Samuel, Morgan, Karen, Tan, Maw Pin","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1044202/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23712,""
"Effect of Internet Addiction on Depression among Pakistani Population amidst the COVID 19","Background:  Internet addiction has proved to have detrimental effects on the mental health wellbeing of people. During COVID19, these effects are amplified significantly;therefore, this study aims to assess the effect of internet addiction (IA) on the presence of depression among the Pakistani population amidst COVID 19. Methods:  A cross-sectional design was employed using an anonymous web-based survey link. This link was disseminated via different social media platforms. The ""Young's Internet Addiction Test"" (IAT) and ""Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21"" (DASS-21) screening tools were used to measure Internet addiction (IA) and level of depression respectively. Adjusted odds ratios along with 95% confidence interval were reported using multinomial logistic regression for the association of IA and other predictors associated with depression. Results:  A total of 1145 individuals has completed this survey. Overall, the prevalence of severe and extremely severe depression was found to be 9.7% and 16.4% amidst the Pakistani population during the Covid-19 outbreak. The odds of extreme depression were 15 times more among (AIU) addicted internet users (95% CI: 8.26-28.8) and 7 times more among (PIU) problematic internet users (95% CI: 4.57-12.05) as compared to (NIU) normal internet users. Conclusion:  In the aftermath of COVID 19, depression was found to be significantly related to internet addiction. This study determined that addicted and problematic internet users are more prone to suffer from depression.","Lakhdir, Maryam Pyar Ali, Angez, Meher, Nathwani, Apsara Ali, Hameed, Ayesha Nasir, Khan, Malik Muhammad Hamza, Nawaz, Muhammad Talha, Peerwani, Ghazal, Azam, Syed Iqbal","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1103202/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23713,""
"Distinct trans-placental effects of maternal immune activation by TLR3 and TLR7 agonists: implications for schizophrenia risk","Exposure to infection in utero predisposes towards psychiatric diseases such as autism, depression and schizophrenia in later life. The mechanisms involved are typically studied by administering mimetics of double-stranded (ds) RNA viral or bacterial infection to pregnant rats or mice. The effect of single-stranded (ss) virus mimetics has been largely ignored, despite evidence linking prenatal ss virus exposure specifically with psychiatric disease. Understanding the effects of gestational ss virus exposure has become even more important with the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In this study, in pregnant mice, we compare directly the effects, on the maternal blood, placenta and the embryonic brain, of maternal administration of ds-virus mimetic poly I:C (to activate toll-like receptor 3, TLR3) and ss-virus mimetic resiquimod (to activate TLR7/8). We find that, 4h after the administration, both poly I:C and resiquimod elevated the levels of IL-6, TNFa, and chemokines including CCL2 and CCL5, in maternal plasma. Both agents also increased placental mRNA levels of IL-6 and IL-10, but only resiquimod increased placental TNFa mRNA. In foetal brain, poly I:C produced no detectable immune-response-related increases, whereas pronounced increases in cytokine (e.g. Il-6, Tnf a) and chemokine (e.g. Ccl2, Ccl5 ) expression were observed with maternal resiquimod administration. The data show substantial differences between the effect of maternal exposure to a TLR7/8 activator as compared to a TLR3 activator. There are significant implications for future modelling of diseases where maternal ss virus exposure contributes to environmental disease risk in offspring.","Kwon, Jaedeok, Suessmilch, Maria, McColl, Alison, Cavanagh, Jonathan, Morris, Brian","https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.20.460754","","Database: other preprints; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23714,""
"Lifestyle Changes, Mental Health, and Health-related Quality of Life in Children Aged 6-7 Years Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic in South Germany","Background:  The measures against the COVID-19 pandemic are challenging for children and parents, and detrimental effects on child health are suggested especially from lock-down measures and school closings. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using a population based longitudinal (birth-) cohort study (SPATZ study) conducted in the South of Germany. Data included all children of the 6- and 7-year follow-up for whom a questionnaire was completed during first grade of school. Consequently, we were able to analyze children being in first grade before the first lockdown in Germany (=15 th March 2020), as well as children being in first grade during the pandemic (&gt;15 th March 2020). We conducted descriptive statistics and estimated the associations between the two time periods, before and during the pandemic, and various outcomes of child health using multivariable adjusted linear or logistic regression modeling. The analysis was stratified by gender. Results: Results among n=362 children aged six or seven years showed substantially lower mean scores of health-related quality of life (b: -5.5, 95% confidence interval (CI): -9.0, -2.0), and higher mean scores in emotional and behavioral difficulties (b: 2.0, 95% CI: 0.2, 3.8) in girls during vs. before the COVID-19 pandemic using multivariable linear regression modeling. In addition, weekly screen-time was increased in boys by 3.5 hours (95% CI: 0.6, 6.4). We did not find substantial differences in sleep quality, physical activity, and time spent with books, neither in boys nor in girls, however, the limited sample size has to be considered. Conclusion: Child health (and behavior) of first grade school children is possibly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic with adverse consequences possibly differing by gender.","Kurz, Deborah, Braig, Stefanie, Genuneit, Jon, Rothenbacher, Dietrich","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-934189/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23715,""
"A Cross-sectional Study on Perceived Workplace Health Support and Health-Related Quality of Life","Objective Many companies in Japan have been increasingly interested in â€œhealth and productivity management (H&PM).â€ In terms of H&PM, we supposed that companies can enhance their employeesâ€™ perceived workplace health support (PWHS) by providing support for workersâ€™ lively working and healthy living. This could then improve health-related QOL (HRQOL) by increasing PWHS. This study explored the relationship between PWHS and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Methods During the COVID-19 pandemic in December 2020, we conducted an Internet-based nationwide health survey of Japanese workers (CORoNaWork study). A database of 27,036 participants was created. The question regarding the intensity of PWHS was measured using a four-point Likert scale. We used a linear mixed model (LMM) to analyze the relationship between the intensity of PWHS and the four domains of CDC HRQOL-4 (self-rated health, number of poor physical health days, number of poor mental-health days, and activity limitation days during the past 30 days). Results In the sex- and age-adjusted and multivariate models, the intensity of PWHS had a main effect on self-rated health and the three domains of unhealthy days (physical, mental, activity limitation). There was also a trend toward worse HRQOL scores as the PWHS decreased. Conclusions This study aimed to document the relationship between PWHS and HRQOL. We found that the higher the PWHS of Japanese workers, the higher their self-rated health and the lower their unhealthy days. Companies need to assess workersâ€™ PWHS and HRQOL and promote H&PM. H&PM is also necessary to maintain and promote the health of workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kurogi, Kazushirou, Ikegami, Kazunori, Eguchi, Hisashi, Tsuji, Mayumi, Tateishi, Seiichiro, Nagata, Tomohisa, Matsuda, Shinya, Fujino, Yoshihisa, Ogami, Akira, the, CORoNaWork Project","https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.01.21262994","","Database: other preprints; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23716,""
"Behavioral Healthcare Providersâ€™ Experiences Related to use of Telehealth as a Result of the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Exploratory Study","Background:  Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers were forced to shift many services quickly from in-person to virtual, including substance use disorder (SUD) and mental health (MH) treatment services. This led to a sharp increase in use of telehealth services, with health systems seeing patients virtually at hundreds of times the rate as before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.By analyzing qualitative data about SUD and MH care providersâ€™ experiences using telehealth, this study aims to elucidate emergent themes related to telehealth use by the front-line behavioral health workforce. Methods: This study uses qualitative data from large-scale web surveys distributed to SUD and MH providers between May and August 2020. At the end of these surveys, the following question was posed in free-response form: â€œ Is there anything else you would like to say about use of telehealth during or after the COVID-19 pandemic? â€ The 391 responses to this question were analyzed for emergent themes using a conventional approach to content analysis. Results: Three major themes emerged in the data: COVID-specific experiences with telehealth, general experiences with telehealth, and recommendations to continue telehealth delivery. Convenience, access to new populations, and lack of commute were frequently cited advantages, while perceived ineffectiveness of and limited access to technology were frequently cited disadvantages. Also commonly mentioned was the relaxation of reimbursement regulations. Providers supported continuation of relaxed regulations, increased institutional support, and using a combination of telehealth and in-person care in their practices. Conclusions: This study advanced our knowledge of how the behavioral health workforce experiences telehealth delivery. Further longitudinal research comparing treatment outcomes of those receiving in-person and virtual services will be necessary to undergird organizationsâ€™ financial support, and perhaps also legislative support, of virtual SUD and MH services.","Kisicki, Abby, Becker, Sara, Chaple, Michael, Gustafson, David, Hartzler, Bryan, Jacobson, Nora, Murphy, Ann, Tapscott, Stephanie, Molfenter, Todd","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-965869/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23717,""
"Community social vulnerability and access to medications for opioid use disorder within the continental US: A cross-sectional study","The COVID-19 pandemic, like past natural disasters, was associated with significant disruptions in medications for opioid use disorder services and increased opioid overdose and mortality. We examined the association between community vulnerability to disasters and pandemics and geographic access to each of the three medications for opioid use disorder within the continental US and if this association was impacted by urban, suburban, or rural classification. We found communities with greater vulnerability did not have greater geographic access to medications for opioid use disorder and the mismatch between vulnerability and medication access was greatest in suburban communities. Rural communities had poor geographic access to all three medications regardless of vulnerability. Future disaster preparedness planning should include anticipation of access to medications for opioid use disorder and better match the location of services to communities with greater vulnerability to prevent inequities in opioid overdose deaths.","Joudrey, Paul, Kolak, Marynia, Lin, Qinyun, Paykin, Susan, Anguiano, Vidal, Wang, Emily","https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.30.21264351","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23718,""
"ASSOCIATION BETWEEN EMOTIONAL STABILITY AND SUICIDALITY IN A BRAZILIAN SAMPLE OF THE GENERAL POPULATION DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND THE MODERATION ROLE OF FINANCIAL HARDSHIP","Introduction: Emotional stability is considered to be a protective factor for suicidal behavior. Nonetheless, suicidality is the result of a complex interaction of protective and risk factors, a key one being financial difficulties. Objective: We aimed to investigate the association between emotional stability and suicidality in Brazilian individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic and the moderation role of financial hardship. Method: A total of 2140 participants, 79.4% women, answered an online survey from November 2020 to January 2021, containing questions about suicidality as well as concerning economic hardship. The personality data was assessed with the TIPI. We used Pearson chi-square to compare categorical variables and Student t-test to compare continuous variables. Finally, we conducted multiple regression and moderation analysis using SPSS PROCESS v3.5 Macro model 1. Results: The participants who reported not having presented a wish to die, suicide intent, or suicide attempt in the previous month showed a significantly higher level of emotional stability. There was a significant interaction with financial hardship (p=0,006) for suicide attempt as the outcome, with significant association between emotional stability and suicide attempts only in the absence of financial hardship.

"Towards responsible research in digital technology for health care","Digital technology is everywhere for the benefit of our daily and professional life. It strongly impacts our life and was crucial to maintain professional and social activities during the COVID19 crisis. Similarly, digital technologies are key within biomedical engineering research topics. Innovations have been generated and introduced over the last 40 years, demonstrating how computing and digital technologies have impacted health care. Although the benefits of digital technology are obvious now, we are at the convergence of several issues which makes us aware about social, societal and environmental challenges associated with this technology. In the social domain, digital technologies raise concern about exclusion (financial, geographical, educational, demographical, racial, gender, language, and disabled related exclusion) and physical and mental health. In the societal dimension, digital technologies raise concern about politics and democracy (sovereignty and governance, cognitive filters and citizen's engagement), privacy and security (data acquisition and usage transparency, level of personal approval, and level of anonymization), and economics. In the environmental dimension, digital technologies raise concern about energy consumption and hardware production. This paper introduces and defines these challenges for digital technology in general, as well as when applied to health care. The objective of this paper is to make the research community more aware about the challenges of digital technology and to promote more transparency for innovative and responsible research.","Jannin, Pierre","https://www.google.com/search?q=Towards+responsible+research+in+digital+technology+for+health+care","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23720,""
"Factors influencing wellbeing in young people during COVID-19: A survey with 6291 young people in Wales","COVID-19 infection and the resultant restrictions has impacted all aspects of life across the world. This study explores factors that promote or support wellbeing for young people during the pandemic, how they differ by age, using a self-reported online survey with those aged 8 - 25 in Wales between September 2020 and February 2021. Open-ended responses were analysed via thematic analysis to provide further context. A total of 6,291 responses were obtained from 81 education settings across Wales (including primary and secondary schools as well as sixth form, colleges and universities). Wellbeing was highest in primary school children and boys and lowest in those who were at secondary school children, who were girls and, those who preferred not to give a gender. Among primary school children, higher wellbeing was seen for those who played with others (rather than alone), were of Asian ethnicity (OR 2.3, 95% CI: 1.26 to 4.3), lived in a safe area (OR: 2.0, 95% CI: 1.67 to 2.5) and had more sleep. To support their wellbeing young people reported they would like to be able to play with their friends more. Among secondary school children those who were of mixed ethnicity reported lower wellbeing (OR: 5.10, 95% CI: 1.70 to 15.80). To support their wellbeing they reported they would like more support with mental health (due to anxiety and pressure to achieve when learning online). This study found self-reported wellbeing differed by gender, ethnicity and deprivation and found younger children report the need for play and to see friends to support wellbeing but older children/young people wanted more support with anxiety and educational pressures.","James, Michaela, Jones, Hope, Baig, Amana, Marchant, Emily, Waites, Tegan, Todd, Charlotte, Hughes, Karen, Brophy, Sinead","https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.13.21261959","","Database: other preprints; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23721,""
"Labour Market Shocks During the Covid-19 Pandemic, Inequalities and Child Outcomes","We study the effect of negative labour market shocks borne by parents during the Covid-19 crisis on resource and time investments in children and the channels through which negative labour market shocks experienced by parents might affect children. Using data collected in the UK before and during the pandemic, we show that fathers and mothers that were already disadvantaged were more likely to have suffered negative earnings and employment shocks. These shocks had an immediate intergenerational impact: Children whose fathers reported an earnings drop to zero are significantly less likely to have received additional paid learning resources compared to similar children whose fathers did not experience a drop in earnings. Potentially offsetting this, they received about 30 more mins of parental help with schoolwork per day. Parental mental health is negatively affected when they experience earnings losses, and fathers who experience a full loss in earnings were less likely to quarrel or talk about things that matter with their kids than fathers who did not suffer earnings drops. The interactions between labour market shocks, parental investments and school closures are likely to have important implications for future inequality.","Hupkau, Claudia, Isphording, Ingo, Machin, Stephen, Ruiz-Valenzuela, Jenifer","https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3758701","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23722,""
"Safeguarding Adolescent Mental Health in India (SAMA): study protocol for co-design and feasibility study of a school systems intervention targeting adolescent anxiety and depression in India","Introduction Symptoms of anxiety and depression in Indian adolescents are common. Schools can be opportune sites for delivery of mental health interventions. India, however, is without a whole-school mental health approach. This article describes the study design for the Safeguarding Adolescent Mental Health in India (SAMA) project. The aim of SAMA is to co-design and feasibility test a suite of multi-component interventions across the intersecting systems of adolescents, schools, families and their local communities in India. Methods and analysis Our project will co-design and feasibility test four interventions to run in parallel in eight schools (three assigned to waitlist) in Bengaluru and Kolar in Karnataka, India. The primary aim is to reduce the prevalence of adolescent anxiety and depression. Co-design of interventions will build on existing evidence and resources. Interventions for adolescents at school will be universal, incorporating curriculum and social components. Interventions for parents and teachers will target mental health literacy, and also for teachers, training in positive behaviour practices. Intervention in the school community will target school climate to improve student mental health literacy and care. Intervention for the wider community will be via adolescent-led films and social media. We will generate intervention cost estimates, test outcome measures and identify pathways to increase policy action on the evidence. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been granted by the National Institute of Mental Health Neurosciences Research Ethics Committee (NIMHANS/26 th IEC (Behv Sc Div / 2020/2021)) and the University of Leeds School of Psychology Research Ethics Committee (PSYC-221). Certain data will be available on a data sharing site. Findings will be disseminated via peer-reviewed journals and conferences. Article Summary Strengths and Limitations A key strength of this study is its focus on depression and anxiety prevention, both of which are the common adolescent mental health problems in India. The study utilises a public mental health systems approach, which adopts a â€˜person-in-contextâ€™ perspective and recognises multiple determinants of mental health. Extensive co-design of interventions will promote cultural relevance and acceptability by key stakeholders, including adolescents, teachers, parents and school communities. The Covid-19 pandemic makes this research more pertinent but may affect recruitment of the schools / adolescents or may lead to participation bias if the study processes are conducted online by excluding those with limited access or who lack technical skills.

"Global research on syndemics: A meta-knowledge analysis (2001-2020)","Syndemics or synergies of cooccurring epidemics are widely studies across health and social sciences in recent years. We conducted a meta-knowledge analysis of articles published between 2001 to 2020 in this growing field of academic scholarship. We found a total of 830 articles authored by 3025 authors, mostly from high-income countries. Publications on syndemics are gradually increasing since 2003, with rapid development in 2013. Each article was cited more than 15 times on average, whereas most (n = 604) articles were original studies. Syndemics research focused on several areas, including HIV/AIDS, substance abuse, mental health, gender minority stressors, racism, violence, chronic physical and mental disorders, food insecurity, social determinants of health, and COVID-19. Moreover, biopsychosocial interactions between multiple health problems were studied across medical, anthropological, public health, and other disciplines of science. The limited yet rapidly evolving literature on syndemics informs transdisciplinary interests to understand complex coexisting health challenges in the context of systematic exclusion and structural violence in vulnerable populations. The findings also suggest applications of syndemic theory to evaluate clinical and public health problems, examine the socioecological dynamics of factors influencing health and wellbeing, and use the insights to alleviate health inequities in the intersections of synergistic epidemics and persistent contextual challenges for population health.","Hossain, Md Mahbub, Saha, Nobonita, Rodela, Tahmina Tasnim, Tasnim, Samia, Nuzhath, Tasmiah, Roy, Tamal Joyti, Burdine, James, Ahmed, Helal Uddin, McKyer, Lisako, Basu, Banga Kamal, Ma, Ping","https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.19.21257413","","Database: other preprints; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23724,""
"The COVID-19 Shock and Consumer Credit: Evidence from Credit Card Data","We use credit card data from the Federal Reserve Board's FR Y-14M reports to study the impact of the COVID-19 shock on the use and availability of consumer credit across borrower types from March through August 2020. We document an initial sharp decrease in credit card transactions and outstanding balances in March and April. While spending starts to recover by May, especially for risky borrowers, balances remain depressed overall. We find a strong negative impact of local pandemic severity on credit use, which becomes smaller over time, consistent with pandemic fatigue. Restrictive public health interventions also negatively affect credit use, but the pandemic itself is the main driver. We further document a large reduction in credit card originations, especially to risky borrowers. Consistent with a tightening of credit supply and a flight-to-safety response of banks, we find an increase in interest rates of newly issued credit cards to less creditworthy borrowers.","Horvath, Akos, Kay, Benjamin, Wix, Carlo","https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3832359","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23725,""
"The COVID-19 Pandemic's Evolving Impacts on the Labor Market: Who's Been Hurt and What We Should Do","In this paper, we shed light on the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the labor market, and how they have evolved over most of the year 2020. Relying primarily on microdata from the CPS and state-level data on virus caseloads, mortality, and policy restrictions, we consider a range of employment outcomesâ€”including permanent layoffs, which generate large and lasting costsâ€”and how these outcomes vary across demographic groups, occupations, and industries over time. We also examine how these employment patterns vary across different states, according to the timing and severity of virus caseloads, deaths, and closure measures. We find that the labor market recovery of the summer and early fall stagnated in late fall and early winter. As noted by others, we find low-wage and minority workers are hardest hit initially, but that recoveries have varied, and not always consistently, between Blacks and Hispanics. Statewide business closures and other restrictions on economic activity reduce employment rates concurrently, but do not seem to have lingering effects once relaxed. In contrast, virus deathsâ€”but not caseloadsâ€”not only depress current employment, but produce accumulating harm. We conclude with policy options for states to repair their labor markets.","Hershbein, Brad, Holzer, Harry","https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3789375","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23726,""
"THE US MIDLIFE MORTALITY CRISIS CONTINUES: EXCESS CAUSE-SPECIFIC MORTALITY DURING 2020","ABSTRACT COVID-19 prematurely ended many lives, particularly among the oldest Americans, but the pandemic also had an indirect effect on health and non-COVID mortality among the working-age population, who suffered the brunt of the economic consequences. This analysis investigates whether monthly excess mortality in the US during 2020 varied by age and cause of death. Based on national-level death counts and population estimates for 1999-2020, negative binomial regression modelsâ€”fit separately by sexâ€” were used to estimate monthly cause-specific excess mortality by age group during 2020. Among males, 71% non-COVID excess deaths occurred at working ages (25-64), but those ages accounted for only 36% of non-COVID excess deaths in females. The results revealed substantial numbers of excess deaths from external causes (particularly among males), heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimerâ€™s disease (particularly among women), and cerebrovascular disease. For males, the largest share of non-COVID excess deaths resulted from external causes, nearly 80% of which occurred at working ages. Although incorrectly classified COVID-19 deaths may explain some excess non-COVID mortality, misclassification is unlikely to explain the increase in external causes of mortality. Auxiliary analyses suggested that drug-related mortality may be driving the rise in external mortality, but drug overdoses were already increasing for a full year prior to the pandemic. The oldest Americans bore the brunt of COVID-19 mortality, but working-age Americans, particularly men, suffered substantial numbers of excess non-COVID deaths, most commonly from external causes and heart disease.","Glei, Dana","https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.17.21257241","","Database: other preprints; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23727,""
"Effect of Single Session Receptive Music Therapy on Anxiety and Vital Parameters in Hospitalized Covid-19 Patients: A Randomized Controlled Trial","Hospitalized COVID-19 patients are vulnerable to different degrees of stress disorders as well as depression, anxiety and fear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of introducing Music therapy (MT) on site with Covid-19 patients and investigating the immediate effects a single session has on anxiety, heart rate (HR), oxygen saturation (O2Sat) and satisfaction compared to standard care. A randomized controlled trial of 40 patients was conducted. Participants were assigned to control group (CG) or the MT group (MG). MG received an individual single session of music therapy in presence. CG received standard care. MG and CG were subjected to identical measurements (pre-during-post) of the parameters STAI-Y, HR and O2Sat. Participants in MG were asked to fill in an optional open-ended question concerning their experience with MT. Significant difference in anxiety levels between scores in MG and CG (34.50 (23.25 - 40.00) vs 45.00(38, 25 - 54.00);p = 0.000) was observed. MG compared to CG had statistically significantly higher values of O2Sat (97.50 (96.25 - 99.00) versus 96.00 (96.00- 98.00);p = 0.026). Results show the feasibility of introducing MT as a supporting complementary/non-pharmacological intervention on site in Covid-19 patients. A single session of MT improves O2Sat and can significantly reduce anxiety.","Giordano, Filippo, Losurdo, Antonella, Quaranta, Vitaliano, Campobasso, Nicla, Daleno, Antonio, Carpagnano, Elisiana, Gesualdo, Loreto, Moschetta, Antonio, Brienza, Nicola","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-948288/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23728,""
"Pre-pandemic mental health and disruptions to healthcare, economic, and housing outcomes during COVID â€“19: evidence from 12 UK longitudinal studies","Background The COVID-19 pandemic and associated virus suppression measures have disrupted lives and livelihoods and people already experiencing mental ill-health may have been especially vulnerable. Aim To quantify mental health inequalities in disruptions to healthcare, economic activity and housing. Method 59,482 participants in 12 UK longitudinal adult population studies with data collected prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Within each study we estimated the association between psychological distress assessed pre-pandemic and disruptions since the start of the pandemic to three domains: healthcare (medication access, procedures, or appointments);economic activity (employment, income, or working hours);and housing (change of address or household composition). Meta-analyses were used to pool estimates across studies. Results Across the analysed datasets, one to two-thirds of participants experienced at least one disruption, with 2.3-33.2% experiencing disruptions in two or more domains. One standard deviation higher pre-pandemic psychological distress was associated with: (i) increased odds of any healthcare disruptions (OR=1.30;[95% CI:1.20â€“1.40]) with fully adjusted ORs ranging from 1.24 [1.09â€“1.41] for disruption to procedures and 1.33 [1.20â€“ 1.49] for disruptions to prescriptions or medication access;(ii) loss of employment (OR=1.13 [1.06â€“1.21]) and income (OR=1.12 [1.06 â€“1.19]) and reductions in working hours/furlough (OR=1.05 [1.00â€“1.09]);(iii) no associations with housing disruptions (OR=1.00 [0.97â€“1.03]);and (iv) increased likelihood of experiencing a disruption in at least two domains (OR=1.25 [1.18â€“1.32]) or in one domain (OR=1.11 [1.07â€“1.16]) relative to no disruption. Conclusion People experiencing psychological distress pre-pandemic have been more likely to experience healthcare and economic disruptions, and clusters of disruptions across multiple domains during the pandemic. Failing to address these disruptions risks further widening the existing inequalities in mental health.","Gessa, Giorgio Di, Maddock, Jane, Green, Michael, Thompson, Ellen, McElroy, Eoin, Davies, Helena, Mundy, Jessica, Stevenson, Anna, Kwong, Alex S.

"Qualitative analysis of the cognitive triad in a sample of the general population in response to the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has created a profound mental health challenge worldwide. The goal of this paper is to explore cognitive responses to the pandemic in order to better understand underlying beliefs for those reporting and not reporting symptoms of depression within the context of a period of realistic health, economic and social threat. This paper described a cross-sectional survey carried out with a convenience sample from the general population between December 2020 and February 2021. As part of that survey, adult respondents (n=555) were asked to fill in open text box questions which provided prompts of the Cognitive Triad: â€œI amâ€¦/I am notâ€¦â€;â€œOthers people areâ€¦/Other people are notâ€¦â€;â€œThe world isâ€¦â€. These qualitative data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Thematic responses between people who screened above and below the cut-off for moderate depressive symptoms showed noticeable overlap, especially in terms of negative cognitions. The largest distinct difference in cognitions was the lack of positively framed cognitions across the cognitive triad in those screening above the cut-off for moderate depressive symptoms. These data highlight the importance of developing a positive cognitive framework to the pandemic, indicating that approaches such as Positive Psychology or Compassion-Focused Therapy which emphasise positive emotions, empathy, and gratitude may be particularly helpful.","Gaynor, Keith, McNamara, Roisin, O'Connor, Rachael, Schmieder, Luisa, Somers, Ellen, Hennessy, Eilis","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/jp5g4","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23730,""
"Pre-existing anxiety, depression, and neurological disability is associated with long COVID: A prospective and longitudinal cohort of the United Kingdom Multiple Sclerosis Register","ABSTRACT Objectives To assess the prevalence of long COVID among people with multiple sclerosis (MS) and its predictors, including their pre-COVID-19 functional status. Design Community-based prospective and longitudinal cohort study Setting The United Kingdom (UK) MS Register (UKMSR) COVID-19 study Participants A national cohort of people with MS and COVID-19 Main outcome measures Participants used the online questionnaire-based platform of the UKMSR to update their COVID-19 symptoms, recovery status, and duration of symptoms for those who had fully recovered. Questionnaires were date-stamped for estimation of COVID-19 symptom duration for those who had not recovered at their last follow-up. The UKMSR holds demographic and up-to-date clinical data on participants as well as their web-based Expanded Disability Status Scale (a measure of physical disability in MS) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale scores. The association between these factors and recovery from COVID-19 was assessed using multivariable Cox regression analysis. Results Out of 7,977 people with MS who participated in the UKMSR COVID-19 study, 599 had COVID-19 and updated their recovery status prospectively. At least 181 participants (31.1%) had long-standing COVID-19 symptoms for =4 weeks and 76 (13.1 %) for =12 weeks. Participants with higher levels of pre-COVID-19 physical disability, participants with anxiety and/or depression prior to COVID-19 onset, and women were less likely to report recovery from COVID-19. Conclusions Long COVID appears to disproportionately affect people with pre-existing mental health problems or physical disabilities.

"Technological and Economic Decoupling in the Cyber Era","The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the shift toward digital services. Meanwhile, the race for technological and economic leadership has heated up, with risks of decoupling that could set back trade and growth and hinder the recovery from the worst global recession since the Great Depression. This paper studies the conditions under which a country may seek to erect barriers-banning imports or exports of cyber technologies-and in effect promote decoupling or deglobalization. A well-known result is that banning imports may be optimal in monopolistic sectors, such as the digital sector. The novel result of this paper is that banning exports can also be optimal, and in some cases superior, as it prevents technological diffusion to a challenger that may eventually become the global supplier, capturing monopoly rents and posing cybersecurity risks. However, export or import bans would come at a deleterious cost to the global economy. The paper concludes that fostering international cooperation, including in the cyber domain, could be key to avoiding technological and economic decoupling and securing better livelihoods.","Garcia-Macia, Daniel, Goyal, Rishi","https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3758091","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23732,""
"The Mediating Role of Gender, Age, COVID-19 Symptoms and Changing of Mansion on the Mental Health of Healthcare Workers Operating in Italy during the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID19 pandemic tested the performance of hospitals and intensive care units around the world. Health care workers (HCWs) have been used to develop mental symptoms, but this was especially true during the COVID19 pandemic when HCWs must deal with many other sources of stress and anxiety that can usually be avoided, and long-term shifts and unprecedented population restrictions have weakened people's ability to cope with stress. The research aims to observe the dynamic interplay between burnout, depression, distress, and anxiety in HCWs working in various settings, with specific a focus on Emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and a diminished sense of personal achievement in mediating a worst mental health status during the first wave of the COVID19 pandemic in Italy. To analyze that we performed a mediation analysis, from which resulted a strong correlation among depression, psychological distress, health perception and anxiety, and the impact of job burnout on anxiety, depression, and distress. Gender seemed to have a strong correlation with burnout, anxiety, and distress;the impact of COVID19 pandemic on Quality of Life seemed to affect anxiety and depression;the changing of mansion influenced depression and job burnout. Encouraging supportive and educational strategies would certainly be recommended to policy makers.","Gambaro, Eleonora, Gramaglia, Carla, Marangon, Debora, Azzolina, Danila, Probo, Manuela, Rudoni, Marco, Zeppegno, Patrizia","https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202109.0500.v2","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23733,""

"Assessing the Acceptability of a Co-produced Long COVID Intervention in an Underserved Community in the UK","Background:  The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected people from more deprived communities. The experience of Long Covid is similarly distributed but very few investigations have concentrated on the needs of this population. The aim of this project was to co-produce an acceptable intervention for people with Long Covid, living in communities recognised as more deprived. Methods: The intervention was based on a multi-disciplinary team using approaches from sport and exercise medicine and functional rehabilitation. The co-production process was undertaken with a stakeholder advisory group and patient public involvement representation. This study identified participants by postcode and the indices of multiple deprivation (IMD);recruitment and engagement were supported by an existing health and wellbeing service. A virtual &lsquo;clinic&rsquo;was offered with a team of professional practitioners who met participants three times each;to directly consider their needs and offer structured advice. The acceptability of the intervention was based on the individual&rsquo;s participation and their completion of the intervention. Results: Ten participants were recruited with eight completing the intervention. The partnership with an existing community health and wellbeing service was deemed to be an important way of reaching participants. Two men and six women ages ranging from 38 to 73 were involved and their needs were commonly associated with fatigue, anxiety and depression with overall de-conditioning. None reported serious hardship associated with the pandemic although most were in self-employment/part-time employment or were not working due to retirement or ill-health. Two older participants lived alone, and others were single parents and had considerable challenges associated with managing a household alongside their Long Covid difficulties. Conclusions: This paper presents the needs and perspectives of eight individuals involved in the process and discusses the needs and preferences of the group in relation to their support for self- managed recovery from Long Covid.","Fowler-Davis, Sally, Young, Rachel, Maden-Wilkinson, Tom, Hameed, Waqas, Dracas, Elizabeth, Hurrell, Eleanor, Bahl, Romila, Kilcourse, Elisabeth, Robinson, Rebecca, Copeland, Robert","https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202111.0368.v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23735,""
"Diurnal Dynamics of Stress and Mood during Covid-19 Lockdown - An Ecological Momentary Assessment Study","The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in severe disruption to peopleâ€™s lives as governments imposed national â€˜lockdownsâ€™. Using ecological momentary assessment for seven days in 731 participants, we investigated how individualâ€™s stress and mood fluctuated diurnally during lockdown in spring 2020. We found that age, gender, financial security, depressive symptoms, and trait loneliness modulated the diurnal dynamics of participants' stress and mood. For example, younger and less financially secure individuals showed an attenuated reduction in stress as the day progressed and, similarly, more lonely individuals showed a diminished increase in calmness throughout the day. In addition, we collected hair samples from 140 participants and found a decrease in cortisol concentrations following lockdown, but these changes were not related to any of the assessed person-related characteristics. Our findings provide novel insights into the psychobiological impact of lockdown and have implications for how, when, and which individuals might benefit most from interventions during comparable psychologically demanding periods.","Feneberg, Anja Christine, Forbes, Paul, Piperno, Giulio, Pronizius, Ekaterina, Stijovic, Ana, Skoluda, Nadine, Lamm, Claus, Nater, Urs, Silani, Giorgia","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/9rf8g","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23736,""

We examined how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected FGM/C and CEFM in Kenya, Uganda, Senegal, and Ethiopia. Methods A cross-sectional study design with a mixed methods approach was used. Household surveys targeting women and men aged 15â€“49 years in Kenya ( n = 312 ), Uganda ( n = 278 ), Ethiopia ( n = 251 ), and Senegal ( n = 208 ) were conducted. Thirty-eight in-depth interviews with programme implementers and policymakers were carried out in Kenya ( n = 17 ), Uganda ( n = 9 ), Ethiopia ( n = 8 ), and Senegal ( n = 4 ). Results In Kenya, the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to the increase in both FGM/C and CEFM cases. Minimal increase of FGM/C cases was reported in Uganda and a significant increase in CEFM cases. In Ethiopia, the COVID-19 pandemic had a limited effect on changes in FGM/C and CEFM. In Senegal, there were minimal effects of COVID-19 on the number of FGM/C and CEFM cases. The pandemic has negatively affected implementation of interventions by the justice and legal system, the health system, and civil societies. Conclusions The pandemic has had varied effects on FGM/C and CEFM across the four countries. Across the four countries, the pandemic has negatively affected implementation of interventions by the various sectors that are responsible for preventing and responding to FGM/C and CEFM. This calls for innovative approaches in intervening in the various communities to ensure that women and girls at risk of FGM/C and CEFM or in need of services are reached during the pandemic. Evidence on how effective alternative approaches such as the use of call centres, radio talk shows and the use of local champions as part of risk communication in preventing and responding to FGM/C and CEFM amid COVID-19 is urgently required.","Esho, Tammary, Matanda, Dennis, Abuya, Timothy, Abebe, Sintayehu, Hailu, Yeshitila, Camara, Khaltoume, Mouhammed, Bachir, Kapsandui, Tonny, Kamanzi, Lilian, Wabwire, Andrew, Kagurusi, Patrick, Nankanja, Maureen, Gitimu, Anne, Kawai, David, Kogada, John, Ondigo, Millicent, Osur, Joachim","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-690662/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23737,""
"Emergence of the first manic episode in recovered COVID-19 patients: A case series from Egypt","Objective:  In December 2019, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection was first reported in Wuhan city, China, which had rapidly spread as a global pandemic. This infection was commonly presented by respiratory and /or gastrointestinal symptoms. However, it is still unclear whether COVID-19 infection could be associated with central nervous system (CNS) damage which would result in development of neuropsychiatric symptoms. Method A total of five cases of suddenly emerged manic episodes during the pandemic of COVID-19 were extensively described. We presented the symptoms and described the diagnosis, clinical course, and treatment of each case. Results All patients had positive findings of ribonucleic acid (RNA) tests for COVID-19 in specimens of their sputum. The patients later developed manic symptoms during and after the recovering period of their illness. Conclusions The case series of newly emerged manic symptoms associated with COVID-19 infection highlights the essential need for evaluation of mental health status and would contribute to our understanding of the potential risk of CNS affection by COVID-19 infection.

"Mechanisms associated with the trajectory of depressive and anxiety symptoms: A linear mixed-effects model during the COVID-19 Pandemic","With the fluctuations in anxious and depressive symptomatology accompanied by the pandemic crises, studies on the trajectories of these symptom domains are warranted to monitor the development of mental health problems in the population. This pre-registered longitudinal study examines stable factors and mechanistic processes covarying with the trajectory of anxiety and depressive symptoms using linear-mixed effects models in 4936 adults from the pandemicâ€™s onset to four months into the COVID-19 pandemic in Norway. Prevalence estimates of moderate to severe levels of clinically impairing symptoms of anxiety and depression revealed high but reduced occurrence four months into the pandemic where social distancing protocols were substantially lightened in severity, revealing associations between symptoms and viral mitigation protocols after stringent control of plausible confounders. In risk subgroups at the onset of the pandemic sustained their relative position compared to their counterparts four months into the pandemic, indicating prolonged suffering of these subgroups. Among mechanistic processes, key differences were identified regarding the trajectory of anxiety and depressive symptoms. Physical exercise was associated with long-term but not momentaneous alleviations in anxiety. In contrast, reductions in depressive symptoms were associated with both the simultaneous exertion as well as dose-increases in exercise over time. Increased knowledge about how to best cope with pandemic challenges was associated with greater improvement in depressive but not anxiety symptoms. Reductions in maladaptive coping strategies and negative metacognitive beliefs was substantially associated with greater improvement of both anxious and depressive symptomatology. Mechanistic processes divergently relate to the trajectory of depressive and anxious symptomatology, yielding domain-specific information of utility for preventive and interventive efforts aimed at impeding deleterious symptom levels.","Ebrahimi, Omid, Hoffart, Asle, Johnson, Sverre Urnes","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/nwkcx","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23739,""
"Suicide and Quarantine During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Do We Know Everything?","Background: There is widespread concern over the impact of COVID-19 and lockdown measures on suicidal behaviour. We assessed their effects on suicide and hospitalization for attempted suicide in Chile.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Methods: We used panel data at the county and month level from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2020 on suicides and related hospitalizations and a pandemic quarantine dataset. Poisson regression models and a difference-in-difference (DiD) methodology was used to estimate the impact of quarantine on both measures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Findings: Suicide and hospitalizations for attempted suicide decreased (18% and 5Â·8%, respectively) during the COVID-19 outbreak in Chile (March-December 2020) compared to the same period in 2016-2019. The DiD analysis showed that there was at least a 13Â·2% reduction in suicides in quarantined counties relative to counties without such restrictions. This reduction was in male suicides and unaffected by age. There was no significant difference between quarantined and non-quarantined counties in terms of hospitalization for suicide attempts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Interpretation: This study shows a significant quarantine effect on reducing suicide during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Rationale and design of the Health Professional Students at the University of Illinois Chicago (HOLISTIC) Cohort Study","ABSTRACT Objectives The objectives of the HOLISTIC Cohort Study are to establish a 3-year prospective cohort study that characterizes the health of students within and across health professionalsâ€™ education programs during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, implement an interprofessional student research team, and inform initiatives to improve student health. This report describes the rationale and design of the HOLISTIC Cohort Study, including recruitment strategy, survey development, data management, and descriptive statistics of the first wave of study participants. Methods An interprofessional student research team was formed to continuously inform study design. The first wave of recruitment was conducted from April 14, 2021 to May 5, 2021 across seven health science colleges (applied health, dentistry, medicine, nursing, pharmacy, public health, social work) at the University of Illinois Chicago in Chicago, IL. Eligible students were sent an invitation via email to complete an online survey after providing electronic informed consent. The online survey was based on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Preventionâ€™s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 2019 survey and the 2014 World Health Organization Report of the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts Working Group Questionnaire. Two additional recruitment waves are planned in the Spring 2022 and Spring 2023;follow-up of participants previously enrolled will occur during these second and third recruitment waves. Results Of 5,118 students invited to participate in the first wave, 553 (10.8%) completed the survey and includes participants from all seven health science colleges. The average age of participants is 27.3 years, 435 (78.8%) identify as female, and 137 (24.8%) identify as an underrepresented minority. Overall, 465 (84.6%) participants reported being currently employed for wages. Just over half (51%) reported no days with poor physical health within a month but only 11.2% reported no days with poor mental health within a month. Nearly one in ten (9.4%) reported having ever had a positive test for COVID-19. Conclusion The HOLISTIC Cohort Study of health professional students across seven health science colleges has completed the first of three waves of enrollment during the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the first wave of study participants, increased attention to supporting the mental and physical health of health professional students is needed.","Dommaraju, Sunil, Rivera, Stephanie Gordon, Rocha, Ethan, Bicknell, Scott, Loizzo, Daniel, Mohammad, Ayesha, Rajan, Priya, Seballos, Alexandria, Datta, Avisek, Ahmed, Rashid, Krishnan, Jerry, Keehn, Mary","https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.12.21266272","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23741,""
"Prevalence of long-term effects in individuals diagnosed with COVID-19: an updated living systematic review","Objective Post COVID-19 condition refers to persisting or recurring symptoms weeks after acute COVID-19 illness which can significantly impact quality of life and health systems. It is important to understand the manifestation and magnitude of this condition. The objective of this living systematic review is to summarize the prevalence of symptoms and sequelae reported by people =4 weeks after COVID-19 diagnosis. Design Systematic review, meta-analysis and narrative synthesis. Data sources Embase, Medline, PsychInfo, Cochrane Central and select grey literature up to April 14, 2021. Methods We adapted a previous search strategy used by the U.K. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and updated it to search for new literature. Two reviewers screened references independently;one extracted data and assessed risk of bias and certainty of the evidence while another verified them. Prevalence data from laboratory-confirmed populations were meta-analyzed using a random effects model and synthesized separately in the short-term (4-12 weeks) and long-term (&gt;12 weeks) periods after diagnosis. Data from clinically-diagnosed populations were synthesized narratively. Results Of the 4444 unique citations, 84 observational studies met our inclusion criteria. Over 100 post COVID-19 symptoms and sequelae were reported. Sixty-one percent (95% CI: 44-76%, low certainty ) and 53% (95% CI: 41-65%, low certainty ) of laboratory-confirmed individuals reported persistence or presence of one or more symptoms in the short- and long-term periods, respectively. The most prevalent symptoms in both periods included: fatigue, general pain or discomfort, shortness of breath, cognitive impairment and mental health symptoms. Conclusions A substantial proportion of individuals reported a variety of symptoms =4 weeks after COVID-19 diagnosis. Due to gaps in the research base, and the low certainty of the evidence currently available, further research is needed to determine the true burden of post COVID-19 condition in the general population and in specific subgroups.

"Remote recruitment for Essential Coaching for Every Mother during COVID-19","Background With a decrease in in-person support and increase in perinatal mental health concerns during the coronavirus pandemic, innovative strategies, such as mHealth, are more important than ever. However, due to physical distancing recommendations, recruitments for perinatal research needs to shift. The objective of this study is to desire the process evaluation of recruitment and retention of women for an mHealth pre-post intervention study for Essential Coaching for Every Mother . Methods Three methods were used for recruitment: social media, posters in hospital, and media outreach. First time mothers were eligible for enrollment antenatally (37+ weeks) and postnatally (&lt;3 weeks). Eligibility screening occurred remotely via text message. Outcomes were days to recruit 75 participants, eligibility vs. ineligibility rates, dropout and exclusion reasons, survey completion rates, perinatal timing of enrollment, and recruitment sources. Results Recruitment ran July 15 th -September 19 th (67 days) with 200 screened and 88 enrolled, 70% antenatally. It took 50 days to enroll 75 participants. Mothers recruited antenatally (n=53) were more likely to receive all intervention message (68% vs. 19%). Mothers recruited postnatally (n=35) missed more messages on average (13.8 vs. 6.4). Participants heard about the study through family/friends (31%), news (20%), Facebook groups (16%), Facebook ads (14%), posters (12%), or other ways (7%). Conclusion Antenatal recruitment resulted in participants enrolling earlier and receiving more of the study messages. Word of mouth and media outreach were successful, followed by advertisement on Facebook.

"The social media response to twice-weekly mass asymptomatic testing in England","Background From 9 th April 2021, everyone in England has been encouraged to take two COVID-19 tests per week. This is the first time that national mass asymptomatic testing has been introduced in the UK and the effectiveness of the policy depends on uptake with testing and willingness to self-isolate following a positive test result. This paper examines attitudes towards twice-weekly testing, as well as barriers and facilitators to engaging in testing. Methods Between 5 th April and 28 th May 2021 we searched Twitter, Facebook, and online news articles with publicly available comment sections to identify comments relating to twice-weekly testing. We identified 5783 comments which were then analysed using a framework analysis. Results We identified nine main themes. Five themes related to barriers to engaging in testing: low perceived risk from COVID-19;mistrust in the government;concern about taking a test;perceived ineffectiveness of twice-weekly testing policy;and perceived negative impact of twice-weekly testing policy. Four themes related to facilitators to engaging in testing: wanting to protect others;positive perceptions of tests;a desire to return to normal;and perceived efficacy for reducing asymptomatic transmission. Conclusions Overall, the comments identified indicated predominately negative attitudes towards the twice weekly testing policy. Several recommendations can be made to improve engagement with twice weekly testing, including: 1) communicate openly and honestly about the purpose of testing;2) provide information about the accuracy of tests;3) provide financial support for those required to self-isolate, and;4) emphasise accessibility of testing.","Dennis, Amelia, Robin, Charlotte, Carter, Holly","https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.19.21262284","","Database: other preprints; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23744,""
"Personality traits in post-COVID syndrome","Background:  We aimed to evaluate personality traits in patients with postCOVID syndrome, as well as the association with neuropsychiatric symptoms present in this disorder. Methods: . The Big Five Structure Inventory was administered to 93 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of post-COVID syndrome and to matched controls. We also performed a comprehensive evaluation of depression, anxiety, fatigue, sleep quality, cognitive function, and olfactory function. Results: . Patients with post-COVID syndrome scored lower for emotional stability, equanimity, positive mood, and self-control. Extraversion, emotional stability, and openness correlated negatively with anxiety and depression levels. Conscientiousness correlated negatively with anxiety. No statistically significant correlations were observed between personality traits and cognitive function, sleep quality, olfactory function, or fatigue. Personality scores explained 36.3% and 41% of the variance in scores on the anxiety and depression scales, respectively. Two personality profiles with lower levels of emotional stability were associated with depression and anxiety. Conclusions: . Our study shows higher levels of neuroticism in patients with post-COVID syndrome. Personality traits were predictive of the presence of depression and anxiety, but not cognitive function, sleep quality, or fatigue, in the context of post-COVID syndrome. These findings may have implications for the detection of patients at risk of depression and anxiety in post-COVID syndrome, and for the development of preventive and therapeutic interventions.","Delgado-Alonso, Cristina, Valles-Salgado, MarÃ­a, Delgado-Ãlvarez, Alfonso, GÃ³mez-Ruiz, Natividad, Yus, Miguel, Polidura, Carmen, PÃ©rez-Izquierdo, Carlos, Marcos, Alberto, Gil, MarÃ­a JosÃ©, MatÃ­as-Guiu, Jorge, Matias-Guiu, Jordi","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1099432/v2","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23745,""
"Burnout among frontline health professionals in two African countries: a cross sectional study from Egypt and Sudan","Background:  The impact of coronavirus pandemic (COVID19) on healthcare professionals (HCPs) is an issue of global concern. Occupational burnout among HCPs has been reported by several studies. However, pandemic-related burnout needs further investigation especially among frontline HCPs. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and associated factors of burnout syndrome among HCPs working at COVID-19 isolation facilities in Egypt and Sudan. Methods:  A cross-sectional survey was conducted among frontline HCPs in Egypt and Sudan from May 2021 to July 2021. An online, anonymous, self-administered questionnaire was used for data collection. Occupational burnout was estimated using the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory. Data analyzed using SPSS software. Results:  A total of 362 HCPs participated in the study and were equally recruited from Egypt (181) and Sudan (181) with mean age of (31.84 Â± 8.32) years. More than half were females (60%) and were physicians (58.3%). Most healthcare professionals included in the study had high levels of work disengagement (75.4%) and emotional exhaustion (98.6%). Burnout syndrome was present in 75% of the HCPs with 77% prevalence among Egyptian HCPs and 71% prevalence among Sudanese HCPs. The parameters that are associated with burnout syndrome among Egyptian HCPs were working hours per week;while for Sudanese HCPs, these were age and number of days off. Conclusion:  The study revealed a high prevalence of burnout syndrome among HCPs working at COVID-19 isolation facilities in Egypt and Sudan. Appropriate actions should be taken to preserve mental health status of HCPs through establishment of effective and efficient coping strategies.","Dabbah, Noha Ahmed El, Elhadi, Yasir Ahmed Mohammed","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-951355/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23746,""
"Self-reported mental health status of pregnant women in Sweden during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional survey","Background:  The COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to unprecedented worries and challenges for pregnant women due to social restrictions and changes in maternity care provision. We aimed to investigate the mental health impact of COVID-19 pandemic on pregnant women in Sweden and explore factors associated with poor perinatal mental health in this specific context. Method:  This was a nation-wide cross-sectional survey of pregnant women living in Sweden. Validated questionnaires were distributed through non-profit organizationsÂ´ websites and social media channels from May 2020 to February 2021. Perinatal depression, anxiety, and acute stress reaction were assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7(GAD-7) and Impact Event Scale (Revised)(IES-R), respectively. Sociodemographic characteristics and self-perceived mental well-being were also obtained. Factors associated with mental health outcomes were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression model. Results: : Among a total of 522 participants, 42.5% (n=222) reported depression (EPDS =13), 25.3% (n=132) moderate to severe anxiety (GAD-7 score=10), and 23.4% (n=122) moderate to severe acute stress reaction (IES-R =33). 27.4% participants (n=143, 27.4%) expressed concerns regarding their mental well-being during the pandemic. Pregnant mothers who had sick family members reported more severe poor mental health outcomes than those who did not (median [Interquartile range (IQR)] EPDS scores: 14.0 [8.75 â€“ 18.0] vs 10.0 [6.0 â€“ 14.0], p&lt;.001;median [IQR] GAD7 scores: 7.0 [4.0 â€“ 12.25] vs 5.0 [3.0 â€“ 9.0], p&lt;.001;median (IQR) IES-R scores: 20.0 [9.0 â€“ 38.0] vs 15.0 [7.0 â€“ 28.0], p=.008). Logistic regression analyses revealed that risk factors for poor mental health outcomes were having a sick family member with any illness, unemployment, giving birth, and experiencing an exceptional stressful life event. Having a higher educational level, younger age, and changing career during the pandemic were protective. Conclusion:  Depression and anxiety were highly prevalent among pregnant women in Sweden during the COVID-19 pandemic, indicating a need for professional mental health support for this vulnerable group of population. Unemployment was an associated risk factor whereas younger age and higher educational level were protective suggesting an important role of socio-economic factors in modulating the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on perinatal mental health.","Chung, Ho-Fung, Andersson, Ewa, Huang, Hsuan-Ying, Acharya, Ganesh, Schwank, Simone","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-872040/v1","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23747,""
"Pangamba at antala sa harap ng pandemya: Mga karanasan ng paglalakbay at pananatili ng mga Pilipino sa Japan (Worries, delays, and the pandemic: Filipino experiences of staying in and traveling to Japan)","Filipino Abstract: Nang magsimula ang pandaidigang pandemya ng COVID-19 sa Japan, marami ang pumuri sa polisiya ng pamahalaan dahil hindi masyadong naapektuhan ang karaniwang pamumuhay at hindi rin mataas ang bilang ng mga tinamaan ng sakit sa bansa kahit na walang malawakang lockdown. Gayumpaman, marami rin ang bumatikos sa pamahalaan dahil sa magulong polisiya kaugnay ng paglabas at pagtanggap ng mga banyaga, mga nagsasalungatang patakaran tungkol sa pandemya, kaangkupan ng suporta para sa mga residente, at mabagal na pagsisimula ng programa ng pagbabakuna.

Sa pamamagitan ng pakikipanayam sa mga mag-aaral at manggagawa sa Japan, natuklasang bagamat malaki ang hamong dala ng pandemya sa mga Pilipino sa Japan laluna sa kanilang mental health, nananatili ang katatagan nila, at kahit na marami sa mga personal na hangarin ang kinailangang isantabi, hindi nawawala ang pag-asang magkakaroon pa rin ng pagkakataong tuparin ito sa hinaharap.English Abstract: At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan, many praised the government's response. Daily life was not drastically affected, and infections were kept at bay without a national lockdown policy. However, there were also criticisms on how the country handled its border policies, health programs, the slow vaccination roll-out, and the adequacy of the support it provided its residents. How did Filipinos in Japan experience these issues during the pandemic, especially since they are far from their families in the Philippines? This study represents the narratives of anxiety, traveling, staying, and delays by Filipinos in Japan during the pandemic. Through interviews with Filipino students and workers in Japan, this study finds that while the pandemic challenged their mental health, their resilience remained. Despite having to set aside many of their personal goals, their hopes of achieving them remain in the future.","Candelaria, John Lee","https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3953611","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23748,""
"Medication-assisted Treatment for Opioid Use Disorder in Rhode Island: Who Gets Treatment, and Does Treatment Improve Health Outcomes?","Since the early 2000s Rhode Island has been among the states hardest hit by the opioid crisis. In response, the state has made it a priority to expand access to medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorder (OUD), which refers to the use of the FDA-approved medications methadone, buprenorphine, and/or naltrexone in conjunction with behavioral therapy. MAT is strongly supported by scientific evidence and endorsed by US public health officials and yet fails to reach many OUD patients. Using administrative data covering medical treatments and selected health outcomes for more than three-quarters of the Rhode Islanders covered by health insurance from mid-2011 through mid-2019, this report considers MATâ€™s efficacy in preventing opioid overdoses in Rhode Island and sheds light on the barriers to receiving MAT. The authors find evidence that MAT, as practiced in Rhode Island, appears to reduce the risk of opioid overdose: Among patients who had an initial (nonfatal) overdose, those who had received MAT in the preceding three months were less likely to experience a second overdose. In addition, federal policies that allowed a broader set of health-care providers to prescribe buprenorphine for OUD and enabled each prescriber to treat more patients with that drug are shown to have had some success in expanding the set of patients receiving MAT in Rhode Island.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, we observe significant disparities in access to MAT across different groups within Rhode Island. Among individuals diagnosed with opioid dependence, those living in places with elevated poverty rates are less likely to receive buprenorphine, but they are also somewhat more likely to receive methadone. Because a treatment regimen involving methadone is much less convenient for the patient compared with one involving buprenorphine, ideally patients should have similar access to both drugs. Having Medicaid insurance as opposed to some other form of insurance is associated with a much greater chance of receiving methadone treatment, a finding that supports policies that would incentivize the expansion of Medicaid in states that have not yet done so. Women are somewhat less likely than men to receive either methadone or buprenorphine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This research demonstrates that recent federal policies helped to increase the number of Rhode Islanders who were prescribed buprenorphine for OUD. Raising patient-number limits enabled select prescribers to serve more patients and expand the total patient pool;however, more people could be helped if more prescribers took full advantage of their prescribing limits. This research and similar findings from other states reveal that the typical buprenorphine prescriber has a caseload that is well below the maximum number of patients they could treat. A separate policy that enabled mid-level practitioners (such as physician assistants) to train to prescribe buprenorphine was also found to draw in new patients, particularly those in high-poverty Zip codes. The research also underscores the urgency of helping more OUD patients receive methadone and/or buprenorphine treatment quickly following an overdose (in hospitals, for example) and to maintain that treatment over time for a sufficient duration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some additional policies that could promote greater access to MAT include allowing pharmacists to prescribe buprenorphine, relaxing restrictions on the use of telehealth for obtaining buprenorphine prescriptions, and revisiting the rules about allowing take-home doses of methadone. Additional research is required on these interventions before specific recommendations can be made, but consideration of further policy adjustments is critically important given the ongoing scourge of opioid abuse and the proven ability of MAT to help those suffering from opioid use disorder. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic there has in fact been a temporary loosening of policies related to MAT in order to minimize patientsâ€™ exposure to the virus while helping them to get on or stay on medications, thus offering an opp rtunity to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the revised measures.","Burke, Mary, Sullivan, Riley","https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3832299","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23749,""
"Weather, Psychological Wellbeing and Mobility During the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic","To reduce infection rates during the first UK wave of the COVID-19 outbreak, a first lockdown was announced on March 23, 2020, with a final easing of the restrictions on July 4, 2020. Among the most important public health costs of lockdown restrictions are the potential adverse effects on mental health and physical activity. Using data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS) and Google COVID-19 Mobility Reports we find evidence of reduced park mobility during the initial period of the first UK lockdown and confirm existing evidence of worsening psychological wellbeing. Linkage with weather data shows that contrary to popular belief, weather conditions do not exacerbate the mental health consequences of the pandemic, while we find systematic links between park mobility and weather over the same period. Our results highlight the importance of promoting the existing guidelines on regular exercise during winter lockdowns.","Burdett, Ashley, Davillas, Apostolos, Etheridge, Ben","https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3789386","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23750,""
"Getting Trapped in a Dead End? Trait Self-Control and Boredom Are Linked to Goal Adjustment","Disengaging from unattainable goals and reengaging in alternative goals is essential for effective goal pursuit;yet, surprisingly little is known about associated personality factors. Here, we focused on individual differences in self-control (domain-general self-control, if-then planning) and boredom (boredom proneness, boredom avoidance and escape tendencies). Concerning goal adjustment in everyday life (Study 1;N = 323 crowdworkers), if-then planning was associated with worse disengagement and better reengagement. While boredom proneness was associated with poorer reengagement, boredom avoidance and escape tendencies were associated with better reengagement. When goal striving was thwarted during the COVID-19 pandemic (Study 2;N = 97 students), similar associations emerged along with links to anxiety and depression. However, disengagement was no longer associated with if-then planning but instead with better self-control and higher boredom proneness. These results show differential relationships of goal disengagement and reengagement with self-control and boredom, paving the way to a better understanding of who struggles or shines when effective goal adjustment is required.","Bieleke, Maik, Keller, Lucas, Wolff, Wanja","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/db7u3","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23751,""

Results of the Gaussian graphical model (GGM) suggested that: (1) central symptoms identified via the centrality index of strength included depressive symptoms of â€œanhedoniaâ€ and anxiety symptoms of â€œrestlessnessâ€ and â€œtenseâ€;(2) bridge symptoms identified via the bridge expected influence index included depressive symptom of â€œpsychomotor agitation/retardationâ€ and anxiety symptoms of â€œafraidâ€ and â€œrestlessnessâ€. Results of the Bayesian directed acyclic graph (DAG) demonstrated the predictive priority of depressive symptoms of â€œanhedoniaâ€ and â€œsadnessâ€ in driving comorbidity. The network analyses highlight the node of â€œanhedoniaâ€ (a central node in GGM and the top node in DAG) and several other mostly physical symptoms including â€œrestlessnessâ€, â€œtenseâ€, â€œpsychomotor agitation/retardationâ€, and â€œafraidâ€ as candidates for interventions and show great value in generating clinical insights beyond western sample. Implications and limitations are discussed.","Bi, Kaiwen, Jiang, Qiwenjing, Chen, Shuquan","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/y9svn","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23752,""
"Economic analyses of interventions for student mental health: protocol for a systematic review","Background Students in higher education exhibit higher rates of mental health problems than the general population and often lack access to effective treatments and services. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated already high levels of need. Policymakers must have the relevant evidence to inform resource allocation and investment decisions about student mental health services. Aim We aim to identify and summarise economic analyses of interventions to prevent and treat mental health problems in university students in terms of the studiesâ€™ findings and the methods used. Method We will review all published economic analyses relating to interventions designed to prevent or treat student mental health problems. We will search the following databases: PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, EconLit, PsycINFO and the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Databases (NHS EED). The review will be conducted following PRISMA guidelines. Key data items relating to the methods and results of the included studies will be extracted, and the resulting database will be made publicly available.

"Predictors of quality of life among Brazilian medical students during second coronavirus wave","Objective To assess the impact of COVID-19 second wave on quality of life (QoL) of Brazilian medical students. Methods The data from 210 medical students were collected through a web-based survey between February and March 2021. We assessed information about sociodemographic characteristics, health conditions, electronics tools-related to physical activity (PA-eTool), and health-associated QoL. Multiple linear regression was performed to identify the potential QoL predictors. Results The psychological domain was the most affected, showing lower score during COVID-19 second wave. Being male was a positive predictor in the physical health domain. Spending too much time indoors and sexual minority-group membership were associated with lower perception on psychological well-being. Personal benefit from having PA-eTool accessed and higher income were positively associated with psychological and environmental domains, respectively, and in the overall QoL. Conclusions Psychological well-being impairment is a long-term negative impact among Brazilian medical students during COVID-19. By evidencing that studentsâ€™ QoL has been worsened in this global crisis, supportive interventions provided by community and universities are required to aid those vulnerable students facing mental health or QoL impairment.","Barreto, Filipe Silva, Andrade Feitosa, Ankilma do Nascimento, de Carvalho BaldaÃ§ara, Raquel Prudente, BaldaÃ§ara, Leonardo, de Assis, Elisangela Vilar, Ferreira Silva, JosÃ© Bruno Nunes","https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.27.21265581","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23754,""
"The economic impacts of COVID-19 on household mental health: Panel evidence from Pakistan","We combine data collected just prior to the unfolding of COVID-19 with follow-up data from July 2020 to document the adverse economic effects of the pandemic and resulting impact on parental and child mental well-being in rural and semi-urban Pakistan. 22% of the households in our sample are affected by job loss, with monthly income down 34% on average. Our difference-in-difference results show that job loss is associated with a 0.73 standard deviation (SD) reduction in adult mental health score (K10), a 0.55 SD reduction in a â€˜Hopeâ€™ index of childrenâ€™s aspirations, agency and future pathways, and a 0.33 SD increase in childrenâ€™s depression symptoms. In addition, we observe higher levels of parental stress and anger reported by children, as well as an increase in reported prevalence of domestic violence. Overall, we document that the pandemic has disproportionately and negatively affected the economic and mental well-being of the most vulnerable households in our sample.","Baranov, Victoria, Grosjean, Pauline, Khan, Fatima Jamal, Walker, Sarah","https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3939587","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23755,""
"Clinical Effectiveness of Music Interventions for Dementia and Depression in ELderly Care (MIDDEL) in Australia: Pragmatic Cluster-Randomised Controlled Trial","Background: Dementia and depression are highly prevalent and comorbid conditions among older adults living in care homes, and are associated with individual distress and rising societal costs. Effective, scalable, and feasible interventions are needed. Different music interventions have shown promising effects, but the current evidence-base is inconclusive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Methods: We implemented a 2x2 factorial cluster-randomised controlled trial to determine whether 1) group music therapy (GMT) is more effective than standard care (SC) or 2) recreational choir singing (RCS) is more effective than SC, for reducing depressive symptoms and other secondary outcomes in people with dementia with mild to severe depressive symptoms living in residential aged care. Care home units with at least 10 residents were allocated to GMT, RCS, both GMT and RCS, or SC, using a computer-generated list with block randomisation (block size four). The protocolised interventions were delivered by music therapists (GMT) and community musicians (RCS). The primary outcome was Montgomery-Ã…sberg Depression Rating Scale score at 6 months, assessed by a masked assessor and analysed on an intention-to-treat basis using linear mixed-effects models, which examined the effects of GMT vs no-GMT and RCS vs no-RCS, as well as interaction effects of GMT and RCS. Trial registration: NCT03496675;ACTRN12618000156280.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Findings: Between July 18, 2018, and November 26, 2019, 20 care home units were randomised (318 residents). Recruitment ceased in March 2020 due to COVID-19. The primary endpoint, available from 20 care home units (214 residents), suggested beneficial effects of RCS (mean difference: -4Â·25;95% CI -7Â·89 to -0Â·62) but not GMT (mean difference -0Â·44;95% CI -4Â·32 to 3Â·43).

"Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Ordinary People;A Social Distancing Challenge","COVID-19 has become a part of everyone's day-to-day life, since the outbreak in 2019 the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused more than 4.5 million deaths with over 200 million cases reported globally. Currently, the number of infections and deaths are gradually lowering in different countries however the underlying challenges still exist. COVID-19 threatens human life, social functioning and development. Although numerous studies have been carried out in the past to highlight the key challenges very limited studies have been conducted from an ordinary person's viewpoint. In the fight against COVID-19, humanity has been pushed to a level which cannot be accepted where establishing that balance is a priority.

"A Longitudinal Study of the Mental Health of Children and Adolescents with Autism and their Parents during COVID-19: Part 2, Qualitative Findings","In Part 1 of this United Kingdom based study (Toseeb &amp;Asbury, 2021), across four timepoints between March and October 2020, children and young people with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) showed higher levels of parent-reported depression and anxiety symptoms than those with other Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SENDs). Here, we used qualitative data from 517 parents/carers of young people with ASD and other SENDs to conduct a longitudinal qualitative content analysis examining stability and change in the mental health of these young people, and their parents/carers, during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Worry and psychological distress were dominant categories at all timepoints and we noted that, in line with quantitative findings, worry in CYP with ASD stayed stable over time but decreased for those with other SENDs. The third dominant category was wellbeing and we saw evidence that removing demands, especially the demand to attend school, was a driver of wellbeing for a significant minority of pupils, particularly those with ASD, and their parents/carers. Overall, we observed no differences in mental health experiences between the two groups of parents, also mirroring quantitative findings.","Asbury, Kathryn, Toseeb, Umar","https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/p2c5v","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23758,""
"COVID-19 Stressor: Implications for Changes in Menstruation Physiology and Mental Health","Background: Stress is a physiological reaction to awful stimuli that is regulated by neuroendocrine pathways. COVID-19 is one of the most stressful events nowadays. Female reproductive function is maintained by menstrual cycle which is negatively affected by hyperstimulation of stress response. This study evaluates the impact of COVID-19 on menstruation and mental health, and the influence of COVID-19-associated mental disorders on menstruation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Methods: Online questionnaire was conducted among Jordanian female medical students during COVID-19. The survey compared menstrual characteristics, depression, anxiety, and stress during COVID-19 with 10-months before. Data were analysed using SPSS software.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Results: Significant change in menstrual cycle length and bleeding amount during COVID-19 compared with before was observed. Menstrual signs like nausea, vomiting, breast pain, and urinary urgency during menstruation were significantly increased during COVID-19 (P=0.000, P=0.008, and P=0.024, respectively). Total depression, anxiety, and stress scale 21 (DASS-21) score mean was significantly increased after COVID-19 compared with before (22.68 vs 31.10, P=0.000), and total means of depression, anxiety and stress subscale scores were significantly increased during COVID-19 (P=0.000). During COVID-19, significant positive correlation between total DASS-21 and heavy bleeding was detected. Mental disorders, and amenorrhea, urgency, nausea, and vomiting were positively correlated after COVID-19.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Conclusion: This study introduces a general insight into the effect of COVID-19 on menstruation and mental health, and the relationship between them, which could serve as a baseline for planning and introducing stress mitigation interventions in similar crisis situations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Funding: This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Declaration of Interests: The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest with regards to this study.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ethics Approval Statement: The Hashemite University Institutional Review Board Committee has reviewed and authorized this study.

"Usual Source of Primary Care and Preventive Care Measures in a Pandemic: A Nationwide Study in Japan","Objectives In a pandemic when there are many barriers to providing preventive care by health care workers, it is unclear whether primary care contributes to the quality of preventive care and what type of preventive care delivery is a challenge for primary care providers. This study aimed to assess multiple preventive care measures and to examine their associations with having a usual source of primary care and primary care performance during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. Design Nationwide cross-sectional study. Setting Japanese general adult population. Participants 1,757 adult residents. Primary outcome measures Fourteen preventive care measures aggregated the overall, screening, immunization, and counseling composites. Results Depression screening, zoster vaccination, and tetanus vaccination had low implementation rates even among participants with a usual source of primary care. After adjustment for possible confounders, having a usual source of primary care was positively associated with all preventive care composites. Primary care performance assessed by the Japanese version of Primary Care Assessment Tool Short Form was also dose-dependently associated with an increase in all composites. Results of the sensitivity analyses using a different calculation of preventive care composite were similar to those of the primary analyses. Conclusions Receipt of primary care, particularly high-quality primary care, contributed to increased preventive care utilization even during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the rate of mental health screening in primary care was at a very low level. Therefore, addressing mental health issues should be a major challenge for primary care providers during and after the pandemic.","Aoki, Takuya, Fujinuma, Yasuki, Matsushima, Masato","https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.26.21263606","","Database: other preprints; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23760,""
"Characterising post-COVID syndrome more than 6 months after acute infection in adults;prospective longitudinal cohort study, England","Background Most individuals with COVID-19 will recover without sequelae, but some will develop long- term multi-system impairments. The definition, duration, prevalence and symptoms associated with long COVID, however, have not been established. Methods Public Health England (PHE) initiated longitudinal surveillance of clinical and non-clinical healthcare workers for monthly blood sampling for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in March 2020. Eight months after enrolment, participants completed an online questionnaire including 72 symptoms in the preceding month. Symptomatic mild-to-moderate cases with confirmed COVID-19 were compared with asymptomatic, seronegative controls. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify independent symptoms associated with long COVID. Results All 2,147 participants were contacted and 1,671 (77.8%) completed the questionnaire, including 140 (8.4%) cases and 1,160 controls. At a median of 7.5 (IQR 7.1-7.8) months after infection, 20 cases (14.3%) had ongoing (4/140, 2.9%) or episodic (16/140, 11.4%) symptoms. We identified three clusters of symptoms associated with long COVID, those affecting the sensory (ageusia, anosmia, loss of appetite and blurred vision), neurological (forgetfulness, short-term memory loss and confusion/brain fog) and cardiorespiratory (chest tightness/pain, unusual fatigue, breathlessness after minimal exertion/at rest, palpitations) systems. The sensory cluster had the highest association with being a case (aOR 5.25, 95% CI 3.45-8.01). Dermatological, gynaecological, gastrointestinal or mental health symptoms were not significantly different between cases and controls. Conclusions Most persistent symptoms reported following mild COVID-19 were equally common in cases and controls. While all three clusters identified had a strong association with previous COVID-19 infection, the sensory cluster had the highest specificity and strength of association. Key points Compared to controls, we identified three clusters of symptoms affecting the sensory, neurological and cardiorespiratory systems that were more prevalent among cases. Notably, gastrointestinal and dermatological symptoms and symptoms related to mental health were as prevalent among cases as controls.","Amin-Chowdhury, Zahin, Harris, Ross, Aiano, Felicity, Zavala, Maria, Bertran, Marta, Borrow, Ray, Linley, Ezra, Ahmad, Shazaad, Parker, Ben, Horsley, Alex, Hallis, Bassam, Flood, Jessica, Brown, Kevin, Amirthalingam, Gayatri, Ramsay, Mary, Andrews, Nick, Ladhani, Shamez","https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.18.21253633","","Database: other preprints; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23761,""

"Working Parents, Financial Insecurity, and Child-Care: Mental Health in the Time of Covid-19","The COVID-19 pandemic and the policy measures to control its spread â€“ lockdowns, physical distancing, and social isolation â€“ has coincided with the deterioration of people's mental well-being. We use data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS) to document how this phenomenon is related to the situation of working parents who now have to manage competing time demands across the two life domains of work and home. We show that the worsening of mental health in the United Kingdom is worse for working parents, and that it is especially related to the increased financial insecurity and the time spent on childcare and home schooling. We find that this burden is not shared equally between men and women, and between richer and poorer households. In crafting public policy responses to the pandemic, better outcomes can be achieved if policymakers are cognizant of these inequalities.","Tani, Massimiliano, Cheng, Zhiming, Mendolia, Silvia, Paloyo, Alfredo, Savage, David","https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3674309","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23763,""
"COVID-19 and Mental Health Deterioration Among Bame Groups in the UK","We use the UK Household Longitudinal Study and compare pre- (2017-2019) and post-COVID-19 data (April 2020) for the same group of individuals to assess and quantify changes in mental health among ethnic groups in the UK. We confirm the previously documented average deterioration in mental health for the whole sample of individuals interviewed pre- and post-COVID-19, and uncover four new facts. First, ethnicity predicts mental health deterioration when interacted with gender. Among men, BAME individuals experience a higher deterioration in mental health compared to British White individuals. However, among women, the deterioration in mental health is similar for both BAME and British White individuals. Second, the gender gap in mental health deterioration is only present among British White individuals and not among BAME individuals. Third, the drop in mental health among women and BAME men is very similar. Finally, there is substantial heterogeneity across BAME groups. The BAME group of Bangladeshi, Indian and Pakistani appears to be driving the difference in the gender gap in mental health deterioration between British White and BAME individuals. We call for additional research on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic across different ethnic groups, and urge both policy makers and researchers to allocate resources to collect larger sample sizes of minority ethnic groups.","Proto, Eugenio, Quintana-Domeque, Climent","https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3662057","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23764,""
"Mental Health Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Longitudinal Probability Sample Survey of the UK Population","Background: There is growing global concern about the potential impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on population mental health. We examine changes in adult mental health in the UK population before and during the lockdown. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Methods: Secondary analysis of the UK Household Longitudinal Study Waves 6 (2014/15) to 9 (2018/19), matched to the Covid-19 web-survey completed by 17,452 panel members 23-29 April 2020. Mental health was assessed using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). Repeated cross-sectional analyses were conducted to examine annual temporal trends. Fixed effects regression models were fitted to identify within-person change compared to preceding trends. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Findings: Mean population GHQ-12 score increased from 11Â·5 (95% confidence interval: 11Â·3â€“11Â·6) in 2018/19 to 12Â·6 (12Â·5â€“12Â·8) in April 2020, one month into lockdown. This was 0Â·48 (0Â·07-0Â·90) points higher than expected when accounting for prior upward trends between 2013 and 2019. Comparing scores within-individuals, adjusting for time-trends and predictors, increases were greatest in 18-24-year-olds (2Â·7, 1Â·89-3Â·48), 25-34-year-olds (1Â·6, 0Â·96-2Â·18), women (0Â·9, 0Â·50-1Â·35), and people living with young children (1Â·45, 0Â·79-2Â·12). People employed before the pandemic averaged a notable increase (0Â·6;0Â·20-1Â·06). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Interpretation: In late April 2020, mental health in the UK deteriorated compared to trends pre-Covid, particularly in young people, women and those living with young children. Those in employment before the pandemic also experienced greater deterioration one month into lockdown, perhaps due to actual or anticipated redundancy. While deterioration occurred across income groups, we anticipate inequalities may widen over time, as in other causes of recessions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Funding Statement: This study was unfunded.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Declaration of Interests: The authors declare no competing interests. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ethics Approval Statement: The data used are publicly available via UK Data Service repository (study numbers 6614 and 8644), and do not require ethical assessment for academic research purposes.","Pierce, Matthias, Hope, Holly, Ford, Tamsin, Hatch, Stephani, Hotopf, Matthew, Kontopantelis, Evangelos, John, Ann, Webb, Roger, Wessely, Simon, McManus, Sally, Abel, Kathryn","https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3624264","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23765,""
"Gender Inequality in Covid-19 Times: Evidence from UK Prolific Participants","We investigate gender differences across socioeconomic and wellbeing dimensions after three months of lockdown in the UK, using an online sample of approximately 1,500 respondents in Prolific, representative of the UK population with regards to age, sex and ethnicity. We find that women's mental health is worse than men's along the four metrics we collected data on, that women are more concerned about getting and spreading the virus, and that women perceive the virus as more prevalent and lethal than men do. Women are also more likely to expect a new lockdown or virus outbreak by the end of 2020, and are more pessimistic about the current and future state of the UK economy, as measured by their forecasted present and future unemployment rates. Consistent with their more pessimistic views about the economy, women choose to donate more to food banks. Women are more likely to have lost their job because of the pandemic, and working women are more likely to hold more coronavirus-risky jobs than men. We also find that between February and June 2020 women have decreased their work hours, but increased housework and childcare much more than men. These gender inequalities are not driven by differences in age, ethnicity, education, family structure, income in 2019, current employment status, place of residence or living in rural/urban areas.","Oreffice, Sonia, Quintana-Domeque, Climent","https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3648803","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23766,""
"Macroeconomic Policy Lessons for Greece from the Debt Crisis","This paper studies the Greek economy in the aftermath of the 2007-8 global crisis looking for barriers to, and engines of, growth. We use a micro-founded macroeconomic model calibrated to Greece. We first study the years of the debt crisis between 2008 and 2016 and then the recent covid-19 pandemic. Departing from 2008, our simulations show that the adopted economic adjustment program (the fiscal austerity mix combined with the fiscal and monetary assistance provided by the EU, ECB and IMF), jointly with the observed deterioration in institutional quality (the degree of protection of property rights) can explain most (around 23% of GDP) of the cumulative loss in GDP in the data (around 26% of GDP) between 2008 and 2016. In particular, the economic adjustment program can explain a fall of around 13%, while the deterioration in property rights accounts for another 10%. Counterfactual simulations, on the other hand, show that this loss could have been around 10% only, if the country had followed a different fiscal policy mix;if the degree of product marker liberalization was closer to that in the core euro zone countries;and, above all, if institutional quality in Greece had simply remained at its pre-crisis level. On the other hand, we show that, in the absence of the official fiscal bailouts, the depression would be much deeper, while the accommodative role played by the quantitative policies of the ECB has been vital to the Greek economy. Finally, departing from 2019, we quantify the impact of the covid-19 pandemic under various policy scenaria. A loss of around 8:5% of GDP and a sharp jump of public debt seem to be unavoidable during 2020 but, like in the case of the debt crisis, the duration of the new crisis depends crucially on the policy mix chosen.","Economides, George, Papageorgiou, Dimitris, Philippopoulos, Apostolis","https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3570290","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23767,""
"Managing Momentum in Climate Negotiations","The Conference of the Parties (COP) has proven a valuable outlet to advance the climate agenda. The combination of high media coverage, extremely high expectations set by influential environmentalists, and unanimity rules has, however, started to limit its effectiveness. Technical issues can legitimately require years to be addressed. Delays on such issues should not lead society to ignore progress in other areas. If anything, defining expectations based on technical issues creates more incentives for unwilling countries to delay action and spread pessimism. The coronavirus is bad news for climate action, but also provides opportunities. The absence of a session of the COP in 2020 gives negotiators additional time to address technical issues behind the scenes, including through club approaches. Virtual forums can be used to increase interactions, also involving top diplomats. The extra time also allows global leaders and influential environmentalists to improve their communication strategies, increasing ambition while effectively managing momentum.","Carattini, Stefano, LÃ¶schel, Andreas","https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3740329","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23768,""
"Covid-19, Lockdowns and Well-Being: Evidence from Google Trends","The COVID-19 pandemic has led many governments to implement lockdowns. While lockdowns may help to contain the spread of the virus, they may result in substantial damage to population well-being. We use Google Trends data to test whether the lockdowns implemented in Europe and America led to changes in well-being related topic search terms. Using differences-in-differences and a regression discontinuity design to evaluate the causal effects of lockdown, we find a substantial increase in the search intensity for boredom in Europe and the US. We also found a significant increase in searches for loneliness, worry and sadness, while searches for stress, suicide and divorce on the contrary fell. Our results suggest that people's mental health may have been severely affected by the lockdown.","Brodeur, Abel, Clark, Andrew, Fleche, Sarah, Powdthavee, Nattavudh","https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3596670","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23769,""
"The Short-Term Economic Consequences of Covid-19: Occupation Tasks and Mental Health in Canada","In this paper, we document the short-term impact of COVID-19 on labour market outcomes in Canada. Following a pre-analysis plan, we investigate the negative impact of the pandemic on unemployment, labour force participation, hours and wages in Canada. We find that COVID-19 had drastic negative effects on labour market outcomes, with the largest effects for younger, not married, and less educated workers.We investigate whether the economic consequences of this pandemic were larger for certain occupations. We then built indices for whether (1) workers are relatively more exposed to disease, (2) work with proximity to coworkers, (3) are essential workers, and (4) can easily work remotely. Our estimates suggest that the impact of the pandemic was significantly more severe for workers more exposed to disease and workers that work in proximity to coworkers, while the effects are significantly less severe for essential workers and workers that can work remotely.Last, we rely on a unique survey, the Canadian Perspective Survey, and show that reported mental health is significantly lower among the most affected workers during the pandemic. We also find that those who were absent form work because of COVID-19 are more concerned with meeting their financial obligations and with losing their job than those who remain working outside of home, while those who transition from working outside the home to from home are not as concerned with job loss.","BÃ©land, Louis-Philippe, Brodeur, Abel, Mikola, Derek, Wright, Taylor","https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3602430","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23770,""
"Changes in Healthcare Utilization, Spending, and Perceived Health During Covidâ€“19: A Longitudinal Study from Singapore","The COVIDâ€“19 pandemic has challenged the capacity of healthcare systems around the world and can potentially compromise healthcare utilization and health outcomes among non-COVIDâ€“19 patients. Using monthly panel data of nationally representative middle-aged and older Singaporeans, we examined the associations of the pandemic with healthcare utilization, out-of-pocket medical costs, and perceived health. At its peak, doctor visits decreased by 30% and out-of-pocket medical spending decreased by 23%, mostly driven by reductions in inpatient and outpatient care. Although there were little changes in self-reported health and sleep quality, COVIDâ€“19 increased depressive symptoms by 4%. We argue that it is imperative to monitor COVIDâ€“19's long-term health effects among non-COVIDâ€“19 patients since our findings indicated delayed healthcare and worsened mental health during the outbreak.","Ahn, SangNam, Kim, Seonghoon, Koh, Kanghyock","https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3695416","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: preprint","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23771,""
"Covid-19 and its impact on education, social life, and mental health among medical students in Saudi Arabia","Background: As COVID-19 pandemic reached Saudi Arabia, emergency disaster protocols were implemented to control the spread of the virus, which resulted in limitations on all public movements, including the dosure of educational institutes. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on education, social life, and mental health among medical students during COVID-19 restrictions. Methods: A cross-sectional study with a sample size of 1253 medical students from various universities in different regions in Saudi Arabia was conducted. Survey data were obtained from social media platforms using web-based self-administered questionnaires. Results: This study revealed large acceptance of online classes (64.1% of students), however, students reported less opportunities to both collaborate with colleagues, and ask questions during online dasses. Improved student's education skills including time management, self-monitoring for academic progress, access and using different types of information sources, and multitasking was demonstrated. Regarding effect of COVID-19 on students' social and habitual life, 52.9% reported satisfaction with utilization of their time, however, 52% stated socially not well connected, 36.3% never engage in physical activity, 42.4% reported increased body weight, and only 25% were able to sleep as usual. Social media platforms were at the fore front in using to overcome loneliness feeling and communicate with others. Conclusions: Positive impact of COVID-19 on education was demonstrated in terms of the large acceptance of online dasses and improvement of education skills. However, negative impact on social life was established including poor social communication, disturbed sleep habits and poor engagement in physical activity.","Shatla, M. M.; Alotaibi, N.

"Gaming addiction and its impact on emotional intelligence among school students during COVID â€“ 19 pandemic","Background: Internet addiction has become a major issue all over the world. Internet addiction in adolescents could be a serious crisis comparable to drug addiction in terms of personal life, family relationships, social behavior, and academic standing. According to scientific evidence, people with higher emotional intelligence are less addicted to the internet. However, the type and strength of this relationship are still up for debate. Our study aims to understand the level of emotional intelligence and online game use among adolescents and emotional intelligence based on gender with the level of gaming addiction. Materials and methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 417 adolescent children of age 10-19 in the schools of Dharmapuri district from March 2021 to April 2021. Simple Random Sampling techquine is used to select the schools and students. Game Addiction Scale for Adolescent (Jeroen S. Lemmens et al) and 30 Item Emotional Intelligence Scale (TEIQue-SF) was used as a standard tool. Results: A total of 471 children between the ages of 10 and 19 were included in the study. Game addiction received the lowest possible score of 21 and the best possible score of 105. The lowest possible score for emotional intelligence was 30, and the best possible score was 150. Males and girls had no statistically significant differences in gaming addiction and emotional intelligence at (p&gt;0.05). There was a statistically significant correlation (p &lt; 0.05) between tolerance and sociability, mood modification and self-control, relapse, and sociability. Conclusion: Excessive time spent in front of a computer and web overuse may be harmful to various aspects of their lives, including social, functional, physical, and psychological aspects, and may cause them to neglect other important priorities, putting them at risk for a variety of morbidities and, in the worst-case scenario, mortality.

"The psychopathological impact of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic on subjects suffering from different mental disorders: An observational retrospective study","SARS-CoV-2 infection causes a pulmonary disease (COVID-19) which spread worldwide generating fear, anxiety, depression in the general population as well as among subjects affected by mental disorders. Little is known about which different psychopathological changes the pandemic caused among individuals affected by different psychiatric disorders, which represents the aim of the present study. Specific psychometric scales were administered at three time points: T0 as outbreak of pandemic, T1 as lockdown period, T2 as reopening. Descriptive analyses and linear regression models were performed. A total of 166 outpatients were included. Overall, psychometric scores showed a significant worsening at T1 with a mild improvement at T2. Only psychopathology in schizophrenia (SKZ) patients and obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms did not significantly improve at T2. Subjects affected by personality disorders (PDs) resulted to be more compromised in terms of general psychopathology than depressed and anxiety/OC ones, and showed more severe anxiety symptoms than SKZ patients. In conclusion, subjects affected by PDs require specific clinical attention during COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the worsening of SKZ and OC symptoms should be strictly monitored by clinicians, as these aspects did not improve with the end of lockdown measures.

"Mal/adaptations: A qualitative evidence synthesis of opioid agonist therapy during major disruptions","Opioid agonist therapy (OAT) has been severely disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The risks of opioid withdrawal, overdose, and diversion have increased, so there is an urgent need to adapt OAT to best support people who use drugs (PWUD). This review examines the views and experiences of PWUD, health care providers, and health system administrators on OAT during major disruptions to medical care to inform appropriate health system responses during the current pandemic and beyond. We conducted a systematic review and qualitative evidence synthesis. We searched three comprehensive datasets for qualitative and mixed-methods studies that examined OAT in the context of major disruptions such as natural disasters, and analyzed included studies using thematic analysis and the constant comparative method. We used conceptual frameworks of health systems resilience and adaptive systems to interpret our findings. We included 10 studies published between 2002 and 2020 that examined OAT in the context of hurricanes, earthquakes, and terrorist attacks. We organized our results into three themes: uncertainty, inconsistency, and vulnerability; regulatory inflexibility; and lack of coordination. The highly regulated but poorly coordinated systems of OAT provision lacked flexibility to adapt to major disruptions, thereby manufacturing vulnerability for both PWUD and health workers. OAT programs must be resilient and adaptable to face major disruptions while maintaining quality care. Our findings provide guidance to develop and implement innovative strategies that increase the adaptive potential of OAT programs while focusing on the needs of PWUD.","Salamanca-Buentello, Cheng, Sabioni, Majid, Upshur, Sud","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2021.103556","20211213","COVID-19 pandemic; Disaster preparedness; Health systems resilience; Opioid agonist therapy; Opioid use disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23776,""
"Neural and Self-report Measures of Sensitivity to Uncertainty as Predictors of COVID-Related Negative Affect","The COVID-19 pandemic has been a period of unprecedented uncertainty. Research indicates individuals differ in their response to uncertainty and these differences are mediated by anterior insula (aINS) function. Those most sensitive to uncertainty are likely vulnerable to negative affect in the context of the pandemic. The current study was designed to directly test this question using both neural and self-reported measures of sensitivity to uncertainty. Fifty-nine volunteers completed a task designed to probe neural response to anticipation of predictable (P-) and unpredictable (U-) threat-of-electric-shock during functional magnetic resonance imaging and a self-report measure of intolerance of uncertainty (IU). Approximately two years later, during the peak of the pandemic, participants reported their emotional reactions to the COVID-19 crisis. Multilevel mixed models revealed that greater aINS activation to U-threat and greater self-reported IU were independent predictors of increased COVID-related negative affect. These findings were significant when adjusting for biological sex and depression and anxiety symptom severity. The results add to a growing literature demonstrating that individual differences in response to uncertainty have a robust impact on mood and functioning. Results also highlight that individuals highly sensitive to uncertainty may be at increased risk for poor mental health during the ongoing pandemic.","Khorrami, Manzler, Kreutzer, Gorka","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pscychresns.2021.111414","20211213","Anterior insula; COVID-19 pandemic; Intolerance of uncertainty; fMRI","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23777,""
"Parenting in a Pandemic: Parental Stress, Anxiety and Depression Among Parents During the Government-Initiated Physical Distancing Measures Following the First Wave of COVID-19","Drawing on the tenets of family stress theory, the aim of this study is to examine parents' perceived stress, symptoms of anxiety, depression, and associated risk- and protective factors across demographic subgroups during in the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Norwegian parents (N = 2,868; 79.5% mothers) with &gt; 1 child under 18 years of age completed an online survey two weeks after the implementation of government-initiated distancing measures. The survey includes measures of COVID-related risk factors (parental stress, burnout, depression, anxiety, anger of parents toward children, difficulty working from home, and positive beliefs about worry) and protective factors (self-efficacy and social support). Mothers, parents living with more than one child, and parents with a psychiatric diagnosis reported greater levels of parental stress, more burnout, and more anger toward their children, as well as less social support. Almost 25% of the parents reported anxiety and depression that are clinically significant. Parents who followed distancing measures reported significantly higher distress. Anger of parents toward children explains 41% of the variation in parental stress. The findings indicate that parents have experienced symptoms of deteriorated mental health due to the COVID- 19 pandemic, including parental stress, anxiety, and depression. The study presents practical implications for meso- and macro-level policymaking and offers support to further the potential aims of public health and clinical interventions.

"Comparison of Stress and Suicide-Related Behaviors Among Korean Youths Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial psychological effect on young people. A quantitative assessment of the association between the pandemic and stress and suicidality in youths is needed. To investigate the association of the COVID-19 pandemic with self-reported stress and suicide-related behaviors in youths. This cross-sectional study used data from the the Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey (KYRBWS) conducted in 2019 and 2020 with youths aged 12 to 18 years. Statistical analysis was performed from January to February 2021. The odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs for subjective stress level, sadness or despair, suicidal thoughts, suicide planning, and suicide attempts among 2020 participants were compared with those of the 2019 participants using multiple logistic regression analysis with complex sampling using weighted values. The 48Ã¢â‚¬Â¯443 youths in the 2019 KYRBWS (24Ã¢â‚¬Â¯917 male youths [51.3%]; mean [SD] age, 15.0 [1.7] years) and the 44Ã¢â‚¬Â¯216 youths in the 2020 KYRBWS (23Ã¢â‚¬Â¯103 male youths [52.5%]; mean [SD] age, 15.1 [1.7] years) were compared. The degree of subjective stress was lower in the 2020 participants than in the 2019 participants (severe stress: adjusted OR [aOR], 0.90 [95% CI, 0.83-0.97]; very severe stress: aOR, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.60-0.72]). Sadness or despair was also lower in the 2020 participants than in the 2019 participants (aOR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.78-0.84]). There were fewer suicide-related behaviors, including suicidal thoughts, suicide planning, and suicide attempts, among the 2020 participants than among the 2019 participants (suicidal thoughts: aOR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.73-0.80]; suicide planning: aORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.88 [95% CI, 0.81-0.96]; suicide attempts: aOR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.58-0.70]).

"Assessment of a Hotel-Based Protective Housing Program for Incidence of SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Management of Chronic Illness Among Persons Experiencing Homelessness","Persons experiencing homelessness (PEH) are at higher risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe illness due to COVID-19 because of a limited ability to physically distance and a higher burden of underlying health conditions. To describe and assess a hotel-based protective housing intervention to reduce incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among PEH in Chicago, Illinois, with increased risk of severe illness due to COVID-19. This retrospective cohort study analyzed PEH who were provided protective housing in individual hotel rooms in downtown Chicago during the COVID-19 pandemic from April 2 through September 3, 2020. Participants were PEH at increased risk for severe COVID-19, defined as (1) aged at least 60 years regardless of health conditions, (2) aged at least 55 years with any underlying health condition posing increased risk, or (3) aged less than 55 years with any underlying health condition posing substantially increased risk (eg, HIV/AIDS). Participants were housed in individual hotel rooms to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection; on-site health care workers provided daily symptom monitoring, regular SARS-CoV-2 testing, and care for chronic health conditions. Additional on-site services included treatment of mental health and substance use disorders and social services. The main outcome measured was SARS-CoV-2 incidence, with SARS-Cov2 infection defined as a positive upper respiratory specimen using any polymerase chain reaction diagnostic assay authorized for emergency use by the Food and Drug Administration. Secondary outcomes were blood pressure control, glycemic control as measured by hemoglobin A1c, and housing placements at departure. Of 259 participants from 16 homeless shelters in Chicago, 104 (40.2%) were aged at least 65 years, 190 (73.4%) were male, 185 (71.4%) were non-Hispanic Black, and 49 (18.9%) were non-Hispanic White. There was an observed reduction in SARS-CoV-2 incidence during the study period among the protective housing cohort (54.7 per 1000 people [95% CI, 22.4-87.1 per 1000 people]) compared with citywide rates for PEH residing in shelters (137.1 per 1000 people [95% CI, 125.1-149.1 per 1000 people]; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). There was also an adjusted change in systolic blood pressure at a rate of -5.7 mm Hg (95% CI, -9.3 to -2.1 mm Hg) and hemoglobin A1c at a rate of -1.4% (95% CI, -2.4% to -0.4%) compared with baseline. More than half of participants (51% [nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°132]) departed from the intervention to housing of some kind (eg, supportive housing). This cohort study found that protective housing was associated with a reduction in SARS-CoV-2 infection among high-risk PEH during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Chicago. These findings suggest that with appropriate wraparound supports (ie, multisector services to address complex needs), such housing interventions may reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, improve noncommunicable disease control, and provide a pathway to permanent housing.","Huggett, Tung, Cunningham, Ghinai, Duncan, McCauley, Detmer","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.38464","20211213","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23781,""

Depression, anxiety, and stress in internship doctors were 32.6, 44.1, and 19.5% consecutively. Multivariate analysis showed that the only demographic factor associated with depression was female sex. Concerns of internship doctors were the most factors associated with mental health. Working in triage was associated with depression and stress. Donning and doffing training of PPE, difficulty to practice physical distancing and hesitancy to attend patients were associated with depression and anxiety. Difficulty to practice physical distancing in hospital w associated with anxiety and stress. Firstly, some difficulties in data collection. Secondly, the self-reported tools of mental health are not always aligned with the psychiatric assessment. Lastly, possibility of recall biases from each batch. To minimize mental health problems of internship doctors, their concerns must be tackled. Medical schools have an important role to manage concerns of these internship doctors.","Lugito, Kurniawan, Lorens, Sieto","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadr.2021.100283","20211213","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Internship doctor; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23782,""

"COVID-Related Stress and Work Intentions in a Sample of US Health Care Workers","To evaluate relationships between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related stress and work intentions in a sample of US health care workers. Between July 1 and December 31, 2020, health care workers were surveyed for fear of viral exposure or transmission, COVID-19-related anxiety or depression, work overload, burnout, and intentions to reduce hours or leave their jobs. Among 20,665 respondents at 124 institutions (median organizational response rate, 34%), intention to reduce hours was highest among nurses (33.7%; n=776), physicians (31.4%; n=2914), and advanced practice providers (APPs; 28.9%; n=608) while lowest among clerical staff (13.6%; n=242) and administrators (6.8%; n=50; all <i>P</i>&lt;.001). Burnout (odds ratio [OR], 2.15; 95% CI, 1.93 to 2.38), fear of exposure, COVID-19-related anxiety/depression, and workload were independently related to intent to reduce work hours within 12 months (all <i>P</i>&lt;.01). Intention to leave one's practice within 2 years was highest among nurses (40.0%; n=921), APPs (33.0%; n=694), other clinical staff (29.4%; n=718), and physicians (23.8%; n=2204) while lowest among administrators (12.6%; n=93; all <i>P</i>&lt;.001). Burnout (OR, 2.57; 95% CI, 2.29 to 2.88), fear of exposure, COVID-19-related anxiety/depression, and workload were predictors of intent to leave. Feeling valued by one's organization was protective of reducing hours (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.72) and intending to leave (OR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.45; all <i>P</i>&lt;.01). Approximately 1 in 3 physicians, APPs, and nurses surveyed intend to reduce work hours. One in 5 physicians and 2 in 5 nurses intend to leave their practice altogether. Reducing burnout and improving a sense of feeling valued may allow health care organizations to better maintain their workforces postpandemic.","Sinsky, Brown, Stillman, Linzer","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocpiqo.2021.08.007","20211213","AMA, American Medical Association; APP, advanced practice provider; IRB, Institutional Review Board; MAR/MCAR, missing at random vs missing completely at random; OR, odds ratio","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23784,""
"Anxiety and Depression among Healthcare Workers during COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study","During a pandemic, healthcare workers (HCWs) are exposed to many stresses that predispose them to psychological disorders. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the anxiety and depression level of HCWs and determine the relationship between them in terms of their demographic characteristics. This study used a cross-sectional design. The participants consisted of clinical, administrative, and cleaning staff who were working in a referral COVID-19 hospital in an urban area of Iran. The census sampling method was used for recruiting the participants from May to August 2020. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) questionnaire and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) Scale were employed to collect data. Then, data were analyzed using multivariable linear regression analysis. One hundred forty HCWs participated in this study. The mean scores of anxiety and depression were 6.64 (4.86) and 18.21 (10.59), respectively. There was a significant direct association between anxiety and depression (P &lt; 0.001). In addition, female gender (P = 0.01) and having a history of infection with COVID-19 (P = 0.001) were associated with a higher level of anxiety. Moreover, having a history of being quarantined due to COVID-19 was associated with a higher level of depression (P = 0.03). According to the findings of the present study, considering the mental health of HCWs during the generalized anxiety outbreak of COVID-19 should be a priority, and appropriate interventions should be planned to improve their psychological condition.","Motahedi, Aghdam, Khajeh, Baha, Aliyari, Bagheri, Mardani","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e08570","20211213","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Healthcare Workers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23785,""
"The Impact of COVID-19 on Patient Experience Within a Midwest Hospital System: A Case Study","Patient-centered communication and patient-provider relationships directly affect patient outcomes. The purpose of this study was to compare inpatient perception of provider/nurse communication in both COVID versus non-COVID diagnoses groups. A qualitative retrospective study was conducted by performing a priori <i>coding</i> analysis on Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems surveys from 4 different hospitals for both COVID and non-COVID diagnoses. Five themes emerged from non-COVID patient data: inconsistent health care provider communication, variable patient-provider education, pandemic influenced patient satisfaction and mental health stress, inconsistent hospital services, and stable provider professionalism. Five themes arose from the COVID patient data: provider gratitude, controversial communication methods, consistent patient education, lack of quality patient care, and poor timeliness. There is evidence of shared patient perceptions between both COVID and non-COVID patients, but also differences including timeliness and quality of care. The pandemic influenced all patients by creating non-mutually exclusive themes including overall gratitude and patient satisfaction. Future research should focus on a quantitative analysis of pandemic-related patient-provider communication effects on patient outcomes.","Drapeaux, Jenson, Fustino","https://doi.org/10.1177/23743735211065298","20211213","COVID-19; HCAHPS; communication; nursing; physician engagement; provider","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23786,""
"Case Report: Clinical Features of a COVID-19 Patient With Cirrhosis","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019. At present, COVID-19 has emerged as a global pandemic. The clinical features of this disease are not fully understood, especially the interaction of COVID-19 and preexisting comorbidities and how these together further impair the immune system. In this case study, we report a COVID-19 patient with cirrhosis. A 73-year-old woman with cirrhosis reported a fever and cough on February 6, 2020. CT of the chest indicated an infection in her bilateral lungs. She tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The woman was treated with lopinavir and ritonavir tablets and interferon alpha-2b injection, but there was no obvious effect. Although this patient was basically asymptomatic after 2 days in the hospital, the inflammation of the bilateral lungs was slow to subside as shown in CT of the chest. In addition, the white blood cell count (WBC), absolute neutrophil count, and absolute lymphocyte count remained decreased and the result of real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (rRT-PCR) assay was still positive for SARS-CoV-2 on hospital day 28. After infusion of plasma from a recovered COVID-19 patient four times, the patient tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. She was discharged on March 13, 2020. This patient tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 after infusion of plasma from a recovered COVID-19 patient four times. Cirrhosis could impair the homeostatic role of the liver in the systemic immune response, which may affect the removal of SARS-CoV-2. This could lead to a diminished therapeutic effect of COVID-19. Thus, clinicians should pay more attention to COVID-19 patients with cirrhosis.","Zhou, Jiang, Wang, Huang, Zheng, Xie, Zhou, Sun","https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.678227","20211213","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; cirrhosis; cured patient; treatment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23787,""

"Work-Related Mental Health Under COVID-19 Restrictions: A Mini Literature Review","Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) restrictions, including national lockdown, social distancing, compulsory quarantine, and organizational measures of remote working, are imposed in many countries and organizations to combat the coronavirus. The various restrictions have caused different impacts on the employees' mental health worldwide. The purpose of this mini-review is to investigate the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on employees' mental health across the world. We searched articles in Web of Science and Google Scholar, selecting literature focusing on employees' mental health conditions under COVID-19 restrictions. The findings reveal that the psychological impacts of teleworking are associated with employees' various perceptions of its pros and cons. The national lockdown, quarantine, and resuming to work can cause mild to severe mental health issues, whereas the capability to practice social distancing is positively related to employees' mental health. Generally, employees in developed countries have experienced the same negative and positive impacts on mental health, whereas, in developing countries, employees have reported a more negative effect of the restrictions. One explanation is that the unevenly distributed mental health resources and assistances in developed and developing countries.","Liu, Xu, Ma","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.788370","20211213","COVID-19 restrictions; developing and developed countries; employees; remote working; social distancing; work-related mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23789,""
"Identifying the Subtypes and Characteristics of Mental Workload Among Chinese Physicians in Outpatient Practice: A Latent Profile Analysis","<b>Objective:</b> The purpose of this study is to investigate the mental workload level of physicians in outpatient practice since the normalization of prevention and control of the COVID-19 pandemic in China and explore the subtypes of physicians regarding their mental workload. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional survey of 1,934 physicians primarily in 24 hospitals in 6 provinces in Eastern, Central, and Western China was conducted from November 2020 to February 2021. A latent profile analysis was performed to identify clusters based on the six subscales of the Chinese version of physician mental workload scale developed by our research team. Chi-square tests were performed to explore the differences in demographic characteristics of the subtypes among the subgroups, and multinomial logistic regression analysis was further conducted to identify the determinants of the subtypes of physicians. <b>Results:</b> Overall, the participating physicians reported high levels of task load but with high self-assessed performance (68.01 Ã‚Â± 14.25) while performing communication work tasks characterized by direct patient interaction in outpatient clinics. About 33.8% of the participating physicians were identified as ""high workload and high self-assessment"" subtype, compared to 49.7% ""medium workload and medium self-assessment"" subtype and 16.4% ""low workload and low self-assessment"" subtype. Physicians in ""high workload and high self-assessment"" subtype had the highest mean mental workload score. Physicians who were female, younger, married, worse health status, those who had lower educational level and an average monthly income of 5,001-10,000 RMB, those who worked in tertiary A hospitals, more hours per week and more than 40 h per week in outpatient clinics, and those who saw more outpatients per day, and spent more time per patient but with higher outpatient satisfaction were more likely to belong to ""high workload and high self-assessment"" subtype. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our findings can help provide a solid foundation for developing targeted interventions for individual differences across physicians regarding their mental workload. We suggest the hospital managers should pay more attention to those physicians with characteristics of the ""high workload and high self-assessment"" subtype and strengthen the management of the workload of this subtype of physicians to reduce the risks of their mental health, and to maintain their high work performance in outpatient clinics.","Li, Hu, Chen, Zhu, Wu, Li, Zhang, Liu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.779262","20211213","COVID-19; China; communication; latent profile analysis; mental health; mental workload; outpatient care; physicians","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23790,""
"How Did the COVID-19 Lockdown Affect Children and Adolescent's Well-Being: Spanish Parents, Children, and Adolescents Respond","<b>Background:</b> During the COVID-19 pandemic, lockdown strategies have been widely used to contain SARS-CoV-2 virus spread. Children and adolescents are especially vulnerable to suffering psychological effects as result of such measures. In Spain, children were enforced to a strict home lockdown for 42 days during the first wave. Here, we studied the effects of lockdown in children and adolescents through an online questionnaire. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional study was conducted in Spain using an open online survey from July (after the lockdown resulting from the first pandemic wave) to November 2020 (second wave). We included families with children under 16 years-old living in Spain. Parents answered a survey regarding the lockdown effects on their children and were instructed to invite their children from 7 to 16 years-old (mandatory scholar age in Spain) to respond a specific set of questions. Answers were collected through an application programming interface system, and data analysis was performed using R. <b>Results:</b> We included 1,957 families who completed the questionnaires, covering a total of 3,347 children. The specific children's questionnaire was completed by 167 kids (7-11 years-old), and 100 adolescents (12-16 years-old). Children, in general, showed high resilience and capability to adapt to new situations. Sleeping problems were reported in more than half of the children (54%) and adolescents (59%), and these were strongly associated with less time doing sports and spending more than 5 h per day using electronic devices. Parents perceived their children to gain weight (41%), be more irritable and anxious (63%) and sadder (46%). Parents and children differed significantly when evaluating children's sleeping disturbances. <b>Conclusions:</b> Enforced lockdown measures and isolation can have a negative impact on children and adolescent's mental health and well-being. In future waves of the current pandemic, or in the light of potential epidemics of new emerging infections, lockdown measures targeting children, and adolescents should be reconsidered taking into account their infectiousness potential and their age-specific needs, especially to facilitate physical activity and to limit time spent on electronic devices.","Ajanovic, Garrido-Aguirre, Baro, Balanza, Varo, Millat-MartÃƒÂ­nez, Arias, Fonollosa, Perera-Lluna, Jordan, MuÃƒÂ±oz-Almagro, Bonet-Carne, Crosas-Soler, Via, Nafria, GarcÃƒÂ­a-GarcÃƒÂ­a, Bassat","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.746052","20211213","COVID-19; adolescent; children; lockdown; mental health; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23791,""

"Scientific evidence on mental health in key regions under the COVID-19 pandemic - meta-analytical evidence from Africa, Asia, China, Eastern Europe, Latin America, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Spain","This systematic review aims to summarize the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and insomnia in the general adult population and healthcare workers (HCWs) in several key regions worldwide during the first year of the COVID pandemic. Several literature databases were systemically searched for meta-analyses published by 22 September 2021 on the prevalence rates of mental health symptoms worldwide. The prevalence rates of mental health symptoms were summarized based on 388 empirical studies with a total of 1,067,021 participants from six regions and four countries. Comparatively, Africa and South Asia had the worse overall mental health symptoms, followed by Latin America. The research effort on mental health during COVID-19 has been highly skewed in terms of the scope of countries and mental health outcomes. The mental health symptoms are highly prevalent yet differ across regions, and such evidence helps to enable prioritization of mental health assistance efforts to allocate attention and resources based on the regional differences in mental health. El objetivo de esa revisiÃƒÂ³n sistemÃƒÂ¡tica es el de resumir la prevalencia de la ansiedad, la depresiÃƒÂ³n y el insomnio, tanto en la poblaciÃƒÂ³n general adulta como en los trabajadores de salud de diferentes regiones clave alrededor del mundo durante el primer aÃƒÂ±o de la pandemia por la COVID-19. Se revisaron de manera sistemÃƒÂ¡tica diversas bases de datos cientÃƒÂ­ficas buscando metaanÃƒÂ¡lisis sobre la prevalencia de sÃƒÂ­ntomas en salud mental alrededor del mundo, publicados hasta el 22 de setiembre del 2021. Se resumiÃƒÂ³ la prevalencia de los sÃƒÂ­ntomas de salud mental sobre la base de 388 estudios empÃƒÂ­ricos, comprendiendo a 1.067.021 participantes de cuatro paÃƒÂ­ses y de seis regiones. ÃƒÂfrica y Asia meridional tuvieron, de manera general, los peores sÃƒÂ­ntomas de salud mental, seguidas por LatinoamÃƒÂ©rica. El esfuerzo por realizar investigaciÃƒÂ³n en salud mental durante la pandemia por la COVID-19 ha estado altamente sesgado en torno a la envergadura de los paÃƒÂ­ses y de las medidas de resultado empleadas en salud mental.

"Burnout, Anxiety, Stress, and Depression Among Iranian Nurses: Before and During the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Background:</b> Nurses are the major healthcare workforce in an epidemic and have the most contact with patients. Frontline nurses face many health challenges during the COVID-19 epidemic, are directly at risk when treating and caring for COVID-19 patients, and thus experience severe stress and problems in the workplace leading to physical, mental, and social disorders, as well as burnout, anxiety, stress, and depression. The purpose of this study was to compare burnout, anxiety, stress, and depression in nurses before and during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> This was a cross sectional study. We assessed 266 frontline nurses before and 242 frontline nurses during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic with one year apart in 2019 and 2020 (two-stage sampling). The data were collected using demographic questionnaire, Maslach Burnout Questionnaire and Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) in public hospitals in Southern Iran. <b>Results:</b> There were no significant differences between groups in subscales of burnout (<i>p</i> &gt; 0.05). Anxiety, stress and depression scores significantly increased during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic compared with before the COVID-19 outbreak (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). There were significant differences between groups in level of anxiety (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and stress (<i>p</i> = 0.04). Before the COVID-19 outbreak, burnout predicted 11, 15, and 13% of the variance of anxiety, stress and depression, respectively. In addition, stress, monthly working hours and shift were variables that predicted 16% of the variance of burnout before COVID-19. <b>Conclusion:</b> The results of the present study showed that burnout during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic did not change significantly compared with before COVID-19. Anxiety, stress and depression increased significantly first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Zakeri, Rahiminezhad, Salehi, Ganjeh, Dehghan","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.789737","20211213","COVID-19; anxiety; burnout; depression; nurse; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23794,""
"Does Perceived Stress of University Students Affected by Preferences for Movie Genres? an Exploratory Cross-Sectional Study in China","This study aims to explore whether different preferences for movie genres were related to different perceived stress of college students. An online questionnaire was designed and it was filled out by 1,549 students voluntarily. The 10-item perceived stress scale (PSS-10) and multinomial logistic regression were used to access the perceived stress and the association between the movie preference genres. Over 90% of participants had mild to serious levels of stress. Differences were found between participants with different stress perception states in terms of smoking history, active exercise, and sleep duration (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The participants who showed a preference for suspense movies more probably had lower stress [relative risk ratio (RRR)1 = 0.34, RRR2 = 0.26, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05], while students who showed preferences for crime film and disaster film more probably had higher stress (RRR = 2.03, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05, RRR = 3.15, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). And the significant gender gap in different film genre preferences was observed in this study (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The males who showed preference for horror movies were more probably to have moderate stress (<i>OR</i> = 3.68, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), and females who showed a preference for disaster movies were more probably to have high stress (<i>OR</i> = 3.27, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The perceived stress of Chinese university students is high after 1.5 years of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The personal preferences for certain film genres were significantly associated with perceived stress. As different film genre preferences, such as the preference for disaster, crime, and horror, are associated with high perceived stress, it may turn out to be useful to pay more attention to an individual's film viewing. The teachers need to be concerned with the media usage history and preferences of their students and may advise students with high-level stress to avoid potentially harmful media content.","Qiao","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.761340","20211213","mental health; perceived stress; preferences for movie genres; psychology; university students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23795,""
"Psychological Benefits of a Sport-Based Program for Female Cancer Survivors: The Role of Social Connections","In the context of sports-based interventions for improving health and quality of life in chronic patients, participants could develop meaningful social relationships that affect their well-being as much as intervention activities. In this study, 80 female cancer survivors participated in a running-based group intervention (2 sessions/week; 1.5 h), while 51 acted as controls. The intervention lasted approximately 5 months. Unfortunately, the length of the intervention was reduced and sport activities were altered by the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown mid-intervention, while the shared therapy sessions continued online. This possibly altered the results, as anxiety, depression, and physical aspects did not show significant differences between the experimental and control groups after the intervention. Participants reported positive comments on the experience as a whole, especially regarding the positive influence of the newly developed social connections. This was corroborated by significant correlations between group perceived cohesion and anxiety, depression, self-efficacy, and positive experience with the group psychological support. Overall, it is possible to suggest that in the program an important role was played by social connections and support, peer influence and the group experience, preserving positive experiential qualities of the intervention even if it was altered by external circumstances.","Durosini, Triberti, Sebri, Giudice, Guiddi, Pravettoni","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.751077","20211213","cancer; cancer survivors (CSs); group cohesion; quality of life; sport","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23796,""
"Responses to Offense at Work and the Impact of Hierarchical Status: The Fault of the Leader, Causal Attributions, and Social Support During the Covid-19 Pandemic Crisis","The study explores the mechanism by which unadapted causal attributions and the perception of social support stimulate revenge and reconciliation at the social and professional level in the context of the current pandemic. In particular, the purpose of the study is to investigate the relationship between the accused, the victim and offender status and the search for revenge or reconciliation following a personal offense. To test the suggested research model, we analyzed the data collected by 167 (<i>m</i> = 28.52; SD = 8.98) employees in different organizations using a multifactorial experimental design. The results support the influence of attributional predictions in forming revenge and reconciliation and show that they are involved in the decision to carry out revenge, but especially in the way the employee interprets the trigger situation. In conclusion, the revenge is based on a negative attributional mechanism that produces the greatest deficit of adaptation to the situation and a weakening of the perception of social support, while reconciliation seems to be based on a much more complex socio-occupational mechanism. Leaders should pay attention to organizational communication during a crisis as they could encourage hopelessness depression. Adjusting crisis communication is crucial to ensuring job satisfaction that could mitigate negative effects.","Marian, Barth, Oprea","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.734703","20211213","attributional style; emotions; reconciliation; revenge; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23797,""
"Adapting to Uncertainty: A Mixed-Method Study on the Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Expectant and Postpartum Women and Men","Detrimental biopsychosocial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on populations have been established worldwide. Despite research indicating that the transition to parenthood is a vulnerable period for maternal and paternal health, an in-depth examination of the specific challenges the pandemic poses for new mothers and fathers is still lacking. Using a mixed-method design, we investigated individual and relational well-being of women and men who were expecting their first child during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Portugal and its associations with contextual, individual, and relational factors. Adults older than 18 (<i>n</i> = 316, 198 women) from early pregnancy to 6-months postpartum completed a cross-sectional online survey assessing sociodemographic, individual (depression, anxiety, perceived stress), and relational (dyadic adjustment, perceived social support) self-report measures. From those, 99 participants (64 women) responded to an open-ended question and reported perceived changes in their couple's relationship due to the pandemic. Men responding during strict lockdown measures reported significantly higher levels of perceived stress relative to those men who were not under lockdown. Overall, women reported higher levels of depression and greater social support than men. Qualitative analyses resulted in two main themes: Individual Changes and Relational Changes. These themes aggregate personal concerns and experiences (e.g., worsening of mental health, uncertainty about the future, lack of freedom) interrelated with relational issues (e.g., increased togetherness, avoidance of physical contact, and increased availability for parenthood during lockdown). The prevalence of negative effects (58.6%) exceeded the described positive effects (28.3%), and 13.1% described both positive and negative effects of the pandemic. Current findings offer grounds for important evidence-based strategies to mitigate the potential adverse effects of the current pandemic on new mothers' and fathers' individual and relational well-being.","Tavares, Fernandes, Moura, Nobre, Carrito","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.688340","20211213","COVID-19; anxiety; couple relationship; depression; postpartum; pregnancy; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23798,""
"Introduction and Psychometric Validation of the Resilience and Strain Questionnaire (ResQ-Care)- A Scale on the Ratio of Informal Caregivers' Resilience and Stress Factors","<b>Background:</b> Informal caregivers are a particularly vulnerable population at risk for adverse health outcomes. Likewise, there are many scales available assessing individual caregiver burden and stress. Recently, resilience in caregivers gained increasing interest and scales started to assess resilience factors as well. Drawing on a homeostatic model, we developed a scale assessing both caregivers' stress and resilience factors. We propose four scales, two covering stress and two covering resilience factors, in addition to a sociodemographic basic scale. Based on the stress:resilience ratio, the individual risk of adverse health outcomes and suggestions for interventions can be derived. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 291 informal caregivers filled in the ResQ-Care as part of a survey study conducted during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. Exploratory factor analysis was performed. Validity analyses were examined by correlations with the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-4) and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15). <b>Results:</b> The data fitted our proposed four-factor solution well, explaining 43.3% of the variance. Reliability of each scale was at least acceptable with Cronbach's ÃŽÂ± Ã¢â€°Â¥0.67 and MacDonald's Ãâ€° Ã¢â€°Â¥0.68 for all scales. The two strain scales weighed more than the resilience scales and explained 65.6% of the variance. Convergent and discriminant validity was confirmed for the BRS and PSS-4, whereas the GDS-15 correlation pattern was counterintuitive. <b>Conclusion:</b> The factor structure of the ResQ-Care scale was confirmed, with good indications of reliability and validity. Inconsistent correlations of the scales with the GDS-15 might be due to a reduced validity of GDS-15 assessment during the COVID-19 lockdown.","Wuttke-Linnemann, Palm, Scholz, Geschke, Fellgiebel","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.778633","20211213","counseling; diagnostics; health; homeostasis; prevention; stress awareness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23799,""
"How participation in Covid-19 mutual aid groups affects subjective well-being and how political identity moderates these effects","Mutual aid groups have flourished during the Covid-19 pandemic. However, a major challenge is sustaining such groups, which tend to decline following the initial upsurge immediately after emergencies. The present study investigates one possible motivation for continued participation: the well-being benefits associated with psychological membership of groups, as suggested by the ""social cure"" approach. Interviews were conducted with 11 volunteers in a mutual aid group organized by ACORN, a community union and anti-poverty campaigning organization. Through qualitative analysis, we show that participation provided well-being in different ways: positive emotional experiences, increased engagement in life, improved social relationships, and greater sense of control. Participants also reported some negative emotional experiences. While all interviewees experienced benefits from participation, those who viewed their participation through a political lens were able to experience additional benefits such as feelings of empowerment. Moreover, the benefits conferred by a shared political identity appeared to be qualitatively different from the benefits conferred by other forms of shared identity. The interview data is used to hypothesize an overall process by which participants may come to attain a political identity via mutual aid. These findings have implications for how such groups retain their members and how authorities support these groups.","Mao, Drury, Fernandes-Jesus, Ntontis","https://doi.org/10.1111/asap.12275","20211213","Activism; covidÃ¢â‚¬Â19; groups; mental health; mutual aid; social cure; social identity; subjective wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23800,""
"Changes in Substance Use Among People Seeking Alcohol and Other Drug Treatment During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evaluating Mental Health Outcomes and Resilience","Alcohol and other drug (AOD) use patterns have altered as a result of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic restrictions. This study aimed to: (i) determine the impact of the pandemic on patterns of AOD use among individuals seeking treatment, (ii) identify which mental health and resilience factors were associated with changes in patterns of AOD use and (iii) evaluate changes in the contextual factors (eg, motivations) associated with use. Cross-sectional surveys were completed by clients (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°325) who had sought AOD treatment from January 2020 onwards. We measured quantity and frequency of AOD use now compared to before the pandemic, mental health (depression, anxiety, trauma exposure), resilience and contextual factors related to AOD use. Quantity of tobacco and cannabis use increased post-pandemic, while methamphetamine and alcohol did not change. Depression was associated with more frequent alcohol use now compared to before the pandemic, while anxiety and lower resilience were associated with less frequent cannabis use now. Lower resilience was associated changes in methamphetamine use. Depression was associated with using more frequently for enjoyment and to alleviate loneliness following the pandemic, and anxiety was associated with using earlier in the day and to alleviate boredom. The pandemic has led to increased frequency of AOD use for a subset of individuals seeking treatment. Depression, anxiety and resilience are important factors associated with altered AOD use, and changes in the motivations and control surrounding use. Special consideration of this should be considered during AOD treatment through the pandemic.","Carlyle, Leung, Walter, Juckel, Salom, Quinn, Davidson, Ellem, Newland, Hides","https://doi.org/10.1177/11782218211061746","20211213","AOD treatment; COVID-19; Substance use; anxiety; depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23801,""
"Effect of Meditation and Breathing Exercises on the Well-being of Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Infection under Institutional Isolation: A Randomized Control Trial","The corona virus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected every domain of human health be it physical or mental. The uncertainty of disease progression in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to major psychological and psychiatric concerns that should not be overlooked. The interventions should be directed to the vulnerable population to help them mitigate the stress and anxiety caused by the infection and isolation. We evaluated the effect of meditation and breathing exercises on the well-being of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection under institutional isolation. We conducted a randomized control trial on 84 subjects, 18 years and above, asymptomatic, or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected patients under institutional isolation. Subjects were randomly and equally divided into a control group and interventional group. We measured the depression, anxiety, and stress levels as well as quality of sleep in patients after 7 days of meditation and breathing exercises in the intervention group versus standard care in the control group. Meditation and breathing exercises had a statistically significant effect on the depression level (P &lt; 0.001), stress level (P = 0.004), and the quality of sleep [trouble falling asleep (P = 0.007), trouble staying asleep (P = 0.004), and feel tired after waking up in the morning (P = 0.003)]. Further, the positive effect of intervention on the level of anxiety in patients under isolation was also observed; however, the difference was not found to be statistically significant (P = 0.528). Meditation and breathing exercises have positive effects on depression, stress levels, and quality of sleep in COVID-19 positive patients under strict institutional isolation.","Mahendru, Pandit, Singh, Choudhary, Mohan, Bhatnagar","https://doi.org/10.25259/IJPC_40_21","20211213","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Meditation; SARS-CoV-2; Sleep; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23802,""
"Gamification and family leisure to alleviate the psychological impact of confinement due to COVID-19","This study presents a quasi-experimental longitudinal mixed-methods research about the participation in leisure activities, physical activity, and games, as part of the family leisure programme (""Lunae Magic School"") for Spanish families with children under 12Ã‚Â years old during COVID-19Ã‚Â lockdown. The impact on parents and their perception of the psychological well-being of their children is evaluated. The results show that leisure activities reduce the parent's anxiety levels measured with STAI scale (<i>pÃ‚Â </i>=Ã‚Â .0001) and their perception of the physical and emotional discomfort of their children, measured with PSC scale (<i>pÃ‚Â </i>&lt;Ã‚Â .0001). It is qualitatively argued that despite the confinement situation, the gamification, the variety of activities and the fact of being able to enjoy quality time with the family have allowed the creation of spaces of fun and flow.

"Alcohol Use Cravings as a Mediator Between Associated Risk Factors on Increased Alcohol Use among Youth Adults in New York During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The sudden increase in alcohol use in the young adult population during the COVID-19 pandemic may be partially explained by social isolation and stress due to restricted stay-at-home orders. The goal of this study was to assess specific psychological factors (e.g., anxiety, depressive symptoms, sleep disturbances, and alcohol cravings) and COVID-19 diagnoses and their association with increased alcohol use and misuse during the COVID-19 pandemic among New York residents 18-35 years of age. Survey data were collected via Qualtrics between July 2020-October 2020. Path analyses tests were employed to test alcohol use cravings as a mediator. Among the total sample (N=575), mean age was 27.94Ã‚Â±4.12; a majority were White non-Hispanic (66%), female (55%) and had completed a 4-year college or university degree (n = 249; 43.5%).

"Influence of the COVID-19 Lockdown on the Physical and Psychosocial Well-being and Work Productivity of Remote Workers: Cross-sectional Correlational Study","Lockdowns imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic have impacted the living and working habits of millions of people, with potentially important implications for their physical, mental, and social well-being. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on remote workers who were not directly affected by COVID-19. This was a correlational cross-sectional study (with an additional qualitative component) of 184 remote workers surveyed during the first COVID-19 lockdown in the United Kingdom. Standard measures of mental health (Kessler-6 Distress Scale), productivity (Brief Instrument to Assess Workers' Productivity During a Working Day), and physical activity (International Physical Activity Questionnaire) were used, and respondents were further surveyed on changes to their dietary, exercise, smoking, drinking, and socialization habits to produce a well-being change index. The results revealed associations between sedentary behavior and poorer mental health (<i>Ãâ€ž</i> <sub>b</sub>=0.14) and between poorer mental health and low work productivity (<i>Ãâ€ž</i> <sub>b</sub>=-0.39). However, both positive and negative lifestyle changes were reported; a self-reported increase in well-being (with respect to diet, exercise, smoking, alcohol consumption, and socialization) since the start of the pandemic was associated with both better mental health (<i>Ãâ€ž</i> <sub>b</sub>=-0.14) and better work productivity (<i>Ãâ€ž</i> <sub>b</sub>=0.14). Of note, among respondents without a mental health diagnosis (137/184, 74.4%), we observed rates of moderate (76/137, 55.5%) and severe (17/137, 12.4%) psychological distress, which were markedly higher than those reported in large prepandemic studies; moreover, 70.1% (129/184) of our respondents reported more sedentary behavior, 41% (69/168) increased their alcohol consumption, and 38.6% (71/184) increased their overall food intake. However, 46% (75/163), 44.8% (39/87) and 51.8% (57/110) of respondents reported spending more time walking and engaging in more moderate and vigorous exercise, respectively. Qualitative analysis revealed many positive adaptations to lockdowns (eg, decreased commuting expenses, flexibility) but also a number of structural obstacles to remote working (eg, lack of support and high expectations from employers, childcare duties). These findings may be of practical importance for policy makers and employers in a world in which work involves long-term remote or hybrid employment arrangements; strategies to promote more sustainable remote working are discussed.","Tronco HernÃƒÂ¡ndez, Parente, Faghy, Roscoe, Maratos","https://doi.org/10.2196/30708","20211213","COVID-19; employment; health policy; mental health; pandemic; policymakers; remote workers; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23805,""
"The experience of caregivers of chronically ill patients during the COVID-19: A Systematic Review","This study aimed to identify the difficulties that caregivers of chronically ill patients experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic and to provide directions for future studies. Five electronic databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL Plus Full Text, EMBASE, and Scopus, were systematically searched from January 2019 to February 2021. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses were employed for the literature screening, inclusion, and exclusion. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool was adopted for qualifying appraisal. Six studies met the study criteria, including three quantitative studies, two qualitative studies, and one mixed-method study. Mental health, personal experience, financial problems, physical health, and improvement approaches were the major five themes that participants reported regarding the impact of COVID-19 they encountered during the pandemic. The results could heighten healthcare providers, stakeholders, and policy leaders' awareness of providing appropriate support for caregivers. Future research incorporating programs that support caregivers' needs is recommended.","Ruksakulpiwat, Zhou, Phianhasin, Benjasirisan, Fan, Su, Chiaranai","https://doi.org/10.1177/17423953211064854","20211213","COVID-19; caregivers; chronically ill patients; experiences; systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23806,""
"Digital interventions for the treatment of depression: A meta-analytic review","The high global prevalence of depression, together with the recent acceleration of remote care owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, has prompted increased interest in the efficacy of digital interventions for the treatment of depression. We provide a summary of the latest evidence base for digital interventions in the treatment of depression based on the largest study sample to date. A systematic literature search identified 83 studies (N = 15,530) that randomly allocated participants to a digital intervention for depression versus an active or inactive control condition. Overall heterogeneity was very high (I2 = 84%). Using a random-effects multilevel metaregression model, we found a significant medium overall effect size of digital interventions compared with all control conditions (g = .52). Subgroup analyses revealed significant differences between interventions and different control conditions (WLC: g = .70; attention: g = .36; TAU: g = .31), significantly higher effect sizes in interventions that involved human therapeutic guidance (g = .63) compared with self-help interventions (g = .34), and significantly lower effect sizes for effectiveness trials (g = .30) compared with efficacy trials (g = .59). We found no significant difference in outcomes between smartphone-based apps and computer- and Internet-based interventions and no significant difference between human-guided digital interventions and face-to-face psychotherapy for depression, although the number of studies in both comparisons was low. Findings from the current meta-analysis provide evidence for the efficacy and effectiveness of digital interventions for the treatment of depression for a variety of populations. However, reported effect sizes may be exaggerated because of publication bias, and compliance with digital interventions outside of highly controlled settings remains a significant challenge.

"Leading through the first wave of COVID: a Canadian action research study","This first phase of a three-phase action research project aims to define leadership practices that should be used during and after the pandemic to re-imagine and rebuild the health and social care system. Specifically, the objectives were to determine what effective leadership practices Canadian health leaders have used through the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, to explore how these differ from pre-crisis practices; and to identify what leadership practices might be leveraged to create the desired health and care systems of the future. The authors used an action research methodology. In the first phase, reported here, the authors conducted one-on-one, virtual interviews with 18 health leaders from across Canada and across leadership roles. Data were analyzed using grounded theory methodology. Five key practices emerged from the data, within the core dimension of disrupting entrenched structures and leadership practices. These were, namely, responding to more complex emotions in self and others. Future practice identified to create more psychologically supportive workplaces. Agile and adaptive leadership. Future practice should allow leaders to move systemic change forward more quickly. Integrating diverse perspectives, within and across organizations, leveling hierarchies through bringing together a variety of perspectives in the decision-making process and engaging people more broadly in the co-creation of strategies. Applying existing leadership capabilities and experience. Future practice should develop and expand mentorship to support early career leadership. Communication was increased to build credibility and trust in response to changing and often contradictory emerging evidence and messaging. Future practice should increase communication. The project was limited to health leaders in Canada and did not represent all provinces/territories. Participants were recruited through the leadership networks, while diverse, were not demographically representative. All interviews were conducted in English; in the second phase of the study, the authors will recruit a larger and more diverse sample and conduct interviews in both English and French. As the interviews took place during the early stages of the pandemic, it may be that health leaders' views of what may be required to re-define future health systems may change as the crisis shifts over time. The sponsoring organization of this research - the Canadian Health Leadership Network and each of its individual member partners - will mobilize knowledge from this research, and subsequent phases, to inform processes for leadership development and, succession planning across, the Canadian health system, particularly those attributes unique to a context of crisis management but also necessary in post-crisis recovery. This research has shown that there is an immediate need to develop innovative and influential leadership action - commensurate with its findings - to supporting the evolution of the Canadian health system, the emotional well-being of the health-care workforce, the mental health of the population and challenges inherent in structural inequities across health and health care that discriminate against certain populations.

"Mental health at the COVID-19 frontline: An assessment of distress, fear, and coping among staff and attendees at screening clinics of rural/regional settings of Victoria, Australia","Research examining psychological well-being associated with COVID-19 in rural/regional Australia is limited. This study aimed to assess the extent of psychological distress, fear of COVID-19, and coping strategies among the attendees in COVID-19 screening clinics at 2 rural Victorian settings. A cross-sectional study was conducted during July 2020 to February 2021 inclusive. Participants were invited to fill in an online questionnaire. Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K-10), Fear of COVID-19 Scale, and Brief Resilient Coping Scale were used to assess psychological distress, fear of COVID-19, and coping, respectively. Among 702 total participants, 69% were females and mean age (Ã‚Â±SD) was 49 (Ã‚Â±15.8) years. One in 5 participants (156, 22%) experienced high to very high psychological distress, 1 in 10 (72, 10%) experienced high fear, and more than half (397, 57%) had medium to high resilient coping. Participants with mental health issues had higher distress (AOR 10.4, 95% CI: 6.25-17.2) and fear (2.56, 1.41-4.66). Higher distress was also associated with having comorbidities, increased smoking (5.71, 1.04-31.4), and alcohol drinking (2.03, 1.21-3.40). Higher fear was associated with negative financial impact, drinking alcohol (2.15, 1.06-4.37), and increased alcohol drinking. Medium to high resilient coping was associated with being Ã¢â€°Â¥60 years old (1.84, 1.04-3.24) and completing Bachelor and above levels of education. People who had pre-existing mental health issues, comorbidities, smoked, and consumed alcohol were identified as high-risk groups for poorer psychological well-being in rural/regional Victoria. Specific interventions to support the mental well-being of these vulnerable populations, along with engaging health care providers, should be considered.","Rahman, Ford, Sousa, Hedley, Greenstock, Cross, Brumby","https://doi.org/10.1111/jrh.12638","20211213","COVID-19; coping; mental health; resilience; rural","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23809,""
"Workplace Bullying and Patient Aggression Related to COVID-19 and its Association with Psychological Distress among Health Care Professionals during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Japan","The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has spread throughout the world. Poor mental health has been reported among healthcare professionals responding to COVID-19. However, no study has examined the impact of COVID-19-related workplace bullying or patient aggression on the mental health of healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 outbreak. This study examined the prevalence of COVID-19-related workplace bullying and patient aggression and its association with psychological distress among healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 outbreak in Japan. This was a cross-sectional study conducted from May 22 to 26, 2020, inviting participants (n = 1,421) from an online survey of full-time employees. We limited the sample to healthcare professionals for further analyses. Using an online self-report questionnaire, workplace bullying and patient aggression related to COVID-19 was measured using nine items with dichotomous response options. Psychological distress was measured using the Japanese version of Brief Job Stress Questionnaire. Among 1,032 participants (72.6%) who completed the survey, 111 healthcare professionals were identified. Among them, 19 participants (17.1%) had experienced any COVID-19-related workplace bullying or patient aggression: 11 participants (9.9%) had experienced any workplace bullying and 12 participants (10.8%) had experienced any patient aggression. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that any bullying or patient aggression related to COVID-19 significantly correlated with psychological distress. It was suggested that a non-negligible proportion of participants experienced workplace bullying or patient aggression related to COVID-19. Preventing and reducing workplace bullying and patient aggression may be effective in improving mental health of healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Asaoka, Sasaki, Kuroda, Tsuno, Kawakami","https://doi.org/10.1620/tjem.255.283","20211213","COVID-19; health care professional; patient aggression; psychological distress; workplace bullying","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23810,""
"Loneliness in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic: Prevalence, correlates and association with mental health","Loneliness, which is increasingly recognised as an important public health problem, may have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic in the wake of social distancing measures. This study examined loneliness in Japan during the ongoing pandemic and its association with mental health. Cross-sectional online survey data that were collected at monthly intervals from April to December 2020 were analysed. Loneliness was assessed with the Three-Item Loneliness Scale. Information was also obtained on depressive (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7) symptoms. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine associations. For the combined sample (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 9000), 41.1% of the respondents were categorised as lonely when using Ã¢â€°Â¥ 6 as a cutoff score, and 16.5% when the cutoff was Ã¢â€°Â¥ 7. The prevalence of loneliness changed little across the period. Younger age, male sex and socioeconomic disadvantage (low income, deteriorating financial situation, unemployment) were associated with loneliness. In fully adjusted analyses, loneliness was linked to depressive (odds ratio [OR]: 5.78, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.08-6.57) and anxiety symptoms (OR: 5.34, 95% CI: 4.53-6.29). Loneliness is prevalent in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic and associated with socioeconomic disadvantage and poorer mental health. A focus on loneliness as a public health issue in Japan is now warranted.","Stickley, Ueda","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.114318","20211213","Anxiety; Coronavirus; Depression; Japanese; Lonely","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23811,""
"[Psychiatric emergencies in teleconsultation: legal and practical aspects]","In the context ofÃ‚Â the Covid-19 pandemic, teleconsultation is an obvious solution in psychiatry to ensure continuity of care and facilitate access.

These situations, because of the specific aspects they cover, are in fact upsetting texts and recommendations of good practice in terms of teleconsultation. Thus, the questions of eligibility of people suffering from psychiatric disorders, the identification of an immediate self- or hetero-aggressive risk during teleconsultation and the establishment of a measure of psychiatric care without consent atÃ‚Â the end of a teleconsultation require specific reflection in order to allow theÃ‚Â practitioner to anticipate and manage the situation in the best possible way.","Eck, Dujardin-Lascaux, Williatte-Pellitteri, Fovet","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.spsy.2021.10.008","20211213","Covid-19; care without consent; risk; risque; soin sans consentement; suicide; telemedicine; tÃƒÂ©lÃƒÂ©mÃƒÂ©decine; violence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23812,""

"Rural opioid treatment program patient perspectives on take-home methadone policy changes during COVID-19: a qualitative thematic analysis","In the United States, methadone for opioid use disorder (OUD) is highly regulated. Federal agencies announced guidelines in March 2020 allowing for relaxation of take-home methadone dispensing at opioid treatment programs (OTPs) to improve treatment access and reduce COVID-19 transmission risk during the public health emergency. We explored patient perspectives at three OTPs serving rural communities on how take-home policy changes were received and implemented and how these changes impacted their addiction treatment and recovery. We completed semi-structured individual qualitative interviews in 2 phases: (1) August-October 2020 and (2) November 2020-January 2021 (total nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°46), anticipating possible policy changes as the pandemic progressed. We interviewed patients with OUD enrolled at 3 rural OTPs in Oregon. Participants received varying take-home methadone allowances following the COVID-19-related policy changes. All interviews were conducted via phone, audio-recorded, and transcribed. We conducted a thematic analysis, iteratively coding transcripts, and deductively and inductively generating codes. The 46 participants included 50% women and 89% had Medicaid insurance. Three main themes emerged in the analysis, with no differences between study phases: (1) Adapting to changing OTP policies throughout the pandemic; (2) Recognizing the benefits, and occasional struggles, with increased take-home methadone dosing; and (3) Continuing policies and procedures post-pandemic. Participants described fears and anxieties around ongoing methadone access and safety concerns prior to OTP policy changes, but quickly adapted as protocols soon seemed ""natural."" The majority of participants acknowledged significant benefits to increased take-homes independent of reducing COVID-19 infection risk including feeling ""more like a normal person,"" improved recovery support, reduced time traveling, and having more time with family and for work. Looking to a post-pandemic future, participants thought some COVID-19-related safety protocols should continue that would reduce risk of other infections, make OTP settings less stressful, and result in more individualized care. As the pandemic progressed, study participants adapted to rapidly changing OTP policies. Participants noted many unanticipated benefits to increased take-home methadone and other COVID-19 protocols including strengthened self-efficacy and recovery and reduced interpersonal conflict, with limited evidence of diversion. Patient perspectives should inform future policies to better address the ongoing overdose epidemic.","Levander, Hoffman, McIlveen, McCarty, Terashima, Korthuis","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13722-021-00281-3","20211213","Addiction medicine; COVID-19; Methadone; Qualitative research; Rural; Substance-related disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23814,""
"Psychological experience of patients with confirmed COVID-19 at the initial stage of pandemic in Wuhan, China: a qualitative study","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) quickly developed into a global pandemic and affected patients' mental health. However, little is known about psychological experience of patients with COVID-19. The aim was to elucidate the psychological experience of patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Wuhan, at the initial stage of the pandemic. This study was conducted using a phenomenological approach in a qualitative study. Thirteen patients with confirmed COVID-19 from a COVID-19-designated hospital in Wuhan, were recruited between March 15th and April 20th, 2020 via purposive sampling. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted face-to-face. The interview data were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. The psychological experience of patients was summarized into three themes: mental distress related to COVID-19, expectations of life scenarios after discharge, and making sense of the experience. These themes were classified into 10 sub-themes. Patients experienced confusion, uncertainty, worry, guilt and concern. Both positive and negative expectations of life scenarios after discharge were reported, manifested as expectations about making up for lost time with family, anxiety about social discrimination and feelings of helplessness about poor financial security. Moreover, patients perceived strength of abundant social support and awareness of social responsibility from their unique experience to cope with their condition. This study demonstrated that patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Wuhan underwent complex psychological experience, both positive and negative at the initial stage of the pandemic. These findings will contribute to the delivery of effective mental health care to safeguard patients' wellbeing.","Li, Hu, Xia, Wen, Ren, Xia, Wang, Cai, Chen","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-12277-4","20211213","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Infectious disease pandemic; Patients; Psychology; Qualitative research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23815,""
"Assessing the repercussions of COVID-19 pandemic on symptoms, disease management, and emotional well-being in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a multi-site survey study","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created numerous challenges in provision of safe and effective care for patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). In this study, we surveyed patients with IBD to highlight the impact of the pandemic on their IBD symptoms, management, and well-being. A multi-site survey was administered to patients with IBD. We evaluated patient's symptoms, medications changes, seeking medical attention, eating behaviors, sleep patterns, stress, self-reported anxiety and depression. The survey also measured emotional impact of the pandemic using the validated Pandemic Emotional Impact Scale (PEIS) and resilience using the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS). Logistic, ordinal, and linear regression models were utilized to perform sensitivity analyses. The response rate to the survey was 61%. Of 391 surveyed patients, 21.1% reported worsened gastrointestinal symptoms, 17.5% reported changing biologic medication infusion schedule, 18.7% reported changing medication regimen, 43.6% attended at least one telemedicine visit with their gastroenterologist, 16.5% reported a less healthy diet, 40.5% reported worsening sleep, 63.7% reported more stress, and 65.3% reported feeling more vulnerable than before the pandemic. Women and participants with self-reported anxiety and depression were more likely to have worse symptoms, psychological well-being and daily functioning. Increased PEIS scores and decreased BRS scores were associated with worse outcomes. COVID-19 pandemic has impacted symptoms, disease management and well-being for patient with IBD, more prominently in patients who suffer from anxiety and depression. Utilizing PEIS and BRS scores as screening tools could help better tailor outreach and follow-up to support these patients.","El-Dallal, Saroufim, Systrom, Ballou, Farhoud, Pasam, Gadupudi, Osman, Chaudrey, Cheifetz, Feuerstein","https://doi.org/10.1080/00365521.2021.2013527","20211213","COVID-19; CrohnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease; health; mental health; pandemic; ulcerative colitis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23816,""

"Risk Factors for Postpartum Depression During COVID-19 Pandemic: A Systematic Literature Review","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating worldwide effect on mental health. Recent studies correlate the spreading of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with symptoms of depression, most prominent in postpartum women. Our systematic literature review scope is to identify the risk factors and predictors for postpartum depression (PPD) and describe the steps that should be taken to help postpartum women. This study will help clinicians, researchers, and policymakers to elucidate the predictors of PPD during this pandemic and prevent these adverse outcomes in future crises. We conducted a systematic search by employing databases PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Embase to identify articles published before March 2021. About 463 publications were generated during our search process and from those, 36 were reviewed, summarized, and synthesized. Studies qualified the criteria if they (1) utilized qualitative or quantitative design, (2) explored the risk factors for PPD, and (3) were written in English. Quality evaluation of each study was achieved by using criteria set by Lincoln and Guba. Prevalence of depression symptoms ranged from 7% to 80.8% in postpartum women during the SARS-COV 2 pandemic. The risk factors for PPD were classified into 6 major categories: socio-demographic, psychological, pre-existing pathology, metabolic factors, previous events of miscarriage, and media misinformation. It is extremely vital to care for women's mental health during pregnancy and after childbirth during these unprecedented times. This review urges the need to design adequate interventions for this vulnerable population to prevent negative consequences of PPD.","Usmani, Greca, Javed, Sharath, Sarfraz, Sarfraz, Salari, Hussaini, Mohammadi, Chellapuram, Cabrera, Ferrer","https://doi.org/10.1177/21501327211059348","20211213","COVID-19; anxiety; mental health; postnatal depression; postpartum depression; sars-cov-2; women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-14","",23818,""
