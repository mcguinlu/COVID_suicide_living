"Suicide and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan","Background: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is an unprecedented public health crisis, but its effect on suicide deaths is little understood. Method: We analyzed data from monthly suicide statistics between January 2017 and August 2020 and online surveys on mental health among the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. Results: Compared to the last three years (2017-2019), the number of suicide deaths was lower during the initial phase of the pandemic but subsequently exceeded the past trend. By August 2020, the total number of suicides was 5.69% higher than the average number of suicides in the same month of the previous three years. The largest increase was found in suicides by young women (less than 40 years of age), with a 40% increase in August 2020 compared to the same month in the past three years. The number of suicides among students and housekeepers in summer months was notably larger in 2020. The survey data indicated that the status of mental health among young women was worse than that of women in other age groups. In addition, young female workers were more likely to have experienced a job or income loss in recent months compared to any other groups, suggesting adverse economic conditions surrounding some of these young female workers. Conclusion: Our results strongly indicate that continuous monitoring of mental health, particularly that of the most vulnerable populations identified in this study, and appropriate suicide prevention efforts are necessary during and in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Michiko Ueda; Robert NordstrÃ¶m; Tetsuya Matsubayashi","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.20207472","20201008","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-08","",5574,""
"Mental health symptoms in a cohort of hospital healthcare workers following the first peak of the Covid-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom","Background The Covid-19 pandemic is likely to lead to a significant increase in mental health disorders amongst healthcare workers (HCW). Aims We evaluated the prevalence of anxiety, depressive and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in a HCW population in the United Kingdom (UK), to identify subgroups most at risk. Methods An electronic survey was conducted between the 05/06/2020 and 31/07/2020 of all hospital HCW in the West Midlands, UK using clinically validated questionnaires: Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4) and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). Univariate analyses and adjusted logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate the strengths in associations. Results There were 2638 eligible participants who completed the survey (female: 79.5%, median age: 42 [IQR: 32-51] years). The prevalence rates of clinically significant symptoms of anxiety, depression and PTSD were 34.3%, 31.2% and 24.5% respectively. In adjusted analysis a history of mental health conditions was associated with clinically significant symptoms of anxiety (odds ratio 2.3 [95% CI 1.9-2.7]; p<0.001), depression (2.5 [2.1-3.0]; p<0.001) and PTSD (2.1 [1.7-2.5]; p<0.001). The availability of adequate personal protective equipment (PPE), wellbeing support and lower exposure to moral dilemmas at work demonstrated significant negative associations with former symptoms (p[&le;]0.001). Conclusions We report a high prevalence of clinically significant symptoms of anxiety, depression and PTSD in hospital HCW following the initial Covid-19 pandemic peak in the UK. Those with a history of mental health conditions were most at risk. Adequate PPE availability, access to wellbeing support and reduced exposure to moral dilemmas may protect hospital HCW from mental health symptoms.","Kasun Wanigasooriya; Priyanka Palimar; David Naumann; Khalida Ismail; Jodie L.

"Psychiatric side effects induced by chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine: a systematic review of case reports and population studies","Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are commonly used drugs in the treatment of malaria as well as chronic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Although various reports on possible psychiatric side effects of these drugs exist, the nature and extent of these effects remain poorly understood. Moreover, the relevance of these drugs in the treatment of early stages of COVID-19 necessitates a careful estimation of their side effects. Here, we provide a systematic review of the psychiatric side effects associated with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. We used PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science platforms to identify relevant literature published between 1962 and 2020. Search terms included chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, psychiatry, psychosis, depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, delirium, and psychotic disorders. Only case reports and clinical trials were included. All studies included records of psychiatric side effects induced by either chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine or both. Both retrospective and prospective, randomized as well as non-randomized population studies were included. Overall, the psychiatric side effects are dose- and sex-independent. The most common psychiatric side effects reported are increased speech output/ excessive talking, increased psychomotor activity, irritable mood, auditory hallucinations, delusion of grandiosity, and suicide attempts, likely due to brain intoxicationbe of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. The symptoms can develop in a few hours to 11 weeks after drug intake and are normally reversed within a week after the drug withdrawal. We conclude that CQ and HCQ have the potential to induce psychiatric side effects. This study calls for further investigation of psychiatric symptoms induced by these drugs in the short and long term.","Fernanda Talarico; Sucheta Chakravarty; Yang Liu; Angrew Greenshaw; Ives Passos; Bo Cao","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.20208132","20201007","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-08","",5576,""
"Economic precarity, social isolation, and suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic","The US population faces stressors associated with suicide brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding the relationship between stressors and suicidal ideation may inform policies and programs to prevent suicide. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between economic precarity, social isolation, and suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic. We used data from two, nationally representative surveys of US adults: The 2017-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and the 2020 COVID-19 and Life Stressors Impact on Mental Health and Well-being study (conducted March 31 to April 13). We compared suicidal ideation in 2017-2018 to suicidal ideation in 2020. We estimated the association between stressors - job loss, trouble paying rent, and social isolation - and suicidal ideation in 2020 using bivariable and multivariable Poisson regression models with robust variance. Suicidal ideation increased more than fourfold, from 3.4% in the 2017-2018 NHANES to 16.3% in the 2020 CLIMB survey, and from 5.8% to 26.4% among participants in low-income households. Suicidal ideation was more prevalent among people facing difficulty paying rent (31.5%), job loss (24.1%), and loneliness (25.1%), with each stressor associated with suicidal ideation in bivariable models. In the multivariable model, difficulty paying rent was associated with suicidal ideation (aPR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.2 to 2.1), while losing a job was not (aPR: 0.9, 95% CI: 0.6 to 1.2). Feeling alone was associated with suicidal ideation (aPR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.5 to 2.4). We conclude that suicidal ideation increased more than fourfold during the COVID-19 pandemic. Difficulty paying rent and loneliness were most associated with suicidal ideation. Policies and programs to support people experiencing economic precarity and loneliness may contribute to suicide prevention.","Julia Raifman; Catherine Ettman; Lorraine Dean; Colleen Barry; Sandro Galea","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.06.20207993","20201007","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-08","",5577,""

The current study was conducted in the Basque Autonomous Community in northern Spain. The authors analyzed stress, anxiety, and depression with the arrival of the virus and the levels of symptoms according to age, comorbidity, and confinement. Levels of anxiety, stress, and depression were measured in a sample of 976 adults, using the DASS scale (Depression Anxiety, and Stress Scale). Although levels of symptoms were generally low at the start of the alert, younger individuals with chronic diseases reported more symptoms than the rest of the population. The study also detected higher levels of symptoms after the stay-at-home order was issued. Such symptoms are predicted to increase as the confinement continues.

The article aims to assess the changes in the habits of the Brazilian participants engaged in physical activities in relation to their practices, due the measures of social distancing during the COVID-19 epidemic in 2020. The secondary objective was to describe their levels of anxiety and depression. The questionnaire used in this online survey included demographic information, questions about self-perceptions of the impact of the COVID-19 in the life routines and the 14-item Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale. A total of 1,613 adults completed the questionnaire between May 11 and 15, 2020. Of those, 79.4% reported that the measures to contain the epidemic had any impact on their physical activities, and many had to interrupt or decrease the frequency of their practices. Participants who felt a higher impact of quarantine on their physical activities tend to have higher prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms. Individuals who practiced physical activities reported that social distance had a high influence on their practices. Furthermore, changes in these habits are associated with high levels of poor mental health.","Martinez, Silva, Morigi, Zucoloto, Silva, Joaquim, Dall'Agnol, Galdino, Martinez, Silva","https://doi.org/10.1590/1413-812320202510.2.27242020","20201007","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-08","",5597,""
"Lifestyle behaviors changes during the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine among 6,881 Brazilian adults with depression and 35,143 without depression","Our aim was to analyze the association between previously diagnosed lifetime depression and changes in physical activity (PA), TV-viewing, consumption of fruits and vegetables as well as frequency of ultra-processed food (UPF) consumption. Data of 41,923 Brazilian adults (6,881 with depression and 35,042 without depression) were used. Participants reported PA (Ã¢â€°Â¥ 150 min/week), TV-viewing (Ã¢â€°Â¥ 4 h/day), frequency of eating fruits or vegetables (Ã¢â€°Â¤ 4 days/week) and UPF (Ã¢â€°Â¥ 5 days/week). For incidence indicators, we only considered participants without the risk behavior before the quarantine. People without and with depression presented, respectively, incidence of physical inactivity [70.1% (95%CI: 67.4-72.8) vs 76.3 (70.3-81.5)], high TV-viewing [31.2 (29.6-32.8) vs 33.9 (30.5-37.4)], low frequency of fruit or vegetable consumption [28.3 (25.8-31.0) vs 31.5 (26.1-37.5)] and elevated frequency of UPF consumption [9.7 (8.9-10.7) vs 15.2 (13.0-17.7)]. Participants with depression were more likely to present elevated frequency of UPF consumption incidence [OR:1.49 (95%CI:1.21-1.83)].

"Depression and Anxiety in Mothers of Home Ventilated Children Before and During COVID-19 Pandemic","Due to advances in technology, home ventilation in children has increased in recent years. The provision of proper care for a home-ventilated (HV) child can have a strong impact on the lifestyle of caregivers. The aim of this study was to evaluate the depression and anxiety levels of the mothers of home-ventilated children during the current COVID-19 pandemic and compare them to those of mothers of healthy peers. This cross-sectional study was conducted on HV children (n=21) and a control group of healthy peers (n=32) by means of a questionnaire completed by the mothers of the children of both groups. Psychometric scales, such as the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-State (STAI-S), and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Trait (STAI-T), were used to assess participants. During the pandemic signs of depression were present in eight (38.1 %) of the case group and eight (25%) of the healthy control (HC) group. Comparison of the BDI scores from before and during the pandemic showed no difference between mothers of the HV children (p=0.09). Scores for BDI and STAI-T were higher in the case group than in the control group, whereas there was no significant difference in STAI-S scores. Depression and anxiety levels of mothers of HV children were found to be higher during the COVID-19 pandemic. Economic, medical and social support resources are needed in order to reduce levels of depression and anxiety and help mothers of those children dependent on technology.

"Community Gardening as a Way to Build Cross-Cultural Community Resilience in Intersectionally Diverse Gardeners: Community-Based Participatory Research and Campus-Community-Partnered Proposal","Community-based agriculture has been found to decrease food insecurity and alleviate health inequities. Furthermore, it provides a sense of ownership, resources to help integrate new communities, and a space to nurture existing cultural identities for intersectionally diverse gardeners. This sense of belonging in connection with access to growing plots has been linked to psychological well-being and resilience. However, little is known about how the psychosocial benefits of plot ownership affect resilience and which aspects of this resilience are salient. This community-based participatory research (CBPR) project will examine the role of community gardens in decreasing food insecurity and facilitating various forms of resilience in food-insecure groups in Rochester, Minnesota. Since participation in community gardens nurtures various forms of resilience along individual, group, and community dimensions, our research seeks to understand how dimensions of resilience vary along intersectional lines. In addition to mapping the psychosocial benefits linked to plot ownership, we find that examining which forms of resilience are fostered in community-based agricultural projects addresses an important gap in the academic literature. This can help us propose policy-level practices that reduce health inequities connected to food and nutrition at the local level. Using a mixed methods approach, this ongoing community-campus partnership will examine the experiences of current and new plot owners. As a CBPR project, our data collection plan, from design to dissemination, incorporates the intellectual and creative labor of the individuals representing members of the campus community (ie, college students and faculty members engaged in other citizen science projects hosted by the garden), community growers, individuals involved in the community garden's board, and representatives of various organizational bodies. Data collection activities will consist of surveys, in-depth interviews, and photovoice. This project was funded in January 2020 and approved by the University of Minnesota's Institutional Review Board in March 2020. For the 2020 growing season, we will conduct evaluative interviews about the effect of COVID-19 on community gardeners, including their experiences during this growing season. For the 2021 growing season, data collection, via pre- and postsurveys, is projected to begin in March 2021 and end in November 2021. We will also conduct in-depth interviews from January to April 2021. Data analysis will commence in April 2021. Photovoice activities (ie, data collection, analysis, synthesis, and dissemination) are expected to take place during the spring and summer of 2021. Findings emerging from this study will provide the preliminary data to foreground community gardening projects and initiatives to improve physical and mental health outcomes in food-insecure communities. Also, the data collected will highlight the role of CBPR methods in disseminating information about the organizational practices of the community garden; this will assist others in planning and implementing similar projects.

"Increased risk of COVID-19 infection and mortality in people with mental disorders: analysis from electronic health records in the United States","Concerns have been expressed that persons with a pre-existing mental disorder may represent a population at increased risk for COVID-19 infection and with a higher likelihood of adverse outcomes of the infection, but there is no systematic research evidence in this respect. This study assessed the impact of a recent (within past year) diagnosis of a mental disorder - including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), bipolar disorder, depression and schizophrenia - on the risk for COVID-19 infection and related mortality and hospitalization rates. We analyzed a nation-wide database of electronic health records of 61 million adult patients from 360 hospitals and 317,000 providers, across 50 states in the US, up to July 29, 2020. Patients with a recent diagnosis of a mental disorder had a significantly increased risk for COVID-19 infection, an effect strongest for depression (adjusted odds ratio, AOR=7.64, 95% CI: 7.45-7.83, p&lt;0.001) and schizophrenia (AOR=7.34, 95% CI: 6.65-8.10, p&lt;0.001). Among patients with a recent diagnosis of a mental disorder, African Americans had higher odds of COVID-19 infection than Caucasians, with the strongest ethnic disparity for depression (AOR=3.78, 95% CI: 3.58-3.98, p&lt;0.001). Women with mental disorders had higher odds of COVID-19 infection than males, with the strongest gender disparity for ADHD (AOR=2.03, 95% CI: 1.73-2.39, p&lt;0.001). Patients with both a recent diagnosis of a mental disorder and COVID-19 infection had a death rate of 8.5% (vs. 4.7% among COVID-19 patients with no mental disorder, p&lt;0.001) and a hospitalization rate of 27.4% (vs. 18.6% among COVID-19 patients with no mental disorder, p&lt;0.001). These findings identify individuals with a recent diagnosis of a mental disorder as being at increased risk for COVID-19 infection, which is further exacerbated among African Americans and women, and as having a higher frequency of some adverse outcomes of the infection. This evidence highlights the need to identify and address modifiable vulnerability factors for COVID-19 infection and to prevent delays in health care provision in this population.","Wang, Xu, Volkow","https://doi.org/10.1002/wps.20806","20201007","ADHD; COVIDÃ¢â‚¬Â19; access to care; bipolar disorder; depression; discrimination; ethnic disparity; gender disparity; hospitalization; mental disorders; mortality; risk of infection; schizophrenia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-08","",5602,""
"Debate: Student mental health matters - the heightened need for school-based mental health in the era of COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted existing gaps in school-based mental health services and created new and urgent needs to address student mental health. Evidence from early in the pandemic already suggests that preexisting educational and mental health disparities have increased under the stress of the current health crisis. School mental health professionals are essential to help address anxiety, to promote social adjustment in the 'new normal', and to address trauma, grief, and loss. Schools will also need to creatively support teachers during this unprecedented time. Such efforts will require adequate funding and advocacy for the inclusion of school-based mental health supports within governmental COVID-19 aid packages.","Weisbrot, Ryst","https://doi.org/10.1111/camh.12427","20201007","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-08","",5603,""

"Debate: Supporting the mental health of school students in the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand - a digital ecosystem approach","The pandemic is creating unprecedented demand for mental health support for young people. While schools often facilitate mental health support for their students, the demands for online teaching and the uncertainty created by the pandemic make traditional delivery of support through schools challenging. Technology provides a potential way forward. We have developed a digital ecosystem, HABITS, that can be integrated into school and healthcare systems. This has allowed us to deploy specific evidence-based interventions directly, and through schools, to students and to parents in New Zealand during the current pandemic. Chatbot architecture is particularly suited to rapid iteration to provide specific information while apps can provide more generalised support. While technology can provide some solutions, it is important to be aware of the potential to increase current inequities, with those facing the greatest challenges to health and well-being, also least able to afford the resources to access digital interventions. Development of an integrated and equitable digital system will take time and collaboration.","Merry, Cargo, Christie, Donkin, Hetrick, Fleming, Holt-Quick, Hopkins, Stasiak, Warren","https://doi.org/10.1111/camh.12429","20201007","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-08","",5605,""
"Using genetics to understand the role of antihypertensive drugs modulating angiotensin-converting enzyme in immune function and inflammation","Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) is the binding domain for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARSCoV-2. Some antihypertensive drugs affect ACE2 expression or activity (ACE inhibitors and Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs)), suggesting use of other hypertensives might be preferable, such as calcium channel blockers (CCBs). Given the limited evidence, the International Society of Hypertension does not support such a policy. We used a Mendelian randomization study to obtain unconfounded associations of anti-hypertensives, instrumented by published genetic variants in genes regulating target proteins of these drugs, with immune (lymphocyte and neutrophil percentage) and inflammatory (tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-ÃŽÂ±)) markers in the largest available genome wide association studies. Genetically predicted effects of ACE inhibitors increased lymphocyte percentage (0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.35, 1.22), decreased neutrophil percentage (-0.64, 95% CI -1.09, -0.20) and possibly lowered TNF-ÃŽÂ± (-4.92, 95% CI -8.50, -1.33). CCBs showed a similar pattern for immune function (lymphocyte percentage 0.21, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.36; neutrophil percentage -0.23, 95% CI -0.39 to -0.08) but had no effect on TNF-ÃŽÂ±, as did potassium-sparing diuretics and aldosterone antagonists, and vasodilator antihypertensives. ARBs and other classes of hypertensives had no effect on immune function or TNF-ÃŽÂ±. Varying effects of different classes of anti-hypertensives on immune and inflammatory markers do not suggest antihypertensive use based on their role in ACE2 expression, but instead suggests investigation of the role of antihypertensives in immune function and inflammation might reveal important information that could optimize their use in SARSCoV-2.","Zhao, Schooling, Leung","https://doi.org/10.1111/bcp.14572","20201007","ACE inhibitor; immune function; inflammation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-08","",5606,""
"Mental health effects of infection containment strategies: quarantine and isolation-a systematic review and meta-analysis","Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, an unprecedented number of people worldwide is currently affected by quarantine or isolation. These measures have been suggested to negatively impact on mental health. We conducted the first systematic literature review and meta-analysis assessing the psychological effects in both quarantined and isolated persons compared to non-quarantined and non-isolated persons. PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase databases were searched for studies until April 22, 2020 (Prospero Registration-No.: CRD42020180043). We followed PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines for data extraction and synthesis and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for assessing risk of bias of included studies. A random-effects model was implemented to pool effect sizes of included studies. The primary outcomes were depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders. All other psychological parameters, such as anger, were reported as secondary outcomes. Out of 6807 screened articles, 25 studies were included in our analyses. Compared to controls, individuals experiencing isolation or quarantine were at increased risk for adverse mental health outcomes, particularly after containment duration of 1Ã‚Â week or longer. Effect sizes were summarized for depressive disorders (odds ratio 2.795; 95% CI 1.467-5.324), anxiety disorders (odds ratio 2.0; 95% CI 0.883-4.527), and stress-related disorders (odds ratio 2.742; 95% CI 1.496-5.027). Among secondary outcomes, elevated levels of anger were reported most consistently. There is compelling evidence for adverse mental health effects of isolation and quarantine, in particular depression, anxiety, stress-related disorders, and anger. Reported determinants can help identify populations at risk and our findings may serve as an evidence-base for prevention and management strategies.","Henssler, Stock, van Bohemen, Walter, Heinz, Brandt","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00406-020-01196-x","20201007","Containment strategies; Isolation; Mental disorder; Mental health; Meta-analysis; Psychological effects; Quarantine; Systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-08","",5607,""
"Burnout among Healthcare Workers during COVID-19 Pandemic in India: Results of a Questionnaire-based Survey","Burnout, a state of physical and emotional exhaustion, in healthcare workers (HCWs) is a major concern. The prevalence of burnout, due to COVID-19 pandemic in India, is unknown. We therefore conducted this survey. A questionnaire-based survey using Copenhagen Burnout Inventory was carried out among HCWs looking after COVID-19 patients. Questionnaire was sent to the HCWs, using WhatsApp Messenger, and voluntary participation was sought. We received responses from 2026 HCWs. Burnout was assessed in personal, work, and client-related (COVID-19 pandemic-related) domains. Burnout was defined at a cut-off score of 50 for each domain. The prevalence of personal burnout was 44.6% (903), work-related burn-out was only 26.9% (544), while greater than half of the respondents (1,069, 52.8%) had pandemic-related burnout. Younger respondents (21-30 years) had higher personal and work-related burnout. The prevalence of personal and work-related burnout was significantly (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) higher among females. The doctors were 1.64 times, and the support staff were 5 times more likely to experience pandemic-related burnout. There is a significant prevalence of burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic among HCWs, in particular, doctors and support staff. Female respondents had higher prevalence. We suggest that the management should be proactive and supportive in improving working conditions and providing assurance to the HCWs. The long-term effects of the current pandemic need to be assessed later. Khasne RW, Dhakulkar BS, Mahajan HC, Kulkarni AP.

"What could we learn from SARS when facing the mental health issues related to the COVID-19 outbreak? A nationwide cohort study in Taiwan","There were several studies about the psychiatric and mental health issues related to the severe adult respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, however, the association between SARS and the overall risk of psychiatric disorders and suicides has, as yet, to be studied in Taiwan. The aim of this study is to examine as to whether SARS is associated with the risk of psychiatric disorders and suicide. A total of 285 patients with SARS and 2850 controls without SARS (1:10) matched for sex, age, insurance premium, comorbidities, residential regions, level of medical care, and index date were selected between February 25 and June 15, 2003 from the Inpatient Database Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. During the 12-year follow-up, in which 79 in the SARS cohort and 340 in the control group developed psychiatric disorders or suicide (4047.41 vs. 1535.32 per 100,000 person-years). Fine and Gray's survival analysis revealed that the SARS cohort was associated with an increased risk of psychiatric disorders and suicide, and the adjusted subdistribution HR (sHR) was 2.805 (95% CI: 2.182-3.605, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) for psychiatric disorders and suicide. The SARS cohort was associated with anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder/acute stress disorder (PTSD/ASD), and suicide. The sensitivity analysis revealed that the SARS group was associated with anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, PTSD/ASD, and suicide after the individuals with a diagnosis of psychiatric disorders and suicide were excluded within the first year, and with anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders, while those in the first five years were excluded. In conclusion, SARS was associated with the increased risk of psychiatric disorders and suicide.","Tzeng, Chung, Chang, Chang, Kao, Chang, Chien","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-020-01021-y","20201007","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-08","",5609,""
"The experiences of pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey: A qualitative study","Due to spread and impact of COVID-19 in the world and Turkey lead to fear, stress and anxiety in individuals. This trend is increasing more especially in pregnant women at risk as they are concerned about the safety of themselves and the fetus. In our study, concerns, problems and attitudes of pregnant women related to diseases in the pandemic process will be determined by detailed discussions based on their individual experience, and by increasing the awareness of midwives and nurses about what pregnant women experience in this process. Content analysis is used as qualitative study pattern. Due to the social isolation rules during the coronavirus pandemic, interviews with pregnant women were planned to be held via mobile phone. The study was completed with 15 pregnant women. As a result of the content analysis of the interviews, 3 main themes and 11 sub-themes were identified. The identified themes were as following: (1) not understanding the seriousness and fear of the unknown, (2) coronavirus pandemic and disruption of the routine prenatal care (3) disrupted routines and social lives. Each theme was necessarily discussed separately. The results of the study show that coronavirus pandemic has a significant potential for creating anxiety, adversity and fear, which has a negative emotional effect on pregnant people. It will be useful to provide awareness for midwives and nurses not only about the physical health of pregnant women, but also their mental health, and to cooperate with mental health experts if necessary.","Mizrak Sahin, Kabakci","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wombi.2020.09.022","20201007","Attitude; COVID-19; Concerns; Experiences; Pregnancy; Turkey","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-08","",5610,""

"Karantzas et al (2020) COVID-19 Relationship Wellbeing & Loneliness","It has been assumed that the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted parental and family relationships due to issues including economic problems, strains of home confinement and social isolation. Despite these assumptions, there has been little research to date investigating the impact of COVID-19 stressors on parentsâ€™ relationship wellbeing and loneliness. Hence, there is an insufficient evidence base with which to guide policy or action in this most critical arena. The current study reports data from a large national representative sample (N=1,829) of Australian parents, surveyed during the early phases of the COVID-19 lockdown. Drawing on widely studied relationship models of vulnerability-stress and stress-buffering, Structural Equation Models (SEM) were derived to test the extent that COVID-19 stressors, personal vulnerabilities (mental health problems, attachment insecurity), relationship adaptation processes (constructive communication, partner support), and the interactions between these variables, predicted relationship quality and loneliness. After controlling for pre-pandemic stressors, relationship adaptations buffered the negative effects of COVID-19 stressors and personal vulnerabilities on relationship quality and loneliness. The findings provide support for a model of stress-buffering over a model of vulnerability-stress. The findings have important implications for the identification of parents at risk of relationship difficulties and social disconnection during the pandemic, and for policy and practice in how best to strengthen relationships and human connection during COVID-19.","Gery Karantzas et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460FA-FCC-E19","20201007","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Interpersonal Relationships; loneliness; romantic relationships; covid-19; stress-buffering; parents; vulnerability-stress","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-08","",5615,""
