"Lockdown babies- Birth and new parenting experiences during the 2020 Covid-19 lockdown in South Africa","Background Perceived birth experiences of parents can have a lasting impact on children. We explored the birth and new parenting experiences of South African parents during the Covid-19 lockdown. Methods We conducted an online cross-sectional survey with consenting parents of babies born in South Africa during 2020. Factors associated with negative birth emotions and probable depression were estimated using logistic regression. Results Most of the 520 respondents were females (n= 496, 95%) who gave birth at private hospitals (n=426, 86%). Mothers reported having overall positive birth emotions (n= 399, 80%). Multivariable analysis showed that having the baby during lockdown (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 5.02; CI 1.28-19.66); being diagnosed with Covid-19 (aOR 3.17; CI 1.07-9.42); having negative new parenting emotions (aOR 6.07; CI 3.27-11.29); a preterm baby (aOR 3.02; CI 1.36-6.70) and lockdown related barring of preferred in hospital support (aOR 2.45; CI 1.35-4.43) were associated with mothers reporting predominately negative emotions about the birth. Having their chosen delivery method reduced the odds of negative birth emotions (aOR 0.4; CI 0.22-0.72). Multivariable analysis showed that having predominantly negative new parenting emotions (aOR 10.75; CI 5.41-21.37), breastfeeding struggles (aOR 2.16; CI 1.36-3.46); lockdown preventing health care access (aOR 2.06; CI 1.20-3.54) and creating financial strain (aOR 2.58; CI 1.08-6.18) were associated with probable minor depression Conclusions Lockdown exacerbated many birth and parenting challenges including mental health and health care access. However, overall experiences were positive and there was a strong sense of resilience amongst parents.","Elise Farley; Amanda Edwards; Emma Numanoglu; Tamsin K Phillips","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.20.21257537","20210524","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-24","",13990,""
"Persistent clotting protein pathology in Long COVID/ Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) is accompanied by increased levels of antiplasmin","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2)-induced infection, the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is characterized by acute clinical pathologies, including various coagulopathies that may be accompanied by hypercoagulation and platelet hyperactivation. Recently, a new COVID-19 phenotype has been noted in patients after they have ostensibly recovered from acute COVID-19 symptoms. This new syndrome is commonly termed Long COVID/Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). Here we refer to it as Long COVID/PASC. Lingering symptoms persist for as much as 6 months (or longer) after acute infection, where COVID-19 survivors complain of recurring fatigue or muscle weakness, being out of breath, sleep difficulties, and anxiety or depression. Given that blood clots can block microcapillaries and thereby inhibit oxygen exchange, we here investigate if the lingering symptoms that individuals with Long COVID/PASC manifest might be due to the presence of persistent circulating plasma clots that are resistant to fibrinolysis. We use techniques including proteomics and fluorescence microscopy to study plasma samples from healthy individuals, individuals with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), with acute COVID-19, and those with Long COVID/PASC symptoms. We show that plasma samples from Long COVID/PASC still contain large anomalous (amyloid) deposits. We also show that these anomalous deposits in both acute COVID-19 and Long COVID/PASC plasma samples are resistant to fibrinolysis (compared to plasma from controls and T2DM), even after trypsinisation. After a second trypsinization, the persistent pellet deposits were solubilized. We detected various inflammatory molecules that are substantially increased in both the supernatant and trapped in the solubilized pellet deposits of acute COVID-19 and Long COVID/PASC, versus the equivalent volume of fully digested fluid of the control samples. Of particular interest was a substantial increase in (2)-antiplasmin (2AP), various fibrinogen chains, as well as Serum Amyloid A (SAA) that were trapped in the solubilized fibrinolytic-resistant pellet deposits. Clotting pathologies in both acute COVID-19 infection and in Long COVID/PASC might therefore benefit from following a regime of continued anticlotting therapy to support the fibrinolytic system function.","Etheresia Pretorius; Mare Vlok; Chantelle Venter; Johannes A Bezuidenhout; Gert J laubscher; Janami Steenkamp; Douglas B Kell","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.21.21257578","20210523","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-24","",13991,""
