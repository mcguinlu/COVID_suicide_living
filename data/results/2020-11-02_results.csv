"Hospital and ICU patient volume per physician at peak of COVID pandemic: State-level estimates","In anticipation of patient surge due to COVID-19, many states are working to increase the available healthcare workforce. To help inform state policies and initiatives aimed at physician deployment during COVID-19, we used predictions of peak patient volume for hospitals and intensive care units (ICU) and regional physician workforce estimates to measure patient to physician ratios at the peak of the pandemic for each state. We estimated the number of potentially available physicians based on Medicare Part B billings for the care of hospitalized and critically ill patients in 2017, adjusted for attrition due to exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and relevant experience. We used estimates from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation to determine the number of hospitalized and ICU patients expected at the peak of the pandemic in each state. We then determined the expected ratio of patients per physician for each state at the peak of the pandemic. The median number of hospitalized patients per physician was 13 (low estimate) to 18 (high estimate). At the high estimate of hospitalized patients, 35 states would have a patient to physician ratio of more than 15:1 (patient to physician ratios above 15:1 have been associated with poor outcomes). For ICU patients, the median number of patients each physician would treat across states would be 8-11 patients. Nine states would experience patient to physician ratios above 15:1Ã‚Â at the higher end of estimates. Patient-physician ratios decreased if the available physician pool was broadened to include physicians without recent experience treating hospitalized patients, and physicians in surgical specialties with experience treating acutely hospitalized patients. We estimate that most states will have sufficient physician capacity to manage hospitalized patients at the peak of the pandemic. However, at the high estimates of hospitalized patients, some Midwestern states will experience high patient to provider ratios that may adversely affect patient outcomes.

"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on help-seeking behaviors in individuals suffering from eating disorders and their caregivers","To describe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on help-seeking behaviors among individuals with eating disorders and caregivers. We analyzed service utilization data from the National Eating Disorder Information Centre (NEDIC). We compared the number of contacts and symptom frequency between the pandemic period and previous years. NEDIC was contacted 609 times during March 1-April 30, 2020 (72.1% individuals affected by disordered eating, 20.4% caregivers). The number of total contacts significantly increased from 2018 to 2019 and 2018 to 2020 (X<sup>2</sup>(3)Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 50.34, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001). Among affected individuals (80.4% women), the number of contacts during the pandemic period was significantly higher (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 439; X<sup>2</sup>(2)Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 92.74, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .001) compared to 2018 (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 197) and 2019 (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 312). There were higher rates of eating disorder symptoms, anxiety, and depression in 2020 compared to previous years. Thematic analysis of instant chats from the pandemic year revealed four emerging themes: 1) lack of access to treatment, 2) worsening of symptoms, 3) feeling out of control, and 4) need for support. These findings point toward the impact of COVID-19 in individuals affected by disordered eating and hold implications for service delivery during times of crises.","Richardson, Patton, Phillips, Paslakis","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2020.10.006","20201031","COVID-19; Eating disorder; Internet; Psychotherapy; Treatment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-02","",6651,""
"Posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms in healthcare workers after the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak: A survey of a large tertiary care hospital in Wuhan","This study examined the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and assessed mental illness via an online survey among healthcare workers (HCWs) at the Central Hospital of Wuhan after the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak. PTSD symptoms were measured using the PTSD Checklist Civilian Version (PCL-C), with a cutoff score of 50. Among the 642 HCWs, the prevalence of probable PTSD was 20.87%. Additionally, 88.88%, 82.09%, 100%, and 95.52% of HCWs with probable PTSD reported varying degrees of anxiety, depression, somatic symptoms, and insomnia, respectively. HCWs with probable PTSD scored higher on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Patient Health questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15), and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) than non-PTSD HCWs (all pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.05). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that HCWs with negative COVID-19 tests (OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.21-0.58; pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.00), those with high Social Support Self-Rating Scale (SSRS) scores (OR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.17-0.52; pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.00), and HCWs whose family members tested negative (OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.42-0.96; pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.03) were less likely to have probable PTSD. This study found a high prevalence of probable PTSD and severe mental illness among local HCWs. Our finding emphasizes the need to provide mental health support for HCWs.","Zhang, Shi, Jing, Zhan, Fang, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113541","20201102","COVID-19; Epidemic disease; Healthcare workers; Mental illness; Multivariate regression analysis; Posttraumatic stress disorder; Wuhan","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-02","",6652,""
"How the COVID-19 pandemic has changed our lives: A study of psychological correlates across 59 countries","This study examined the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent social restrictions or quarantines on the mental health of the global adult population. A sample of 6,882 individuals (M<sub>age</sub> Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°42.30; 78.8% female) from 59 countries completed an online survey asking about several pandemic-related changes in life and psychological status. Of these participants, 25.4% and 19.5% reported moderate-to-severe depression (DASS-21) and anxiety symptoms (GAD-7), respectively. Demographic characteristics (e.g. higher-income country), COVID-19 exposure (e.g., having had unconfirmed COVID-19 symptoms), government-imposed quarantine level, and COVID-19-based life changes (e.g., having a hard time transitioning to working from home; increase in verbal arguments or conflict with other adult in home) explained 17.9% of the variance in depression and 21.5% in anxiety symptoms. In addition to posing a high risk to physical health, the COVID-19 pandemic has robustly affected global mental health, so it is essential to ensure that mental health services reach individuals showing pandemic-related depression and anxiety symptoms.","Alzueta, Perrin, Baker, Caffarra, Ramos-Usuga, Yuksel, Arango-Lasprilla","https://doi.org/10.1002/jclp.23082","20201031","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; mental health; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-02","",6653,""
"Psychological impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on dental students: A nationwide study","Public mental health concerns have been raised during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The aim of this study was to assess the psychological impact of the pandemic on dental students in Saudi Arabia. A cross-sectional analytical study was conducted among dental students from different universities in Saudi Arabia selected using 2-stage cluster sampling. The psychological impact was assessed using the validated Arabic version of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 Item questionnaire. The data were analyzed using SPSS software. The Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used as appropriate. A chi-squared test was used to compare the proportions between the sociodemographic data and logistic regression analysis to identify variables associated with the student's responses. The internal consistency of the scale was excellent (0.954). A total of 697 dental students participated voluntarily in the study; their mean age was 21.76 Ã‚Â± 1.859 years, and 54.7% were female. The majority (96.1%) were single, and 69.4% lived in a household of &gt; 5 persons. Significant differences in mental health outcomes were evident for gender, university, and survey time. Elevated levels of depression, anxiety, and stress were recorded among 60.64%, 37.02%, and 34.92%, respectively, of the students. Females, students who lived alone, and junior students were more likely to experience psychological problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. The presence of elevated levels of depression, anxiety and stress among dental students highlights the need for psychological empowerment strategies involving institutional counseling services.","Hakami, Khanagar, Vishwanathaiah, Hakami, Bokhari, Jabali, Alasmari, Aldrees","https://doi.org/10.1002/jdd.12470","20201031","COVID-19; Saudi Arabia; anxiety; dental student; depression; mental health; psychological impact; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-02","",6654,""
"Prenatal exposure to gestational diabetes is associated with anxiety and physical inactivity in children during COVID-19","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with adverse child mental health outcomes and reduced physical activity. Moreover, prenatal exposure to gestational diabetes (GDM) is associated with increased risk for adverse psychological outcomes in children. Assess prenatal exposure to GDM on anxiety levels and physical activity in children during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sixty-five children age 9 to 15 reported their physical activity and anxiety levels using the 24-hours physical activity recall and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children via phone or video meetings. Prenatal exposure to GDM was obtained from maternal electronic medical records. The 38 GDM-exposed children reported significantly higher anxiety levels and were less likely to engage in any vigorous physical activity (VPA) (5% vs 30%) compared to the 27 GDM-unexposed children. Lower levels of physical activity were significantly associated with higher levels of anxiety. Less engagement in VPA explained 75% of the association between GDM exposure and anxiety levels. Engaging in physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic may be beneficial for reducing anxiety, particularly amongst GDM-exposed children.","Alves, Yunker, DeFendis, Xiang, Page","https://doi.org/10.1111/cob.12422","20201031","anxiety; children; coronavirus disease 2019; gestational diabetes mellitus; physical activity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-02","",6655,""
"Mental Health Problems of HIV Healthcare Providers During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Interactive Effects of Stressors and Coping","HIV healthcare providers might be vulnerable to mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. Guided by the stress and coping paradigm, the current study aimed at examining the interactive effects of COVID-19-related stressors and coping on mental health problems. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among 1029 HIV healthcare providers in Guangxi, China. The prevalence of depression and anxiety in the current study was 13.31% and 6.61%, respectively. Results from path analyses revealed that the main effects of COVID-19-related stressors and coping were significant on both depression and anxiety. The interaction of coping and COVID-19-related stressors had significant effects on depression and anxiety. Simple slope tests revealed that more coping behaviors buffered against the negative effect of COVID-19-related stressors on mental health problems. Coping acted as a protective factor that alleviated the harm of COVID-19-related stressors on mental health. Intervention targeting coping management might benefit the mental health of HIV healthcare providers.","Mi, Yang, Sun, Li, Tam, Zhou, Shen","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10461-020-03073-z","20201031","COVID-19; China; Coping; HIV healthcare providers; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-02","",6656,""
"Handwashing and Detergent Treatment Greatly Reduce SARS-CoV-2 Viral Load on Halloween Candy Handled by COVID-19 Patients","<i> <b>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and potential public health implications, we are publishing this peer-reviewed manuscript in its accepted form. The final, copyedited version of the paper will be available at a later date.</b> </i> Although SARS-CoV-2 is primarily transmitted by respiratory droplets and aerosols, transmission by fomites remains plausible. During Halloween, a major event for children in numerous countries, SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk via candy fomites worries many parents. To address this concern, we enrolled 10 recently diagnosed asymptomatic or mildly/moderately symptomatic COVID-19 patients to handle typical Halloween candy (pieces individually wrapped) under three conditions: normal handling with unwashed hands, deliberate coughing and extensive touching, and normal handling following handwashing. We then used a factorial design to subject the candies to two post-handling treatments: no washing (untreated) and household dishwashing detergent. We measured SARS-CoV-2 load by RT-qPCR and LAMP. From the candies not washed post-handling, we detected SARS-CoV-2 on 60% of candies that were deliberately coughed on, 60% of candies normally handled with unwashed hands, but only 10% of candies handled after hand washing. We found that treating candy with dishwashing detergent reduced SARS-CoV-2 load by 62.1% in comparison to untreated candy. Taken together, these results suggest that although the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by fomites is low even from known COVID-19 patients, viral RNA load can be reduced to near zero by the combination of handwashing by the infected patient and Ã¢â€°Â¥1 minute detergent treatment after collection. We also found that the inexpensive and fast LAMP protocol was more than 80% concordant with RT-qPCR.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The COVID-19 pandemic is leading to important tradeoffs between risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and mental health due to deprivation from normal activities, with these impacts being especially profound in children. Due to the ongoing pandemic, Halloween activities will be curtailed as a result of the concern that candy from strangers might act as fomites. Here we demonstrate that these risks can be mitigated by ensuring that prior to handling candy, the candy giver washes their hands, and by washing collected candy with household dishwashing detergent. Even in the most extreme case, with candy deliberately coughed on by known COVID-19 patients, viral load was reduced dramatically after washing with household detergent. We conclude that with reasonable precautions, even if followed only by either the candy giver or the candy recipient, the risk of viral transmission by this route is very low.","Salido, Morgan, Rojas, Magallanes, Marotz, DeHoff, Belda-Ferre, Aigner, Kado, Yeo, Gilbert, Laurent, Rohwer, Knight","https://doi.org/10.1128/mSystems.01074-20","20201031","COVID-19; Halloween; LAMP; RT-qPCR; SARS-CoV-2; candy; fomite; qPCR; surface swab","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-02","",6657,""

"Similar Clinical Course and Significance of Circulating Innate and Adaptive Immune Cell Counts in STEMI and COVID-19","This study aimed to assess the time course of circulating neutrophil and lymphocyte counts and their ratio (NLR) in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 and explore their associations with clinical events and structural damage. Circulating neutrophil, lymphocyte and NLR were sequentially measured in 659 patients admitted for STEMI and in 103 COVID-19 patients. The dynamics detected in STEMI (within a few hours) were replicated in COVID-19 (within a few days). In both entities patients with events and with severe structural damage displayed higher neutrophil and lower lymphocyte counts. In both scenarios, higher maximum neutrophil and lower minimum lymphocyte counts were associated with more events and more severe organ damage. NLR was higher in STEMI and COVID-19 patients with the worst clinical and structural outcomes. A canonical deregulation of the immune response occurs in STEMI and COVID-19 patients. Boosted circulating innate (neutrophilia) and depressed circulating adaptive immunity (lymphopenia) is associated with more events and severe organ damage. A greater understanding of these critical illnesses is pivotal to explore novel alternative therapies.","de Dios, Rios-Navarro, Perez-Sole, Gavara, Marcos-Garces, RodrÃƒÂ­guez, CarratalÃƒÂ¡, Forner, Navarro, Blasco, Bondia, Signes-Costa, Vila, Forteza, Chorro, Bodi","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9113484","20201031","COVID-19; lymphocyte; myocardial infarction; neutrophils; prognosis; severity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-02","",6659,""
"Increased Psychological Distress during COVID-19 and Quarantine in Ireland: A National Survey","The emergence of the coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) resulted in a global pandemic. The psychological impact of an epidemic is multifaceted and acute, with long-term consequences. A cross-sectional online survey-based design was employed, assessing the psychological impact of COVID-19 on members of the Irish public during the quarantine period of COVID-19 in Ireland. Participants were invited to complete the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) retrospectively (prior to quarantine) and during the quarantine period, as well as measures of illness perceptions, well-being, and a bespoke measure (the Effects of COVID Questionnaire, ECQ), which assessed perceptions of COVID-related stresses associated with personal concerns, caring for children, caring for aging parents, as well as gratitude. A total of <i>n</i> = 1620 entered the survey platform, with a total of <i>n</i> = 847 surveys completed by members of the Irish public. Entry into COVID-19 quarantine was associated with significant increases in clinically significant symptoms of depression, stress, and anxiety. The ECQ reliably assessed a range of COVID-19-related stresses and had large and significant correlations with the DASS-21. The COVID-19 quarantine was associated with stresses and significant increases in symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress in a national Irish cohort. The public require increased access to mental health services to meet this increase in COVID-19-related psychological distress.","Burke, Berry, Taylor, Stafford, Murphy, Shevlin, McHugh, Carr","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9113481","20201031","COVID-19; Ireland; mental health; psychological distress; public; quarantine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2020-11-02","",6660,""
"Personnel Well-Being in the Helsinki University Hospital during the COVID-19 Pandemic-A Prospective Cohort Study","In March 2020, strict measures took place in Finland to limit the COVID-19 pandemic. Majority of Finnish COVID-19 patients have been located in southern Finland and consequently cared for at the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa (HUS) Helsinki University Hospital. During the pandemic, HUS personnel's psychological symptoms are followed via an electronic survey, which also delivers information on psychosocial support services. In June 2020, the baseline survey was sent to 25,494 HUS employees, 4804 (19%) of whom answered; altogether, 62.4% of the respondents were nursing staff and 8.9% were medical doctors. While the follow-up continues for a year and a half, this report shares the sociodemographic characteristics of the respondents and the first results of psychological symptoms from our baseline survey. Out of those who were directly involved in the pandemic patient care, 43.4% reported potentially traumatic COVID-19 pandemic-related events (PTEs) vs. 21.8% among the others (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). While over a half of the personnel were asymptomatic, a group of respondents reported PTEs and concurrent depression, insomnia, and anxiety symptoms.
